Katie had seemed to think Jessica should be here, and it made sense, this being her room and all.  But simply put, Jessica was no where to be found.  You take a couple steps inside looking to see if maybe she's hiding.  First you look under the bed, and then in her walk-in closet.  Nothing in either place, and unfortunately, as far as you know, those are the only places big enough for her to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think maybe she's simply slipped into the bathroom.  As you turn back to the door, preparing to look elsewhere, Katie appears in the doorway.  \"Huh?  She's not here?  Wonder <i>where</i> she could have gotten to?\" she says while looking around.  \"And by the way, what took you so long to get here anyways?  I, I mean, <b>she</b> texted you to come over an hour ago and you just now respond?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was getting weird.  Since when does Katie worry about your relationship with her sister?  And how does she know when Jessica texted you?  And what about that slip about 'I' texted you?  Is she secretly crushing on you?  Did she really text you on Jessica's phone to get you over here for herself?  All these questions run through your head is mere seconds.

As she fitted her legs into the skin she felt her body tingle and get warm, watching as her legs filled the masculine ones of David.As she pulled up the suit to her pelvis she gasped, feeling her wetness disappear only to be replaced with the sensation of a limp dick slowly becoming aroused. She giggled again and began sliding the rest of her body into the suit. She fit her arms in nicely and began pulling her head into the suit. As soon as she finished fitting into it, she sealed herself up with the tiny nob on the lower back. As she did this the suit began to fit her real body to it's shape. She was excited looking as her limp dick grew to a full 7 inch erection and gasped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh my..\" She stopped, forgetting she now sounded like David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow.. This is awesome! I can't wait to see jessica now\" she giggled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe began to slowly stroke her dick, getting used to it's feeling as she moaned a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now, what to do, what to do?\" She said grinning to herself.</span></div></div>",

You open it and see two pens, one of which seems very familiar. You read the description of the pens' powers.

Okey?\" Katie then moves her hands to the back of her head and starts to fiddle with something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me wha...\" You try to ask before you hear a ripping like sound from the back of Katie's head. Your jaw drops as you see her face start to twitch and deform. She bends her head forwards and you see her hands ripping up some kind of opening on the back of her head. Her hands opens the opening wider and wider, and suddenly you can see some blond hair getting visible in between Katie's brown hair. Suddenly she starts to pull her whole face forward and as she does you can see another head getting more and more visible trough the opening, Katie's face is coming off just like a mask!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last thrust with her hands the face comes off and you see Jessica's face looking at you with a wide smile on it. <br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" You exclaim as you see your girlfriend standing before you with a deflated face of her sister dangling right under her chin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Suprise!\" she says smiling. \"It was no joke\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck Jessica? What... is... that? A... mask?\" You stammer. \"I't looks so... realistic. Where did you get that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica starts to giggle a bit. \"I know! Isn't it amazing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. yeah.. it.. is\" You say, having calmed down from the shock and leaning forwards a bit to get a closer look. Besides having a mask of her sister hanging right under her face, there is something else that's not quite right about you girlfriend. Her body seemed different... she was shorter then usual!<br>\r\n\"How come you are shorter than usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggles. \"So you notice, do you? Well... you see.. it's not actually a normal costume.\" She says, forming the same sly grin she had when she wore Katie's face. She points on the mask still hanging on her and continues: \"This isn't a costume made to look like Katie, it is Katie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" you ask her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hands you the pen looking thing you saw her fiddling with before. You hold it in your hand and look down on it. It's black, with a dark blue-ish gem on its 'clicker' side and with golden engraving decorated the length of its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a box with the letters -Costume set- on it, wich contained two pen looking objects inside\" She tells you. \"Turns out... the pen you hold in your hand is able to turn people into a lifeless skin, wich acts just like a costume. When you put on the person's skin, you actually become the person 100%!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaat?\" You respond, not knowing to believe it or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see my height has been reduced to my sister's right? And just watch everything else change, like my eye color, teeth, voice... everything!\" She says and grabs Katie's face with her hands and quickly drags it over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica now looking exactly like Katie again, walks right in front of you and look you straight in the eyes. You start study her face and see Jessica's normally blue eyes are now more greenish. Your eyes move down to the smile she has on her face and notice the teeth also has changed just like she said. <br>\r\n\"You see?\" She then says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" you say with an excitement in your voice. \"That is amazing!\"<br>\r\n\"If this is really true... this pen is fucking awesome!\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Jessica agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Could it identify your drawing of an elephant trapped in a boa constrictor? You tried asking all these questions at once, but that was physically impossible. All Jessica heard was gibberish and something about elephants. She handed you the note that came with the pen. You read it closely as she went into her bathroom to take off the skin and shower. She briefly considered taking off the skin while in the shower. But she didn't want to risk damaging the suit. So 'Katie' striped in the bathroom next to the pile of clothes that Jessica had discarded an hour ago when she put on her sister's skin for the first time. The device was still in the bathroom next to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jessica unzipped the skin, she felt herself growing in height. The skin became tight on her matured body. After a minute of struggling, Katie's body was laying on the floor of the bathroom with the two discarded outfits. Out of sheer force of habit, Jessica zipped up her sister's empty body before she stepped into the steamy shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your girlfriend cleansed herself, you read the instructs aloud. You tried to yell a few questions to Jessica in the shower, but it seems like she couldn't hear you. What you didn't realize what the the newly restored Katie could hear you perfectly. When he woke up naked on the floor of a bathroom, she assumed that she had gotten wasted at a party. The numbness in her skull supported her assumption. But as she heard you read about this incredible device and how it worked. She put the pieces together. Her big sister had turned her into a bodysuit without her permission. She spied the device on the counter as you called out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you just point and click the button.\" You repeated for the 8th time, \"Man, we should tell Jimmy and Trish about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica shut off the water, Katie sprang into action. She pulled back the shower curtain and shot her sister. Jessica collapsed into the tub. Katie wasted no time trying her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfive minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend walked out of the bathroom in her favorite outfit. She gives you a long kiss hello. \"Where's Katie?\" you asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" 'Jessica' paused,  \"I dressed her and zipped her up. She'll come up in 10 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good.\" You reply, accepting Katie's lie. \"Well, then. What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jessica' pauses for a moment before replying...</span></div></div>",

She locks the door seeing that no one is there and then decides to take off her red shirt revealing her C-Cup breast, imitating her looks, in front of me. Next she takes down her blue skirt revealing her pink panties. Soon she takes off her panties and decide to flirt me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do look sexy don't you think, David?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye..yea..\" as I almost have a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well.. I be right back!\" as she unzip her back and takes out her head first. Minutes later after I see her taking off her 'suit', my girlfriend becomes herself again while 'Katie'  lies down like a plump of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok now...zap me!\" Jessica tells me while giving me the pen while pointing at the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did what she told me and in a blink of an eye, it zap her and suddenly, a bodysuit was form in front of her and Jessica's suit is complete in a few minutes. I take a closer look, dropping the pen and holds the suit in amaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow..it's really you!\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and be me!\" Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, I take off my clothes and slide in my legs into the suit. I gave a good stretch on the legs as it seems to pull me to my waist. Once I done I notice that I grew taller and continue with the hands. Wow it is soft as silk as I keep stretching. Once I've finish, I adjust the breast after I zip myself up and look at myself in the mirror. Looks weird for a guy in a woman's body (well suit). So then by taking a deep breath, I wear my girlfriend's face and adjust it to it's place. I open my eyes and see myself as Jessica. I look behind and amaze that there's no zipper. Unable to resist I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Jessica Hunt, sexiest girl and cheerleader of the Wellengton High school. Yay!\" I yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I didn't act like that but although wearing as cheerleaders sounds like a good idea! One minute,\" as Jessica opens up her closet , taking out two cheerleader outfits. \"Now hurry up and wear them while I wear back Katie once I take my bath!\" as she takes her 'sister' and her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, before I wear I decide to check on my 'girlfriend'. I grope her D-cup breast and feels it. Oooohh...it feels good. Getting a bit side-track, I quickly snap out of my new body and wears the pink bloomers. Wow...I can't believe I'm wearing a female bloomers before. Next I wear the pink &amp; white skirt. Slim as always as I know. Once there I wore the pink &amp; white top shirt. Finally I wore her socks and shoes and look in the mirror. Yeah this is how Jessica and her sister become famous. I then hear the door opening, to see Jessica in Katie's body out of the room revealing her cheerleader outfit. 'Katie's head' is still deflated onto her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how you like being me?\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's hot...\" as I took out Jessica's face for a while revealing my face. \"I can't believe this is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well believe it.\" she smiles \"So shall we start being them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod as we both wear the mask at the same time. As we look at each other we giggles and do a cheer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone. I am Jessica!\"<br>\r\n\"And I am Katie!\"<br>\r\n\"And we are here to support the Wellengton Pixies! GO Wellengton !!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how many people love us.\" Jessica/me says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! And you never dare to wear bra in it because of your breast,\" as she plays along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what next?\" I ask<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaving it on the toilet seat, you get undressed really fast without realizing it and grab the suit. It feels warm and very soft rubber. You stare into the open back. It's black, so black that it doesn't seem to reflect light. You turn it to let more light in only to find your right leg already gliding itself down into it. There's a tingling and silky slipperiness allowing it to go on easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's foot fills out, points, then settles back mimicking your own movements inside. You wiggle your toes and watch her green toenails move. When you put her foot down, you feel the fuzzy bathmat. There's no sense of anything covering your foot like a suit. The other foot goes in before you think to do it. It's almost like the skin is directing your actions. You know it isn't so, that it's just your own excited anticipation pushing you to find out and quickly. It's just you don't seem completely in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both feet down, you pull at the waist to get it up to yours over your much longer legs. Amazingly, there's no problem until you look to the side and realize that you're shorter already. It didn't stretch; it shrunk your legs into hers. For a few moments you stop astonished by this only to be more in awe as you tuck in your man-parts and feel them go numb to be replaced by sensations of your new female crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms go on same as the legs, and her painted nails become your own as you now feel through her hands as well. Reaching behind to your tailbone, you push along the seam where the two sides come together. The suit tightens around your stomach and chest causing your abs and waist to decrease and then the breasts to fill. All that feeling of wearing a suit disappears as if this skin is now fully yours including the fleshy small mounds that feel the skin suit's head and hair hanging down against them. It's quite different than how you're accustomed to something on your male chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the mass of hair draped in front of you, you marvel at Katie's, now your, dainty hands before you insert them to open the hood hanging there and pull it over your head. For a few seconds everything is dark, then the bathroom again comes into focus. You turn and see Katie in the mirror, a good head lower than where you saw yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really works,\" you whisper in disbelief before moving Katie's hand to your throat. \"And her voice as well, and no Adam's apple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, you look into Katie's eyes and see the greenish blue not your old brown eyes. Her teeth are straight and white without that crooked incisor and odd canine of David Anderson. It makes you wonder if all your insides have changed or just what's visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, you done? You OK?\" Jessica asks through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn something of bewildered amazement, you open the door and walk out. Your whole body feels so different, and your perspective is much lower. In fact, you have to look up at Jessica, several inches now above instead of below you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, you are Katie, and this is her body. You have her memories of growing up and living here. Last you remember you were in your room after taking a shower then, suddenly, now you're here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, what am I doing in your room, and why am I naked?\" you ask looking around and spying your clothes on her bed. Automatically, you race over and start putting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, <i>Katie</i>. I guess I need to remind you that you're really <i>David</i>. HELLO, DAVID. Are you still there?\" Jessica imitates calling like you're a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shake of your head, Jessica's words shock up memories of being David, being teased by Jessica's sister then finding out it was really Jessica inside some sort of body skin suit of Katie. Then Jessica convinced you in putting on Katie's skin before a flash made you think about being David. But you know you are really Katie. That's what most stands out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah. Jessica. I thought I was your sister,\" you reply before looking over in the mirror to see Katie Hunt. You then start rambling on very fast. \"I still think I'm her just with David's memories unless I concentrate that I'm David though, right? But I feel more like myself, I mean your sister, Katie. There's some distant memories about David, but I clearly have all my memories and personality, and, and, . . if I'm David - This is so awesome! But, <i>ew!</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had so many questions to ask Jessica about this incredible device she used to wear her little sister like a halloween costume. Your mind was racing with possibilities. You hardly noticed when Jessica walked back into the room with a timid smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya David\" she hugged you tightly, whispering into your ear, \"my big sis isn't here.\" Just then you feel Katie's hand grab your ass firmly. \"It's just me and you.\" She rests her head on your chest, letting you smell her hair. The scent of strawberries intoxicates your brain as Katie, you know it's really Jessica, but all of your senses are feeling the sexy brunette that had been stealing glances at you for the last 18 months. She looses her hug and starings longingly into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've wanted you so long, David.\" Katie's voice confesses desperately. You were planning on playing hard to get, staying 'loyal' to Jessica, but as Katie's arms wrapped around your neck, once her body leaned into yours, once you smell the strawberries... you had to go for it. You had to taste the strawberry chap-stick that adorned those bright red lips. Something in you realizes that you've wanted her for a long time too. So you go for it. You lean into her lips. You lift the petite teen off her feet in an embrace that would make Nicolas Sparks green with envy. She is young, she is passionate. You tongue spelunks into her mouth, exploring the teeth that only magic could have given your girlfriend. You feel your arousal press again her soft form as she presses herself to you. She wraps her legs around your waist, now completely supported by you. You lead her to Jessica's bed. She smiles warmly as you place her down on the sheets.You begin to unbuckle your jeans when the doorbell rings. Jessica breaks the mood and gets off the bed, fixing her sister's disheveled hair and clothes in the mirror<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, tiger.\" 'Katie' laughs. \"Though you get an A for effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, I\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts a finger to your lips. \"Ssh. Do I look like I'm Jessica? I'm Katie.\" she teases. \"And this\" she runs her fingers through your hair. \"is our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she pecks you on the cheek and bounces out of the room. You catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. You have a old friend visiting and it doesn't look like he's going to see himself out. You walk into Jessica's bathroom to resolve the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, you hear 'Katie' chatting warmly to a guest downstairs. They talk for a few minutes about plans for the day. You're not sure how it'd look to have Jessica's boyfriend hanging out in the house alone with Katie. So you stay upstairs and browse the web a flash of light bursts from the 1st floor. Katie's voice calls you downstairs. You excitedly run down. What do you see?</span></div></div>",

Your dorky little sister, little miss perfect who was class president every year since junior high, was an empty skin in your girlfriend's living room. And more than that, you were about to put on that skin and become your own sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey 'Claire', if you're done fawning over your sister's nekkid parts like a perv, you might want to try her on.\" Jessica paused. \"Unless you'd like to resume what we were up to with me in a slightly different skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw up in your mouth a little bit at that and started stripping out of your own clothing. Jessica gathered them in a bundle and stored them in the back of her closet. \"Wouldn't want people to make assumptions.\" She joked as you sank your left leg into the suit. Clarie's toes wiggled as your own. The 2nd leg at the same results. You could feel your feet growing smaller as you pulled the suit above your hips. Jessica waved goodbye to your old friend as it fit snugly into the suit. It formed a visible bump in the skin, but as your pelvis shaped under the suit, it disappeared into your sister's toned curves. You worked both arms into the suit next, Claire's well-freckled shoulders slipped over your own. Jessica had zipped you up to the base of the neck. \"You ready?\" she asked as you looked at the mess of red hair on the headpiece. You nodded yes and pulled the rest of the skin over your face. Jessica zipped the rest of the way and a feeling of warmth filled your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Jessica asked. She was re-dressing you as quickly as she had stripped the real Claire. Though you were the real Claire now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blurry.\" you complained in a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Katie's voice replied. She handed you Claire's black rimmed glasses. You slide them on and the world comes back into the focus. You look around the living room. It felt like the weirdest FPS you've ever played. Your had lost about 6 inches of height and grown a full pair of breasts. There was a lot to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica finished helping you dress and walked with you to the wall mirror in the guest bathroom. You saw Katie &amp; Claire. Nothing more. Nothing to give away the truth. Just two teenage girls who became best friends as kids and were mutually disgusted when their older siblings started to date each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Claire\" 'Katie' asked, \"we better get back to your house. Our pick-up will arrive soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said that Claire didn't have any plans when she got here.\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't\" Jessica admits, \"but when Katie asked if she wanted to double-date today, she called us Scott at once. He and Allen are gonna pick 'us' up in 30 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately think of Scott. He was actually in your grade. Your sister absolutely adored him, but you always thought he was a creep. Of course, that may have been your bias. Allen, on the other hand, was a really great guy who always looked adorable with Katie. He'd definitely be a lot of fun to go out with.</span></div></div>",

She starts with the right foot and as it's completely inside she continues with her left, within seconds she stands with both of her feet inside the skin. The weird thing is that her legs now looks just like Trish's, the shape and length hasn't changed even though Jessica is slightly taller. She then continues to drag the skin further up her body and starts to maneuver her hands inside as well. <br>\r\nYou can't help but be amazed and slightly aroused by the sight that meets you. Jessica is standing on the floor with her face on top of your friend Trish's body and with her face dangling lifeless over the chest.

Instead, think of the opportunities and how wickedly cool this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right.. But... Wow, I mean... Wow this is so not what i was expecting.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it\" Jessica replies and starts to feel her new body up and down while looking seductively towards you. \"Oh yeah, it feels good inside here, her breasts are a bit smaller but she's so cute.

You had the pens for about a week previously before you began this plan of yours, learning about all they could do from the notes you read with them. The brown pen made copies of your own skin, and when resealed would act like an identical copy of you with all the memories up to the point you zapped yourself. The notes also told you to proceed with caution if you sealed a new skin when you were already wearing one, for it would permanently make your body that of the previous skin you wore, which ment you were now the only Jessica. Just the thought made you wet. You just kept rubbing your Trish tits slowly as the 'Jessica or \"David\" inside began to spasm a little on the floor. You had made a new clone of yourself after you modified the pens a little that would allow combined skins to regain control over their wearer's, which ment in just a moment..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Jessica/David rose from the floor and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so did it work\" you cooed in Trish's sexy voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grinned at you and began to rub between her legs against her new clit, and said \"mmmm oh yesss it did, now i'm Jimmy too\" she giggled afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Jimmy inside the Jessica which had completely erased your once friend David slowly strutted to you and embraced you as she began to kiss your Trish lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so what should we do now Jimmy.. or should I say 'Jessica'\" she said grinning.</span></div></div>",

Your eyes widen at the sight of your friend, really your girlfriend, slowly edging closer, hands running through her hair, naked body inches from your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you want this,\u201d she whispers seductively. \u201cAnd I can give it to you. I can be anyone,  just for you...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breath draws heavy as you think of the possibilities. Trish O'Neil has been your friend for as long as you can remember. You've never thought of her this way until now \u2013 now that it's Jessica inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck.\u201d You lean forward for the kiss. It doesn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you're going to have to earn it.\u201d Trish's body pulls away, her features mimicking Jessica's when she's teasing you. She reaches back, gripping the back of Trish's head and forcing her hands deeper into the neck. Still amazed, you watch as Trish's nose flattens as the cheeks begin to sag, before Jessica's head emerges once more. \u201cThere I was thinking you only had eyes for me,\u201d she mocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was you! Jessica, this is incredible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you! Awesome, isn't it? And if I zap her again, Trish is back to normal, no longer a suit. I tried it out earlier to make sure. A test run, for later tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, still trying to take in everything that's happened. \u201cWait. Test run? Tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggles, continuing to slide Trish's body off, her own form enlarging as she removes the mask. \u201cJesus, David! Do you really think we're going to stop with Trish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps out of her costume, and grabs a bathrobe hanging on her door. \u201cWe're going to have fun with this, but we're going to take it slow. We're going to enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly, wondering what plan she's come up with. \u201cTrish was the first person I tested it on, but... I had to try it outside as well, to see if people thought I was her. And they did! I knew you were going to be late \u2013 you always are \u2013 so I went shopping as her. And while I was out I found myself another costume. One you're really going to enjoy.\u201d Her eyebrows flash as she giggles. \u201cBut for that treat, you're going to have to find me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets Trish to one side, walking up to you again, tracing the pen against your chest. \u201cHere, take this. You'll need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait... you want me to use this?\u201d You're still not sure how this works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh! Go out and find someone to be for a night. Use the pen and become them for a little while. Then you're going to have to find me in my disguise and seduce me. Think of it like a masquerade ball, or hide and seek. I win if I work out it's you. You win if...\u201d she kisses you on the lips. \u201cYou can work that part out yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the pen from her. You have to admit, the idea is strangely appealing. But you can see one major problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I going to find you? You could look like anybody. You could be anybody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rolls her eyes. \u201cCome on! Think! You know me well enough. Tell you what, I'll narrow it down for you. There's a band I like in town tonight. You remember my taste in music, right? Maybe I'll be going to the gig \u2013 as someone else. Maybe I'll even be back stage. Or... perhaps I'll go for something a little classier. Maybe the person whose life I've borrowed has a blind date arranged at Baggio's \u2013 that fancy Italian place? Perhaps I'll be waiting there. Either way, I'll give you a clue. I'll be wearing a red flower, and I'll be older than I am now. That's all you're getting. Now go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait... what about Trish?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll worry about Trish.\u201d Jessica practically shoos you out of her room. \u201cGo and find yourself a new body.

In your hand is a pen that can turn people into a suit? It's incredible. And now Jessica has sent you off on an errand in perhaps the strangest bedroom game ever. It puts a whole new spin on roleplaying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pretty certain that you're to meet her for a blind date. Jessica knows you don't like the same type of music, and this game is as much for her benefit as yours. The only question is how to surprise her. You doubt her new identity really had a date lined up, so the obvious thing to do would be to find some good-looking guy, turn up on this pretend blind date, charm and woo her. That's not original though; you're sure you could do better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause as you reach Baggio's; it's a typical Italian restaurant, all dark wood and classy interior, a menu proudly displayed outside under immaculately polished windows. It's too early for dinner service and the restaurant is currently closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaggio's is a family-run business. You've been there once or twice with your parents, and the manager is the original owner's daughter. She's a feisty Italian beauty: lean, olive skin tone, long black hair (always tied in a ponytail), bee-stung lips and dusky eyes. You've seen her charm customers with her wonderful, lilting voice, and once overheard her reprimanding her chef when someone sent their food back. The waiters are all Italian too, in their 20s and annoyingly handsome \u2013 which is probably why Jessica likes the place so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey! There's a thought. You cross the road, entering a small coffee house to scheme. You could always become one of the restaurant's staff for the night. When Jessica arrives, you could act normally, wait her table, hit on her... then, when the 'date' doesn't show, make your move. She wouldn't see that coming. Hell, why stop with the waiters? You could even try becoming the hostess; maybe Jessica would like it if you were a woman. It's certainly unexpected, and with the pen rules are out the window. In fact, she never said she was coming as a woman at all, did she? Maybe she wants to swap gender identities for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou order your coffee and take a seat, mulling over your options. Becoming the staff is an entertaining idea, but is there something better? You glance around, looking for something even more creative...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackpot. Sat in the corner, clearly on a break from her shift, is one of the local cops. You know her well from her occasional talks at your school: Officer Molly O'Sullivan. She's in her early 30s and pretty enough, with auburn hair cut in a wavy bob, a thin nose and a pale complexion sprinkled with freckles. She's often parked in town watching for anyone cutting the junction, which probably explains why she's taking her break here. You watch as she finishes her drink and heads to the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin fiendishly. You could always borrow Officer O'Sullivan's body for a while, too. Perhaps you could convince Jessica (or whatever she's calling herself) that her body is wanted for something and that you're going to arrest her. Then you could let her seduce you while 'taking her into custody'; there's no way she would see that coming. Or you could finish O'Sullivan's shift, find her home and dress nicely for your blind date. Either way, it's going to be a pleasant surprise for Jessica. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's twenty minutes later. Officer O'Sullivan is still in her car, and you've crept into the side alley behind Baggio's to consider your next move. You still don't have any real idea how this pen works. Do you just fire it and it turns someone into a... thing? What if it doesn't work? And what if it does?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've decided that the greatest surprise for Jessica \u2013 the one she would never expect \u2013 is to become one of the staff. Obviously she wants you to roleplay, and you can't think of a better way to do it. So now you're waiting outside for someone to come out into the alley. You're pretty sure you can zap them and grab the costume easily enough: the back door is open, and you can see a small set of stairs, presumably leading up to the owner's apartment. That will buy you enough privacy to make the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a noise from the corridor, voices in Italian flying out in a sparky exchange, and you duck behind a dumpster. You hear footsteps, and hold your breath as you prepare to make your move. Your stomach turns, your palms sweat. You take a breath, step out, level the pen, and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you think nothing's going to happen. Shit; it's not a waiter, it's the hostess \u2013 she's got a cigarette in her mouth and was preparing to light it, having stepped outside for a smoke. But then, without a sound, the flesh seems to deflate. It's as though her body and soul has vanished, leaving only her skin and clothes. You pause for a moment in shock as you watch the cigarette cartwheel in the air. Then, realizing what you've just done, you do the only thing you can: grab the bundle of flesh and clothes, and rush up the stairs. Behind you a male voice calls out, light and friendly. You ignore it, slamming the door to the owner's apartment behind you, staring around to make sure you are alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only when you realize no one else is here that you catch your breath. Thinking quickly, you dart to the bedroom \u2013 a standard, traditional, room with a few homely touches, a crucifix over the bed, and a large dresser crammed with beauty products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d you say, pulling the clothes away from the costume. \u201cI guess I'm going to be a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how you feel about that, but there's no backing down now. You pick up the costume \u2013 it's the only way to think of it \u2013 find the opening, and step inside. You've already seen how the Trish costume changed Jessica, but it's even more amazing when it's your own legs replaced by someone else's smooth, olive-toned, long legs. Every inch you don, the more your amazement continues, until you find your new, perfectly manicured hands grasping that long, silky black hair and pulling it back over your own as you don your new face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an instant the world goes black as the costume's fit reshapes your visage: then you open your eyes, now a deep shape of hazel, and look in the dresser mirror. Staring back at you, a look of utter surprise on her lips, is a fiery Italian beauty. Her hair is still in a ponytail, her face beautifully made up with bright red lips and dark, smokey eyelids, but she is stark naked. Instinctively you trace your nails around your breasts, stroking down your lean stomach, then reaching up to touch your new cheeks. It's a remarkable face: comparatively large to the rest of the body, timeless and full of character, with large dark eyebrows and round, glorious cheekbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you say, your lips instinctively drawling a rich, melodic accent. You laugh, and hear her laugh. \u201cI guess I'm now Italian,\u201d you say, listening to her sparkling voice as you pose in front of the mirror. \u201cCiao, bella!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at that point you realize the problem. You don't know how to speak Italian. You don't know how to run a restaurant, either. In fact, you don't know anything about your new body. Obviously the costume doesn't turn you into the person, only turns the person into a costume. It's a small point, but a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it matter? You're the owner of this place: nobody will question you. You laugh and fall back on her bed, your bed now, stretching out luxuriously. Then there's a knock from the apartment door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngelica?\u201d Someone is calling you. You clear your throat \u2013 why, you're not sure \u2013 and try answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d The voice is male and heavily accented. \u201cWe heard you rushing up the stairs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine,\u201d you say, slipping surprisingly easily into your role. \u201cI just forgot to check something, that's all. Go back to work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, you're the boss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief as you hear the footsteps fade. Maybe today you'll tell your staff only to speak in English, or that you're going to take a front of house role and only supervise. That's probably the best way to do it; it will give you ample time to spot Jessica.  You scramble to the end of the bed, slipping on Angelica's clothes. You have a little difficulty with the bra, but after five minutes you are smoothing the creases of your hostess uniform, and pushing a few errant hairs back in place. You look as she did the moment she stepped out of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at the dresser, taking out a cigarette from the pack in her jacket. You slip it between Angelica's lips and revel in your new identity. An ornate diary sits on the dresser, open at today's date and written in English and you have some time before the restaurant opens: you could find out more about Angelica Baggio for your charade tonight. Alternatively, you could call up one of the waiters and take their form instead. You have to admit though, being Angelica is even better than you imagined... and Jessica would love it.</span></div></div>",

Sir, madam.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour into service and you love your new role. Your heels click across the hard floor of the restaurant, a smile teased out of your perfectly pouting lips. You are Angelica Maria Baggio. It says so on your driving license. You look like her, smell like her, sound like her. Is that all identity is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been pretending to be her for the past couple of hours. You started off reading her diary, getting to understand her mindset as you smoked her cigarette. That didn't last long: you're a guy in a hot woman's body, after all. It was only a matter of time before you slipped off her clothes (yes, the ones that took you five minutes to don the first time) and became intimately acquainted with your new skin. And, once you had experienced what this incredible body had to offer, you stayed up in her room, staring into the dresser, practising every facial expression your mask could make. It was a full hour before you had cleaned yourself up, donned her clothes again, and headed downstairs, ready to temporarily take over her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody questioned who you were or where you had been. Nobody seemed bothered when you insisted on talking only in English. As for running a restaurant, so far it's been surprisingly easy. You direct people to tables \u2013 the real Angelica has already assigned each table to a booking \u2013 and let the waiters handle the rest. You charm the customers a little, make a few jokes, hurry a few waiters. It's a pretty easy role to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow as you seat the couple, give them one last dazzling smile with your perfect teeth, and head back to the front of the restaurant to plan your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you had no idea what Jessica was planning. In fact, you thought you may have got it wrong: after all, she hadn't given you a reservation time at Baggio's. What if that had been a clue she was going to the gig? But then the first candidate arrived, and you had barely been able to hide your arousal under the mask of Angelica's warm, professional face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandidate number 1: Hannah Wellington, the statuesque anchor for a local TV station who lives next to Trish, with her lush, brunette locks falling around a curvy bombshell body. You've been in love with her for years. Jessica knows all about your crush, and has even teased you mercilessly about it. If she was going to be anyone to 'reward' you in this fantasy game, Hannah would be the perfect candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Wellington arrived about half an hour ago, with a table booked for two, and has started on the antipasto. So far, nobody else has shown up. She seems to be clock-watching a little, occasionally checking her phone: it's the same make as Jessica's. She's also wearing a magnificent crimson gown, with a red rose pinned in her hair as a fascinator. So far you've only spoken to her briefly as you took her to her table, asking if anyone would be joining her. The answer was enigmatic: \u201cI hope so\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure it was her. But then a second candidate walked in you just couldn't ignore. It was a woman who took your breath away: the veritable girl of your dreams. Jessica knew exactly what pushed your buttons \u2013 and this woman, in her late 20s, hair in a stylish, shaggy blonde cut, meets all the requirements. You felt Angelica's body tense as you spoke to her, and struggled to keep in character as she gave you her faux-fur coat to reveal a small, tight-fitting black sleeveless dress. On her arm: an ornate red rose tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou busy yourself as Angelica, before slipping outside to the alley, taking a cigarette break to think. The stunningly beautiful stranger is booked under \u201cWalker\u201d, and had introduced herself as \u201cMonica\u201d. If it was an alias, it's exactly the kind of joke Jessica would make. But does that mean Hannah Wellington is really here? It's an odd coincidence. And if Hannah is really Jessica, what are the chances of such a beauty turning up by accident?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what to think now. But you're going to have to act. The two women won't wait around forever, and, if you're going to pretend to be the hostess and seduce your girlfriend, you'll have to start heading over there to comfort and console your choice. The only question is: which?</span></div></div>",

Monica, by this point, is finishing her main, content on her own. You know your choice. You check your appearance in the polished mirror on one of the restaurant's walls, allowing a thin smile to pass over Angelica's face. It's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roberto,\" you say, leaning in to one of the waiters out back. \"I need you to take over as host, all right?\" You know from her diary he's done it before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Then double stupido, eh? Because now he'll never know what he missed out on!\" You grin Angelica's smile, letting her large, bright smile light up.

Soon she's relaxed completely, and you're bumping into each other, touching each other's hands across the table, even caressing each other in an overtly friendly way. It doesn't take much beyond that to point out to her that other guests are noticing the owner is taking a lot of time with one customer (even if you're officially off duty), and that you've got an even better bottle of red upstairs. Soon you're heading up to Angelica's apartment, laughing, slipping over as the alcohol takes hold, walking with one arm planted on 'Hannah's' back. And then, alone, as the wine flows, the cigarette smoke drifts and conversation peters out, Hannah comes on to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathes heavily, her lips drifting closer to yours, your proud Italian face not resisting as she plants first a kiss on your lips, then her tongue slips down your throat. At that you're so surprised you recoil back, unsure how to react... or how Angelica would react, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I've...I've never done anything like this before,\" Hannah says, catching her breath. \"But... if you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't need to complete the sentence. The only question is: do want this? It's easy to think of this as you and your girlfriend, having some fun. But there's something dark, evil, about having effectively stolen two peoples' lives in the first place. Some fun and games, a little fooling around... you can understand that. But you feel like you should draw a limit somewhere, shouldn't you? Angelica's body might be yours for now, but doesn't that come with a responsibility to its original owner? You feel torn, caught up in both the intoxication of the moment and the strange ethics of the scenario you find yourself in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your sense of morality is eventually overridden by the alcohol you previously shared with Hannah, and her curvacious, lightly toned body.<br>\r\nShe stands there, looking at the ground as she tries to quell her nerves as you suddenly take her shoulders. She looks up, surprised, as you plant your lips firmly<br>\r\nonto hers just as she did. Your tongues entertwine, and as you make out, you guide her backwards onto your bed. Falling forwards, you land on Hannah, still<br>\r\nattached to her face. Breaking your kiss in order to breath momentarily, you slip your hand up her shirt and grope her restrained breast, your fingers feeling<br>\r\nthe smooth texture of her push up bra. You bite her bottom lip as she starts to moan quietly, tugging it before letting go. Your lips drop from her own to her neck, you<br>\r\nnuzzle into her smooth skin and suck it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moonlight still cascades into the room through the window, illuminating the scene taking place on your bed. The two of you have stripped completely and<br>\r\nnow lay as an entanglement of two bodies, rich brown and pale white. Hannah takes you by surprise as she pushes you over and rolls ontop of you, your breasts<br>\r\npress together with her weight. Rubbing your bodies as you make out, Hannah's fingers travel down your stomach to your crotch. She massages your moistening<br>\r\npussy with one finger, and your legs tremble in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm.. You seem ready.\" Hannah says, biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it, love.\" You reply, your hair messily scattered over the pillow behind your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah withdraws from you, sitting up on your legs. Her fingers work your clit, before she slips two inside of you. You bury your face into the pillow, clenching<br>\r\nyour teeth as your body tenses. Hannah knows just how to please you, most likely from experience. She said she'd never done this before, but she's unusually<br>\r\nadept at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while passes as you orgasm, letting out a muffled groan as your juices trickle down your inner thigh. You trade positions with Hannah and decide to deliver<br>\r\noral, sticking your head between her legs. As you lick her clit, she grabs your head, sitting up, and coaxes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm.. fuck! Just like that..\" Hannah moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guide the tip of your tongue to just above her asshole and then press it flat against her cunt, sliding upwards as you lick her entire labia at once. <br>\r\nYou hear Hannah gasp as tense, before melting. You tease her clit more, until she finally cums, squirting all over your face.<br>\r\nCleaning up her cunt with your lips, you kiss it one last time and then withdraw, wiping your face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so good..\" Hannah says, laying on her back, exhausted and drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding, you'd found a towel and cleaned yourself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wanna' head back to your place Jess? We can have another round in our real bodies.\" You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of confusion appears across Hannah's face, and as you see it, you frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Hannah asks, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica.. what do you mean, 'What are you talking about?'\" You reply, your eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah couldn't possibly be herself.. right? You can't be wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your phone rings from your pants pocket, laying on the floor by the window. Walking over to it, it's Jessica calling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit..\" You whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in a mess now, you've just had sex with the real Hannah Wellington in someone else's body. You can't answer your phone in Angelica's voice for Jessica to hear, but you can't take off the skin with Hannah still watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never even told me your name, what's all this about real bodies..?\" Hannah perks up, you turn your head to see her standing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It was a joke,\" You stutter, trying to come up with an excuse, \"I was only kidding, Hannah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah folds her arms and sighs, before putting on her clothes. \"Whatever, I'm gonna' get going now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright..\" You reply, as you hear the bedroom door close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a weirdo.\" You hear Hannah say to herself as she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slept with someone you thought was me?\"  Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I really thought she was you! I guess I was wrong.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughs out loud over the phone at you. \"I guess that means I win! I went to the concert, but you obviously didn't check there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens now that you win..?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I'll think of something. Come over tomorrow.\" She replies, chuckling evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, babe. I gotta' go, sleepy as hell.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye David, goodnight!\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone call ends with a blip, and you let your phone drop onto your chest, laying in your bedroom. You'd got home late after putting Angelica back in her bed,<br>\r\ndressing her, then zapping her with the black pen. Your mother wasn't too concerned about your late night sneaking-in. You shut your eyes in the dark of your room<br>\r\nand fall asleep quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your first instinct is triumph; you knew that Hannah, dressed as she is in her bombshell red dress, was really Jessica. But any satisfaction at your guess soon gives way to fear. She's pointing a pen at you! And that means you're going to turn into a suit! You fall back in shock, Angelica's hazel eyes wide with terror as she fires at you. You trip in your heels and fall back, onto the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you're not deflated. You pat yourself quickly - your generous breasts, your perfectly made-up, expressive Italian face. And then you begin cursing. Cursing in a string of Italian that flows freely from your lips, twisting in phonetic somersaults as only Italian can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. You speak Italian. And much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories flood your mind, as if you are flying through clouds of a person's history. You remember watching your father in the kitchen as a young girl, how you always wanted to run the restaurant, and took over management in your late 20s, having worked just about every job in the place except chef. You remember how your father bought the flat above the restaurant, and papa gave it to you for your 25th birthday. You know how to run a restaurant, the names of your staff, the entire history and mind of Angelica Maria Baggio. It's overwhelming. Breath shudders from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, isn't it?\" Hannah, really Jessica, poses above you, body curved to the light to show off Miss Wellington's stunning figure. You know everything about Angelica. You could be her for years and nobody, not her family or closest friends, could know the difference. You can think like her, act like her, talk like her. You know her likes - her passion for wildlife documentaries, for example - and her dislikes - she's not a fan of zombie movies. Beyond pointless trivia, you know about her failed attempts to quit smoking, and the secrets of applying her makeup just-so to give the perfect professional look. More, you know her emotions, from surface thoughts to those deep, repressed desires. She's a good Catholic girl, who has only had a handful of long-term relationships due to the nature of her work. She has always been curious about being with a woman, but she does not consider herself bisexual, and has never acted on such thoughts or desires. With her emotions come changes to her body. You feel the heat in her breast as she reacts to the slow seduction of Hannah Wellington, and that forbidden kiss moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica would have protested, at least at first, but then she would have succumbed out of interest. Knowing that makes you feel at least somewhat better about how you're borrowing this life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up from the sofa, and catch sight of yourself in a large, ornate mirror she keeps in the lounge. Your large, high cheekbones are flushed, your dusky eyes wide, your painted lips catching your breath. But you look, even in your professional uniform, stunning. Your hands are fumbling for something, and you realize Angelica's instincts had taken over: you were reaching for a cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah, or rather Jessica, has meanwhile returned to character. The pen has vanished, and she's brought you a glass of water. \"Are you all right, Angelica?\" she asks, feigning concern. \"I guess you tripped. I'm kind of nervous about this too. But I think we've got a real connection.\"</span></div></div>",

Never being David again, yet not worrying his family with his disappearance, would be perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah grins mischievously and before you know it she's zapped you with the brown pen gadget again. This time the mental change is subtle: your David memories and self recede a little further into the background and you're more you, more Angelica Maria Baggio than before. There's also a strange fullness in your abdomen, and a feeling that something's been inserted up your vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a David suit up your sweet twat,\" says Hannah. \"Pull it out.

The young man nods his head and agrees, pondering why he and his girlfriend were able to be seated so quickly on such a busy night. \"Right-a this way,\" you say smiling while grabbing a couple of menus while leading the young couple to a seat in the back.

Enjoy.\" you smile while staring at David who you notice blushes when his eyes momentarly darts at your cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell he finds you very attractive even though you are eleven years his senior. You know this because at one point you were him, and he was you, way before that one night, all the way back in 2014, when you happened to stumble a little device called a costume pen that charged your lives forever. Of course unlike you he can't remember anything about his old life of being you (Angelica) or of anything about a set of costume pens which made him David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you can't believe its been over five years since you last saw the body you grew up in your first 18 years of life. Many details about his life has slipped from your memory long ago but you can still picture the night you became your true self all those years back. You even recognize your old girlfriend who was the one who gave you those pens, all those years back too. They are both heavier now though, probably being fresh out of college with their bachelors degrees and in their mid twenties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a pair of engagement rings on their fingers. \"Ahh so you did stay together.\" You think to yourself behind the hostess counter. You always wondered if you had stayed as David you'd still be together with Jessica your original high school sweet heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you only shrug a those thoughts, you don't regret becoming your true self, you have a dotting handsome husband and a beautiful one year old daughter now. You've moved put of your old upstairs apartment and have a lovely house in the suburbs.You are only in your mid thirties and you are still very slim, even after your pregnancy, due to your strict workout routine and for the fact you finally quit smoking after all those long years. You still also stay in touch with Hannah now and then over email, as she got a job on the east coast being a lovely nationwide news anchor. She was even the maid of honor at you and your husband's wedding a few years back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tend to the couple all night asking if they need anything, and even give them a free dessert on the house. When the couple get up to pay they both thank you, but you only smile and say \"No, Thank you both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At this, the questioning voice gave a little giggle. You turned around sharply and saw the shaggy haired blonde woman stood nonchalantly in front of you, one arm in the crook of the other, and an unlit cigarette in her raised hand. She swung this cigarette in a slight circular motion as she asked again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'I said, \"Got a light?\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You blinked a couple of times and then muttered something to the affirmative and fished around in your pocket for your, for Angelica's lighter. You were about to just hand it over, when one of of Angelica's hosting mannerisms kicked in, and you instead switched the clicker, conjuring an electric blue flame from the lighter, then leaned forward with the proffered light. The woman bowed slightly in thanks, then bowed deeper as she placed the cigarette in her mouth and brought it to the flame. As she took a luxuriant inhale, your eyes fell to her low cut dress, and the breasts therein to which you now had a perfect view of. You tried to look away but you were transfixed. Then her eyes swung upwards and caught you looking. You turned away quickly, your olive cheeks darkening with embarrassment. You mumbled an apology and turned away to run back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hand landed on your shoulder. Almost reluctantly, you turned back to see Monica Walker stifling a laugh. 'It's okay to stare, you know. Most do. It only annoys me when it's men doing the staring. When a woman does it, though, I take it as a great compliment.' She blew out a thin plume of smoke and grinned. 'Or a sign of great jealousy. Either way, it's all good for me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You narrowed your eyes. That was definitely a very Jessica thing to say.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAnd which,\u201d you ask, \u201cwas I doing? Complimenting or feeling envy?\u201d You\u2019ve had enough practice with Angelica\u2019s voice not to overplay your hand; her natural lilt verges on flirtatious anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica smiles, tilting her head so the blonde locks feather on her shoulder. She taps the ash from her cigarette. \u201cHard to say. Or do I get to choose?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a smile across Angelica\u2019s wide, warm lips. \u201cWe always like to provide options. Not everything we offer is on the menu. Sometimes we do special requests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch as?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomp on your cigarette, extinguishing it with a twist of your heel. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure your server talks you through our menu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you head back inside, allowing Angelica\u2019s curves and figure-hugging dress to work for you. You\u2019re not going to admit to Jessica who you are outright, and you know there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll drop her masquerade. So the only thing you can do is keep going with the dance until one of you can\u2019t take it any further and breaks character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and grab a mint from Angelina\u2019s pocket and slip it in your mouth, sucking it thoughtfully before taking the captain aside to make a few front-of-house changes. Hey, it\u2019s good to be the boss. Every so often your attention drifts back to Monica - your number one suspect for Jessica - trying to come up with a way to trick her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is serving table 12?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that's one of Anna's tables.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Tell Anna that I'll be working table 12. Miss Walker is a friend of mine. You take over front of house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an eyebrow raised, but nothing more as you head over, watching as those heavy eyelids waiting at table 12 flick up to drink in your borrowed form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We meet again,\" you joke. \"My name is Angelica, and I shall be your hostess tonight. May I take your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a thin smile across Monica's lips. \"I was just going to ask about the specials.\" You've been preparing for this, memorizing Italian restaurant menus - not just Baggios but others - and working on your pronunciations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, tonight we have a family recipe. zuppa di pesce, from Naples, with a white wine. For main, I recommend the cacciatore, off menu but delicious. Then, I suggest the plum semifreddo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica's face tries not to give anything away, but you know Jessica hates plums. There's a pause for a moment, a hesitant disgust that tugs Walker's nose in. In a flash, however, another set of mannerisms take hold and suppress the thought. \"The first two dishes, please, with paired wine. No dessert.\" A thoughtful click of Monica's tongue heralds her own probing attempt at flirtation. \"I do like clam followed by breast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you know it's Jessica; she's not even playing pretend as you brush off the statement as if you never heard it. And yet your body's impulses say you did, and you can only hope your partner in this masquerade didn't notice. \"Excellent choice,\" you say, before taking the menu from the table and heading to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night passes too slowly. Hannah Wellington looks frustrated that her date hasn't shown, and eventually storms off, providing only a modest tip. The chef swears at you when you instruct him to whip up chicken cacciatore, but you've already learned a couple of deliberate, pinched hand gestures seem to be the answer to any question in Italian. Every so often you swing by Monica's table to check on the meal, flirt, make small conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it comes time for the check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're disappointed that there doesn't seem to be any conversation from Monica; no more giveaway words or phrases. Instead, she pays in cash and slips into her fur coat, that red rose tattoo vanishing from sight as she prepares to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a pleasant evening!\u201d you call out as she heads to the door, flicking her hair back as she turns to address you one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I intend to. The night is still young. I might walk down toward Gibson Plaza, see what mischief I can create.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she goes - out the door, and out of Angelica\u2019s life. You begin to question if it was actually Jessica as you clear the table.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then you notice the receipt, left in its wallet with bills amounting to a hefty tip. Sure enough, Monica has written a cell number on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the night's games are just beginning. But do you call? Or perhaps you could have some fun. You know you\u2019ve spotted Jessica and she is expecting you to continue to play the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if you swapped skins, trading Angelica and pursuing Monica though the night? Jessica would never expect that. And you could be anyone...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being the owner might be nice and an easy way to scope out Jessica, if she is indeed coming here. But being a cop? That's so much more fun. Pulling people over, or detaining them for questioning on silly grounds, would make checking for Jessica quite easy. Plus as a bonus, Officer O'Sullivan is fairly easy on the eyes. She's in the restroom so getting her would also be far easier than it would the manager, even if the manager is prettier and in a more prime position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's even if the Baggio's hint was a real hint and not a red herring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settles it, you've made up your mind. You stand up and head over to the rest room. You stop for a moment and look around and when you're sure no one is looking you head into the women's restroom. You hope that there's nobody but Officer O'Sullivan in here. There wasn't a lot of customers, being the middle of the early afternoon, but there are still some girls working as baristas who might need to use the facilities. To your luck, however, you don't see anyone so quickly you duck into an open stall and wait. A moment or two later you hear a flush and a stall door open, then the sound of water from one of the sinks running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is your chance so quietly and slowly you open the door. You pull the pen from your pocket and once you're out of the stall see Officer O'Sullivan washing her hands. You aim it at her, you pause and your hand shakes a bit. This is all so weird. Are you really going to go through with it? You steel yourself, you get ready to fire the pen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer O'Sullivan says those words in a neutral tone but it's one that causes you to freeze completely. How did she...? You look past her and right over her shoulder you see yourself. The mirror, of course! You curse yourself silently for being an idiot. She shuts the water off and dries her hands, then turns back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen you around the high school before, haven't I?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, y-yeah. I guess.\" you reply nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sizes you up, \"Yeah, I remember now. I've done some talks there. Talked to a few students individually some times. Donny, right?\" she asks, \"Or was it Danny? Denny? Davey? David! That's it! David Anderson. Yeah I know who you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat takes you by surprise. You don't think you've ever talked to her one on one before and you're fairly sure you've never told her your name. Still you don't protest as she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, David, what are you doing in the ladies room, hmm?\" she asks, her tone and face showing a hint of amusement. \"Saw a woman walk in and thought you'd follow them for a bit of perverted fun, is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" you stammer. Oh man, she's a cop, you're going to be in big trouble for this. Of course the pen could get you out but you're so surprised, so nervous, that you don't feel like you can move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks and notices the pen as well. \"Lemme see that.\" she orders and, nervously, you comply as she grabs it from you. She holds it up and examines it. \"A pen, huh? Doesn't look like it writes though.\" She looks back at you, more seriously. \"So what does it do? Don't answer that, because I have a theory. What I think it does, you point it at somebody and activate it. It zaps the person and deflates them, turning them into a sack of skin. Then you take the skin and you can wear it, like a suit or a costume, and it allows you to become the person. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um... y-yeah.\" you reply. \"How did... how did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer O'Sullivan looks at you with a smile before reaching her hands up to the back of the head, her face and head then peel forward before revealing the grinning face of your friend Jimmy Wilson. \"Gotcha!\" he exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n\"Jeez, Jimmy, you nearly had me pissing myself what the hell?\" you ask as you sit next to him, now back as Officer O'Sullivan completely, in the cop's patrol car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I'm in here it's Molly.\" she replies with a laugh, \"And I'm sorry, man, but I couldn't help myself when I spotted you in the coffe house and especially when you came into the ladies room. That takes balls, never expected you to do that. That's usually my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you even get in there?\" you ask, \"Did you run into Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly cocks an eyebrow at that. \"Jessica? No. I found these things in my attic, accidentally used one on my mom, then figured I'd have some fun.\" she explains, \"What's Jessica got to do with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then go over your story for your best friend-turned-cop. You tell her about going over to Jessica's, the pen that she showed you, the suit of Trish, how Jessica promised you any girl you wanted and then of the game of hide and seek you're playing with her where she's given you the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly laughs even harder, \"Gotta admit I'm surprised. That's pretty clever and fun and kinky on Jessica's part. Never thought she'd be the type to do that.\" She leans over to you, \"Have to admit, I've always thought she was kind of an uptight prissy bitch. Nice to see she's got a bit of a fun streak in her though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let that insult towards your girlfriend pass by. \"Well hey, do you think you can help me?\" you ask. \"She never said anything about not getting help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could help you.\" Molly states with that cheshire cat grin that Jimmy gets when he's got an idea, \"But I think I've got a better idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then starts the car and drives. It's about ten minutes later and the two of you arrive at a fairly large, fancy house. \"Holy shit, the mayor's place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly continues to smile. \"Yeah. You wanted to be someone powerful, right? Who's more powerful in town than the mayor? She likes to have these little monthly open house hobnob events. It's open house but not quite everyone can get in, still I'm a cop so getting in will be no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly drags you up to the front door where she greets a person. Like she said, being a cop she is able to get right in and gets you in by explaining that you're an at-risk youth she's been mentoring causing you to roll your eyes. You are both then given a red carnation, pinned to your shirts, to identify you as guests and are told to enjoy yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly then takes you to the side, away from prying eyes, and gives you your black pen back. \"Here, take it dude. Have fun being the movers and shakers of the city. Oh, right!\" she then pulls out a brown pen and hands it to you as well. \"Guess Jessica either didn't have one like this or was holding something other than sex back. You take this brown pen and you zap someone with it. It'll give you all the information on the target, name and age and even memories. They'll fade quick unless you're wearing a suit of that person. It allows you to pull off a perfect impersonation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claps you on the shoulder and then walks off. You look down at the pens and then look at the red carnation on your shirt. Wait, a red carnation? A red flower! The red flowers that identify guests! Maybe Baggio's was just a red herring. This is definitely fancy, she would definitely be someone older here. Did Jimmy inadvertantly bring you right to where Jessica is? If so, where could she be? Who could she be? You scan the guests as you walk around. Almost all of them are older, most of them not particularly attractive. She said she'd be someone older but you're sure she doesn't want to be someone in their 50s or 60s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to give up hope when you hear two voices, two women. You're standing in a crowd near the entrance of a hallway as they come walking by and stop near you. One looks fairly young, the other slightly older. You recognize the older one as Tina Chan, the mayor, the younger one seems to be her assistant judging by the folders she's carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, Jenny, this gets more than a little tiring.\" Mayor Chan says to the younger woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told you before that you don't need to hold these gatherings so often, ma'am.\" the younger woman replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Chan shakes her head. \"No, Jenny, I do. It keeps me visible and it's the easiest way to garner support. Speaking of which, I'll need you to go file those for me. They're guarantees of support both financially for future campaigns and for various projects and bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" the younger woman replies with in a manner that comes off as being plain but loyal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Jenny. I'll be in my room taking a quick break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women then separate and the younger one, Jenny, heads into a nearby office. You thought she seemed familiar and you suddenly remember. She's Jenny Ishiyama. She went to the same high school as you and was a senior when you were a freshman. You were quite a nerd back then and she herself was quite nerdy as well. Brainy and studious but into a lot of the same stuff you were in back then, comic books and video games and such. She was your first girlfriend, actually, and your first kiss. She quite cute underneath her drab and messy dress. She still looks like something of a nerd, still serious-faced from what you saw, her hair pulled back in a messy bun and with dark-rimmed glasses. But it's all done in a way which makes her look nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayor Chan is quite young, 37 years old, and was elected last year. She's proved popular both because of her approachable nature and also because of her looks. She is a pretty lady no doubt and her close cropped bob and pantsuits give her a bit of a pretty executive vibe. Jessica is aware of your crush on her as well as Jenny being your ex-girlfriend. Could she be in one of them? They both had red carnations. You could use the pen on one and check the other. If you're wrong, well, then it's as simple as swapping skins and trying the one you had just been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she's in neither? Well you're not going to complain. Being either Jenny or the mayor would be quite nice indeed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wade through the crowd and follow Jenny, you don't know where Mayor Chan's office is, but she does. The two of you finally get out of the sea of people and she starts walking towards a smaller hallway, you wait a few seconds and then follow behind. She hasn't noticed you at all, glancing at her small watch occasionally as her heels click against the marble tiles. You make it to the corner and fish out your brown pen, a clear shot. Aiming the pen, you fire it quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories and feelings flood your mind. You were right, Jessica is inside of Jenny after all! Her memories tell you that she was out for lunch with Mayor Chan at Baggio's earlier today, and Jessica got her in the ladies room. It's all black from there as your recollection starts to fade, but you manage to find what you need.<br>\r\nTurning about, you hear a door click and open behind you as you walk away. Making your way to Mayor Chan's office, you halt by the door and listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I understand. We'll have the payment delivered in a mater of days.\" she assertively says, her fingers waving charismatically. \"Alright, good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone sets in the stand and you hear a sigh. Now's your chance.<br>\r\nYou fish out the black pen and hold it in your hand, standing in the door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock knock, good night Mayor!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello there, David right?\" she looks up at you from her laptop.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here to report on this gathering for my school newspaper, can I get an interview?\" You say with a fake smile.<br>\r\nShe looks at her laptop with a sullen expression and then back up at you again. <br>\r\n\"Sure.. what would you like to know?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding her office chair back, she stands up and straightens her shirt, she'd taken off her jacket and put it on the stand nearby.<br>\r\nWalking around her desk to you, her heels silently thudding against the carpeting. She makes her way over to you quickly.<br>\r\nHalf way, the phone rings and she sighs, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me David, I'm trying to sort something out with a contact.\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"No problem, Mayor.\" you smile as she turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, you quickly close the door and take out the black pen, aiming it at the Mayor, you press the button.<br>\r\nThe door clicks closed and you lock it as Mayor Chan crumples to the floor in a heap. Rushing over to her skin, you quickly<br>\r\nzap it with the brown pen and absorb the information, sticking your head into the long slit running down her back.<br>\r\nAs you pull the mayors face over yours with one hand, your other one picks up the phone.<br>\r\nYou poke and pull your face into position with one hand and put the receiver to your ear, your head fully morphing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Mayor Chan.\" you say in her high tone, you draw on her personality to aid you.<br>\r\n\"It's me again, we have a problem. My agents say that a few of the C-Sets have been lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? Who is this guy and how does he know about the pens? Unless..<br>\r\nMayor Chan's memories tell you that in addition to being the Mayor, she's a dealer for said pens to an undercover agency.<br>\r\nLuckily, she was never worn by anyone until now. You run your hand through the mayor's hair, this is bigger than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, what are you going to do?\" You ask<br>\r\n\"We'll dispatch a small group to round up the sets, anyone who knows about them will be removed.\"<br>\r\nYour instinct tells you to protest, but Mayor Chan's memories say otherwise.<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. alright, I'll cover it up as best I can.\" you say in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up, you slump against the hard wood of the office desk. You're in utter shock. How many people are out there that use these pens apart from you, Jimmy and Jessica? You realize that the three of you are going to be hunted down because you know about the sets. Shit, you have the warn the others.<br>\r\nYou hear someone knocking on the office door, followed by Jenny's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayor? I've finished up. Are you ready to get back to the gathering?\"<br>\r\nShit shit shit, you've got Mayor Chan's head on and the rest of her draped over you like a cape. Calm down, it's only Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Hold on a moment, I'll be right out.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling to get up, you peel Mayor Chan's face from yours and strip her clothes off. Flapping her out like a dusty rug, you open the back and quickly put her on.<br>\r\nLosing about an inch in height, you grow delicate and small breasts on your chest and your waist shrink dramatically.<br>\r\nPulling on the Mayor's underwear, you follow suit with her matching bra and then her shirt. Pulling her pants up you tuck your shirt in, then grab your jacket off the rack. Throwing it over your shoulders as you walk towards the door, you hear Jenny shriek in surprise. A gentle hum resonates as you unlock the door and hear shuffling, throwing the door open, you hold your black pen in one hand and peek your head out. A figure disappears around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, he got away..\" you mutter, looking to Jenny's skin sprawled out on the floor.<br>\r\nYou scoop her up and throw her in the office, then shut the door as you step in. Aiming the black pen, you zap the skin and watch as flesh fills it out again.<br>\r\nYou sit in a chair and sigh, who was that? Flipping out your phone, you dial Jimmy's cellphone number.<br>\r\nIt rings for a few minutes, and you see Jenny start to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Officer O'Sullivan's voice comes through.<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, it's me, David.\" You say urgently, looking at Jenny as her eyes slowly open. \"We're in a fucking crisis man.\"<br>\r\n\"Woah, are you in the Mayor? Damn, nice pick man.\" He laughs meekly and you sigh.<br>\r\n\"Mayor Chan's been dealing these pens to a secret organization and now they're after us because we know about them.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"...Wait, what? Secret organization? Dude, I found my set in my house.\" he mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause, the two of you realize what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone in your house is an agent, you need to be careful, I managed to save Jessica just in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Jenny get up and she listens intently, obviously recognizing you as David. You put your finger to your lips and she nods, walking to your desk.<br>\r\nShe swings you large office chair around and sits in it, and begins typing on Mayor Chan's laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How? Was she disguised?\" Jimmy sounds like he's driving.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't know how, but they knew she was in a skin. Maybe they were spying on her, or they have some kind of detection.\" you surmise.<br>\r\n\"Mayor Chan doesn't really know a lot, and I think that if I ask questions, they'll silence her.\"<br>\r\n\"I see.. we need to meet up, any ideas where?\" He says, obviously he's surprised.<br>\r\n\"How about at your house? We can find out if anyone's being worn and they don't know who we are yet.\" you say, glancing at Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a thumbs up and a smile, you find yourself blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.. be careful mate.\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" you mumble, and snap the phone shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you tuck Mayor Chan's cellphone into her jacket pocket and get up, walking next to Jenny. Putting your hand on the top of the chair you look at what she's up to. Your eyebrows raise as you see her impressively manouevering through the town's Database, bringing up records of any activity with the secret organization.<br>\r\nMayor Chan's memories click as you see yourself reading the same records suspiciously, she was trying to figure out who these people are herself.<br>\r\nMaybe.. no, Mayor Chan would never help you. You quickly dismiss the idea of getting help from the authorities, or anyone for that matter. <br>\r\nYou can only trust Jessica and Jimmy at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, David, you found me first.. I guess you win the game.\" Jenny suddenly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle amusingly in the Mayor's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you picked my ex-girlfriend, how's that going for you?\" you cynically mutter.<br>\r\n\"Eh.. she's not as good as me honestly.\" Jenny smirks.<br>\r\n\"Oh please..\" you say. \"Hurry up, we have to get to Jimmy's house.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright.. Jeez, you sound just like Mayor Chan.\" she says whilst giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself off the chair and walk around the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not funny.\" you give Jenny an unamused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping off your clothes, you take off Mayor Chan's skin and lay it out on the floor. Quickly dressing yourself to get rid of Jenny's probing eyes.<br>\r\nYou pull out the black pen and wait for Jenny to finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I sent the records and anything else I could find to my e-mail account.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Sweet.\" your normal voice feels weird to talk in, you discover. \"We've gotta' restore these two to normal, so hurry up.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, do we?\" She says as she strips herself, quickly exposing Jenny's curvy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away and suddenly feel jenny's arms around your chest, then her chin on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davie.. I miss you so much..\" you hear Jenny coo in your ear.<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Jess.. you're not funny at all.\" you try to shrug her off, but she clings on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles and lets go, stripping off Jenny's skin, laying her right next to Mayor Chan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should leave something for them. Like.. a signal?\" you say to Jessica.<br>\r\n\"Sure..\" you turn around as you hear her voice, and you turn red, your eyes catching her form.<br>\r\n\"David, I need my clothes. They're in Jenny's office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and retrieve them quickly, returning to the Mayor's office as quickly as you left. People looked but didn't ask any questions.<br>\r\nJessica dresses and you restore the two executives to normal, then making haste out of the building.<br>\r\nWalking down the street, Jimmy doesn't live far from here. Jessica holds your arm in her own as you traverse the sidewalk.</span></div></div>",

Before putting it on you look at her and say, \"You sure you don't want this instead (holding your stiff cock)\"? \"Maybe later, put it on\", she replies. You start putting it on and notice right away something is very strange. Instead of the suit stretching over you it's almost as if you're, for lack of a better word, flowing into it. Your body is changing to fit inside of it. As you slide the head over yours there is a flash and you can feel the suit sealing up in the back. You reach back to find the opening but only find skin and long flowing hair, Trish's long flowing hair. \"Holy crap\", you yell, but it comes out in Trish's voice. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.sexy-solo.com/2011/02/28/busty_nude_brunette.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sexy-solo.com/2011/02/28/bust...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look down and see a massive pair of knockers hanging off your feminine chest. \"Holy crap, I'm Trish\", you shout! Jessica smiles and says, \"Yep\". You then feel up your boobs and say, \"Damn, I never knew Trish was this stacked. Shit, this feels real. Like it's my skin not a suits\". Jessica rolls her eyes and says, \"Leave to a guy to go right for the boobs and yeh, she's stacked and has an awsome body. Why she never dressed to show it off I'll never know. As best as I can tell as long as you wear the skin you are Trish through and through, 100%\". That last part catches your attention. \"100%? You mean I'm completly female, inside and out\", you ask concerned? Jessica knods her head. This freaks you out a little bit. \"How do you get this thing off, can I get off\", you exclaim freaking out? Jessica holds up her hands and says, \"Yes, yes, calm down. All you have to do is will it to come off and the opening in the back will reappear. Before you do that would you like to have a little fun? I could show you how you made me feel a little bit ago\". You calm down for a minute and your hand goes to your pussy. Jessica smiles and says, \"Yeh, that' what I'm talking about. Would you like me to lick that sweat little clit of yours\"? You're still a little freaked about being suddenly female, but also intrigued by Jessica's offer.</span></div></div>",

Both fill back in and are fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably wore their bodies out,\" Sasha points out. \"Anyways since when did you become a sex freak, Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just was curious and being in somebody else's body makes me feel like it's okay to experiment,\" You respond quickly. \"It is getting sort of late, you should send me a copy of that video and we can get to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do,\" Sasha responds and then taps a few buttons on her phone before slapping your ass. \"Night sweet cheeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is slightly turned on by it but you brush it away as you lie down. You wait a few hours to ensure everyone is asleep and sneak off to the bathroom. You look at Jessica in the mirror in her pajama shirt. You start rubbing your boobs as you talk to yourself using Jessica's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God its good to be back. Though I can't do a lot of my fun stuff to you. I like you. Lauren, however, she has been nothing but a bitch to me.\" You say, then stop massaging your breast. \"Would you mind if I take her over for a bit? Put her through the ringer a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Have fun with her body!\" You have Jessica respond into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle knowing it was just you saying it, but decide that Jessica did say it was okay.

If it were different and your mentality were in full control of your circumstance, you might know what is coming next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let Rocky breed with you to his fullest delight of what David would have done if he were again human.

Yes oh yes, get up, rise as stand, stand on all four, having hoofs, and know that after you eat an equine style breakfast and go for an hour of exercise, the stables trainer shall come for you, rein you, and walk you to meet then with Trigger #20, your stallion stud for a wild as wanted breeding session!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop now, no need to thank me, as what you are, you have not the mental will left inside your weakened mind to wish as will the mare suit to reopen and let you escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your anger-heated blood suddenly starts boiling in your crotch. Trish is quite well endowed but just doesn't show off her body like Jessica. But as she drops her skirt and blouse, her sexy figure just turns up the fire in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David,\" she whines with a pouty look. \"Before I get out of Trish, will you do something for me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's sad face is like a kitten that you can't refuse, so you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to put on the Jessica skin first. You know,\" she winks sexily at you. \"So it's just we girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I guess.\" <i>What's the harm in that.</i> Where's this clone or whatever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just down the hall. Why don't you go ahead and strip down, and I'll bring the skin to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting, she scurries off, your eyes following her bouncing butt, the one you wore when Jessica ate you out a couple days ago and started all this. You swallow at that and remember how great that sex was as a girl. It's a good thing you're unbuttoning your pants because they were becoming very tight, just like before you put on Trish's skin last. Maybe this thing with Jessica becoming Trish will be OK with Trish and you can always have girl-girl sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish holds out the skin. Jessica's blond hair shines in the light, and her flesh has the warm glow, just a bit paler round the hips and chest where she wasn't tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll get the pens and be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're glad she left so she wouldn't see your boner as you drop your pants and boxers. Strange how you feel embarrassed since that never happens stripping in front of Jess. It must just be a trick of your mind because she looks like Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the skin against your leg is more than tantalizing. It's seductive, so soft and warm. You admire Jessica's leg, firm and toned, shaven smooth. You rush to get your other leg to match. It feels so good wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the skin up over your waist and torso creates heat on your manparts and chest. Feeling fades from the first as a bigger, heavier sensation grows from your chest. With the back sealing itself, you look down around the head and hair hanging in front of you. It's beautiful even if the perspective is opposite how you usually look from in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a contented sigh, you raise the head over yours and let it mold itself to your head and neck. You feel skin connect and seal around your neck. There's a tingling in every part of your body as it finishes the change. Then you're completely Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still quite aroused, but as Jessica, when 'Trish' comes back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It immediately starts sealing up your back. No longer is there any feeling of appendages between your legs, and the skin bonds to your chest adding extra weight. With happy thoughts of a new wonderful life to come, you pull Jessica's head and hair over yours and fit it around your eyes, ears, nose and mouth. As soon as you let go, your whole body tingles before all your senses go blank for a couple seconds. When you can see again, you're staring into the mirror with Jessica looking back at you with a contented smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clone is gone when you come out wearing just the Jessica skin, having left Jessica's clothes in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's the fair lady I want to see,\" Trish purrs at you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see that Jess and her double are also a bit disappointed. \"Needs more intimacy,\" says one of them -- you're not sure which -- and she concentrates.

With a copy of her self enveloping your own, you want this life swap as much as he does. After a bit of making out as your new selves, you get dressed just as if he's always been David and you've always been Jessica. He zips up the Jess suit into another Jess, and has her put on the Trish suit and Trish's clothes and go home as Trish. This fake Trish can stand in for now, and you'll worry about restoring the real one eventually. It's too exciting being your new selves to get sidetracked by worries about Trish.</span></div></div>",

As you pulled the suit to your waist, you could feel her strong core and flexible body. You loved being fucked by David, but you just had to see what sex was like as Tina. Especially with a hunk like Roger McConnell. Your breasts weighed heavily on your chest: 100% natural and firm as David's cock as he stared at your naked form. The head piece went last. It was a wave of feathered hair like an classic starlet. You felt like Tina could have walked off the set of Happy Days in the right outfit. And you had her brilliant team-leading smile. That smile that almost won Nationals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire brought out a dress that screamed 1950's soda pop. And the other Jessica, now fully dressed as you were, started working on your makeup. David excused himself into the bathroom to deal with some... private needs. When all was done, Claire shot you with the brown pen and you had full knowledge of your big sister.

She clearly felt very strongly about fulfilling Paul's wishes and wanted all the best for him. As soon as she was completely stripped, she took the black and brown pens and that suit upstairs. It wouldn't do for Paul to wake up in the living room surrounded by his family. Marie (Jessica2) followed her upstairs to sooth her husband's worries and explain how the pens worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the family gathered at the door to eavesdrop on the conversation. It was all very quiet, save a few audible gasps of surprise. And, of course, the unmistakable ping of the pens whose light flashed under the closed door. A few minutes after Trish walked upstairs holding a skin of Paul Anderson like a precious babe, a new Trish O'Neil walked downstairs dragging Paul's skin like a used condom. The original Jessica followed them with two suits of Marie Anderson. Trish was beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" Trish laughed as she jumped onto the couch. \"It's really great seeing all of you!\" As the rest of the mix-matched group greeted Trish, she began to cry a little. But it was good tears. \"I'm so grateful, I really am!\" Trish professed to Claire who gave her old body a big hug. Everyone took turns meeting the new Trish. It seemed like everyone got what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there was Marie and the other Jessica. Nobody wanted to steal Marie's life without offering her a trade, but she couldn't be trusted to understand the gift of these pens. She'd think they were an evil curse. Luckily, she'd have zero knowledge of being worn as a suit. So maybe she didn't have to know about the suits at all. Marie always complained that she'd been a better parent if her husband was more support of her needs and think about how she felt. Well, maybe that's exactly what they could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I got some more skins too, so don't worry.\". The original Jessica said as she emptied the bag, our came a myriad of skins, men, women, teens, etc. Jessica had been busy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JESUS!

Tina asks now a little more than suspicious of Jessica's ideas. Jessica laughs, with the new Trish just having a shit eating grin on face, like she normally does when she finds something worth joking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, enough beating around the bush. On the surface, I still love David, but I want to try different forms of love. Like your parents, they agreed to let us trade places as long as they got new bodies of their own.\" Jessica explains while spinning the black pen around her fingers. \"They have new bodies, new lives, and, new attitudes towards each other. Don't worry, they still love each other. Just not as they used to \" she finishes, letting the Trish she sits on kiss her neck and collar bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what's with all these skins? The original Trish asks holding up a very slim looking skin with blue hair.  The group of girls now sorting through the piles of skins, organizing them by gender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I got your parent's new numbers and they agreed to join us.\" As if the devil himself had made it so, a young blonde, with the very definition of beauty appeared. She wore an athletic style of clothes showing of her legs, the bloomers hanging out of the skirt. It's tank top bursting with a very much developed bosom. Her body had weight to it, no, it had shapes, starting to fill in at all the right places. She was walking like A very dominant woman, as if she owned the place. Behind her was a goth. A tall, lanky boy. However a closer look revealed, he was scarred up. From his hands to his face, battle scars. Cuts, Piercing, tattoos, almost anything covered him. He wore a black set of jeans, scuffed at the knees, with a sleeveless top, for a Young Man, he had defined muscles and killer good looks. His mouth and left eye had cuts, but they added to his long hair ties back loosely, granting him a calming aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! Uh, Jessica? Real Jessica, we came as promised.\" The goth said, in the most concerned voice a boy could possibly have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie, come on. It's not like have just changed, look everyone is sitting there waiting for us. Let's get this party started and get some skins.\"  The Young girl says grabbing the boy's hands and leading him into the den. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right am Sadie Deluom and this is my boyfriend, Keith Harlow.\". She announces as the air of her changes into a young in love girl kissing on her boy friend.  The two of them start kissing again, this time it's a very passionate kiss, like they have known how to make this happen, or at least, have knowledge of what makes each other go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Paul, if you keep kissing me like this, this poor boy's penis will explode.\" . Keith says, smiling sweetly at Sadie as she giggles hugging him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wonder who would tease me like this Marie?\" Sadie asks as she is taken off the ground and on to Keith, who takes a seat on the sofa placing both feet down for Sadie to sit on her better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait mom? Dad? What the shit? Why?\" Claire says looking a lot more confused, Tina staring openly at the parents, now odd couple. Sadie's smile disappears, she takes a commanding figure and sits like the man of the house would, Keith changes into a womanly position, looking more sensitive and homely. Sadie sighs, she grabs Keith and hold his head on to her chest, letting the silence take a mintue to build before ending it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a long story, but as you know, we haven't been doing too good recently. We have been at each other's throats for a while. The trip was a way to see if we could love each other again, sadly it busted.\". Is all Paul says as the room is hit with the gravity of the situation. \"However, Jessica gave us a solution. She had us spend a day in each other's bodies. It solves the whole dilemma, wiped it off the face of the earth, but we had to spend it as other people each day.\". He takes our a flask, a very Paul thing to do and takes a large swig, wiping the remaining dribble off his mouth with his delicate arms. \"So we were lesbians, gays, young couples, older couples, and, many other people, before we realized, that we do love each other. It's just we aren't done having fun yet.\" Sadie smiles as she stashes the liquor away on her body. Keith let's a tear fall, before kissing Sadie hungrily. The two whispering about doing dirty deeds into their ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Enough. Jesus, I find out that my brother is really his girlfriend, my parents almost had a divorce, and, to solve it they became teenagers playing for the opposite teams.\". Tina says as she looks at the both of her parents. She lets out a sigh, resigning her self to Jessica's machinations, she looks over at Jessica to see the new Trish and Jessica fully making out. Claire is blushing madly, remembering the emotions and memories of being David, she slips the suit back on, looking at her rising member, you grab Jessica's skin to follow suit. Your phone rings, a text from David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Am going to stay here tonight!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs all it says, before shutting it down, you fully put on the skin of Jessica, as she and her new girlfriend put on Paul and Marie. Trish grabs a few different skins, resuming Claire's identity and wonders out of the house, smiling as Gavin calls her out on a date. The house goes silent. As Tine dressed as Jessica, mounts Claire, dressed as David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie and Keith are gone in the morning, well the real Paul and Marie Anderson are, their copies, filled with fake jessicas are here holding down the fort. Claire and Tina are having round two on the table, while the real Trish and Jessica are having fun as two real lesbians, a wet dream for both David and Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\". Trish says as Jessica rises from the sheets, kissing her aggressively. \"I didn't think you were that fucking kinky.\". Trish relents between sweet pecks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, am normally not this <i>adventurous</i>, but seeing as we are dating behind my boyfriend's back, I decided why not?\" Jessica says, driving a penis, sticking out from her vagina into Trish. Trish screams into the basement living quarters, alerting the whole house. As the rooms in the house are filled with list and sweat, the front door opens to a very pretty Tina, hugging both of her parents, she goes into her room to change into cleaner clothes. The house, now aware of the changes in their domain, gather to resume to act of the Anderson family with amazingly familiar filling.</span></div></div>",

Your new feminine body grinded against David, or rather, Jessica's clone wearing a copy of your skin.  In your own defence, you were actually David wearing a copy of Jessica's skin wearing her little sister Katie's skin.  Somehow, in this little twist scenario, your identities were the last and least complicated matter here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out Katie was actually a virgin; that cute little sister with curly brunette hair had been too engrossed with her studies to bother getting laid.  Well, it looks like that's no longer an issue, you thought to yourself as you lay exhausted next to David.  There was an unusual moment when you had started squealing \"stop stop!\" from the pain of your hymen being penetrated and David had actually stopped but that was now at the back of your mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Jessica-clone was doing her best to act naturally as David.  In a sense, she was the real David now, complete with his consciousness and memories, she could and was acting exactly as you would have.

The pieces begin to come together.  There was something afoot here and you knew, in the back of your mind, that there had been something strange about those magical pens and how Jessica had revealed them to you.  You need to do a test.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand on one foot and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't come as that much of a surprise that the David clad Jessica-clone began doing exactly as you told him.  Nonetheless, you were still so shocked that you didn't even stop him from completing the entire pledge.  The puzzle was there and your mind had just pieced it all together.  There was some kind of failsafe built into the brown pen's clone creation mechanism: all the clones were subservient to the original person, even if they were wearing someone else's skin; you presumed as long as they knew it was the original.  But as a side effect, whoever wore cloned skins could also be controlled in this manner as well.  This is why you had gone along with Jessica's megalomaniac plans after she had told you and why this Jessica was completely under your control.  It also brought up a disturbing possibility in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was probably not who she claimed to be either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you need to do something to confirm this.  If there was someone wearing your girlfriend's skin, there's no way you could let them get away with it.  </span></div></div>",

Ajusting her uniform, she opened the door, only to be greeted by the new Officer stationed at the front, Emma. \"Yes, what is it Emma?\" Smiling sweetly, Emma clasped her hands together, inadvertantly pushing out her generous bosom for all to see. \"Sorry detective, but a boy is waiting for you in the lobby?\" Emma brought a fringer to her cheek in confusion. \"I told him to pass, dont worry i searched him, but he said he needed to speak to you directly, something urgent\" In a flash, Lopez got up a huge grin on her face, before practically running down the hall, yelling behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Emma! Get a report ready thi-\" Her words got cut as she turned into a skin, collapsing onto the floor, as a very horny Emma held the pen with one hand, and used the other to grope herself. \"Alright, shes ready!\" Jeremy proceeded to stroll out of the side office, wink at Emma, before grabbing the bundle that was Lopez and closing the door behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, you climed into your cruiser, wiping off any lipstick from your face. \"God Emma-\" you chuckled in your melodious voice, \"whoever you get with will be one lucky son of a bitch\". You ajusted the roughed up clothes of your new skin, the youthful detective as you looked into the mirror of the car, groping yourself before buttoning up the uniform correctly, tracing the features of her face, and feeling her smooth hair before sighing and getting to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin could be summerized as a basic bitch. She perfered to call herself...unique. It wasn't her fault she was born with a better life than others, she thought as she smiled down at her curvacious form, enjoying a nice tan by the poolside. Robin stood out in a crowd for how smooth and pale her skin was, along with her red hair topping of her head. She could be confused for being a nice, down to earth girl, but she was a bitch, making humiliating Jeremy at the store. Well, she was about to become his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Jeremy go about taking Robin?</span></div></div>",

Sometimes nearly getting caught or having to give up entirely. That was Jeremy's way, a brute Force way of doing things. He had some street smarts, but it wasn't very practical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy, that's not very good, let me show you how to really isolate your target!\" Your Lopez mind thinks while you bask it in the glory of getting use to her mind's way of hunting down Robin.<br>\r\nUnlike Jeremy, detective Maria Estella Lopez, a top grade official. She had access to people's information on the fly, graduated top of her class in every subject, easy on the eyes, and, in your \"expirence\" a very fun body to live in. Of course, this was after being her until she closed up her office, had a regular dinner, and, did her normal nightly rituals. Now in her bed, did Jeremy really get to know detective Lopez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, am never letting this whore go, she's way to good.\" You chuckled. You hands drenched in her bodily fluids. You meticulously lick her sexy fingers clean. It was an early morning Saturday, the perfect time to get some dirt on Robin. You climb out of bed, pulling Maria's personality out, begining her task of investigating Robin Delian. It took a long time, but just in her laptop alone, detective Lopez had quite the resume. Robin was the daughter of Samuel Delian and Jacqueline Delian. She was eighteen years old, had three new cars, spoiled rotten, single child, single in general. She went to local high school, was a social butterfly, to the upper parts of society. The family was living the very comfortable life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right baby, take it out and show me the goods.\" Lopez said aloud, her little trick of keeping her mind's concentration on the task. The pages were filling up nicely, you could write books on the family alone, and still have some pages to fill up. Her mom was staying at home, she graduated an architect, but only designs little houses and things on the side. She would hold gathering for the community in the local parks and donate her little creations to the city. While making appearances at the same gym Lopez used. They shared the same yoga class and martial arts instructor. while her dad, was well, this was little more than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't believe it.\" You mutter, feeling the smile on your face expand. He's the boss of your real dad. In his company, the Alton association. A huge company that builds helicopters and stuff, your dad unfortunately, is very low in the chain. But this guy has several different companies under his hand, all in different fields and places. It's not something illegal, but it is a lot of information to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I may have found several ways to investigate her, or better yet, to explore.\" You think aloud, now feeling both your personalities trembling with excitement. The idea originally wasn't this complicated, Jeremy just wanted to have a new skin, a sexy skin. But now, things are different. You have Lopez and Emma, who are a duo with skills essential to your desires. Robin Delian, a rich bitch with money who could be used as a hideout for you. Jessica and her circle, which reminded you to check in on the clones you left there. Finally, you thought about getting into the upper crust of society, or you could slum it up with some of the lower class Lopez normally goes after. Through her eyes, these pens would allow her do anything, get anywhere, nothing would be hidden from her. Maria's persona is very much entertaining the idea of infiltrating the upper class. Her body is actually turning its self on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A law abiding worker like me shouldn't be doing this.\" You say, your feminine hands exploring Lopez's body again. You take a pen and zap your self, Maria's skin shriveling and sliding off your fat body. Once again your Jeremy, sadly, your not as attractive as your detective skin, but you have a plan. Hitting your self with the pen, you get a copy of your self into the available skin. Maria Lopez returning to life, her motions resuming the pleasure seeking she sought before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo detective, get your ass ready, am going to step out real quick.\" You order, but she's sadly already moaning. Unable to resist, you walk over to her and start pounding her. Her body is tantalizing, her kisses are sweet, and she is all yours. You pass the afternoon having sex, making this flesh suit work it's magic, until Emma arrives, bringing much needed refreshments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************************<br>\r\n\"So Maria's pussy looks fucking amazing, how is it?\" Your Emma copy asks, playing with your Maria copy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fucking great. She's got what I need, but not what I want to do it with.\" You say sitting on the couch legs spread open, your dick still hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw well, I can help for now.\" Emma says as she lowers her self to your dick and begins to suck it clean. You grunt a bit, realizing how good the skin is at it. Her mouth and tonge making you finish real quick, she sucks it all up and swallows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also boss, tonight is ladies night for the group. Well, Emma and Maria have a circle they go with.\" Emma states, smacking lips. \"It's nothing big, but seven girls go together, I got some hot ones in there I can get.\" Emma says, twirling the pens in her hands. Making you think again. Yeah it's cool to get out as another hot babe, but you want to get Robin. It's not easy being the boss.</span></div></div>",

Always looking to fool yourself, you decided to play a little prank on your suit-clone. But you couldn't do it here. You carefully rolled up the deflated Jessica and David skins first. Then you restored Trish's body and clothed her before she woke back up. You made some measly excuse to left. Sneaking out of the backdoor, you took a few shortcuts to get to your house. Your parents weren't home, so this was the perfect time to try your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter locking the door to your room, you stripped out of your David clothes. Your erect organ was visibly enthralled by your narcissistic plot. A few minutes later, 'Jessica' appeared in your bedroom. You thought Trish's body felt great, but it was even more incredible to be your own girlfriend. You were reluctant to lose yourself in her memories, but you plan required it, so you shot yourself with the brown pen again. This time manifesting the complete memories, habits, and persona of your beautiful girlfriend. You could fool anyone in this disguise, even her own boyfriend. And that is exactly what you intended to try. You knew from restoring Trish that any restored suit would be dazed and gullible in the first few minutes after being restored, you might really succeed in your vain deluded plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubled-checked your new reflection in the mirror, taking a moment to fix some make-up and strip down to Jessica's panties and bra. When you were satisfied, you flashed a borrowed smile. You zipped up the empty David Anderson and crawled into bed with him, wrapping his re-inflatted arms around you as the big spoon. He moaned, groggy and confused, on the bed. You kissed him lightly on the lips. \"That was AMAZING Davy\" You teased. The new David looked at you for a moment...</span></div></div>",

When people are restored, the only gaps in their memory come from the time in which they were actually a lifeless bodysuit.  When David had been zapped, he had been you and therefore remembered everything you did up to that point.  He remembered Jessica showing him the Trish suit, wearing the Trish suit and pretending that you'd been absorbed into Trish's psyche before zapping her into a lifeless husk on her request.  The only thing he wouldn't remember were your disturbing but strangely arousing thoughts of becoming your own girlfriend and seducing yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pushed you aside.  Aside from his own suspicions and lack of memory of returning home, you had obviously overplayed your part.  Having Jessica's mannerisms and memories were one thing, using them effectively and flawlessly was another.  This was definitely a time when you had gone against her baser instincts and acted more like yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he demanded as he pinned you down on the bed, grabbing your arms roughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hurting me David,\" you gasped, your frightened doe like eyes surprising him.  Even if he knew you were a fake, that expression was enough to soften anyone's heart let alone her boyfriends.  Even if your narcissistic plot wasn't going along as you planned, you still felt smug that you could screw around so much with yourself.  His grip loosened and he sat back, content with simply pinning you down with his weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis softened expression hardened again.  \"I won't ask again.  Who are you and why are you wearing Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew how he was thinking.  He was you after all.  The first thought that you'd have is someone that you knew.  Jimmy would spring to mind but the most likely culprit was Trish, seeing as the last he'd seen of her was a crumpled mass of skin on Jessica's floor.  He was probably thinking that Trish had been restored some time during the night and that you had been zapped, that Trish had taken Jessica's place and was now screwing with you as payback for wearing her.  But that didn't make sense.  The last thing he remember was zapping himself with the brown pen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.  It couldn't be.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" you say as you reach up and caress yourself on the face.  \"Don't I make just the perfect girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid rolls back over onto the bed and moans; this is a lot to take in.  Finding out about all the pens and their magical power and then waking up from a 'coma' to find a copy of himself nestled within his girlfriend's skin was enough to make anyone's head explode.  Strangely though, he found himself aroused; the fact that his girlfriend was actually a skinsuit being worn by himself seemed amazing to him.  Jessica was perfect; her body was simply amazing and her personality was great too.  But he couldn't deny that he was a shameless narcissist.  Jessica's mind and body under the control of himself was beyond perfect.  His member stood to attention, a fact that didn't escape your notice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna do it?\" you climbed seductively onto your clone as he struggled with his emotions.  </span></div></div>",

Trish knew exactly what it was, and David's surprise caused her to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy lifted his head and withdrew his tongue, but you and Trish just raised yours until he was too high and had to release your lips. You remained with eyes closed taking deep breaths as your back and hips continued to sway up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Trish, do you remember what you said when I reached lower before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you do. Trish's memory of that had climbed to the forefront halfway through the kiss. David was appalled by finding out, but he was helplessly trapped under Trish's feelings. You then nodded at Jimmy and with eyes still closed formed a delicate smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me again what you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid shuttered to the excitement that ran through Trish as you began to speak in a soft, easy whisper still trying to catch your breath. \"I said never try to go there because you'll only get that if ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not that she thought Jimmy was a crazy degenerate. Well, she thought that, too, but she also had a crush on him - one she would never want to admit to her friends. Right now, though, she was more than ready to admit it to Jimmy as he kneeled there between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs hard as the David in you could, you tried to fight letting Trish's personality allow Jimmy to fuck you, or Trish for that matter, especially after what he'd done. However, Trish actually admired Jimmy's resourcefulness, and she wanted this just as much as you didn't. Unfortunately, you couldn't stop from answering truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David made you come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lascivious smile made you realize what he was about to do. You started to squirm, but the Trish in you turned into a sensuous invitation. However, you weren't going to give in that quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Trish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange. You sound like Trish. You look like Trish. You just confirmed that you know only what Trish and I know,\" he smirks as he moves closer so you feel his boner against your entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy! Please,\" you beg which comes out from Trish's voice like a purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just gives you that wicked Jimmy smile and replies, \"Oh, I definitely will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conflicting personalities just canceled each other out, and you lay anxious with desire and loathing. His first touch had you gasp and shiver. It was hard to tell if it was David trying to get away or Trish trembling with arousal. To Jimmy, it was a real turn-on, and he proceeded to drag his solid shaft between your nether lips. The sensation drove both personalities frantic. Jimmy could see this and gave a twisted laugh as he pushed forward to tease Trish's clit. At this point, the sensations made it impossible to stop him and you committed completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, babe. You're finally awake,\" Jimmy's voice greeted you as you opened your eyes. \"That was some session. We should do it again sometime. Or maybe reverse roles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you hated it, it was the most pleasure you had ever experienced. There's no way you would admit it to Jimmy, but he was a really good fuck. Of course, it probably had a lot to do with Trish knowing how to get the most out of any guy, and that's exactly what she had you do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna fuck Trish,\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, as much as I'd like to see you try to fuck yourself, <i>Trish</i>, ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a pillow and toss it at him. He dodges it as he twirls one of the pens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Admit that it was enjoyable fun. I could tell you really liked what happened earlier as well,\" he smirks caressing your Trish leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerk it away and say, \"That was when I didn't know it was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he says putting his hand on his heart. \"I'm hurt at that.\" Then he gives you an evil smile, \"But you did like it directly from me, too, didn't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I knew it. So much so you want to do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss another pillow then get up and will the skin to open.

She's not only good looking but very smart - almost genius smart, and she knows how to use that to her advantage. It's going to be very complicated convincing Jessica about all that happened. Even if she believes you, she's libel to be pretty upset and angry. No, the only real way is for you to put Claire on and look through her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much trepidation, you turn your sister's skin backward and proceed to step into it. Just like Trish, it is smooth and soothing as your foot then ankle glides into the warm skin. When your toes reach bottom, the sensation of being inside a suit changes to that of your real foot. You're careful to step into the other leg before pulling it up your calf because you know she's several inches shorter and it will be a tricky balance with one leg longer than the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin easily glides up your legs with a sensation of warm oil before that fades to just having normal legs under you. Well, as normal as having smooth-shaven, toned and tanned sexy legs with turquoise toenails, except the big ones have something on them. You bend down to see better. There's a star or one and what looks like a seashell on the other. Looking back to the first you realize that it's a starfish. You chuckle knowing how much Claire likes the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, you tuck in your penis and stretch the skin over your rump and waist. You man-parts go numb only to be replaced with sensing the lips of Claire's vagina. That brings back the memory of your orgasms as Trish, and you're distracted briefly as those thoughts cause your new vagina to grow warm and moist. Quickly you refocus to getting into the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlunging your hands into her arms has them fully functional, and you flex Claire's fingers making the blue nails with their white stripes look like waves across the ocean. You never realized how creative and thoughtful Claire could be. It's a whole other side of her that actually makes you admire her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the skin across your shoulders. A tingling moves up your spine as the suit seals itself. With a deep breath, you toss Claire's red curls over your head and pull the hood on. A few moments of black numbness follow before you can see and feel no suit at all. You're now completely physically your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to get the brown pen, you're stopped by your reflection in the mirror, Claire's reflection. You've seen your sister millions of times but never completely naked and never from her viewpoint of herself. She's very attractive and very sexy. You reach toward the mirror in disbelief. She's really hot, and you male mind is very turned on. It in turn turns on the hormones in your body. As you watch, the wrinkles around Claire's nipples disappear and they begin to protrude. Your crotch is warm and moist once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as your hand moves to cup one breast. It feels very nice to hold it up, and you run your thump down to the nipple.  The sensation causes you to take in a quick breath then just stand motionless for half a minute. Your eyes wander down to the reddish hair in her crotch. Yes, your sister is a true one hundred percent red-haired beauty. Your hand moves toward that making you again remember those earlier orgasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background you notice Jessica's skin which reminds you what Claire did with her. You need to find out why and if Claire has done anything to anyone else. Then you can put Jessica back, and this whole thing will be over. However, maybe you should just relax and enjoy this first. After all, it would serve Claire right and definitely make you feel better - much, much better.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here you are having been seduced by your sister wearing your girlfriend's skin then having her convince you to wear your best friend's skin while she ate you out, and all you think of is more sexual pleasure by playing with your sister's luscious body. There's more important issues here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned away to go get the pen, Claire's breasts bounced and beckoned your attention. Your hands instantly went to console and control them, but holding them just seemed to feel so good especially with those sensitive nipples shifting under your fingers. Straight ahead was Jessica's bed where you could tease them a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Control your sick, horny mind, David,\" you reprimanded yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's clothes were scattered where she, or rather Claire in Jessica's skin, had dropped them earlier. Looking around for her bra, you realized from the hold you had on Claire's boobs that Jessica and Claire weren't exactly the same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's clothes must be her somewhere,\" you muttered to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, your turned to look towards the closet where most likely Claire would have stashed them. The first thing you saw was a gorgeous, nude redhead sexily holding her ample breasts while staring at you over her shoulder in a sensuous pose. You stopped still and quickly felt very warm, aroused by the sight. It took a bit before you got control of yourself from the reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it! I can't believe my sister could have such an effect on me,\" you berated yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, when you let go to reach for the door knob, your eyes became entranced by Claire's nipples. They engaged you in a staring contest, and it took most of your will power - and three tries - to actually open the door and break the visage's hypnotic effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside on the floor were two piles of clothes. On top of the first was a t-shirt saying \"Don't Mess With Trish\" in the same style as with Texas. Trish could be quite a cowgirl at times and did have an affection for dressing up in boots and a stetson. A picture of her like that came to mind which was soon augmented by your earlier foray that put you thinking about becoming that image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez,\" you mumbled shaking your head. \"I guess it isn't just Claire. Maybe it's my subconscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments you shivered at the thought and looked back to the other pile. It was much more feminine and typical Claire, so you bent down to get the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistake. Let loose, your girls swung forward. Not enough to affect your balance much, but they did send sensations to your head that they were there needing to be cradled. Throwing your arm across the two stopped their flight but highlighted the new feeling that as a male you never had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly, you sifted the pile and pulled out her bra. It was light beige and sheer and went on easily. You wondered why stories of guys with bras always make a big deal about not being able to hook one behind them. It really wasn't a problem. The material felt nice against Claire's breasts on your chest as well as eliminating most of the pull of just being there. Looking down you noticed the color was a perfect match to her tan so it wouldn't be noticed. What would be noticed, though, were the nipples clearly poking out, probably due to your own arousal from all this, and you almost tried pushing them back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing your thoughts to the task at hand, you picked up what must be her panties although they looked more like small, silk pink boxers. The only other items were a pair of jean shorts and a v-neck pink blouse, so you pulled the panties on. The material seemed to flow up Claire's sleek, toned legs with a sensuous tingle. They fit firm to your rear and across your crotch. As you reached to get the shorts, the satin gently shifted with a slight tickling of your skin augmenting the sensations from your breasts as they jostled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if girls are as distracted when they have on guy's clothes if they're in a guy's body?</i> you wonder as your pull up the shorts then drop the pink blouse over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the closet door, you admire yourself as Claire reflected in the mirror. Other than the mussed up red hair, you looked perfectly Claire and very attractive. In fact, the hair seemed to give you a sexy, just-fucked look. You pouted your lips and blew yourself a kiss, then hefted your breasts with your hands while trying for a naughty-girl look. That warm feeling again rose through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\" you blurted and turned away before you got lost in turning your sister into a porn star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the brown pen, you took a deep breath, steeled yourself, and pushed the trigger as it was pointed towards you. As Claire's memories flow in, you ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't know what crazy plan you had even if Jessica DID wear Claire.<br>\r\nWhat are you gonna' do? Fuck your little sister? You're starting to think this whole skin thing is driving you mad. <br>\r\nYou notice Jessica giggling and flicking her gaze down often, you follow and notice your member rock hard, throbbing even.<br>\r\nAfter a while the feeling in your cock went away, probably from all the action you just got even if it was in someone else's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Davie, suit up!\" Jessica says as you catch Claire's skin. It feels warm and moist, just like Trish and Jessica's did. <br>\r\nPerverse thoughts run through your mind as you stare at Claire's deflated face, her lips open due to her jaw being slack, eyeholes empty.<br>\r\nA warm feeling permeates around your nether regions and you feel a dampness emerge, pre-cum wetting your head.<br>\r\nJessica's face turns red as she laughs at you, covering her mouth with one hand, the other around her bust.<br>\r\nYou simply shake your head and narrow your eyes at her, holding Claire's skin up in the air by a handful of red hair.<br>\r\nLooking up and down Claire's deflated form, she's a sight for sore eyes. Her red hair contrasts her pale yet lithe complexion with a natural grace.<br>\r\nYou have no idea where her redheadedness came from since you don't know anyone in your family with red hair or such a pale complexion.<br>\r\nMaybe she's adopted, you never know. You snap out of your train of thought as Jessica taps you on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, stop staring at it and put the damn thing on!\" She's anxious and impatient, the norm really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay! Jeez.\" You reply, ripping the opening in the skin apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside is hot, as you push one leg into it you feel the hot air gently rise out of the opening along your calve.<br>\r\nYour leg slides into Claire's as if it was oiled, and a strange sensation runs up your leg. You feel a plethora of small sensations all at once, but your brain can only pick out the most dominant of them. Your toes snap and crack, going numb as they shrink into Claire's, you feel your muscles writhe about like snakes under your skin, spasming until they assume the correct form and then they tighten like mad, before relaxing. Soon after, a tingling runs up your leg quickly, you regain feeling up until the middle of your thigh, where the skin hangs loose in your fingers. The sight is incredible, yet it seems like something that shouldn't ever occur in nature.<br>\r\nClaire's leg is small and poised, smoothly shaven, as your travel up the leg it widens tremendously into a masculine thigh, slightly hairy but muscular.<br>\r\nJessica is on her phone texting as she waits for you to \"dress\", but you admire this strange sight for a few second.<br>\r\nAs you pull the skin up your thigh slowly, it seems to stretch from a point in your thigh before you touch it against your own skin.<br>\r\nThe same sensation as before occurs but on a smaller area, you feel like you're wearing extremely tight stockings for a few seconds, until the sensation disappears altogether, becoming natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah..\" you mutter, slowly continuing, but this time not stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch Claire's leg down and instantly you stand awkwardly, Claire's legs are shorter than yours and this forces you to lean on her foot.<br>\r\nClaire's leg muscles clench as they easily support your weight however, she's athletic and participates in Track events.<br>\r\nYou lower the rest of the skin as you use your left hand to stretch the opening wider and stick your other leg in.<br>\r\nFollowing the other leg, you push it through. Your normal height resumes as both your legs are the same length.<br>\r\nYou're hesitant to don the rest of the suit however, you're slightly perturbed by the thought of having Claire's sweet little cunt, her tight abs and her luscious tits..<br>\r\nWoah, hold up man. What are you thinking? This is your sister. Quit it with the Game of Thrones shit.<br>\r\nYou resolve to complete the transformation and pull the skin upwards, instantly you feel your cock dissolve in a sea of numb sensation.<br>\r\nMomentarily a bulge appears and then flattens as soon as it formed, you feel muscle swim around under your skin again, tightening and loosening in certain places around and in your crotch. Flesh fills your thighs and crotch as Claire's thighs tighten, her pussy forming inbetween her very own legs.<br>\r\nYou lean over and catch a glimps of her labia sprouting like a flower from inbetween a mess of morphing flesh, a clitoris following soon after.<br>\r\nClaire is absolutely hairless down there as well and you simply smirk. You shove your arms into Claire's and they shrink immediately, you feel muscles swim up your arms like fish up a river and then tighten like ropes. Flexing your fingers you shrug the skin up your shoulders, then assisting it by using said fingers to stretch Claire's chest over your own. The sensations hit you like a storm. As the skin binds to yours it almost crushes your torso, you feel your chest shrink and then mold into a feminine shape, your ribs crackling as they appear under your small arms. Your abs tighten as your stomach sucks in, your hips widen and your ass perks out, flesh filling it in a strange like, similar to a water being forced into a balloon, but whilst in a washing machine. <br>\r\nYou feel a warm damp liquid trickle down your right thigh and notice that your pussy is pink. All these feelings are turning you on.<br>\r\nYou're almost finished, you stretch the skin up further as you feel the same sensation that happened to your ass occurs on your chest.<br>\r\nAs you rub your shoulders, you literally see Claire's tits rise like bread in an oven. Flesh fills them up and then they pop out, pink nipples completing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" You're aghast as you immediately fondle your tits, but you feel a soreness. \"Ow! Sensitive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Jessica staring at you the meanwhile, her phone in one hand. Turning around to her, Claire's head flaps like a reverse hoodie over your new tits.<br>\r\nYou wink at Jessica and then stuff your head up Claire's neck, filling out her own head. You grip a handful of hair in one hand, and Claire's neck in the other and pull.<br>\r\nThis stretches Claire's face over yours and it instantly binds, you feels your facial muscles and fat shrink and morph, producing a more slender jawline rather than your rigid one. Completing the finishing touches, you massage Claire's face on and you realize that the opening at the back is completely gone, but it still feels like it's there, slightly cooler than the rest of your body in a line going down your back. You gather up Claire's red locks and throw them over her shoulder, looking down at her moderately sized breasts. Bouncing them in your hands you look at Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jess, get the pen.\" You say, but it comes out in Claire's high feminine tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica seems almost surprised but promptly zaps you with the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain your focus and you see Jessica staring at you in angst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?! What happened?\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's memories are all fragmented, I don't understand..\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do you mean \"fragmented\"?\" Jessica asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize it, and your face contorts into an expression of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire was being worn, but how? There's no extra skin inside her.\" you say as you pat your ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to suddenly see Jessica right up in your face, she grabs your shoulders and stabs you in the gut with the black pen, a grin plastered over her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show's over kid.\" Jessica mutters coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel an electric shock run through your abs and all over your body, before your consciousness is cut like a power cord being unplugged.</span></div></div>",

You're right. The way you dove into Trish might mean you're too weak mentally to handle Claire,\" she teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny. We'll see if you can control a genius IQ kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what Claire is - very intelligent. She could skip grades but is too smart to do that. However, she does take advance courses and is always reading and checking out college level books in the library. Plus she can beat your ass in computer games and has even programmed a few amazing patches herself. It gives you pause that maybe you should just re-inflate Claire and interrogate her instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping a t-shirt over her head before climbing out from under the covers, Jessica takes the Claire skin into the bathroom that goes between her and her sister's, Katie's, room. You stare at the door after it closes keeping the vision of her long legs and part of her ass cheeks swinging below the t-shirt. You hope this works without a hitch. At least putting on the skin should be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passes, you begin to worry. You wonder if you should tie her up before using the brown pen, but you put that aside when you realize how much bigger you are than Claire. If anything could happen, it might be that Claire has some ninja mind control ability she's gained through all her research. That always works like hypnosis when the victim looks deep into someone's eyes. You make a mental note to avoid her eyes. You can picture them now - their greenish tinge, how they sparkle when she's happy, how they seem to glow when she's upset until you cave and she gets her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. I'm ready,\" Claire's voice surprises you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spin and find yourself staring into those big green orbs. They seem to engulf you causing a shriek to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gees, Davie. What's your problem?\" Claire asks very annoyed, her eyes starting to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you cover your eyes and turn away. <i>Is it too late? Am I still in control?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, snap out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly turning and peaking between your fingers, you see her in a very unlike Claire stance wearing Jessica's t-shirt. It now comes down to her knobby knees and no longer has large breasts pushing it out, but smaller ones that you can still clearly see the nipples staring at you. Claire's red curls appear to you as a fiery halo, her eyes as green lasers, but it's her expression of \"you idiot\" that has you drop your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, um, ha,\" you sputter trying to act like it was your joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just rolls her eyes and hands you the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to light up the brain cells and find out the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, you point the brown pen at her. You're not really comfortable with this, but figure a skin shouldn't be able to override a real mind. So you ease your thumb down on the button, feel the thing spark, and wait.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm fine,\" she softly replies. \"Just a lot in here,\" she adds as she lies back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Now be quiet and let me think.\" She pats the bed, and you crawl up beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's several minutes that she stares at the ceiling. You initially figure she must be looking through Claire's memories to see what happened before she explains to you, so you remain quiet and wait. However, the longer it takes, the more concerned you become that Jessica's mind is trapped by some malware in Claire's brain that has frozen her into an infinite do-loop. You're just about to speak when she starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems I, ... er, she was just interested in experimenting with the pens, being older and experiencing life from a different perspective. It seems almost mundane considering how evil you thought it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's head turns to face you. She smiles, and her eyes sparkle bright as you gaze at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, she, ah, wanted to, ... um ... It's hard to describe in third person,\" she says turning on her side to face you. \"It's weird, but just hold me, and let me speak as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to give her your support, you slip your arm under your sister's small body as she moves against you. Her slender body feels almost bony and cool as you hold her, so you move close to keep her warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was poking in the attic through the old stuff up there when I came across these pens. It took some deep research to find out about them, but I easily hacked through the government's security. It was then that Katie called to have me over. As I walked here, I was wondering how to try these out. It just so happened that Jessica was in her room with her back to me, so I zapped her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles warmly, her braces showing. It makes you feel good but awkward, although you smile back giving her a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggles closer, and you're happy to pull her in. It's a bit bizarre holding you sister like this and even stranger when she gives you a peck on the lips before continuing, but believing it's just Jessica channeling to you, you relax and let her continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just going to try her on for a bit to see what would happen, but as I put my little legs into her long toned ones, it just felt so good. I just stared as they filled out so long and shapely. The healthy color, and her toes painted so well. I ran my hands over them and felt not just how smooth and taut they were, but I felt my hand on them as if they were really mine. The sensation was electric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Jessica's sexy legs had your blood warming. That vision as she went into the bathroom filled your thoughts, and you imagined how they were now just hidden away inside your sister's skin. It all aroused you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I pulled the torso up, my tummy felt so strong and athletic, and suddenly I had real breasts. These little mounds had grown up by themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emphasized this pushing her chest against you before taking your free hand and placing it on her chest. Although her boob was rather small, you could feel a large nipple in your palm. If she hadn't been holding your hand in place, you would have pulled it back; but with those green eyes sparkling so and her smiling, you cupped it tenderly and relaxed. Well, most of you relaxed as your crotch continued to tense up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I shouldn't have, but I wanted to check out both pens, so I finished putting on her head. It was so amazing to see her beautiful face in the mirror with the golden hair and know it was on me. Then looking down at such a perfect body. The glowing bronze skin that transitions so magically to the pale of the perky breasts topped with those magnificent areolas and the nipples projecting out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, you found yourself gently massaging Claire's mound through the thin cotton of the shirt, feeling the crinkly skin tighten and the nipples push stronger into your palm. Your manhood was stiffening as she continued to describe your girlfriend in such erotic terms. In the back of your mind, it seemed strange for Jessica to be doing this, but then she is using Claire's mind and body to turn you on, and it was working.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I zapped her and was planning to sneak out and restore them when you came over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you very lovingly for a bit then leans forward and kisses you. You close your eyes involuntarily and join in. Her mouth gradually opens and her tongue briefly runs over your teeth. You taste the orange citrus of her lip gloss as you brush your tongue in and over her braces. It's a shock but she withdraws before you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you were here, you know what happened,\" she growls seductively indicating those encounters. She paused just briefly, enough to show a feral grin, before attacking your mouth more aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too entranced to object. Her words brought back those memories of the pleasure you two shared. Well, actually, you guess it was with Claire - which, actually, <i>is</i> you two. Instead of a turn off about making out with your younger sister, you found yourself very aroused, tonguing her with abandon as you crushed her against you, your hand slipping all over the t-shirt trying to reach her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple minutes, she rolled on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just close you eyes and dream, Johnny,\" Claire instructed as she straddled you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer small legs barely kept her above your erection, her heat almost singeing the tip. Too aroused to worry or think clearly, you just lay there as she lowered herself enough for you to poke something hard before she groaned and withdrew. Again, and she pulled back. Finally she crashed down with a sharp scream followed by her moaning as you quickly synchronized with her rhythm. Within moments she cried out in pleasure but kept going. In another minute, you joined her second cries with ecstatic grunts of your own until she collapsed on top of you. It was so good that the realization that you had just taken your sister's virginity flashed too briefly to register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour of spooning later, you heard her soft breathing of sleep. Gently you pulled away to use the bathroom. When you closed the door and turned around you saw what had to be a skin in the bathtub. Pulling it out, you saw that it was ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could you ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Ah. Ah.\" She wags the pen at you. \"Don't try anything, or things could get much worse. These pens aren't as simple as they seem,\" she threatens pointing the pen at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop and glare at her. You want to rush her but have no idea what will happen if she shoots you with the brown pen. You know if she used the black pen, you'd be just used like she did Jessica and if you were wearing a skin that the brown would give you the skin's memories. You did use the brown one on her, but she didn't seem to be affected.

At first you think it's just the Trish skin, but you can tell this one is different. Being red hair, it can only be one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to be you? Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, David. if you really want to know that, then you better put on this one.\" She tosses the skin to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there with both skins looking back and forth at each. Neither do you want to wear. You only put on Trish at the suggestion from who you thought was your girlfriend. Wearing Jessica is very tempting if it wasn't for this situation. Wearing you sister is still very creepy especially if you get all her memories including all the teasing and pranks you've done to her over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not just tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles, \"Where's the fun in that? Maybe what you really want is to wear Trish and have Jessica eat you out again. I know you really liked that so you really want to do it again.\" She laughs then adds, \"We can do that if you'd prefer. You can be any girl you want. What girl do you prefer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a girl. I just want to know what's going on and why,\" you shout in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I would suggest you pt on the one I just gave you and hurry up about it. Otherwise, I'll just have to make you one of them and let them wear you for some fun and games. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not going to win this no matter what. Perhaps you should just put on the skin Claire just gave you of her. That way you'd get all the details of what she's done and find out the truth rather than the story she told you earlier. However, it might be better just to wear Jessica so you can keep your sister from doing anything more with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she asks giving your her sweetest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skins hang loosely as you look them over. If this will protect Jessica, then you have to do it. But what if it doesn't? What if Claire has something else planned? You need to know. Maybe you should take your chance and try to get the pens away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's running out. It will be much worse - for both of you - if you don't suit up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no way you were going to subject your girlfriend to any more of this. You're just glad that your sister hadn't done anything more to her. You didn't really want to get into your sister and her mind either, but there was little choice. If you didn't, Claire would probably zap you and do who-knows-what to Jessica and your friends while pretending to be you. At least this way you should be able to find out everything even if it might be more about things other than the pens that you'd really not want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you gently lay Jessica over the side of the tub then turn the Claire skin around to the opening. You glance up at Claire watching you. She gives you a sweet smile and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice. She's much better for you. You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shake your head disbelieving and turn back to the skin as she laughs. It's not a laugh you'd place as being Claire's, but then there's a lot of things this afternoon that don't seem to be your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin goes on just like Trish's only this time you don't take as much time marveling at the sensation. Still it does feel quite amazing, tantalizing even. It seems meant to be so pleasurable that you can't stop yourself. Warm, soft, smooth, and tingly. It makes it like there's no transition and that you end up feeling it as your own, comfortable being the skin. Of course, that's what it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an ache as you get it over your waist and then the tug of the breasts becoming your own when you reach the shoulders. You don't pay any attention until you have the hood on and you're completely Claire. That's when you notice the pain in your crotch. Looking down you see blood smears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the ...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Honey. That's what happens when you lose your virginity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit!</i> You hadn't thought about that, but now the way Claire pushed a couple times then rammed herself on with a cry made perfect sense. It made you feel awful that you had popped your sister's cherry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you looked over at Claire's crotch. It wasn't bloody, and you were about to ask why when Claire continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good thing is that you're about to know how great it felt afterward and won't really care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you felt the sting of the brown pen, and your mind began swimming with being Claire. Again like what happened with Trish, you felt yourself overcome with being your sister. The pleasure of the sex you just had with your brother is in the forefront being so recent. You felt yourself sigh contentedly and move your hands up to hold your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He was a good fuck alright. Makes you want to have another go, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but agree, but you stay quiet in your thoughts as you move backwards in them wondering how you got on your brother in the first place. What you recall is cuddling with him while you told him about zapping Jessica and Trish with some pens. However, you don't remember that directly. In fact, your last memory before being here on Jessica's bed as Claire was going to bed at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem a bit confused, Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Claire? Wait, I remember being David coming over to Jessica's and she showing me the pens and then wearing Trish,</i> you think. The orgasms as Trish come back with a nice shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,... I'm really David,\" you say gaining more confidence as you go. \"I'm wearing Claire's skin.\" You took down at your body causing your red curls to fall forward into view. You spin and see your reflection except it is Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's almost right, but you're actually wearing a copy of Claire's skin - the one her brother, David, fucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I don't understand. And I don't have any memories before I cuddled with, ... I mean Claire - you? - cuddled here, at least since last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that would be correct. When David zapped who he thought was Jessica wearing this skin, it just created a duplicate on top of and of the top skin because I already had Claire's memories. So that skin, the one you're in, started 'recording,' shall we say, at that point from where the first skin got made. It's also why you lost your virginity, but Claire, here on me, has not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. But how did you get away from Jessica? I thought you said this skin was better to understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>is</i> better. Think. Use Claire's memories to find what she thinks about her brother, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that. I want to ...\" You stop as her words triggered Claire's thoughts and memories about her brother.  \"She - she has a crush on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true. Claire has always admired you and considered you her hero. She's buried her feelings because she knows it's not right, but she's wished for some way that she could change that. She was jealous of Jessica and would do anything if she could switch with her. You guess whoever is wearing her is perverted enough to act out Claire's fantasies of being Jessica and then seducing you as Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't explain who or what you are.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you make contact, there's a flash, but you keep going without any effect from it. This sends the two of you and the skins tumbling into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you doing, Johnny?\" Claire's muffled voice calls from under the skins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to scoop up Claire by wrapping your arms around the skins, but she squirms up no matter how tight you hug them. She kicks hard into the skins which protect you from her blows. Rolling over with her, you manage to end up banging her into a wall. That stops her briefly, and you see the pens behind you on the floor where she must have dropped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, you bitch. Stop struggling and tell me why you're doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well why, Johnny. And you know this won't end here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you're propelled backwards as she manages to curl her legs and push you away with her feet. Fortunately, you roll over a pen and pick it up before untangling yourself from the skins and jumping up to point it at her. Unfortunately, she springs up at the same time holding the other pen, leaving you in a Mexican standoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop it, Johnny, or I'll skin you with this pen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must be bluffing. She has the brown pen that didn't seem to affect her earlier. You know the black one in your hand will easily stop her by turning her into a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're confused on who has the baddest pen here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. So, shall we shoot each other like at the Carnival in Rio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you just staying in character for some reason?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What character? Do you think this is one of those Interactives on Writing.Com where my butt will expand and I'll shrink to Barbie size? Those things don't really happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like high-tech pens that turn people into skin suits sort of thing, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, besides that. You're acting crazy, Claire. Get to your senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy senses? MY SENSES? Don't you remember how you acted that night in Minneapolis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good try, but you never were a good liar. You can't possibly have forgotten what we did on the train from Dunedin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, under the clock in Cambridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're thirty-third birthday celebration at Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only seventeen, Claire, and you're only sixteen. Is that how you came up with thirty-three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit trying to confuse me by pretending we're just teenagers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We <i>are</i> just teenagers. We go to high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have brain-washed you somehow to mask those memories. What's the safe word?\" she ponders the last to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no safe word. There was no brain-washing, at least not of me. Maybe it's that new shampoo you bought online.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serendipity? ... No? ... Kinkajou?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her like she's gone nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim Buck Three? ... Randolph Walter Edison? ... Edward Rice Chex Borrows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Claire. If you don't shut up I'm going to blast you until the cows come home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cows. Right. Purple cows. What's that poem? I never saw a purple ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ranting is driving you bonkers. Maybe that's her trick to confuse you.

What did the agency do to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What agency, and why do you keep calling me Johnny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat does shut her up, and she stares at you intently before looking very concerned which gradually turns more to fear then regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery slowly she mumbles, \"Oh - crap.\" Her arm relaxes and lowers to her side. \"I think I might have really fucked up again.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her face looks a little downcast but you can tell that she's actually enjoying this somewhat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who are you?\" you ask, trying to put on a strong demeanor but Katie's young voice and girlish mannerisms completely derail that attempt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't figured it out yet Jimmy boy?\"  Katie's face twists into a devious grin as she giggles uncharacteristically at you.  There's something about that grin that you recognise....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy?!?!?\"  You asked incredulously.  Jimmy has been your best friend since kindergarten but is also a major prankster.  He doesn't stop at any chance to prank his friends and strangers alike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy explained what had lead up to this unlikely set of events as Katie's deflated head dangled from his neck pitifully.  It was a disturbing sight, from the neck down he was an exact copy of Jessica's younger sister but north of that sat your friend's grinning male face.  He explained how he had found the pens on his desk this morning and had come over to zap and replace Jessica to prank you.  However, as he had been climbing into your girlfriend's skin, Katie had walked into room.  Although surprised, Jimmy managed to convince her to go along with it and made a copy of her body so that he could replace Katie while Katie impersonated Jessica.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't explain Katie's lack of memories...\"  you ponder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that.\"  Jimmy pulls out another pen from Katie's pocket, one with a white button.  He tells you that this one can modify memories and he used it on Katie so that it'd be harder for anyone to figure out why there were two Katies running around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a small hole in his explanation though... you realise that if this really was the case, why would Jimmy have revealed himself so easily when exposed?  Jimmy slips his head back into the skin and seals it up and soon there are two identical, but not identically dressed Katies in the room with a Jessica and Trish skin on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You recall her giving envious looks to Trish and to Katie, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Jessica's mom wants to be Jessica permanently!  She's divorced and hasn't remarried, and Jessica's dad is on polite terms with her but wouldn't miss her if she vanished. It seems clear that she wants to be younger and has the hots for you, and zapping Jessica, putting her on, and zapping her new self to get Jessica's persona and memories would have given her just what she wants. Turning Trish into a suit and having you wear her seems to fit in with her wants as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?  Wearing her mom and zapping the new you with the brown \"pen\" would let you know what she's been up to, provide a flawless masquerade, and give you an opportunity to put things right.

Jessica and Trish will have a gap in their lives when you make them back into girls instead of girl suits, and maybe as Mrs. Hunt you'll be better able to comfort them and explain things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you'll just want to wear them.

A sigh of relief escapes your mouth and you get out of living suit. Those last thoughts didn't even make any damn sense! How would putting on Jessica's skin over her mother's allow you to be with you? It is pretty obvious that those masking personalities are perfect. They make you completely into that person without any consideration of who the wearer is.

Absentminded you scratch an itch on your back. Startled you realize that there is something on your back! Frightened, you march up to the mirror and try to catch a glimpse. It looks like that weird zipper the suits have. You try to widen it and it works, so you continue to pull that suit off you. It looks like a suit off you! Now that is something. A frown appears on your face. Is there a limit to the number of suits it can generate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity gets, again, the better of you and you repeatedly use the pen and get the suit off. After the fifth suit you stop. Maybe there is a limit but you are getting bored. Holding one of your own skins in your hands you zip it shut. Suddenly it gets very heavy and starts to fill out. You let it drop to the floor were it lets off a groan. Panic starts to well up in you. Did you just clone yourself? What will it, eh he, do when he wakes up. You grab the pens not wanting to take chances. It takes your copy a couple of minutes to regain consciousness. He gets up and stares at you slack jawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you me?\" you ask slowly and instantly smack yourself. Of course he is you! You just made him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye, i guess so. Weird. I remember me shooting myself thrice with the brown pen.\" He looks around. \"But it is kinda obvious that it was more often. Guess it means i am one of suits zipped up ye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a taken aback by the cold logic of the clone.\"Should that not freak you out? I don't think that I would take it so well. And you ARE me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you say it. I think I should be startled but it seems... right to know that I am not the real one. Maybe it is done so that It is always clear who the original is? At least that would make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving the fake, you start to nod. He has all your mannerism, well at least all those others like Trish or Jessica pointed out you had (Maybe you should take care of them?). And he sounds like you, though the voice sounds weird. Well it should sound weird because your own voice is always slightly off when you hear it from another source. But aside from the strange reaction to his existence he seems very much you. It would also instantly clear up who the real one is if the any clone is both very much aware that he is one and totally okay with it. A thought occurs to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump up,\" you say and without hesitation he does just that.\"Wicked! Seems like you have to do everything I tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh. I thought that was obvious. What good would it do if I run around and make our lives miserable? Kinda shitty feature in a disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that you feel like smacking yourself again. Without the excitement of the situation you would probably come to the same conclusion but being told by yourself is very uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will you do now?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to go home. You know we still got stuff to do before this whole mess started.\" He does not seem thrilled to do your homework for the weekend. Just like you are not very keen on doing it. Without any commands he would probably be able to be a great stand in. You are pulled out of your reverie when he starts talking again. \"Or do you have some idea? It's not like I can't wait to do homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that you go in deep thought!</span></div></div>",

In some little corner of your mind there is this voice, however, telling you that there is no reason to hurry. You rub your temple and banish that particular train of thought. Your clone could handle Mrs Hunt though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about her brings you back to the strange experience of being her. It was not at all unpleasant, which is probably the scariest thing about the whole thing. Now that you think about it, you could even make her desire come true in a twisted way. What to do...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Her obsession in having you and being with you was powerful enough for her to take away her daughter's life and leave you deeply disturbed. But now, with the help of the brown pen, her desire can easily be full-filled. Well in a way. Actually no, it would be your or your clones desire by that point. But that's just arguing semantics at this point. The idea starts to really grow on you. You look at your clone, who still seems to contemplate, silently, who he would like be. You know that he has the same opinion of Mrs Hunt: That she is a damn MILF and, that part is new, that she would like to do nothing more than fuck David Anderson. Your mouth turns into a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning?\" The fake you asks, as soon as he looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle's wish to fuck David can come true with the two of us.\" You don't add anything. He is you after all and thus able to understand without any longer explanations. And looking at his boner it is clear that he arrived at the conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has it really bad for us. Damn that could be fun. For either of us. And no one will know it, too! At least as long we don't tell anyone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes at last statement.\"So it only leaves us with figuring out who will turn into the lady for this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with either.\" David-2 states comfortably. No surprises on that front. You are okay with being yourself or turning into the hot mom, too. While it is tempting to have sex as a woman it is offset by the fact that Michelle is a bit out there in terms of sanity. Just because you think the idea is too kinky to pass up does not mean you are not still a bit creeped out by those bits of memory you still have from her.</span></div></div>",

Your boner disappears into the suit and the feeling with it. Kinda scary, really. Shortly afterward you look at your hands, now well manicured. They are so very delicate and nearly without thinking you touch your new sex. You shudder from the not quite familiar feeling but stop there. No use stalling. The face part is quickly pulled over your own and within moments you feel no part of your old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finally done?\" The fake asks. He looks quite impatient and very horny. But you can't see yourself having sex with him. Not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long sigh you motion to the brown pen: \"Use it on me, please.\" Without hesitation your copy picks up the device trains it on you and pushes the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam hits you. Like the oddest d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all the memories come back: Marriage, pregnancies, divorce and everything after like you never lost them. And with those comes the everything else. The thought of taking Jessica's life makes your skin crawl just as much as it did the first time. You start to have doubts about your plan when suddenly you understand. It's not trying to change you. It is trying to envelop you, so that you can act like you look. Fighting it will accomplish nothing if you want to wear it. Now that you think about it, you did not fight the Trish personality and it was easy to fall into her habits. Yet here you are attempting to be Michelle Hunt while fighting her inner self. Genius. With that revelation you stop struggling and within moments you calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes -didn't even realized you closed them- and look around with a smile. Now it s just like being Trish, you feel like you are Michelle but can still act like your original self just by concentrating. Really there was no point in freaking out like that. You look at the fake, well at David, there is no other so its pointless to make that mental separation. Especially now that you have all kinds of naughty thoughts about him. It's not like David suddenly turned into the most desirable human being on the face of earth. You just seem to appreciate much more what he has. The flat stomach, nice hair, no flabby parts. Sure he would look better if he would do more sports but he is still in nice shape and on top of that you like -well Michelle likes but it is really stupid to make THAT distinction now, isn't it?- how he treats Jessica. You would so enjoy that. And now you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to him, still naked, you seize David and kiss him. He first stiffens, completely surprised, before he relaxes and starts to kiss you back. You enjoy playing with his tongue but everything has to end and the kiss ends. He has still so much to learn, when it comes to kissing, and now, as Michelle, you can teach him just that. Come to think of it you know that he also has not got all that much experience in bed. Another thing to rectify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hand on his chest and say: \"Let's take this to my bedroom. Go ahead I need to take care of something first.\" He only nods as a response, still a bit dazed, and walks off. With him gone you look for the first David skin you made. You take it and the clothes you originally arrived here and get out of the room. Quickly you zip it up and wait for this other David to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as his eyes open you start: \"Please put on some clothes. I know you are not the real one but could you do me a favor?\" Without waiting for him to reply you continue: \"Take the black pen and make yourself comfortable at the TV. If someone comes in zap him. You can of course sleep if you get tired but please don't go into my or Jessica's room.\" You can see that he understands that you are not the real one, being naked and all, but that doesn't matter. Despite phrasing your orders as questions you are sure that he will do them regardless<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, right, of course Mrs Hunt. Anything else?\" He asks despite himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he says it, you can think of something else but decide against it. One David is more than enough for now, so you shake your head and he walks off. He probably will think about what's going on but you don't really care. He won't do something to stop you and he has to do what you say even if he does not realize that. With that you walk into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't told him a thing.\" David, the other one, observes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. I just wanted someone to make sure we are not disturbed. Maybe Katie decides to come home all of a sudden and I don't want a screaming teen making everything even more complicated,\" you explain. \"Now lets have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open a drawer and take out the lube in there. With that you push David onto your bed and kneel before him. You distribute the lube evenly on both of your hands and start massaging his dick. Once satisfied you push David on his back and climb on top of him. You take his prick and place it at your nether lips, then slowly lower yourself. It gently slid inside and you savor every moment of it. Once you have nearly of all of it inside it is time to start in earnest. You lift your hips and clamp down on him, increasing the pace as you go. David tries to awkwardly keep pace but you know that he knows so little about making love. He does get points for trying to though. You start to guide him firmly and show him that the entire body is for pleasure not just your crotch. You play with his body without stopping and when you both orgasm it is clear to you that he considered it the ride of his life. Despite being ridden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill panting you whisper, with your mouth at his ear: \"I hope your little boy isn't out of breath. I am far from done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours of sex, with the occasional breather of course, you feel a great deal of things. You feel content, satisfied, tired, strangely even invigorated and of course very sore. But something is felt off. You told David to do what he wanted and he still made love to you but you still do not feel like he returns your affections. Disappointment is also one of your many feelings. It is all just physical. You don't think you can get his love so simply. Ordering might work. But is that good enough? He now sleeps, utterly content with everything and his arms holding you. Will it last without the compulsion of your order or will the novelty wear off by tomorrow? Maybe you should simply stop being Michelle. Or take more drastic measures to get him and perhaps more.</span></div></div>",

Just the idea of being her is kinda sexy, except you are her. You are Michelle Hunt, Jessica's mother, your girlfriend's mother, the wonderful woman she got her looks from, you have everything from her looks and memories, even as you stand in front of the mirror pondering what to do, a lose Michelle thought comes to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"I need to go shopping, and David would probably want to get to know, well since he is inside of me, we can go out together. Like a date.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she's focused on you, your body, your treatment of Jessica. The envy she felt was more than enough for her to take her daughter's life, but you? Well now she doesn't care, she has you in such a way, not Jessica could get in this deep, all on your own volition, Michelle in her mind had you. The only thing she could want more is a physical relationship, holding you and you holding her. God she loved the feel of how you handled Jessica, you remember so vividly, that the critique, \"He's so into her! Of course he's young, I'll have to tend to how he treats her, but at least he knows how to please my daughter! It won't be to troublesome to have him \"conditioned\" into take care of an older woman.\" She says, you place a finger on your lips, once she finishes speaking, she simply smiles, no you're smiling. You can feel it. Michelle wants to show you her life, to give you a reason to stay inside her. You back away, letting her come back into control, you can feel her now leading you into being comfortable in her skin, once again you're looking over your body, is perfectly dressed and your ready, just one little thing to take care of, the skin of Jessica and David, \"Nothing a hangar and putting her in the far corner of my walk in closet, can't solve.\" You say, as you go through the house, your heels click as you walk, the sound is irresistible. It brings a smirk ro your face, you can feel it. \"Are you enjoying me now, David?\" She says, you move your hands over her breasts and slightly feel them, before you open Jessica's door, and grab her skin, taking a hanger from her closet you place it carefully within her opening and let her hang beautifully. Taking it into the far end of the closest, you see everything you need to, sexy lingerie, bras and panties, and, even some toys, all for later. You hold Jessica up, pushing her back as she lets you go, regretfully, you are back in the driver seat, and her body feels natural, yet the emotions you have for Jessica are still there. Carefully you pick her up and kiss the skin, immediately you feel Michelle get livid over this, she wants you to drop her, but you hold yourself from doing so, and hang the skin, carefully hiding everything like before. <i>\"All right, let's go on a date Michelle, so show me how much better you are than Jessica.\"</i> you think as you let her out again. Before you leave the master bedroom, you notice the time, Katie should be home soon, she went out with Claire in the morning, Michelle doesn't mind Katie becoming a suit for later, so before leaving you grab the pens, shoving them between your breasts, right where you can feel them, and right where nobody will touch the pens. You take look at Michelle's body one last time, and grin, knowing that some part of you always wanted to be inside of her! Maybe not like this, but you think Michelle will show you a good time, so why not? she goes into the kitchen and makes a light snack. A little grilled cheese and some waiting Katie is home, with her signature yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am HOOOOOME!\" she yells, the happy tune coming through the house, Michelle smiles, Katie is her cutest daughter, she's a lot like Michelle at her age, bright, bubbly, cute, and, innocent. Michelle even debated seducing David away using katie, a secret fantasy she wanted and was trying on you <br>\r\nMichelle winces at the thought of it all, you feel the arousal spike, the feeling of being moist and soft comes over you, you shake a bit, before katie comes into the kitchen. \"Hey mom!\" She chirps, immediately taking a seat by the counter top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie, how was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire was talking about how Gavin and I were out, nothing new, but we did see Trish and talk to her for a bit! We went and bought some cute clothes, had some ice cream, and, then we hung out at her house! Where's Jessica and David?\" She asks taking a mouse sized bite out of the freshly made grilled cheese. You take her and hug her, she returns it, just as the Like she normally does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you need? Am going out for a bit, so I'll pick up anything you need.\" You say avoiding the question, but as she notices that something is different, you have already put the pen to her, pressed the button, in a flash Katie is now a skin, carefully cradled in her own mother's arms. You giggle, just letting out the pleasure of how much David is going to enjoy this, the feeling of being Michelle, maybe even Jessica, but out of curiosity, you take the fresh Katie skin, and slide her head over Michelle's, the scene is unreal, mind boggling. As katie, you're youthful, young, and, full of energy, her face is anyways, looking down however is the milf body of Michelle, excitedly you pinch Michelle's ass, hear a moan from Katie is just too sweet so you continue, licking her lips. You can taste the grilled cheese, it's Michelle's special way of cooking it using at least five cheeses and having the bread prepared before by hand is much better than store bought, healthier too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David always loved my cooking, might as well enjoy it, before we get too serious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say with Katie's voice, the young singing voice coming from a head too out of place of her mom's body, well not too out of place, you could totally go outside like this, if you could manage to hide her body dangling from your neck, she would look like a young model. You take the five pieces of grilled cheese and eat them, sexily. Each one is licked, sucked, and, moaned on, even the food tastes different, Michelle has a vastly different taste compared to Katie, either way, it doesn't matter, it's all David's now. The final piece is hanging from Michelle's mouth, you excitedly watch as she uses her tongue to pull it in, the crumbs and mess you made, just make the dirty act of eating better, and clean up even better. The clock barely reads four, the sun is still out, and, Michelle has shopping and exercises too do, you take off the office attire and slip into the better fitting yoga pants and top. In time at all you're in her car and driving to your date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle has done the shopping, she's now in the gym chatting with her friends, more milfs, or rather women of the same breed. The ones who are single, Alice, Samantha, Kaitlyn, and, Beatrice, are the fun loving and out going of the bunch. The youngest being Kaitlyn, who very recently divorced. Along with the married women, Jennifer, Sophia, Aki, and, Harley. Yes, the office nine hotties. The boys fresh out of college and <b>fresh</b> for picking called them that, it wasn't an absurdity, it was just the benefits of being more, \"appreciated\". Looks only go so far, it's the older women's experience that makes part of the group so untouchable, well except for Michelle, since she's taking you places. The whole of just being her in irresistible, the looks people are not unnoticed, the men especially seem to just drop for you, even some of the younger women in the store and gym just fall. The whole outing is just Michelle and her friends having fun, the kind of fun you never see. How ladies really cut loose, you spent so much time just getting into her, you could feel every single gaze and every little sensation, honestly, Michelle was just an adventure! Even when your done, a little shower with her friends and your out the alone again, this time prowling the streets as her, the one thing she wants, the thing she needs, she wants more from you. From David, but not now, not as you are, you can feel it, and you have see it through. A full night as Michelle Hunt, you might not make it back as David, or you might even want to go back as him ever again, but soon your home, washing yourself down and putting on makeup, choosing the right dress, heels, and, necklace. The pens are put in your purse, it's a small slender thing, just enough for tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I hope you're ready, because tonight you're about to see Michelle Hunting.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispers to the reflection, kissing it as make her feel the pleasure of being the cougar she always has been.</span></div></div>",

You begin to wonder whether you'll ever take her mother off, though.  You still sort of want to be David, but... damn, you even like the weight of your breasts on your chest, the airiness of your female crotch.  Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting aside that problem for now, you walk to Jessica's bedroom.  The Jessica and Trish suits made from the girls are still in plain view.  You hide Trish and her clothes under Jessica's bed, you put the clothes that Michelle-wearing-Jessica had been wearing over the chair that goes with Jessica's desk, and you make Jessica's bed, untidy from your sexual romps with the fake Jessica, swiftly and expertly.  Then you pull aside the bedclothes, zip the Jess suit nearly up, put it into bed and put the covers up to its empty neck, then zip it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably you should have taken your skin off and been David again.  Then again, your Michelle Hunt memories say that you zapped Jessica with the black pen unawares, so that she should have no idea that it was her mother stealing her life.  She should find you even more reassuring as her mother than she'd find you as David, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jessica suit slowly becomes less empty, slowly fills with flesh and bone and blood, with Jessica-ness.  Soon Jessica is awake, and the first thing she sees is you, apparently her mother, dressed to the nines for the office, bending over her with an expression of concern on her perfectly made-up face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looks at the woman you are for now, her mother, and seems</span></div></div>",

But there's also a strange thrill of being able to be someone else; a little tingle that makes you wonder if there's any real harm if you do it for only a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlder Jessica smiles. \"I want you to help me correct this world. David, you're the most powerful element in this game. I told you it seems the universe wants Jessica to be worn? The universe wants you to control the C-Set. And the problem is the C-Set is the very focal point of the aberrations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to help you stop people wearing others as disguises?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nods, and sighs. \"That's what I'm asking, David. Although it's more complex than that. I told you, we can shift realities, time and space. That means... look, it's complicated and if you try and think about it too much it will make your head swim. Instead you can just trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have much choice,\" you shrug. Jessica smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. And I know you, David. Or I know other Davids, who are the same person as you. You want to do this. There's nothing you want more. Like I said, the universe wants you to use the C-Set: it seems to correct out the aberrations you'd cause. You can become someone else with little repercussions, and use this talent to help amend the aberrations. Someone like Jimmy... he goes bad, David. It doesn't matter how it starts, or how he gets involved. Every time he gets hold of a C-Set, things go South for him, less someone can get it away from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand... I think.\" You don't - you're confused as hell. As if this day couldn't have become stranger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlder Jessica shakes her head, sitting on her alternate version's bed. \"No you don't. You have absolutely no idea what I'm asking. But you will understand, if you work with me. We've done this before, you and I. Time and space, remember? Just do what I ask, and everything will become clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you say. \"So...what's first? Restore Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. And then we need to head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first step on a journey you won't believe.\"</span></div></div>",

The person shimmied up the drain pipe with skill and entered the room.  Inside, Jessica was starting to take form but this person wouldn't have any of it and shot her with their own black pen.  Almost immediately, she deflated back into a pathetic skin fit only for someone to wear.  The figure did exactly that and donned the Skinsuit swiftly.   They then spent about twenty minutes in Jessica' room before climbing out the window as themselves again, the room not disturbed majorly and the unfortunate Jessica lying in the middle of her bed as she regained form.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Jessica' POV] <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up lying on your bed.   Your head is fuzzy and you have no idea why you're naked, after all, you don't sleep naked.  As you pick yourself up off the bed, you hear the ringing of a phone.  Lying nearby on your table is an old Nokia phone which is clearly not yours.   Your iPhone is right there next to it.   You pick it up and notice that the number is blocked.  It rings out but as you go to put it back down, it rings once more.   This time you pick it up.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you ask tentatively, not sure what to expect.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, listen very carefully to what I'm going to say and don't hang up.\"  The voice on the other side is digitally distorted and there's no way to tell who it is.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you creep, I don't know how you got this phone in my room... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain why you're naked and confused in your own room and why you have no memories of going to sleep or waking up this morning.   In fact, it's actually 3pm already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at a nearby clock.   There's no way you would've slept that late and you've never even been able to sleep past noon when you tried.  There was definitely something amiss here and you figured there'd be no harm in listening.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason you can't remember anything is because your boyfriend's friend Jimmy used a special device to wear your skin and impersonate you for the last 12 hours or so.  David was here too but he left not long ago after finding out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in disbelief.   None of this made any sense and what the stranger was saying was completely ridiculous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen freak, I don't know who you think you are, but if you don't start making any sense, I'm hanging up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to your phone and look at the photos.\"  You decide to humour this person one more time but when you open the photos you notice something odd.   A whole series of selfies with increasingly silly facial expressions and poses which you don't remember taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe me now?  That was me doing that.   I wore you briefly after Jimmy so I could leave you some proof.   My deepest apologies for having done so but you wouldn't have believed me otherwise.   I want you to watch the video that I left you on your phone.   After you've done so, just follow the instructions.   I'll be in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the voice hung up.  You stood there with your mouth agape, holding a phone in each of your hands and butt naked.  What were you going to do now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you stand there in shock, the magnitude of it all just sinks in.  From what you understand, Jimmy somehow became you by wearing your skin and somehow David got involved.  Evidently, this wasn't all that uncommon because another person also ended up wearing you as well and even took a bunch of photos to prove it.  As it sunk in, you finally felt the chilliness of being naked and you quickly got dressed in whatever you got your hands on first.  You sat on your bed and finally begun the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face appeared with a stern expression plastered all over it.  It was like looking into a mirror but there was something about the expression that you'd never seen or made before.  It was far more stoic and weary than your usual self.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica,\" your face on the screen said, \"If you're listening to this, it means you're finally starting to believe me or your curiosity got the better of you.  Either way, I've got your attention and that's all that matters.  I need you to go to the place where you hide your diary.  Pause the video and go look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put down the phone, get up and then pull out the bottom drawer on your desk.  But you don't stop there, you pull the entire drawer out from the slot and find your diary and a set of pens next to it which you've never seen before.  You take the pens and then replace the drawer back into your desk and continue the video.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably wondering how I knew where your diary was.  Well the simple answer is those pens.  One of them allowed me to turn you into a skin and wear you like a disguise.  Another one of them gave me your memories; everything from your crushes, feelings, hopes and dreams, I know them all.  But don't worry, I only needed to find a place which only you knew.  Somewhere safe in case someone wore you before you regained consciousness.  I have little interest in your memories or what you know; I only care about saving you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head in disbelief; your golden hair swaying gently.  You wonder what this person's motive was.  First they wear you, then they claim to want to save you.  And then they give you these pen things which seem unbelievably powerful.  Right now, you have no idea what to think or who to trust.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a strange occurrence in this universe; in every alternate reality, there are only really two common threads.  There's the existence of the Costume set, C-set for short, which I've just given you.  And you.  You are a common thread to every reality in this universe.  But the unfortunate thing is, you are never you in any given reality.  The C-set is a powerful thing.  It's an absolute power and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  For some reason, people who possess the C-set are drawn to use it on you.  To become you.  Permanently or temporarily, but there's almost always someone inside you who shouldn't be.  I want to fix that.  I want you to stop being a common thread.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jessica in the video looks like she's ready to cry.  There's this downcast look to her which looks absolutely miserable and pitiable at the same time.  If she were in the same room, you'd have an incredible urge to just give her a big hug.  She wipes at her eyes and continues.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been following an individual through many realities.  This person has been corrupting every reality that I come across and is always one step ahead of me.  I've tried recruiting the David's of these realities to help me but it never seems to have any effect.  So this time, I want to try something else.  I'm asking you Jessica to help me.  I'm betting that this time, your assistance might finally be able to turn the tides.  If you're willing, I want you to use the yellow pen.  It's a special pen I've modified which should make it a lot harder for someone to wear you.  Remember of course, that you're still a target.  But the effects of this pen will mean that you'll only feel stunned when someone shoots you with the black pen.  You will turn into a skin if they shoot you a second or third time but it'll give you that slight advantage over your opponents.  The choice is up to you.  As I said earlier, I'll be in contact either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video ends there and you sit there reeling from that lengthy explanation.  It's all very hard to believe but the evidence is overwhelmingly in their favour.  It'd be stupid of you not to believe it.  You could choose to take it safe and figure out what all the pens do before heading out or you could rush out after David.</span></div></div>",

All of this information is a lot to take in and you aren't really sure what to make of it. In your hands are clenched a number of differently coloured pens - black, brown, white, blue and yellow. You only know what the yellow one does because of your mysterious 'guardian angel', supposedly it should shield you from being worn by channeling a feedback pulse through an attacker's pen, stunning them temporarily. Despite all your reservations, you decide to zap yourself with it. As you feel a warm tingling sensation flow through your body, you lament the fact that your guardian angel neglected to tell you what the other coloured pens could do. If you want to survive, you're obviously going to have to test them yourself and figure out all their powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip in frustration when you realise what you must do. In order to fight back, you're going to have to use these pens just like the enemy has done so to countless others and yourself. The thought of having to wear other people makes you sick to the stomach and you feel a painful tightness in your chest as you imagine your skin being worn. You fall to the ground and begin hyperventilating as the reality of the situation catches up with you. Shortly afterwards, you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stir, you hear the sound of voices outside your room. The fogginess that hangs over you makes it difficult to recognise but it sounds like your mother is downstairs shouting to someone upstairs. The last thing you hear is \"Yes Aunty\" before your door opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens with a thud. \"Jessieeee!\" squeals the intruder as she thunders in. You recognise her as your obnoxious 21 year old cousin who you finally remember was visiting from out of town. She sees you sprawled on the ground and raises an quizzical eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? The bed isn't good enough for you eh?\" she snarks as she sits down on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. Hannah can be annoying in the best of times and you really weren't in the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww what's got you down sport?\" she says as she patted your head affectionately, \"Or is it because you don't know who to trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver runs down your spine as you look at Hannah and see her pointing the black pen right at your face. \"This was almost too easy,\" she says with a malicious smile on her face as she presses down on the button. You watch as the pen discharges some sort of electricity and Hannah convulses on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much time. Snatching the pen from her fingers, you point it back at your attacker and return the favour. She collapses into an empty skin on your bed before you quickly move through your house zapping everyone into empty piles of skins whilst whispering a quiet apologies to your mother and sister. This was the break you were looking for. A 'person' on whom to test the pens on without the guilt of using them on innocent people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're convinced of what you said in the video now, that's no doubt. <br>\r\nBut pens that turns people into skins? How does that work? And why do you become take on the skin's original form when you wear it?<br>\r\nYou tap the yellow pen against your palm, the person wearing you in the video said it would protect you against being zapped..<br>\r\nAfter staring at it for a while, you decide you're going to use it after all, you're apparently a prime target and you need a defense.<br>\r\nGripping the pen firmly, you press the button whilst aiming it at your hand, a warm yellow beam shines from the head of the pen and hits your skin.<br>\r\nIn a flash, a strange shimmer ripples up your arm quickly, sending itself over your entire body, and then it fades. <br>\r\n\"Woah..\" you say, \"I'd better find out what the rest of the pens do..\" <br>\r\nYou look to your new C-Set, there are pens of different colours, minus the yellow one in your hand.<br>\r\nBlue, Red, Black and Brown. \"God, why can't I just have one pen that does everything?\" you complain.<br>\r\nYou pick up the black one, this is the one that Jimmy used on you. You ball your fist as you recall that memory..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way home from school, you're walking down a path, suddenly, Jimmy runs up behind you.<br>\r\n\"Hey Jessica! Wait up!\" you hear his annoying voice behind you.<br>\r\nLooking over your shoulder, Jimmy's got his hand on his pocket, you stop walking and turn around to him.<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What do you wa-\", suddenly Jimmy sends his arm around your neck and drags you into an alley. You hear <i>zap</i> and it's all black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your naked thighs, you realise you're crying, droplets of tears run down the side of your leg and stain the sheet.<br>\r\n\"Jimmy.. you'll pay for this..\" you're trembling in fury. How could Jimmy abduct you and then wear you like a new set of clothes?<br>\r\nYou realize that you're wasting time crying, and you try to ball up your emotions and put a lid on it.<br>\r\nDavid, you realize that you need David to help you. Even though in the video the person said David never helped much, you could use him for something atleast.<br>\r\nAnd not only because he's involved in this, you need your boyfriend. You love him so much..<br>\r\nFlicking the black pen into your hand, you aim it at your wrist and press the button. <i>ZAP</i><br>\r\nYou feel the shield re-surface as the black pen's beam crackles like lightning across the it, the yellow field around you is shattered and you feel nauseous.<br>\r\nDropping back onto your bed, your breasts bounce and you rapidly inhale and exhale in shock, you try your best not to vomit.<br>\r\nStruggling to pull yourself back up, your strength returns and you shake your head. That was a horrible feeling, it's like you were paralyzed.<br>\r\nAt least you know what to expect when you confront Jimmy, but you'll be careful, he won't get the chance to shoot you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext pen. Your hand finds the red one after you re-establish the yellow shield around yourself using the appropriate yellow pen.<br>\r\nYou aim it at your wrist and press the button, the yellow shield glows again and you see a small hole forming in it where the pen's beam strikes.<br>\r\nWeird.. you flick the red pen and instantly that portion of the yellow shield disintegrates. From your wrist up the shield around your hand shatters like glass.<br>\r\nThe red pen can destroy your shield, you realize, it's less dangerous than the black pen but you still figure it could be used against you.<br>\r\nYou look at your hand and see that the yellow shield gradually reforms itself as if it was a panel of glass \"un-breaking\", yellow shards compile on top of each other.<br>\r\nNeat, at least with the red pen you don't hand to use the yellow pen to re-shield yourself.<br>\r\nYou drop the red pen and pick up the blue pen, you zap your wrist. The yellow shield shimmers and waves like water when a rock is thrown into it.<br>\r\nWeird.. you don't really know what the blue pen does to have that effect. You probably need a skin for it to work.<br>\r\nRepeating the routine with the brown pen, absolutely nothing happened when you zapped your wrist. Perhaps the shield negates it's effect entirely?<br>\r\nYou're amused by these pens you realize, they're actually quite fun to play with.<br>\r\nBut you're not playing games here, you're out for revenge. And you need to know what the blue and brown pens do. You need a skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tuck the pens save the black and yellow pen in the box you find them in. After that, you started getting dressed, you're stark naked after all.<br>\r\nLooking down, you realize that your groin is sore and you're aghast in realization. Jimmy! W-What did you do!? <br>\r\nYour embarassment turns to rage as you consolidate your hatred for Jimmy, he's going to die. <br>\r\nPulling open your drawer, you retrieve a white pair of panties and a matching bra, quickly pulling them on.<br>\r\nThen you search your closet for something that'll let you move quickly and freely. You decide on a pair of bright yellow leggings and white shirt.<br>\r\nWhilst you pull on your shoes, you hear the front door open and two voices. One of them is David. <br>\r\nUpon listening moving to your door and listening in, you hear David talking to someone.<br>\r\n\"Why are we at Jessica's house again?\" he asks. You hear Trish's voice reply.<br>\r\n\"I'm here to check on her, David.\" she says in a tone very unlike her.<br>\r\nYou flick your black pen out of your pants pocket and make sure your yellow shield is on. <br>\r\nStepping back from the door, the knob turns and as it opens you aim at Trish, her eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Where did you ge-\" she's interrupted due to being dissolved into a skin.<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ! Jessica?!\" David yelps. You run forward, stepping over Trish and you throw yourself onto David.<br>\r\nWrapping your arms around him, he staggers back with your weight, but he's used to it from numerous occasions before.<br>\r\n\"Jessica, calm down, are you okay?\" You feel his hand around your head as he caresses you, his finger in between your blonde locks.<br>\r\nYou're starting to sob, your face buried in his chest, you're so relieved to finally see him again.<br>\r\nHe whispers consoling words to you and you finally calm down, the two of you sit on your bed.<br>\r\nDavid scooped up Trish's skin and threw it on the bed, he flicked out a black pen but you stopped him.<br>\r\n\"David don't!\" you grip his wrist firmly and divert his aim, he looks at you confused.<br>\r\n\"I'm helping her, Jessica. She's our ally..\" he tries to explain. You sternly look at him.<br>\r\n\"David, we can't trust anybody anymore, not with these pens.\" you lead him to the other side of the bed and you both sit again.<br>\r\nYou explain to him what happened, telling him all about the person who wore you, the videos, the selfies, your new pens.<br>\r\nHe's amazed and ends up cuddling you, nevermind the skin of his best friend balled up next to him.<br>\r\nYou both lay on the bed and he listens to you talk, occasionally grunting in response.<br>\r\n\"I think that Jessica could be the person who causes the \"aberrations\" or whatever. It could be someone else though.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I get it now, alright.\" David says through a mouthful of your hair. David gets up and straightens his shirt out.<br>\r\nYou roll onto your back and look up at him, he's got a crude grin across his face for some reason.<br>\r\nHe takes out the black pen and aims it at you, your eyes widen as you react, gripping the black pen in your pocket.<br>\r\n<i>ZAP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain focus and you see David standing there surprised, you instantly flick your own black pen forward and zap him.<br>\r\nCrumpling to the floor, you huff and puff, trying to catch your breath as the nausea dissipates, yellow electricity crackling all over you.<br>\r\n\"N-No.. why?!\" You're in disbelief, David tried to turn you back into a skin!<br>\r\nTears start to streak down your face as you crack, you can't take this anymore, you don't know what's going on!<br>\r\nAs you stop crying, you retrieve the box of pens, taking them out. You lay the box on your bed and grip the blue one.<br>\r\nMaybe this'll give you some answers, you aim and fire at David's skin.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>WOOSH</i></span><br>\r\nA torrent of memories flood your brain like water released from a dam. You see David and the older version of you walk to his house.<br>\r\nDavid took Jimmy's skin with him. He couldn't believe the things Jessica told him and he wanted to try to change Jimmy from his usually crooked ways.<br>\r\nRestoring Jimmy in private, Jimmy turned on David and zapped him, it's all black from there.<br>\r\n...Jimmy.. you fucking demon! Your face flushes with red as you stare at your legs with your head hanging, golden locks hang around your face.<br>\r\nYou wipe your nose as you drop the blue pen and grab the red one, pointing it at the skin, you zap it. You notice a colour difference in the place where you aimed,<br>\r\nJimmy is much paler than David, you realize that the red pen can also cut two skins apart. Quickly you cut Jimmy out of David and use the blue pen.<br>\r\nThis time you see things from Jimmy's perspective, Jimmy's mind is truly warped, he's gone insane with the power of the pens.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He dropped his stuff off in your room and promptly undressed. Throwing your clothes about messily.<br>\r\n\"I know.. I should call Davie over here for some fun..\" he mutters seductively in your mannerisms.<br>\r\nHe dials David and lures him over, soon after, David arrives. Oh dear god, David no!<br>\r\nYou witness yourself lead David on and you two have some glorious sex. That explains why your groin is sore.<br>\r\nAtleast it was with David, you're relieved, you'd had sex with David plenty of times before.<br>\r\nJimmy gets up and walks into your bathroom, retrieving a Trish skin from his backpack. Dear God, Trish.. <br>\r\nHe preemptively abducted Trish, your memories reveal that she was his first victim and he furiously masturbated using her body quite often.<br>\r\nDavid was skeptical, you're relieved that he wasn't warped like Jimmy was, but he still went through with it. You're disappointed in him, but not surprised.<br>\r\nYou know David, he's a guy and guys have questions. He probably wanted to know what being a girl was like.<br>\r\nSoon after David dons Trish, you witness yourself lick her out and you recoil in disgust. Gross, Jimmy what the fuck?!<br>\r\nAfter that, you see David question you in Trish, and you try to play him. Typical Jimmy.<br>\r\nThe older version of you enters the room and zaps him, for the first time you know what the older you looks like.<br>\r\nWow, she's.. so similar. Is that really what I'll look like later on though? Your memory is abruptly interrupted as Jimmy peels your face off, and is zapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch yourself holding your head in your hands, that was a handful sure enough. You look down and see that David's skin has regenerated itself.<br>\r\nYou're relieved, at least the red pen doesn't hurt you. Quickly you restore David using the black pen, his body re-inflates and you wait a few minutes.<br>\r\n\"Agh.. J-Jess..?\" you hear him say, and you rush to his side on the floor. <br>\r\n\"David! David, can you hear me?\" you put your hand under his head and hold him up slightly so he can see you.<br>\r\nHe smiles, clearly relieved. \"Where am I..?\"<br>\r\n\"You're in my bedroom, David, this is such a huge mess..\" <br>\r\nDavid looks away for a moment and sees Jimmy's skin next to him, he jumps in surprise.<br>\r\nYou quickly grip the skin and throw it elsewhere, not even bothering to aim.<br>\r\n\"It's alright Davie, you're fine now.\" you've succeeded in calming him. The both of you get up off the floor.<br>\r\n\"There's a lot to learn, David, here.\" You hand him the blue pen. \"Aim and fire, you'll get their memories.\"<br>\r\nHe nods and obeys, his eyes shut as he experiences everything, his brows furrowing as the truth is unveiled.<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, you sick fuck! You tricked me!\" his face is slightly red, he's probably as angry as you are.<br>\r\nYou hug him, trying to calm him down.<br>\r\n\"J-Jimmy.. I thought..\" you put a finger on his lips and look up into his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Shh, Davie..\" you quell his anger.<br>\r\nSuddenly, David pushed your head back slightly and kisses your lips, you shut your eyes and take it wholeheartedly.<br>\r\nFeeling his tongue enter your mouth, you dance with it using your own and he breaks the kiss, you eyes flick open.<br>\r\nYou feel the blood rush to your cheeks and you turn red, David smiles at you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for saving me, Jess.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah..\" you manage to spit out.<br>\r\nAfter a while, you two start to think of a plan. You need to figure out who it is that wore your skin and took the photos, and you need to get an alibi for the older you.<br>\r\n\"We should probably let Trish know what's going on and give her protection, oh right!\" you remember the yellow pen and you flick it out.<br>\r\n\"This will protect you against the other pens, the black pen breaks the shield and leaves you stunned though.\" you show him.<br>\r\n\"It's because of this that I could save you, otherwise.. I'd probably be fucking somebody under the control of Jimmy.\" you joke.<br>\r\nDavid simply shakes his head and take the pen, he zaps his hand and the shield washes over him, he then zaps you and the same thing occurs.<br>\r\nHanding the pen back to you, you take it and put it away, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get around to restoring Trish and informing her about everything that's happened after using the red pen to get older Jessica out of her. Then you use the blue pen on both of them. Turns out that older Jessica is actually an agent from a transdimensional corporation that uses the pens.  She's also gone AWOL, stealing the pens and a device that lets her phase through to other dimensions. For the most part, everything she told David is true.<br>\r\nTrish's body reinflates, filling out her clothes gradually, she awakens violently and thrashes out, you and David qualm her quickly.<br>\r\nAfter explaining everything to her, she walks over to Jimmy's skin and stamps on it.<br>\r\n\"Fuck you Jimmy!\" she says through held back tears, she'd actually fostered a small crush on Jimmy.<br>\r\nDavid consoles her as they sit on the bed, you plant yourself next to her on the other side.<br>\r\n\"What do we do about Jimmy and the other me?\" you ask David.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we're sure as hell not restoring Jimmy though.\" the three of you nod in agreement.<br>\r\n\"I c-can't believe this, David..\" Trish mutters, staring at her knees with his arm around her shoulders.<br>\r\nHe whispers something to her, you assume he's just comforting her.<br>\r\n\"No, David, you fucking wore me, you fucking WORE me man!\" He shoves him off and stands up, staring at him, the betrayal is plastered across her face.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Trish, Jimmy tricked me!\" David stands up as well, trying to redeem himself.<br>\r\n\"I can't, I can't take this..\" you see Trish storm off into your bathroom and lock the door.<br>\r\nDavid sighs and sits next to you, he's obviously sad. <br>\r\n\"Jimmy's fucked all of us up, don't worry Davie.\" you say.<br>\r\nHe nods and kisses you lightly on the cheek. David asks for your phone and you give it to him, he watches the videos.<br>\r\n\"This was only a few minutes after me and your other you over there left your house..\" he says.<br>\r\nYour eyes widen in surprise, you notice that your window is open and when you examine it, the guttering running down your window is slightly shifted.<br>\r\n\"He climbed in through here..\" you say. Meanwhile, David is giggling at the selfies of you in your phone.<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" you snatch your phone away from him and delete all of them. Your face is red in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish eventually comes out of the bathroom and apologizes to David. The both of them set off to talking it out and they're happy afterwards.<br>\r\n\"We should get back to our own houses. Oh right, Jess, give Trish a shield and a pen.\" David says.<br>\r\nYou nod and fish out the yellow pen, quickly you zap Trish, she's initially surprised. Trish pats her pocket and pulls out an assortment of pens much like yours.<br>\r\n\"Seems the other me brought her entire set with her.\" you say. You explain each one to Trish and she nods understandingly.<br>\r\n\"You can use the red pen to slice skins apart after you've zapped someone, in case they're wearing one.\" you add on.<br>\r\n\"Right, I got it now.\" Trish nods.<br>\r\n\"Alright, see you guys later!\" you say as the two leave for home, now you're stuck with two skins and nobody else home.<br>\r\nWhere are your mom and Katie? They should be home by now at least. You start to get worried.<br>\r\n\"Did something happen to them..?\" you wonder.<br>\r\nYou ball up Jimmy's skin and throw it in your closet, then you take the older you and put it on your bed, the black pen in hand.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the pen came with instructions, which made his life easier, although didn't do much to reduce his shock when he saw his mom deflating into a tangled heap of clothes and skin after she becam Jimmy's first guinea pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It was freaky dude.'', Jessica said, Jimmy had decided to resume his guise, much to your objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh-huh, you can say that again.'' , you eyed your girlfriend from top to toe.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jimmy has always had harebrained ideas but for some reason, you always give in to them, no matter how stupid they may be.  It isn't long before you're stepping into your girlfriend's sister's skin, someone you know almost nothing about since the two of you never talk.  Your body shrinks as her skin remakes yours into Katie's and before long, a naked Katie is gazing at her reflection in the mirror.  Katie, whilst not as hot as your girlfriend, is still has an incredibly cute face and medium length curly brown hair.  It isn't really that curly, but wavy enough to make her look nice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're like totally hot.\"  You hear Jimmy's voice behind.  Wait... what?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely have time to think before you're seized by Jimmy's hands and he's thrusting his tongue down yours.  During the time that you got into Katie's skin, Jimmy has evidently stripped out of Jessica's and is now assaulting your Katie-clad body.  You try to resist but he's too strong and before long, he's got you pinned on the bed.  Your protests are muffled and you resign yourself to his 'treatment' of Katie.  Ten minutes later, he's finished and the two of you are exhausted.  It's only now that you realise that you've experienced your first rape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy has his guard down as he lies next to you and you punch him in his nuts as hard as you can.  He curls up in pain as you step over him and strip out of Katie's skin as quickly as you can.  There's no one in the house, so you run naked, holding Katie's ravaged skin, to Jessica's room to find her skin draped on her bed next to the black pen.  On instinct, you grab it and press the button while pointed at it.  Jessica's skin fills up in a matter of seconds and she wakes groggily from her 'slumber'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy stumbles into the room behind you.  \"What the fuck dude,\" he manages to mumble as you dress yourself.  You only respond when you're fully dressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck indeed dude,\" you say as Jessica listens on confused about her nakedness, Jimmy's nakedness, and the Katie skin next to her.  \"You raped me.  You raped me while I was inside Katie.  What the fuck is wrong with you man?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy tries to explain himself.  How he has always had a really big crush on Katie and he thought that as a guy, you'd be okay with him doing the deed since she clearly would never let him.  But you have more respect for people's dignity than what your now-former friend has and you admonish him for even having these ideas.  As Jimmy tries to justify his actions, you explain all that has happened up to the moment to Jessica; how Jimmy found these two pens which turn people into bodysuits to be worn by others, how he wore Jessica to trick you and then turned Katie into a skin for you to wear, only to take advantage of that.  Jessica grows more and more shocked at Jimmy's actions as you explain and it isn't a surprise by the end of the explanation, Jimmy is groaning in pain on floor again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you need to decide what to do.  When you restore Katie, there's no doubt that she will know that she has been raped and then there will be a lot of questions to be answered.  There's also a matter of what to do with Jimmy, that no good son of a bitch prankster who abused Jessica's body and then proceeded to abuse Katie's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the pen from the desk, you zap Jimmy.  You decide you will deal with him later.  There's now the matter of her sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to put her back on,\" Jessica explains.  She explains that her mum will be home from work soon and that both of them need to be here.  Jessica wants you to wear Katie and pretend to be her long enough that she won't be able to feel that she has been raped.  It'll be better for her that she just has a memory blank than having the knowledge of being raped, the situation made worse by the fact that she wasn't even in control of her own body when it happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you go along with her plan and climb back into her sister's skin.  The changes happen like last time but when her body is yours, you feel the pain.  There are bruises on your arms from where Jimmy gripped you and there's a pain in your abdomen.  Jessica goes with you into the bathroom and helps clean up Katie's body the best you can before dressing you in long sleeved clothing to hide the abuse.  The bruises will take some time to go away but luckily, the other pain should subside fairly quickly.  Looks like you'll be staying in this body for a while.  </span></div></div>",

You then realize that you have to make an excuse to ensure that your own parents and Jimmy's don't get suspicious about anything. Suddenly, you remember that you and Jimmy were supposed to go on a weeklong camping trip tommorrow. You figure that neither your parents nor Jimmy's will suspect anything if you decided to start the trip a day early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip off Katie's skin for a moment, telling Jessica that you have to make sure your parents don't come looking for you. Taking your cell phone, you call your mom and explain that you and Jimmy wanted to leave for the campsite early. Your mom doesn't give you a hard time over this decision, saying that she'll be glad to have you out of the house for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you glance at the Jimmy skin that's still hanging nearby. You know that there's no way the real Jimmy would go along with your plan, but you remember that he doesn't have to like it. You climb into the skin, and it soon becomes your own. You comment briefly to Jessica that becoming another guy feels different than becoming Katie was. At the mention of Katie's name, Jimmy's instincts seem to kick in a bit, and both of you can tell how. Evidently, Jimmy's desires still have a hold on his body, though you ignore it for the time being. You take Jimmy's phone and call his home. HIs mom picks up and gives you a bit of a harder time than your own mother did. Though initially unsure how to best respond, you eventually succeed in assuaging her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that is done, you eagerly get out of Jimmy's skin, not wanting to stay for a second longer in the body of your former friend. It's time to hide the magnitude of his actions by returning to Katie's body. You put on her skin, and you see your legs becoming hers. As the rest of the changes unfold, you then ask Jessica how you two are going to spend the week.</span></div></div>",

What could possibly go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'll be here to help you out. I know it's a lot to ask of you to do this, but you're the only person I'd trust to help with something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allow yourself to smile slightly. Spending a week with Jess without needing to leave for anything else is a decent consolation. You know that she'll owe you later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day is difficult for you. There are many times when you felt like you could accidentally slip up with Mrs. Hunt alone. The second day doesn't get easier with you having to hang out with your sister, Claire. When you learn that Katie had been planning to go to the movies with a bunch of her friends on the third day, you're ready to quit, not knowing how you would be able to remember the names of so many people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be an easier way of doing this,\" you tell Jessica. \"When Jimmy was in your body, I wasn't able to tell you weren't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the area where you had put the pen before and realize that there's a second pen. You get up and start to toy with the strange brown object. Absentmindedly, you press a button and zap yourself with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flood of memories rushes through you. You fall backwards onto the floor. \"Urgh...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rushes towards you. \"David? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you gaze confusedly at her. \"Sis? What are you talking about?\" You then realize what you had just said. \"Shit! What did I just say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just called me 'Sis' completely naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did. You are my sister, after all.\" Your eyes widen at this sentence. \"Whoa...I think that brown pen's done something to me. I feel a lot more like me...Katie. It's like...before I completely thought like David...myself and had to pretend to be Katie. Now, I feel completely like Katie and have to concentrate to act like myself. This must be how Jimmy was able to act like you so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough both of you were a bit freaked out by your change in behavior, it becomes much easier for you to accept being Katie. You naturally refer to Mrs. Hunt as \"Mom\" when she tells you and Jessica to go to bed. The next day, you know exactly who all of Katie's friends are as if you had always known them. The rest of the week becomes much more bearable as you act almost completely like Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you inspect yourself later on, you find that no trace from Jimmy's rape anywhere. You feel completely relieved that you're free to return to your old life. You then realize that you haven't taken Katie off since the week started. You feel a lot more comfortable in Katie's skin, and the idea of having a flat chest and a dick feels a bit foreign.</span></div></div>",

You concentrate on getting out of Katie's body, and you can feel your face getting loose. You instinctively pull at it, and find a plasticy version of Katie's face in your hands, as if it were only a mask. You look in the mirror and are greeted by the odd sight of your head on Katie's completely naked body. You continue stripping out of the suit, pulling out your more muscular arms. You feel your chest deflating as you slide the zipper on your back down, and your natural flat chest soon reappears. You keep moving the zipper down, and your penis soon emerges. It feels strange yet relieving to have a dick again. You finally pull out your legs and find your natural reflection in the mirror. Though part of you is saddened by no longer being Katie, most of you is relieved to be back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the bathroom and find Jessica waiting in bed wearing only a bra and panties. \"Why, hello there, David,\" she seductively purrs as she eyes your slowly enlarging manhood. \"Oh, you're definitely a man again. I've been waiting for this all week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you realize how much you missed this as well. \"Likewise,\" is all you manage before she covers up your mouth with a passionate kiss. You've definitely missed having sex the right way, where both you and Jessica feel absolutely amazing all the way through, not like how Jimmy completely took advantage of you. When your mind wanders to that thought just after you and Jessica climax, you can't help but feel that if he'd just asked, you might have had a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you get up and pose the question of what to do now. You both still have no idea how you're going to fill the gap in Katie's memory or what to do with Jimmy. You rummage through Jimmy's belongings, which he had left around probably when he had first taken your girlfriend's body. You spy a piece of paper that you and Jessica had somehow overlooked over the past week. It turns out that these are instructions for the pens. It seems that the pens have more than just the ability to turn people into bodysuits and the ability to impersonate them perfectly. Of note is a setting that allows one to modify memories. You suppose that you'll try to erase Jimmy's memories of the pens and provide Katie most of the memories of the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to these instructions, all we have to do is use the memory modifier setting of the brown pen while we're wearing the person and just think about what we want to happen,\" you finish explaining to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems easy enough,\" she responds. You nod and begin to grab Jimmy's skin, but Jessica stops you. \"You know, David, I've been curious over the past week what it's like to be a guy. Considering how Jimmy used my body without any sort of permission or warning, I'd like to return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a bit concerned about what might happen if too much of Jimmy rubs off on her but quickly brush those concerns away as you hand over the skin to her. You go to retrieve Katie's skin, and, by the time you return physically Katie again, you see that Jessica is already physically Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pretty cool!\" Jessica exclaims in her new, lower tone. \"It feels so different not to have the weight of breasts on my chest.\" You both then notice her body's reaction to seeing Katie's naked body. \"That's also a new sensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin at that remark and grab the brown pen. You look at the instructions again and change it to the desired setting. You zap yourself, wanting Katie to have the memories of the past week. As confirmation that it worked, you change the pen back to its original settings and fire it at yourself again. As you feel the sensation of regaining Katie's memories, you are relieved to find the memories of the past week there. \"It worked,\" you report as you hand over the pen and the instructions to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her slowly cycle through the settings and zap herself. She then sets it back to normal and zaps herself again, this time gaining Jimmy's memories. \"Whoa, dude!\" she says in a completely Jimmy like fashion. \"That felt awesome! Too bad Jimmy won't remember any of this. But, than again, not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement, vowing not to let Jimmy get his hands on the pens again. \"We should probably get out of these bodies now,\" you state, though a good part of you doesn't really want to right now. You remember that Katie has a crush on Jimmy, and seeing his naked body has been turning you on for a while now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Jessica replies, though you can tell from her tone that she also doesn't want to get out of Jimmy's body just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows in a seductive manner. \"There's something else on your mind, though. Is there something you see that you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grins in a completely Jimmy-esque way. \"Definitely.\"</span></div></div>",

It's disturbing enough that Jimmy is inside your girlfriend, but you're not ready to make the jump into someone else's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude! Come on, at least try it! Think of the fun we could have!\u201d Jessica's pretty face is twisted into Jimmy's smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d you stress. Then, as always when it comes to his ideas, you cave in. \u201cLook, if I'm going to try it, I'd rather do it on someone older. I don't want to be my girlfriend's sister; it'd be weird.\u201d You look at her deflated face, and shiver at the thought of what you've done. You're about to list even further objections when you hear the door open downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, I'm home!\u201d You look at each other. Jessica's mom. Panic rushes down your spine: what if she came upstairs? Jimmy \u2013 or, as he appears, Jessica - grins mischievously, eyes sparkling with intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were saying?\u201d Your eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way dude...\u201d you hiss, but before you can protest Jimmy acts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're up here, mom!\u201d Jessica's voice rings out. You hear the footsteps coming up the stairs. Time seems to slow down; you glance at the skin on the floor, enmeshed in a pile of clothes. Quickly you grab it and throw it inside Katie's bed, pulling the cover over it. Jessica's body watches with amusement, and levels the pen toward the door as the handle turns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica? What are you doing in Katie's...\u201d Mrs Hunt never finishes the question. You watch as her hollow skin drops to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJimmy! You can't keep doing that to everyone!\u201d you protest. Jessica's voice chimes with its usual, delightful laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I can, dude. You just shoot them again and they're back to normal. Now come on \u2013 you said you wanted to be someone older, and the sooner you are dressed, the sooner we can restore your 'daughter'.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later and you're in the bathroom, fastening a light blue blouse and staring at the familiar face in the mirror from a completely alien angle \u2013 through its eyes. Jessica's mom has a little weight around her thighs and stomach, and wrinkles are beginning to form beside her eyes, but she's still attractive; if anything, her mature curves only enhance her appearance. Her brown hair \u2013 a trait Katie but not Jessica inherited \u2013 is cut short in a tidy bob, locks drifting down tightly to frame her cheeks. You smile, and watch as her excited smile bursts out across her lips. You laugh, and hear her laugh trickle out of your mouth. You flick her hair, and watch as the bob shifts back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean forward, checking her makeup and lipstick, raising a finely manicured hand to check her ruby red nails; everything has remained in place \u2013 the disguise is perfect. You are Jessica's mom \u2013 a picture of respectability. You slip her faux-pearl necklace around your neck, thread her wedding ring onto your finger and pin her earrings in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Jimmy, or rather Jessica, asks from the doorway, 'your' handbag in hand. \u201cI told you it's a rush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is incredible,\u201d you say, unable to take your eyes away from the mirror as the woman in front of you replicates your expressions. \u201cAt first the idea was horrific. But dude, this is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nods. \u201cI told you! This, I think you'll find, is yours, 'mom'. Car keys, wallet \u2013 she's got at least two hundred in cash \u2013 and, of course, the driving license of one Denise Frances Hunt. Wow, you don't look bad for someone pushing 40.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the bag from Jimmy and slip it over your arm, trying to impersonate Mrs Hunt as best you can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, 'dear'. So, what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first things first, we need to revive Katie; your husband could be home at any minute, and he might get freaked out if his daughter is a pile of skin in her bed. Don't worry \u2013 she won't remember what happened. But after that it's up to you. We could prank her a bit, or we could go out and have some fun, find some new people to become; playing Jessica was fun for a while, but I'm keen to take this up a level. And you have a car now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She takes out the skin and zaps it with the pen. Much to your amazement, the skin suddenly fills itself out, and begin to resemble the person it was once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait.'', you look at Katie's form. ''Aren't we supposed to put some clothes on her or something?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica just looks at you sheepishly. ''No time <i>mom</i>. She's gonna wake up any moment soon.'', she gives a playful slap on your shapely ass, much to your surprise. ''Let's bail.'', and with that, she storms off the room, leaving you in an awkward situation. You look at the open door to Katie's naked form.

These heels are disasters waiting to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I dunno man.'', Jessica just shrugs. ''Why not the mall?'', a glint re-appears in her eyes, but you don't see it.

The heels are already beginning to annoy you. \u201cAlthough we need to come up with a better plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy kicks back in the passenger seat, slouching and reaching into his pockets. \u201cHow so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTypical Jimmy; mischief first, thinking later. You turn the car to the right, concentrating on the gear change as you get going again. \u201cThree problems,\u201d you say, your motherly voice adopting a chiding tone. \u201cFirst, we can't access their memories, or skills, or personality. So beyond the cash we've got, how are we going to get any more? Second, if we swap skins, Jessica and her mom are going to wake up naked in a shopping mall, wondering how they got there. And third, what about us? Isn't your mom expecting you back any time soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica snorts, pulling the pen out of her pocket. No \u2013 out of the corner of your eye you can see it's different. This one is brown, not black. Jessica's hands turn it over, appraising it. \u201cMaybe this will help, dude. It was in the attic, along with the black pen. No instructions though, I have no idea what it does. Maybe it's designed to help with the small stuff, help you act like them. Or maybe it's to fill in the blanks while they're out. I don't know, but it's worth a try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d you say, tasting your lipstick as you bite your lip in concentration, navigating the route to the mall. \u201cIt's too risky to try in public, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy agrees. Instead, he decides to tackle one of your problems head-on. In a moment he's got both Jessica and her mom's phones out, and is hastily texting. By the time you've arrived at the mall \u2013 and parked in a bay where you didn't run the risk of hitting another car \u2013 it's finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoint three, no problemo,\u201d Jessica beams a nauseatingly Jimmy smile, unbuckling. \u201cWe're covered. Jimmy, Jessica and David are heading to a movie marathon tonight. David's mom was a little concerned, until she found out they were getting a lift and being chaperoned by Mrs Hunt. And you have told Katie what's happening, and given her instructions to cook tonight. Nobody's expected back until gone midnight. Thanks, mom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica leans over and throws her arms around your neck for a hug. You pat Jimmy away. \u201cDude!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren't I the one that's supposed to be embarrassed of you?\u201d Jimmy retorts, climbing out of the car. \u201cCome on, mom, let's go shopping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick lap of the mall, and it's clear nobody can tell you're not a genuine mother-daughter shopping trip. You walk around slowly \u2013 your heels won't let you do anything else \u2013 while Jessica darts around, looking for options. If you were nervous to start with, any worries are gone now. In fact, you're beginning to enjoy the strange experience of being someone else. You are Denise Hunt. You relax into your role, smiling her warm, pleasant smile, even daring to stop and pretend to take an interest in some of the window displays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Jimmy says eventually, that infuriating smirk still plastered all over Jessica's face. The sooner you switch skins the better. \u201cI've been thinking about your so-called problems. Here's what we do. There are two prime spots for swapping. First up, look over there, at the hippy shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look. It's some kind of mysticism boutique \u2013 junk like astrology, tarot, and palm reading. At least, you thought it was junk; now you're not so sure. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe woman who runs it is pretty hot, even if she is always wearing those flowing gowns and loop earrings. Here's the deal. You head in for a fortune telling, we zap her and take over the store for a bit. We've got the pick of her customers for the next disguise, and it'd be a blast making up phony fortunes for suckers. We can hide Jessica and her mom out back, take them home and zap 'em back later. Shit dude, we could even see if there's a book about these pens, find out what this brown one does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a plan it's pretty weak, but Jimmy's grin suggests he's got another. \u201cAlternatively,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cthere's a reason I brought us here. I overheard Ms Martinez and Ms Franklin talking at school last week. You know Franklin's getting married? It's the bachelorette party tonight. They've booked hotel rooms in the centre of town, and they're planning to go wild. Before that though, they were talking about final dress fittings at that bridal shop on the second floor. Think about it, dude; they're going to have to use private booths. We could zap the store attendant, and then take our pick of their group to switch into. They're going to have wallets full of money for the night, we know what they're planning to do, nobody's going to suspect if we act out of character, and they're not going to question waking up in a hotel room without any memory.\u201d </span></div></div>",

You have to admit, you've been so caught up trying not to give yourself away that you hadn't thought about it. Now that you do, you feel a rush of excitement. You are an infiltrator, not only into someone else's life, but the other sex. And, ever since you've left the car, you've been enjoying pretending to be Mrs Hunt more and more. Still, you'd rather get out of this current identity \u2013 and get Jimmy out of your girlfriend \u2013 as soon as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, then,\u201d you say, striding toward the boutique. \u201cLet's see if we can't find out more about what we're dealing with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you enter the small store, your scents are teased by a thousand different aromas. Thick incense, warm wood, and the soft tones of crushed plants. The walls are clothed in drapes and cloths, and the whole place has a distinct indie vibe. At the counter, slouched, a goth \u2013 slick black hair, heavy eye makeup, black lipstick and nails against pale skin, spikes and studs on her top \u2013 is reading a tattoo magazine with disinterest. She pays you no attention as you walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening your posture into something more appropriate, you walk over, your faux-daughter in tow. The attendant is nothing like Jimmy described; in her early twenties, she's not conventionally pretty, with a nose that's a little too wide, and a tiny, thin frame. But if that's who he wants to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d you say, Mrs Hunt's voice slipping out. The goth looks up, surprised that someone else is in the store; she didn't even notice you come in. \u201cMy daughter saw your sign about having her fortune told. How much is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat,\u201d says a dramatic, honeyed, Eastern European voice from behind you, \u201cdepends on the fortune.\u201d The goth girl smiles and directs you with her eyes, and as you turn you spot the true owner of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy's earlier description doesn't do her justice. The woman is in her mid-thirties you would imagine, dusky and statuesque, dressed in a shimmering, flowing robe of a deep, midnight blue. Rich dark hair hangs long over her shoulders, curling black locks accented by large, gold hoop earrings. She walks forward with a strange, flowing elegance, her large, passionate eyes appraising you. Jimmy's right \u2013 she's hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say, startled for a moment, and trying not to let you attraction slip through your mask. \u201cWell, that should be fine. It's a treat, after all.\u201d You smile warmly at Jessica, who grins back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks mom!\u201d Jimmy exclaims. \u201cThis is going to be awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the young lady?\u201d The teller asks, smiling as she indulges Jessica's apparent excitement. \u201cVery well. Step this way...\u201d she casts her arm behind her, lifting a veiled area behind the store. You watch as the two depart into the private booth, and begin to walk around the store to see if you can't find a book on the pens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes pass. Your search is fruitless. There's loads of books on pop mysticism, but if there's any genuine magic stuff here, it's being kept somewhere out of sight. As for Jimmy's idea of having your pick of customers, the store doesn't seem to get much traffic. Not that the goth could tell; she's so engrossed in her magazine she doesn't seem to even be aware if you're still present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to despair when a possible candidate for your switch walks in, and enquires about having her fortune told. She's as striking as the store attendant, yet in a completely different way. She's clearly part of the vintage set, in her mid-twenties, with bright orange-red hair, piled up and twisted in two ornate curls with a bow accessory, and makeup straight out of the 1940s. She's wearing a black and white polka dot sun dress, sporting a delicate handbag and, urgh, heels. Still, she's attractive, and could be an interesting life to step into...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, I think someone else is with Madame Elena,\u201d the assistant replies, a little uncertain \u2013 she's been lost in her magazine again. But, before the next customer can reply, 'Elena' steps out from behind the curtain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's all right, Wendy,\u201d she says, in the same exotic voice as before, not a hair out of place. \u201cThe young lady departed some time ago. I shall be ready to attend to our guest momentarily.\u201d She steps forward, the same elegant, flowing way as before, and walks over to you. You arch your brow; is it the real Elena, or Jimmy? She leans forward conspiratorially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right dude,\u201d she hisses in a low tone. \u201cStep one complete.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it is Jimmy! How has his acting improved, and how did he know the store attendant's name? Did he use the brown pen, or did he just ask some careful questions in the booth? You need answers, although not in the middle of the store. 'Madame Elena' flashes her most mysterious smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think? Want to go goth? Or that customer's pretty hot. How about being her? The store shuts in 15 minutes, then we can head out, or check the back room for something about the pens.\u201d</span></div></div>",

There's an eerie silence from inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough. Silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...Madame Elena?\u201d you ask, edging closer but staying in character. Still silence. You step up to the curtain, and are about to head inside when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEek!\u201d Denise Hunt's high-pitched squeal comes out of your lips as you try to move back. Suddenly you're falling, tumbling on the heels, landing hard on your shapely ass. From the floor you stare up in horror. Elena's deflated face hangs loose through the curtain, sagging around the mouth. Jessica's head pops out immediately afterward, bursting with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome inside, dude,\u201d Jimmy says, Elena's head hanging from Jessica's chest like a Halloween mask. You stagger to your feet, appalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJimmy! You're...wearing both of them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shrugs, parts away Elena's locks, and ducks her head back inside. With a few pats and presses later, and a quick reshifting of her jaw, 'Elena' has returned. \u201cSo?\u201d she asks, eyes gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Jimmy! Where's the respect? These are people! People with real lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is Mrs Hunt, doesn't stop you walking around in her body, wearing her clothes, right down to her bra and panties. Don't be a hypocrite, we're playing with different rules now. Come on. Get inside and check this out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you straighten yourself, and, rubbing your sore legs, shift Mrs Hunt's body behind the curtain. Inside the customer's collapsed body hangs off the chair where she had been sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound out what the brown pen does,\u201d Jimmy confides, flicking his robes as he walks around to take a seat opposite the woman. He gets out the brown pen, points it at her, and clicks. He shakes for a moment, as if receiving an electric shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right. This is how you improve your disguise! The brown pen does some kind of... scan. You point it at someone, and it gives you... not their memories. But you get the essential information. She's... her name is Phoebe. Phoebe Callis. Age 26. She's a photographer... and  lives with her girlfriend Sam. Her cell's pin is 6790. And...\u201d he frowns. \u201cIt doesn't stay, the info begins to fade pretty quickly. It only fixes when you put the skin on, I think. Like, I know how to act like 'Madame Elena'. Her real name's Helen Morrison, by the way. If you scanned Phoebe here, took her form, you could pass for her well enough. And you should totally do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was always the plan, but as you dig your nails under Denise Hunt's bob and pull her flesh loose, you can't help but worry about Jimmy. This is going straight to his head. You unbutton your blouse, slip off your dress, get out of the heels, and begin to peel away Mrs Hunt's body. Jimmy doesn't seem to think this requires any privacy, but eventually leaves you alone, closing the store as Elena would \u2013 it closes several hours earlier than the rest of the mall for some reason - and raiding her till. You brush down Mrs Hunt's shapely thighs and belly fat, pulling the skin down your legs, before finally stepping out of her skin. You reach for the brown pen, pick it up, point it at Phoebe and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock startles you. You had seen Jimmy's reaction, but it's as if you've stood on a live wire. Then, as soon as its over, you find your mind flooded with information. Facts, figures, dates, measurements, pin numbers, passwords. Not memories \u2013 there's nothing about Phoebe's life \u2013 just her personal data, as though you've tapped into some kind of personal intranet. It's already beginning to fade as you pick up the skin, holding up the empty, hollow husk close to your own face, breathing in her perfume. In a moment, this will be your face; is this what identity is? When you step in, are you really David, or Phoebe? You will certainly be strikingly attractive: a thin, proud nose, high cheek bones, and curled hair still fixed with spray. Phoebe's look is pretty unique, although with your knowledge you know how to replicate it. You look at the rest of the skin, and its slight imperfections: the mole on her neck, a spot on her back, roots revealing where she dyes her hair to achieve its luminous orange. Then you step inside, and find your own body vanishing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, here's the deal,\u201d Jimmy says from behind the curtain, his words muddied by Elena's European flair. \u201cI'm thinking of staying as Elena for a while. This is one hot body, after all, and the store is ideal as a base. Plus, if the pens are real, what else is going to be real? I need to find out more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're sure the pens are magical?\u201d you ask, tugging Phoebe's head over your own, coughing slightly as your voice transforms into her chirpy tones and your face pinches into her form. \u201cIt could be some kind of government technology.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my attic? Dude. Actually... shit. Why was this in my attic? Good point, man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a mystery,\u201d you say, checking your reflection in the crystal ball, patting your hair into place just as the real Phoebe would to make sure her appearance is just right, before beginning to don her clothes. \u201cWe should find that out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jimmy says. \u201cI need to look into that; maybe ask my mom. Look dude, how about you take the pens for a while, see if you can't create some trouble? Learn how to be someone else.\u201d He pokes his head through the curtain, appraising your half-naked body. \u201cNice, dude. She's a real find.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're not so bad yourself,\u201d you tease, emulating Phoebe's most seductive grin. Wow...that brown pen really did work. You have her muscle memory too, you think. Heels won't be a problem now. You finish donning her bra, and reach for the sun dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Anyway, get dressed, go home, see your girlfriend, live 'your' life. I'll stay here for a bit, see if I can't find out what's going on. We'll meet outside Jessica's at midnight. I'll bring Jessica and Denise here so we can restore 'em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evening as Phoebe is a tempting prospect, and you'll have the pens \u2013 there's no reason to stay as her if you don't want to. On the other hand, you're getting worried about Jimmy. He's messing with something neither of you understand, and seems keen to abandon his own life. And the way he's talking about the skins... it's like he's forgotten they are not costumes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A strange thought takes hold as you walk through the mall, toward the carpark and your \u2013 or at least your current body's \u2013 car. You play your part, acting as you think Phoebe would, looking at some rings and accessories in a display, and suddenly you're reminded of a lesson Miss Franklin gave last term. Franklin, who is right now having her wedding dress fitted somewhere above you (who has a bridal shop in a shopping mall?). If it weren't for her presence in the mall, and the rings, the thought would never have occurred to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShort, thin, with mousy brown hair constantly tied in a ponytail and thick glasses, Franklin always gives off a bookish, librarian vibe. She's apparently a bit more relaxed outside of school, but in front of a class she's only really passionate when teaching you about Greek history; the rest of the time she looks like she wants to hide. Franklin and rings... then it hits you. The Ring of Gyges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to think. You straighten Phoebe's dress, tuck your handbag, pens inside, under your arm and head to the restrooms. There, pretending to touch up your makeup in the mirror, you try and remember the lesson. There are two others with you. In one corner a blonde college girl (she's wearing her college sweater) is talking animatedly to a friend on the phone. She's slightly chubby, and is constantly flicking at her short pixie crop hair; you guess she's just had it done. An attractive, severe-looking businesswoman, black hair swirling down onto a sharp Italian suit, is checking her handbag. She looks in her early 40s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyges, you try and remember. He was a shepherd. He found a cave with a ring in it. So far so normal, but then he basically turned into Gollum. The ring let him turn invisible, and he used his power to seduce the queen, kill the king and seize the kingdom. The message in the story? Man is only moral when he can get caught. Power corrupts. Like the power Jimmy's given you, handing over the pens into your keeping. Maybe it hasn't corrupted him fully, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now the pens are yours. You frown, contemplating your power, the pens' power, for a moment. Phoebe's perfect brow wrinkles too, squishing her \u2013 your \u2013 elegant, thin nose. Then another thought hits you, and Phoebe's lipstick-stained lips twist into a perfect, shocked O.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if it isn't Jimmy? You never considered that before. Jimmy showed that he could be Elena and Jessica at the same time; why not a third suit? What if someone wanted you to have these pens, and has been masquerading as your prank-loving friend to get them to you? It would explain why you were virtually led on a tour of what the pens could do, and why he handed such power over so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare deep into Phoebe's face, trying to think about what to do. You could continue out of the mall as Phoebe, of course; you know you could pass as her easily, and the idea of spending an evening playing at being her gives you a rush of excitement. But what if your helper isn't really Jimmy? Perhaps you should think about slipping back to the shop, perhaps even in a different skin, and tailing 'Madame Elena', or 'Jessica', or 'Jimmy', or whatever face they're wearing. The idea that your friend just happened to find these pens in his attic feels too convenient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish your touch-up. The businesswoman and college girl are still there. And, just as you're wondering what to do, Miss Franklin - the cause of your dilemma - walks in too, laughing to herself about something one of her friends must have said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to make like Gyges,\u201d you mutter. The question is, do you stay as Phoebe and enjoy your evening, or swap your disguise and tail 'Jimmy'?</span></div></div>",

Yet? <br>\r\nYou put such idea in the back of your mind. He feels like the same guy. There is a bigger fish to fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, the girl of Phoebe, is a beautiful woman of age 27. She is hard worker who in the cusp of getting an MBA.  A girl who was the daughter of hard working hispanic immigrants. She had just come back from a recent trip from Wall Street recruiting trip. Sam was about to make bank and Phoebe was glad to be along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had been in tremendous trouble with her parents for being her. At the age of 17 she had meet Phoebe. She had known Phoebe for since they were children. They had been inseparable and the closest of friends. Neither had luck with boyfriends. They had finally experimented at age 17 and finally met each other, truly .  Until Sam\u2019s mom had walked in on them in the dark in the buff and Phoebe had blurted \u201cWe\u2019re not gay or anything\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir parents were furious with them. It was the late 90s  and being Gay was not easy. DOMA has just passed and Matthew Shepard had been killed, being LGBT is not easy now, but it was harder then.  Phoebe\u2019s parents were evangelicals and Sam\u2019s had been with Catholicism for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Phoebe were given an ultimatum. Give up this relationship or their parents would kick them out. The girls chose each other. Looking back at Phoebe's memories you wonder how they were this strong to resist their parents. They left home and never looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you and Jimmy be that strong? Huh? You think. Where did that come from. You too push that thought from your mind because you approach Phoebe\u2019s and Sam\u2019s door.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI'm sorry about this,\u201d you say in the bathroom stall, addressing the crumpled skin on the floor as you twist Phoebe's frame to remove her clothes. You lingered, you waited, and your new disguise lies on the floor: the last of the three women to leave the restroom. You need to find out if your mentor really is Jimmy, or if he was just a disguise in some elaborate game. That means you can't stay as Phoebe. Attractive though she is, it's an instantly recognizable face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully you reach up behind your retro hairstyle and pull Pheobe's fine, sculpted face away from your own. You edge out of her neck, her shoulders, her pert breasts and flat stomach, before peeling away the lower half of the costume. Then you reach for your new identity - the chubby blonde college girl with the short haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to your stolen information from the brown pen, she's Lucy Binder, a sociology major. You step into her skin, and despair as your feet shrink then bulge. Lucy's not a small girl, and as you pull up her torso you watch your waist grow and expand, her large breasts falling loose as you slip into the arms. Finally comes the head; you tug the pixie crop back, gargling slightly as your cheeks fill out and your mouth reshapes to take on your new teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Lucy. You need to get to the gym.\u201d Your new voice, so perky, sounds alien as you pinch the fat around your new waist. You begin to put on her clothes, gather your belongings, and, with the coast clear, open the stall so you can sort out Phoebe. Moments later you've dressed the skin and shoot the beautiful woman you once were again. You leave as she begins to reinflate back to her own self, no doubt confused how she's ended up in a toilet cubicle, but otherwise unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right,\u201d Elena strides through the car park, drawing on a cigarette as she talks on a cheap, disposable mobile phone. \u201cHe bought it hook, line and sinker.\u201d Her posture is relaxed, uncaring: anyone who looks at her would see just a middle-aged fortune teller returning home. Of course it's not really Elena but nobody else would know that, even if the casual words and phrases sound strange in her exotic accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody except you. Bubbly, unobtrusive Lucy Binder, still talking nonsense on her phone to her friend (of course you're only pretending), flicking her new hairstyle as she discusses Todd Hendricks and how he is \u201cso divine\u201d - all the while listening to Elena's every word as she walks through the car park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I've let the kid have fun. If we're going to recruit him, he needs to understand the real power of it. He's found some pretty young thing, and he'll be spending the night as her. If you want my guess, he'll find the whole damn experience so intoxicating he'll jump at the chance to come on board. I remember my first time as someone else. Wow, what a rush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn board? Lucy's voice slows as you strain to listen, forgetting your masquerade for the moment. You were right. The Ring of Gyges; whoever's been impersonating your friends was hoping to get you hooked on swapping identities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was easy,\u201d Elena takes a drag on her cigarette, blowing out smoke in a stream as she fumbles for her keys. \u201cFirst his friend Jimmy. Some prankster, so he bought the persona I put on. Then his girlfriend for the shock reveal. I swapped out at the mall; used that Madame Elena again... yeah, yeah. What can I say? I like her body and know her routine; hell, I've lived it often enough. I've already restored the Jimmy kid; left him at the mall wondering what the hell was going on. Put the girlfriend and her mom in the car earlier. I'll head to Elena's, slip into mom's skin and return them home. Promised the kid we'd meet up at the witching hour, mom's skin will be fine for that. I'll get the C-Set back then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stranger \u2013 you have no idea who they are, or what they want \u2013 scratches an itch under Elena's curling hair. Your mind is racing, and so are Lucy's legs as you struggle to keep up. You're breathing heavily a little from the added weight; as you feared, your new body isn't that fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stranger reaches Elena's car and opens up the boot. You can just about see two large bags with what looks like wigs and clothes inside: Jessica and Denise Hunt. Elena's dusky face nods to whoever's on the phone, flicking the cigarette away, before closing the boot up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure he'll go for it. We've been scouting him for a while now; he'd make an outstanding recruit. Yeah, I was thinking of revealing it all to him tonight. Let him enjoy his evening. Yeah... I'll check in once I've made the offer. He accepts, I'll take him to the safe house straight away. He refuses... you know how that goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour - or at least Lucy's - eyes widen. The Stranger still hasn't noticed Lucy's portly frame walking toward the car, which means you've got options. There's no way you're going to wait until midnight after what you've got heard. Either you can confront whoever's wearing Elena's face now, or you use one of the pens.</span></div></div>",

The fortune teller's body turns around, a look of both amusement and surprise on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll call you back,\u201d she says to the phone, ending the call and placing her hands on her mature hips. Her eyes narrow as she appraises you, a look of mild amusement playing on her lips. For a moment the world turns silent, the only noise your nervous breath and Elena's hoop earrings, swinging like wind chimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the palmist's hands, with their dramatic nails, begin to clap slowly. \u201cOh,\u201d Elena's voice plays over the vowel. \u201cVery good. Very good indeed. We picked a good candidate in you. You're smarter than you look; at least, you're smarter than that face you're wearing looks. So stay smart, and don't do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll do it,\u201d you say, shaking a little. Adrenaline is coursing through Lucy's frame now. At least the imposter didn't even pretend he was Jimmy or Jessica or anyone else you know. No obfuscation, just business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena's face smiles. \u201cI really wouldn't. Honestly, David? You've made a mistake. The end result was going to be the same, but you've just missed a night of passion pretending to be that pretty young thing you left as. Nice choice of skin, by the way. I'd never have suspected her. Where did you switch? And are you still wearing Phoebe underneath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe toilets, and I let her go. She has a life! You can't just treat people like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena raises a quizzical eye. \u201cNo? Who's going to stop us? David, you have no idea how deep this goes. What the point of it is. The pen you're holding right now? Just the start. It's a clich\u00e9, David, but this really is about saving the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit. It's about getting your kicks being someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour interruption brings a shake of the head. \u201cA perk, not the point. Get in the car and I'll explain it all. I'd rather not discuss this in a carpark; Elena's robes aren't exactly the warmest choice of clothing, and I don't want anyone overhearing our little chat. Think about what anyone would see if they came upon us. Some chubby college girl pointing a pen at a fortune teller? It's going to look strange, isn't it? Might raise suspicions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot furtive looks to the left and right. Elena's completely in control, while you feel as though your world is crashing down. You're in way over your head and you know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't have a choice. Think about it, David. You turn me into a skin, you'll never get any answers. What are you going to do, keep Elena's skin in your wardrobe? Throw it away and effectively kill her? Wear her, and abandon your own life? Let me go, or hold me hostage? You're out of options. And what are you going to do when the others come for you? You know there's more of us, you heard my call. One day you'll come home and your mom, or your dad, or your sister, is going to be someone else. Maybe they're already someone else. You didn't think of that, did you? Maybe we've been watching you for weeks, assessing you. Maybe one of us is under the skin of that tomboy friend of yours, Trish. You have no idea, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrust the pen out, trying to look threatening. Elena laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're wearing a different face, but your fear's still all over it. If you shoot me now, you're going to be on the run for the rest of your life. You'll never be able to go home. You'll never get any answers. You'll be hunted for the rest of your days by an unseen force who can literally be anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as well as we can. Do you think it stops with two pens? Really, David? Don't you think we'd start a beginner with training wheels, first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena takes a step forward, hand out, beckoning for the pen. \u201cAnd don't you think we'd protect ourselves against being turned into skins ourselves, somehow? So give me the pen and let's talk. Trust me, you're being recruited for something with a higher purpose. It's a great honor, one worth accepting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena's contradicting herself, her story shifting as fluidly as her appearance today. Already she's been three people, and none of them the true identity underneath. You're not getting answers, just hypotheticals. Your family has or hasn't been replaced. The pen will or won't work. The truth is you have no idea, but the questions have sent your thoughts into a tailspin. Lucy's flabby arms are trembling now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear of just what this shadowy organization could do. There doesn't seem to be a limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've only got two choices: You could go for the shot and spend the rest of your life in hiding. Elena's conversation has already betrayed the fact she has another pen: how else would she have restored Jimmy? If your pen really is just 'training wheels', you can steal her version of this 'C-Set'. You'd have to abandon your old life, though; either leave town and spend your life pretending to be other people, or live in hiding nearby as someone else, watching over your friends and family, never sure if it's really them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's assuming the pen works on your opponent. Firing it could be a death sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you can drop the pen and accept Elena's offer. That way your family and friends would be safe and you'd get all the answers you could want. You're being recruited for something, which is both exciting and enticing; you'd enter a world that very few know about. But you also feel like you'd be making a pact with the Devil, entering into some unknown agreement for an unknown purpose. It's unlikely you'd get to stay in your current life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's the morality of it. Stealing someone's body and identity is the ultimate intrusion, and turning them into a costume permanently is, in effect, murder. It's clear that's what this organization is all about. Can it be justified? Where do you draw the line?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether you fire or not, your world is never going to be the same again.</span></div></div>",

A confrontation with a clandestine organisation which you know nothing about with the power to take over people's lives seemingly seamlessly.  There was no guarantee that the person wearing Elena's form wouldn't've just killed you or had you replaced if you had handed over your only weapon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out she had been bluffing.  Elena crumples into a heap like any other person but when you sift through the skin and clothes, there's only one skin to be found.  She had been telling the truth.  The person underneath is just trapped in Elena's skin until you restore her.  There doesn't seem to be any method available to you to forcibly remove someone from their skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you do find is what is best described as a Parker pen box.  It is a nondescript black box which looks like it wouldn't be amiss in a stationary store which holds 5 pens.  The first two you recognise as the black and brown pens that Elena provided to you earlier that day.  There's also a red, blue and white pen in the box as well whose function is unknown to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adrenaline is pumping through your body.  You have just made a big step in shooting the only person that might have spared you.  Your only choice now to go on the run.  You look up and see Jessica's lifeless skin in the boot of Elena's car.   </span></div></div>",

As much as you'd like to take Jessica with you, something tells you this road isn't one that you want to drag someone else on. You're never going to be able to go back to your old life. You're never going to see your parents or friends again - at least not with your own face. Throwing Jessica into the same type of life just seems cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly throw Elena's skin into the boot of the car and hop in, taking off. Your instinct is to swap with someone else, and quickly: swap with someone that isn't linked to anyone. Right now you're wearing Lucy, but she's too traceable. So is the car you're driving in: you'll need a better form of transportation. Jessica and her Mom's car is still at the mall, but that's not suitable either. And you still need to return them to life. Hopefully when you return them to life, they'll chalk it up to some joyriding kid and forget about the whole strange circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first stop is to return Jessica and her mom, and that means parking in a street a whole two blocks away from your own. You pull up, slip all five pens into your pockets, grab the bag containing Jessica and her mom, and head for a nearby broken fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, with a little difficulty, you duck through, forcing a way through an overgrown, long-ignored garden. You know exactly where you're going. A sidestep down an alley, an awkward climb up a sheltered porch roof, and Lucy's chubby form has slipped into Jessica's room: it's an old route you've used to visit her without her parents knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou creep into the room. Downstairs you can hear the TV, and what sounds like Katie talking on the phone. Great. First, you take out Jessica, dumping her on her bed. Then, tiptoeing across the hallway, you return Denise. You shoot her with the black pen, watch as she returns to life, and bring the door to a close.Then it's Jessica's turn. You climb halfway out of the window, Lucy's form struggling where you would have made an exit with ease, and point the pen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Jess,\" you say solemnly. For her own safety, you're never going to be able to see her again. You level the black pen and fire. Then you're slipping back down, across the porch, and along your secret path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the hole in the fence, you stop dead in your tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena's car, 'Elena' still in the boot, is gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea who took it. Maybe it's them. Maybe it's some opportunist car thief about to have the shock of his life. Either option is terrifying. Your blood runs cold. Lucy's arms well up to gooseflesh. Your eyes dart around, looking at every corner, window, shadow. Is this a trap? You press yourself up against the fence and look through the cracks. There are a few people in the street. An old man is watering his plants. A businessman is speaking on his phone. A phone engineer is fixing a junction box. They could be anyone. Anyone. The thought haunts you. It probably will keep haunting you for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do the only thing you can. You run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in the middle of town, drinking a coffee, shaking like a leaf. Somehow you managed to slip away without anyone noticing, but you can't stay as Lucy forever: you're going to have to swap skins. The only question is who with. There's literally hundreds of choices. You could zap any one of the coffee bar's patrons, from the barista himself, to the athletic blonde in the corner, dressed in a polo shirt emblazoned with the local gym's logo. You could cross the street, enter any of the shops and become the owner for a little while. There's even Officer O'Sullivan, looking bored as ever in her police car parked outside. You could easily draw her somewhere and zap her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of those options involve staying in town, taking on someone's life. And what if they can detect you, somehow? There's too many flaws in the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to make a clean break. There are options for that, of course. You know there's a concert tonight: some pop-rock singer and her group. There's bound to be someone there you could become - maybe even someone in the band. They're touring, so you've got the perfect escape route. Alternatively, there's the local museum - some famous art collection. At weekends it's always drawing a crowd; people even come from overseas to visit it. It might be the ideal place to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if you were to become someone else, what pen do you use? Black turns a person into a costume, Brown scans their personal details so you can impersonate them more easily. But what about red, blue and white? Maybe one of them turns someone into a suit that lets you access the person's memories. Maybe one of them is a cloning device, meaning you don't have to steal someone's life - just their appearance. Or maybe they do something even stranger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you have is questions. One thing is for sure, though: you can't stay as Lucy a minute longer. </span></div></div>",

That way you can check the situation, work out what the pens do, and see if you can rescue your friends from being worn as expendable disguises. You know they've impersonated Jimmy and Jessica... who else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you know anything about hiding (and you'd like to think you've seen enough trashy movies to have an idea), it's to hide in plain sight. They'll be checking for people leaving town somehow - it's what anyone smart would do. They'll also probably take over your family, too: maybe Tina or Nick. The ideal option for you is to hide somewhere in between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hits you. You know just the person they'll never suspect. A person who's close enough to let you keep tabs on both your family and your friends. You'll be the one person 'Elena' actually <i>suggested</i> you become. They'll never suspect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens slowly. \"Yes? Can I help you?\" Miss Franklin is applying curling tongs to her hair as she opens the door, still dressed as you saw her earlier: conservatively. You look into her hotel room: it's a double, but she seems the only occupant. Lucy's lips widen in a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it's the other way round. I saw you drop something at the mall earlier, I thought I'd return it. I heard you and your friends talking about this hotel, so I thought I'd track you down, see if there's a reward or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranklin looks confused. \"Wow. Uhm... that's very kind of you to track me down like this. But I really don't think I did lose anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Because I found this pendant, with a metal guy's face on it, next to a sink, and...\" You know Miss Franklin always wears a pendant with a little Alexander the Great on it. She's not wearing it now, and while it wasn't dropped, you're hoping the confusion is enough to buy you time. Franklin looks concerned for a moment and sets down the tongs, rushing to check her shoulder bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into her room, close the door, and fire the brown pen. \"Sorry, miss,\" you mumble. Before she's turned around, before you've recovered from the storm of information flooding your mind, you fire the black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" you say, rubbing Lucy's brown with the brown pen as you recover from the shock. \"I always thought her name was Hannah.\" It's not - it's Vanessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you strip out of Lucy's clothes. You're about to remove her overweight body and don Franklin's skin when you pause, and wonder what the other pens do. You pull out the red one, point it at Franklin, and fire. Nothing happens. You point and fire again. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the red one's a load of crap,\" you shrug. Next, white. As you point, you realise it's got two settings: there's a way to switch the buttons. Hmm. It's more complex than the others, so you decide to leave it. Instead, you level the blue and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head spins. Right now you have your own personality and thoughts, but there are two others, vying for a place. Franklin's mannerisms and essential details, and... Lucy's memories. All of them. You remember her cat Pogo, hit by a car ten years ago. The shame and embarrassment every time you - no, she - looks in a mirror. You remember Marie, and Vincent, and your highschool romance. Wow...so that's the blue pen. Memories! Seized with this useful information, and aware the brown pen's information is beginning to fade, you finally slip out of your Lucy shell, and head over to Franklin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're finished climbing inside, you pick up her glasses and slip them on. The room turns from a fuzzy blur to vivid clarity, and you look at yourself in the mirror. The naked, short, mousy-brown haired woman facing you looks as if she just wants to duck into her shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the blue pen and fire it, her memories flooding in. You remember her childhood on the other side of the country, the teasing calls of other girls as you ignored sports and focused on Greek history. You remember falling head over heels for the ancient heroes, until one day your own hero - Ian - arrived to sweep you off your feet. You remember your excitement at his proposal, and for your girl's night on the town tonight - your memories tell you she's nowhere near as quiet as she is in class. Vanessa's smile widens as you recall the reason she gave you the grades she did... and her perspective on all the goofing you and Jimmy did when you were supposed to be studying. You're amazed how much of it she knew, and never spoke of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't have time for this. You need to get ready. You pick up the tongs, and begin to finish your hair and makeup. Then you slip on your revealing dress for the night: a white ruffle-skirt dress. The moment you finish zipping it up, you realize just how stunning Miss Vanessa (Nessa to her friends) Franklin actually is: her meekness has hidden a true beauty right under your nose. You hope it will do the same for your pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, and don the \"Bride to be\" sash and cheap, rhinestone tiara the girls brought you earlier, getting into character. With her memories, mannerisms and personal information, nobody will be able to tell you're not Nessa Franklin: you could even fool her fiance or family if you wanted. You're safe for the time being, and the sensible thing to do seems to be to pretend to be her tonight until you can get time to think. After tonight, you've got a day to recover and plan out your move before 'you' return to teaching: and spying on Trish and Jimmy to keep them safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's still the question of what to do about Lucy, too. You can't leave the poor girl as a deflated skin in a hotel room, can you? And your bachelorette party is about to begin...</span></div></div>",

The concert would probably have more people to mingle with but it would be an absolute mess, filled with awkward teens and large crowds.  It would be difficult to zap someone inconspicuously there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go to the museum.  You enter with trepidation, a famous art collection filled with Monet and other artists who you know nothing about.  The coffee hasn't calmed your nerves in the way you had hoped.  The fact that you are being forced to look for someone's life to hide in isn't exactly a soothing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a solemn quiet in the museum.  Normally the place is filled with kids running around giggling and pointing at giant dinosaur skeletons and other exhibits but the art collection has attracted a different kind of crowd.  A number of distinguished guests have come for the grand opening of this multimillion dollar art display and you feel completely out of place in your Lucy skin and college sweater.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRich socialites and other upper class snobs give you odd glares as you walk around, trying futilely to blend in with the crowd.  Maybe the concert would have been a better choice and its no wonder the entrance guard gave you an odd look as you walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pretending to admire the artwork, you notice a stunning woman who gives you a strange little smile.  Unlike the other people who have either ignored you or turned up their noses at you, she gives you a knowing smile and approaches you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'allo,\" she says in a lilting French accent, \"Here to admire the artwork?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod meekly, curious but also suspicious of this beautiful woman who has approached you.  She is dressed in a midnight blue cocktail dress which accents her curves in all the right ways and has topped it off with a black cardigan-like jacket and high heels.  Her long dark brown hair is carefully accented with light reds and oranges and her piercing green eyes look like they're staring into your very soul.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou introduce yourself as Lucy Binder and she tells you her name is Gabrielle Rieu, an exchange student from France.  She explains that she's seen you in some of her sociology classes which of course, you have no recognition of because the brown pen does not give any memories, and she wanted to introduce herself as her night thus far had been a non-stop flow of young rich males hitting on her and uncultured socialites who shunned her for actually turning up for the art.  The two of you hit it off, and you somehow manage to fudge your way through facts that Lucy should know that you two talk about.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been about half an hour since you started talking and it feels like you two are friends now.  Gabrielle excuses herself to go to the bathroom and you follow her, saying you need to use the loo as well.  The bathroom is surprisingly empty and you quietly lock it behind yourself.  Although she has been kind and friendly towards you, you know you have to do.  Just as she's about to enter the stall, you pull out the black pen and whisper a quiet apology before zapping her into a pile of skin and clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze upon the skin in your hands, you contemplate what to do.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While it would be simpler to just put on Gabrielle's skin, you realise that since you're on the run, it would be a lot easier if you figured out what the other pens could do.  After all, they could have abilities which would make it a lot easier for you to hide from your unknown pursuers.  You pull the red, white and blue pens from your pocket and examine them.  Other than the colour, there's little difference between them and the other two pens you've been using already.  Just making a choice at random, you pick the blue pen and press the button while aimed at Gabrielle's skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your brain is filled with memories.  Not Gabrielle's, but Lucy's.  Flashes, no it wouldn't be accurate to call them flashes.  Clear memories of her life fill her mind starting from the most recent ones.  You remember her talking to her bestie Marie in the carpark while bitching about your boyfriend Vincent.  You remember her first kiss with her high school sweetheart Jason.  You remember her disdain that she feels when she looks at her chubby body in the mirror.  It all floods into your mind.  What hasn't seemed to come is her personality, but the brown pen gives you an instinct on how to act like the person you're wearing.  The addition of these memories would make your impersonation basically flawless unless you slipped up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's the blue pen, a pen that gives you the memories of whoever you're already wearing.  You hold the red pen in your hands and are about to try it when there's a knock on the door.  Startled, you put the pens away in Gabrielle's clutch and grab at the back of your Lucy head.  Pulling her face away from yours, strip quickly out of her clothes and body as you hear a woman's voice complaining to a guard that the bathroom door is locked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you are naked again and its somewhat disconcerting to feel all your male parts after spending so long as women today.  You don't have time to use the brown pen on Gabrielle so you set to work putting on her body.  Stepping into her skin as your body is sculpted into her skin into a fine lithe specimen of female kind.  Your torso shrinks into a curvy but slim form and your breasts, while not huge enough to be an inconvenience, are still sizable enough that you knew many of the males were checking out Gabrielle in the gallery.  Finally, the head piece goes on and you check out your reflection in mirror and admire her stunning beauty.  In any other circumstance, you would find the excitement of slipping into her life to be incredibly arousing but considering your circumstances, you refrain from doing anything unnecessary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze into her tight dress and don her clothes before dressing Lucy into her own clothes.  Just before the door opens, you manage to zap Lucy, hide the black pen in your new clutch and press the button on the blue pen which gives you Gabrielle's (her friends call her Gabby) memories.  A guard and a dumb looking socialite enter the bathroom as you exclaim.  You explain that your friend suddenly collapsed on the floor and you have no idea why the door was locked.  Neither of the two are suspicious as Lucy wakes up dazzled and confused at her whereabouts.  After all, the last thing she remembers is talking to her friend in a parking lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gabrielle, you excuse yourself after Lucy has been moved to a first aid room still babbling and confused and leave the museum in your Renault.  Your new memories tell you that your family is rich and that you've been spoilt senseless by their wealth.  Unlike most college students, you have your own private apartment not far from college and no roommate to disturb you.  It's big and well furnished and it doesn't take long for you to get there and collapse on the couch exhausted.  Before long, you've fallen asleep from all the stress and excitement of the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to the sunlight shining across your face.  The presence of long brown hair confuses you a little but then you remember that you're still wearing Gabby's skin from last night.  Sitting up groggily, you sweep your sleek hair out of your face before heading to the bathroom for a shower, your memories telling you that you're running out of shampoo and should probably go pick some up.  The shower is divine, you slept all night in your make up (although in your opinion Gabrielle doesn't really need it) and didn't clean up before going to sleep.  As the warm water caresses your lovely body, you resist the urge to explore your new form as you remember this isn't really any time to place since you're on the run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dress in some comfortable trackies and head out to the dining room to think.  As you prepare a light breakfast (Gabrielle's body needs to stay in shape after all), you think about your options.  While you would probably enjoy being this young French woman at any other time, your memories tell you that she has a flight at the end of the week.  Semester break is coming up and you have a ticket back to Paris on Sunday to see your parents.  Today is Tuesday, so you still have to survive the rest of the week without being caught.  Besides, there's no guarantees that the shadowy organisation that you're on the run from doesn't already know you've taken Gabrielle's life or that their reach doesn't extend to France.  If there really was a group people who could live other people's lives, there's always a chance that they've replaced important figures in other countries as well.  There's just no way to be sure now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabrielle's memories also tell you that she has one last exam to sit on Thursday before she can fly out.  You would feel terrible making her fail this test especially since you can tell that she genuinely liked you when you interacted at the gallery.  Besides, you do plan to stay as her for a while despite your pangs of guilt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to:</span></div></div>",

With her memories, the impersonation is easy: you stop off at a coffee shop on the way to pick up her usual order, and make a mental note to pick up some shampoo when you head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Gabby!\" There's a call from the coffee house door. You don't recognize the voice, but Gabby's memories do: it feels almost dizzying to hold the two contradictory thoughts together. Cally Roberts: Gabby's - your - friend. A smile erupts across your beautiful lips as you turn to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonjour, Cally. We are well?\" Gabrielle always greets her friend this way - Cally seems to like it rather than the English equivalent - so you do so too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are! You heading to the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Per'aps later. I just felt like wearing something comfortable today; I was heading to ze library to study for dis stupid test on Thursday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally wrinkles her nose, falling into step as you both leave the coffee house. \"Yeah, that's going to suck. Don't sweat it, though. You've always been at the top of the class, you'll breeze it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel like it,\" you confess. Gabby is slightly more confident than you are, of course, but her memories tell you she always crams hard before a test. Gabby would go to the library to brush up, and if you're going to 'be' her for the week, you'll have to fall in line with her habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine. Promise. So, what'cha been up to? Did you end up at that art thing you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, it was remarkable\" you nod, suppressing a grin at your description. \"Art has a power to open your mind. Today, I feel like a different person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou talk to each other all the way to campus. Gabby's life is fun, relatively carefree, and easy to slip into. Her identity is your protection - a safety net against whoever had tried to recruit you. All is going well... until you reach campus. Then a chill runs through your stolen veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother is standing there, near the main entrance, looking a little lost. Not Gabrielle's mother - Mrs Rieu is in France after all. Your mother. Your real mother. First you feel faint, panicked and frightened. Then you feel Gabby's delicate hands tighten in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fuckers are wearing your own family, impersonating them, to track you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow your emotions, forcing a smile across your disguised face. How did they get here? You can only assume 'Elena' identified the college sweater. Fine... they're looking for Lucy, not you. This is a test. If you can hold your nerve and impersonate Gabrielle past this infuriating impostor, you'll be able to continue in her life until you can fly out. You keep talking to Cally, trying not to look at whoever's wearing your mother's face. Of course, that's almost impossible: the harder you try not to, the more you want to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, ladies?\" Your mother's voice rings out in the morning air. You and Cally both turn, startled that you're being addressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Cally asks. You arch Gabrielle's eyebrows in quizzical interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could help me, I'm trying to find the administrator's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she is. She's trying to track down Lucy. Where else would she go? You smile warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you say, wishing you had Gabby's mannerisms to slip into as you give directions. \"You head down the main path, den take a left, and it is that small red building down ze slope.\" You finish with a smile, even if you feel the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you\" your mother's voice says. \"You've been very helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Cally begin to walk away again. You hold your breath as you walk away, and pray your masquerade - however brief - was strong enough. Inside, you're in turmoil. But even a bead of sweat or a look back could give you away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've seen <i>The Great Escape</i> enough times to remember the climax. No, not Steve McQueen leaping fences with a motorbike. The moment when a simple slip gives the game away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, David!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn. \"Yes, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a horrible moment, like a knife twisting in your insides, as you realize just what you've done. The moment your guard was down, a simple question, relying on your gut instinct, has given you away. Your mother's body - worn by some unknown agent - grins. Your eyes, disguised as Gabrielle's, widen in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you.\" Your mother's voice is like ice. In her hand she's reaching up with something: a pen, perhaps. It doesn't matter. You're exposed on the campus, and they've cornered you perfectly. End of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Cally, Gabrielle's friend, standing at your side, looks utterly bewildered. \"Gabby, what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interruption gives you the chance you need. Gabby's strong - all that gym work pays off - and you grab the shocked Cally by the arm, catapulting her toward your mother's body. The impostor has gone for a perfect disguise, wearing heels, and is unable to resist the student sent flying in her direction. Cally and 'mom' go falling to the ground in a sprawl of limbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush forward, stooping down: not to help, but to grap the pen from your opponent's clutches. This one, is seems, has a whole raft of different colored buttons. Whatever; there's no way they'll be shooting you with it now. That gives you a brief head start. Gabby's body is compromized: you need to find a new home, and fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burst into a sprint, thankful you decided to dress in runner's clothing for the day. Behind, you hear aggravated screams and raised noises. Confusion from Cally, howls of frustration from the agent. Gabby will have some explaining to do with her friend once she's her true self, but that's the least of your problems right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've run for a good five minutes, down alleyways and through carparks. Gabby is fit, but you still have to catch your breath after pushing her body to the limit. Right now, you're drenched in sweat and your hair is a mess. You're also a little more than half a mile from your encounter. Options are running out. You slump down next to a dumpster, struggling to regain your breath, wiping sweat-drenched hair out of Gabrielle's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know this part of town a little. A little further on, you are sure, is the local hospital; it's a teaching hospital, so located conveniently near to the medical school. Right now your priority is a new face to hide behind, so that's definitely a possible destination: lots of patients, lots of staff, all coming and going. Trying to find you there, even if they work it out, would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Unless, of course, they have a way to track you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could go with the idea you planned before: head out of town. Gabrielle was too perfect a disguise to adopt at the museum and meant you staying in the vicinity, but your ultimate goal was to escape for good. The museum is on the other side of town, though, and you've already missed the concert, so that's not an option either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What about the theater? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. What theater? You have no idea what idea just popped into your...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Hicks Theater. There is a travelling show of Twelfth Night. Its last performance is today's matinee. Then they will be leaving.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp intake of breath, you realize that this is Gabrielle's mind, not yours. Gabby was - is - a cultured girl, into her art. She not only knows that only half a block from here is the back of the town's playhouse, but that the current performance is about to end. This is all news to you; you think the only time you've ever set foot in the place was on school outings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Gabby's cultured brain is imparting you all kinds of knowledge. Twelfth Night is a play where a woman pretends to be a man, only to fall in love. Part of her personality finds the idea of you assuming your next identity as one of the cast <i>hilarious</i>. You could make a great Olivia or Viola, and use your new body to slip out of town with the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just a question of turning right or left at the end of this alley.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The theatre is a good idea, but it's too far away and you need as much time as possible to find a face and establish an alibi. You get up, your chest heaving as you gasp for air as a result of your sprinting, you need an excuse to get attention in the hospital. Looking around the alley you're currently in, there's nothing around on the floor or any of the container, but you notice a small window next to a door leading into the back of the store right in front of you. You grit your teeth as you walk up to it, looking out at the street to make sure nobody's around. You shut your eyes and look away as your fist slams against the window, shattering it into a million pieces and rather loudly, but what did you expect. The pain stings like mad and when you open your eyes, blood trickles down your fingers, small shards of glass protruding from your knuckles. You hold your wrist and squeeze, biting your lip from the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hospital is just up ahead, you quickly pick up the pace from a moderate walk to a brisk glide, pushing open the door with your shoulder, you run up to the front desk, trying not to get blood all over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping in pain, the secretary looks at you, then to your hand, then back to you. She gets up and without saying a word, walks off briskly down the corridor nearby, yelling for another nurse. You smile and walk to a nearby chair, sitting down in it. A few seconds later, the secretary returns with another lady, she's rather young, slightly older than you. Judging by the look on her face when she sees your condition, she's probably a trainee. She's brought along a large sterilized tissue, ushering you up, the two of you proceed to a room nearby. The secretary however, returns to her desk, soon to be greeted by another ailed individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened?\" The nurse says as she cleans your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, I was at home fixing my window. Y'know, the do-it-yourself kind of thing.\" You lie, it's not the best cover story, but your hand's on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well it'll be alright, we'll get'cha patched up quickly.\" She says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return it warmly, she's a pretty woman. Lengthy black hair tied up, she's wearing the hospital's blue uniform. A cross with the pharmaceutical symbol behind it is emblazoned across her breast along with the hospital's name underneath it. \"St. Joseph Hospital\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sweetheart, we're gonna' have to disinfect it now.\" She places a bowl at your side, producing a bottle of peroxide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" You mumble, she giggles at your dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be all over soon, don't worry.\" You hear the cork of the bottle unscrew, and she nears you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grips your wrist gently and guides it over the bowl, tipping the bottle, she pours the chemical over your wound. You jerk your hand instinctively, yelping in pain. A mixture of crimson and white settles in the bowl. You sigh in relief, the pain starts to subside, but your hand is sore. The clanging of a metal tray  rings in your ears. The nurse approaches you with a tray bearing a pair of both large and small tweezers, settling them by your side. Picking up the large pair, she takes your hand and looks you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to remove the glass now, please stay as still as possible, alright?\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, let's get it over with..\" You reply, already irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the nurse plucks the shards of glass from your hand and you're surprised at how fast it ended. Luckily for you, most of the glass pieces were large and easy to remove, so she didn't have a hard time.  Cleaning up the resulting bleeding, she bandages your hand, tying it very tightly with the knot on the back of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" She says, dusting off her hands as she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the door, it's unlocked still. Hopping off the table prematurely as she walks to a nearby cabinet to put away her supplies. You make sure the door is properly shut and lock it, then turning around, brandishing the black pen from your pocket. The nurse is reaching up into the open cabinet, putting back the bottle of peroxide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" You whisper, pressing the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you're tying your hair back, looking down at the body of a pale, blonde girl who you just attended. She's passed out, and you're about to make that known. Opening the door, you run to a nearby doctor and grab his shoulder, a look of urgency clearly across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, my patient's passed out, I think she lost too much blood before getting here!\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright! Where is she?\" The doctor says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll lead you, this way!\" You say, turning around and heading back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Gabrielle groans as she rouses, her white bandages spotted with a circle of blood, you stand to the doctor's side as he examines her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems alright, must've been the shock.\" He says, putting away his stethoscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God, for a moment there, I thought I was about to get fired.\"You joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor snickers and shakes his head, \"Not at all, just make sure she gets out alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You say as he leaves, shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain to a confused Gabrielle her predicament, sending her on her way, albeit sadly. You knew you were going to miss Gabrielle, but there's no time for sentiment, you need to look and be inconspicuous. Walking out into the hallway with Gabrielle, you  almost freeze when you see your mother walk through the door. No, you're not going to make the same mistake twice. She spots Gabrielle and promptly walks up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, love, I'm here for her, I hope she's alright.\" Your mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who are you..?\" Gabrielle frowns, looking at your mother, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know this lady, Gabrielle?\" You ask, looking at Gabrielle's clearly bewildered expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't. I've never seen her in my life.\" She mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, of course you have. I'm here to take you back home.\" Your mother seems irritated now, you can hear it faintly in her well decorated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, but we're afraid we can't sign out any patients without any form of verification.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looks at you and frowns, then she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine. I'll call her father then.\" Your mother says, flipping out her phone. It's not the one she usually uses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to excuse me, I need to get back. Let the secretary help you, okay?\" You say, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She says complacently, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn from them and grin, walking down the corridor to the back where you're out of sight. You need to figure out a way to get out of here, you're tired of running and deserve a break at least. Suddenly, your thoughts are interrupted as a senior looking doctor bumps into you on the way down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry Natasha, didn't see you there.\" The Doctor says with a rather smug expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at him confused, judging by his tones, he knows you and is expecting a reaction. Shit, you forgot to use the brown and blue functions in your haste to settle things. You've got no idea who anybody in this building is. Your best bet is to supply him with a flexible reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you didn't, Doctor. I was in the middle of the road.\" You say, having been hugging the wall the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snaps you a look and smiles, leaning in suddenly, he whispers into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you meet me in my office in 5?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. I don't know. I'm kinda' busy.\" You say, trying to find excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not.\" He says, smiling, he turns and walks past you down the hallway to the secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to blue zap and fast, don't want another situation like that. Heading to the women's washroom, you enter a stall and close the door, pulling out the pen your mother had, it seems to be a combination of all the others. Perhaps the colour coded buttons serve to represent their functions. Aiming at your hand, you hit the blue button and just as planned, your skin's memories come flooding in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha Bellgrave, aged 26. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou absorb the information quickly, it's nothing new, but then you're amused by one little piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor that bumped into you in the hallway is your \"secret lover\". He and you regularly have affairs in his office made possible by his position in the hospital, as far as memories go, you think nobody else knows about it. His invitation was probably just a booty call. However, you find yourself aroused at the thought, remembering several heated moments shared with him whilst at work. You chuckle and leave the bathroom after freshening up. Making your way to his office, his name is Dr.Jack Fields, as is evident by his named painted across the frosted glass panel in his office door. Opening the door, you step inside and shut it behind you, locking it almost habitually. He's leaning back in his chair, at his desk, having a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to see me about Jack?\" You say, slowly advancing as you pull your shirt up and off, revealing your black lacy bra underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stares for a moment, and then grins in his smug manner. \"I wanted to see you about that thing you did the other day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\", you reply, dropping your shirt on the floor, you walk around the side of the desk slowly as he turns towards you. You climb up onto his rather large frame and straddle his lap, reaching behind your back, you unclip your bra. Shrugging the straps off, you allow him to gaze at your rather firm breasts, topped with nice brown nipples. \"What did I do the other day?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing at all.\" He puts his cup down on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, fishing the pen out from your pants pocket, leaning in subtly, you kiss him on the lips and jam the pen into his chest, pressing the first button, the black one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get out of here.\" You smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stride across the museum foyer again, letting your radiant hair willow out behind you. Even in track pants, Gabby looks stunning. That's only going to play to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished your breakfast and slipped the plates into the sink, an ugly thought had come to you. You had tried to trace exactly how the shadowy organisation could track you - and hit on a major snag. Nobody would suspect you are Gabrielle Rieu, but the 'Elena' imposter saw Lucy... and her college sweater. If the organization were half as good as they seem to be, they'd soon track down Lucy, zap her, work out where she had been with the blue pen. That would take them to the museum, and its security cameras. They'd be able to watch as your Lucy disguise followed Gabby into the bathroom. The rest is all too easy to work out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that, of course, depends on whether they identify Lucy, but you'd rather cover your bases. You're not ready to change skins yet, and if they can play that game, you can too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Allo, I was wondering if you could 'elp me?\" You give your most embarrassed smile as you arrive at the security desk. The guard, clearly bored from the lack of visitors on a weekday morning, gives you a helpful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, m'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was 'ere yesterday. You may remember me, my friend collapsed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard nods. \"Yeah. And the door was locked. I remember, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the commotion, I think I left my purse? I was wondering if it 'ad been 'anded in?\" You smile, and bat your eyelashes. It's not long before you're led to the security room. And, the moment the door is closed, you zap the guard for some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't collapse. Instead, he just stands there, dumbstruck. Not frozen, but with a vacant look on his face. You look down in your hand: you've used the white pen by accident. Shit... and you have no idea what it does. While he's stunned, you decide to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about dis,\" you say, Gabby's accent sounding even more apologetic than your real voice would. Quickly you hurry to the CCTV network. The DVD records are all kept in a row, the date clearly marked. You grab the relevant copy and pocket it. \"Just don't remember any of dis, OK?\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" the guard answers. You blink. Could that be what the white pen is for? Some kind of Jedi mind trick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't remember me or my friend from yesterday, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" Obviously this pen can wipe memories. You wonder what else it can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will remember we came 'ere to check lost property, but dat we did not find anything. Then you will forget dis ever 'appened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" You decide to see how far it goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand on one leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard doesn't move. You gulp, and look at the white pen. This has sinister implications. A pen that allows you to alter someone's memories?  It works like that thing in the Men in Black movies: just a chance to make people forget what they've seen. In the wrong hands - the organization's, for example - this could have terrible possibilities. Fortunately, you're not an asshole. You're just on the run, and out of options. You're not going to abuse this power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou level the white pen again, firing. The guard blinks and looks around, first at his surroundings, then at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?\" he says, confused. \"Sorry, I must have been a world away. Anyway, sorry we couldn't find anything. Guess you lost it somewhere else, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you smile bashfully. \"Thank you for your 'elp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the museum, figuring your tracks are at least covered now. But there's still the question of whether you live Gabby's life for the next week. You could always head back to campus and prepare for her test. Alternatively, you could head to the college administration building. You're confident enough with your Gabby memories and acting skills you could claim a family member has fallen ill, cry some fake tears and get a pass on her paper. She's wealthy enough to allow you to buy a ticket straight to Paris and fly out immediately - Gabby's memories mean you're able to speak French easily enough. Or, once you hit the airport, you could find another identity. Gabby's a lovely girl, and you enjoyed chatting with her. Stealing her life feels wrong... but if you're going to survive, you're going to have to steal someone's. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's business as usual so to speak as you head back to your apartment to live out your new life as Gabrielle.  You have classes later today but you just feel melancholic for some reason.  Maybe it's your Gabby memories and personality that's making you feel this way.  The strange juxtaposition of your memories with hers has given you these mixed feelings, it's almost like she's telling you how upset she is at having her life stolen away.  At the same time, you know that she would understand your situation, that she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and that she'd have probably done the same thing in your situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lounge around on the couch playing with the pens absentmindedly.  The black, brown, blue and white pen have all been used at least once so you know what they can do.  Strangely though, it's only now that you notice something different about the white pen.  Instead of the standard button, the button is actually on a rail.  It snaps into the second position with a satisfying click and you press again.  A red dot appears on the wall.  You're slightly confused.  Why would an organisation who has the power to create these mighty devices make one of them a dual purpose laser pointer?  It just doesn't seem logical.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking aim again, you press the button while pointed at your delicate hand.  You watch in surprise as a hole appears in your skin, revealing what looks like your skin underneath.  Just as quickly, you see that hole seal itself forming Gabby's flawless skin once again.  This development definitely merits another go.  Instead of a hole, this time you swipe the laser across your wrist.  Again there's no pain but you see a large gash appear on your skin.  Before the 'wound' (for the lack of a better word) can seal itself, you seize it with your other hand and pull on your finger tips.  Somewhat to your surprise, the entire hand lifts off like a glove and underneath your own hand is revealed.  Gabby's hand dangles from a sliver of flesh underneath your male hand.  After you don the hand-glove again, your female skin seals itself and restores your body to perfection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand now.  As a recruiter, Elena would've had to have had back up in case her potential recruits got too greedy.  After all, these bodysuit devices are powerful things, there's no way an organisation as well thought out as this wouldn't have a failsafe for traitors or defectors.  A white pen to modify memories as well as strip people from their skins.  It's the perfect device for a hunter, one who sniffs out bodysuit jumpers like yourself.  You hypothesize that Elena would've stripped you out of your Lucy skin if you had simply given up and then wiped your memories of that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new found power gives you ideas.  It is now entirely possible to save some of the loved ones you've left behind.  Even if you don't know which of them have been replaced, you can just try out this white pen and if necessary, pull one of the imposters from their bodies.  There's only so much you can do alone though.  It's highly likely that all of them have been replaced and that the organisation is just waiting for you to try something.  You need an edge.  As you stare at the last remaining pen, you hope that it will provide what you need.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You press it multiple times and aimed at various things such as yourself and blankly into space but nothing happens.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of junk,\" you exclaim as you slouch back into the couch.  You can't believe that the last one was a dud and you fume silently, Gabby's normally serene face screwed up with a mixture of disappointment and rage.  As you lay there thinking about all the lives you have borrowed, you accidentally press the button on the red pen absentmindedly.  To your surprise, your body starts to swell until you reach a sizable girth.  In shock, you run to your bedroom where your full length mirror is, heavy foot steps along the way, where you see Gabby's normally slim athletic body has expanded to overweight proportions.  In fact, you look like the splitting image of....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy!\" you shout, half in shock and the other half in fascination.  You think back and realise the moment that you pressed the button, you had been thinking about Lucy and were wondering how she was.  The image in the mirror definitely looks like Gabby but with Lucy's figure.  That's what the red pen does!  It provides the user with a way to modify the skin's parameters but to what limits?  This is what you have to test.  Soon, you have seen Gabby in many different forms.  Fat, skinny, anorexic, obese.  Whatever body shape you can image, that's what you become.  But it isn't limited to that.  Hair colour, hair length, hair style, eye colour, skin colour even.  There are it's limits though.  You can't fundamentally change your appearance too much to become someone else.  Just imagine if someone received plastic surgery, that would probably be the extent to how much your host's structure can change.  Therefore, things like height are out of the question but even with its limits, you're amazed at how different you can make Gabrielle look just from the few things you can change.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've restored your Gabrielle form to its original state, you start to plan.  You have five pens.  The black one turns anyone hit with it to turn into a wearable bodysuit.  The brown one gives you their mannerisms, parts of their personality and muscle memory and facts about them.  The blue one transfers all their memories into you, provided that you're wearing them at the time.  The white one is a hypnosis and skin stripper.  The red one allows you to modify your skin's body at will.  Your use of these will be invaluable to helping you retrieve your loved ones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoved ones?  Is it really possible for you save them all?  Or should you pick and choose who you want to go rescue?  When would be best to do it?  These are questions which you mull over as you plan your escape.  </span></div></div>",

You waited until Gabby's test was out of the way before taking action, so if you end up leaving her body it won't compromise her grade. Last night her friends went out to celebrate, but you stayed at her comfortable home, plotting and calculating what to do. That's when it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey can't be <i>everyone</i> you know. And, given how much they seem to know about you, it's likely they will have only replaced those you would try and contact first. That narrows your focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom. Trish. Jessica. Nick, in that order. They are your prime suspects. For your plan to work, you'll have to get one of them alone. But, now you know what the pens all do, that won't be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Friday morning, but before you go out, you need to make some adjustments. You pick up the red pen, and activate it. You feel Gabby's skin tighten, then sag. Her rich, highlighted hair begins to fade, grey slipping through. Her breasts lose their pertness, and her thighs widen. Finally her skin changes hue slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of you is Gabrielle Rieu has she would be thirty years from now: still a beauty, one who has gracefully settled into middle age. You smile and watch the crow's feet around her eyes spread. Perfect - just old enough to escape suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know your mom's routine best, and you're assuming that if she has been replaced, whoever's using her as a disguise will stick to it. That means a session at the local pool, every Friday morning. You get a day pass and linger in the locker room. Sure enough, she turns up for 'her' session swimming lengths. You time it so you're alone together, calmly collect the white pen from your locker, point, and fire. A gash erupts down her back from where you fired - exposing another's skin underneath. By the time the impostor has realized they've been made and spun around, you've fired the black pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" Your rich, French-accented voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping in to a changing cubicle, skin in hand, you aim the white pen and, a few strokes later, strip your mother's skin free. You're relieved as it reseals, unharmed, as you set it aside. In front of you is the impostor's skin. It's a woman's - your age, perhaps a little older, and from the flat, deflated face she looks remarkably average. The kind of girl you could pass in the street and never think of again. Perhaps that's the point. You had assumed it would be a guy, but that's a trivial concern. You strip off your clothes, steady the older Gabrielle's leg, and begin to pull the skin on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later you're looking at the angry, plain face of the impostor. You have no idea who she is, but clearly she's been assigned to wait to see if you would try to make contact with your family. Now the tables are turned. You look down at your current body. Average, in every regard. An average build. An average height. An average face. It's almost as though the organization's agents have used the red pen to make themselves as inconspicuous as possible. Well, if that's the case, you're soon going to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to rescue your family, you need to know what your opponents are doing. Fortunately, that's not hard at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the blue pen at yourself - the pen that gives you the current skin's memories - and fire.</span></div></div>",

You search the memories that the blue pen has granted you and honestly it's not much.  Basically all you know is that this person got orders to replace your mother, Marie Anderson and await contact with David.  Two other agents had been inserted into people close to yourself being Trish and Jessica.  You're glad that you were right about your guesses but you're frustrated by the lack of information.  There's nothing in this person's mind about their identity, who they work for, why they look so average.  The only information you have now are the parameters of this agent's mission.  There isn't even an end time specified.  You're assuming that these three agents will stay in place until they are recalled by whoever their employer is.  The information you've received only really tells you that to rescue your closest friends/family will mean putting yourself in greater risk.  After all, two of them are now inhabited by trained imposters of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you step out of the cubicle, you step into your mother's skin and assume her form with the blue pen giving you all her memories up until the point that the nondescript woman replaced her.  It's more than a little disconcerting to wear her form but you promise silently that this will only be temporary, at least until you can relocate her and rescue the ones you care about most.  To do that, you need to pretend to be one of the agents, going about their business while awaiting for David to return home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go about your mother's daily routine.    A catch up with her own high school friends.  A stop at the supermarket to buy groceries before returning home to catch her afternoon soap.  Your mother truly has a mundane schedule.  But it doesn't matter.  If you follow it to a tee, no one will suspect that you aren't who you claim to be.  And neither will the agency.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day passes in your mother's life and you realise that no one knows that you have disappeared.  In fact, everyone is of the opinion that you've simply been sent off to boarding school; a decision that your family had been discussing for months now and that you'd suddenly changed your mind in going.  It's obvious that this shadowy organisation has been modifying memories in your absence.  You've suspected this for a while, but this nemesis that you're up against definitely has their fingers in many pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding some way to expose Trish or Jessica won't be particularly easy as your mother.  As Marie Anderson, you simply have no real reason to visit them and going out of your way to find them will expose you as an imposter.  It's very fortunate then, that on your second day of watching through excruciatingly boring soaps that Trish comes to visit out of the blue.  You act exactly as your mother would and invite her in but from the few memories that you retrieved, you know that this Trish is an imposter.  When she turns her back on you, you aim both the white and black pens and fire.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunday comes quickly. Gabby's final test went well, you think. For some reason you studied far harder for someone else's test than you ever have for any of your own - maybe you felt like you owed her. Gabby's friends headed out for a few drinks after the test had ended, and you joined them to celebrate, commiserate and part ways for the break - you are her, after all. Since you plucked up enough courage to remove the skin and hit her with the brown pen on Wednesday evening, the masquerade has been easy. You realized you've been overdoing it with her accent, for example; she's not an 'oo la la' kind of lady as you've been pretending; you've been laying on her accent too thick. Now you can remember and feel just as she would if you choose.. at least, on the surface you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, being Gabrielle is a melancholy experience. Outwardly you seem excited you are heading home; certainly your excitement spilled over in a Skype conversation with her mother - a test you set yourself to ensure you can both speak French and impersonate her perfectly. But inside you feel a deep sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of it is that Gabrielle really didn't deserve this fate. You're her as a necessity, but it doesn't make it any easier; you know she wouldn't want this existence. Who would? But you can set those thoughts to one side. Late on Wednesday you discovered the red pen's ability to change a skin's weight, apparent age and details like hair and skin color. While you experimented with its powers, you knew exactly how Gabrielle - as perfect as she is - would have improved herself if she had the pen. She would have used the pens to borrow someone's life in your situation, you are sure. That eases your guilt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real cause for your sadness is your family and friends. Back when this started, you had every intention of rescuing them. Now you realize just how impossible that would be. For one thing, where do you stop? Rescue Jimmy or Trish and their family would face the same fate as your own. Rescue your relatives and your extended family would become a target... and six are harder to hide than one. Your only option is to leave them behind to the whims of this secret, sinister organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why, as she sits in the airport waiting for her flight, a beautiful French woman, dressed in comfortable designer jeans and a loose T-shirt, is sobbing quietly behind her sunglasses. You've made it through every test you have have faced, and you could escape to France in a few hours. You've checked your luggage - the pens safe and inconspicuous in your hand baggage - but you haven't been able to being yourself to venture into the departure lounge. As you stare at your French passport, you know this is the final step. Leave as Gabrielle and you never see your family again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you really ready to give up? You have your reasons, but there has to be a way to save your family. What kind of life would you have if you left now if you did? You could be anyone you want (and Gabrielle is a great choice for a life, at least temporarily) but you would always feel like you should have done more now. Even if you take the fight to this organization from France, if you run now you'll regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying put is still an option. You could swap with someone heading back to town. From the small overpriced bistro you're sat in, you can see the arrivals hall. A group of stewardesses are making their way through, standing out from the crowd with their perfect appearance and crisp crimson suits. You spot one, a beauty with auburn locks and far too much makeup, break from the group and head to the toilet. She could be a chance to head back to town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could switch with one of the steady stream of arriving passengers. There seem to be a few options: businessmen and women, back from a convention given the sharp suits and branded bags they are carrying. There's an older, still attractive blonde woman in her mid-forties, returning from vacation with her family you assume - she's still in a floppy hat and sundress, and hasn't lost her figure. There's also an Afro-Caribbean woman in her late twenties, her hair in a ponytail and dressed in a sports jacket, who could be a possibility. You're sure you recognize her as the star midfielder of the local women's soccer team; Trish dragged you along to a game once. You can't remember her name, but she plays at international level. Not an outright celebrity (women's soccer doesn't attract big crowds), but without question a potential new identity if you decide to turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are lots of options, but you have to decide: leave for France, or head back into town and fight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's a cool autumn day in Paris as you read a book in a quiet cafe along the Rue di Rivoli whilst sipping your coffee.  As you brush your sleek hazel hair from your face, you remember that just about six months from this day, you had escaped the clutches of an evil clandestine organization which was intent on recruiting you into their fold.  Even more amazing still, was the fact that you'd heard nothing or seen anything suspicious in the last half year to indicate that they were on your trail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last six months hadn't been easy.  Always watching your back to make sure that you weren't being followed, keeping an eye on every single person you meet and never being able to trust anyone you meet; the stress of it all had been overwhelming.  It didn't really help that you'd had to change identities a few times already.  When Gabrielle's summer break was over, you'd been forced to switch skins.  After all, Gabby was going back to your hometown to study and that proximity would've been enough to tempt you into doing something stupid or revealing yourself.  So when Gabby flew off (with your memories as her implanted thanks to the white pen), you'd waved goodbye to her as her loving younger sister Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife as Isabel hadn't been hard.  She was around your age and had two loving parents who doted on her.  There was something comfortable about this family and for some reason, you decided not to move on.  You kept constantly vigilant of course and kept your senses sharp by replacing your new mother and father every now again, but you always stayed in the same family.  It was for that same reason that you also became Gabby again when she returned for a break.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about thirty minutes since you'd started waiting in that little cafe with your book when he arrived.  Gabby had arranged a meeting with her older brother to catch up and talk about life and you weren't about to do anything out of the ordinary.  After all, if you were going to be this woman in the long term, there was no sense in making her a recluse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabrielle!\" exclaimed Jacque, as he kissed you on the right cheek, \"It's been too long.\"  He lingered slightly as he kissed your other and whispered in English \"You are being watched.  Act normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen for a split second as hear his warning but otherwise you give no indication of hearing it.  The two of you reminisce for a while before he invites you to walk with him.  You walk briskly beside him as the two of you browse the unreasonably expensive stores filled with Louboutins and Prada.  As you feign interest, which isn't particularly hard given Gabby's actual interest in all these, you notice a young couple which seem to trailing after the two of you which you recognise from the cafe.  Your brother, obviously aware of these two, pulls you into an exclusive Chanel store to browse.  As you enter, the doors close and lock behind you; preventing the couple from following.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop assistant is a young woman who couldn't be much older than 25 nods at your brother and opens the curtain to the back room.  You hesitate for a moment, your senses telling you that he can't be trusted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Gabrielle, I'm trying to help you.\"  His eyes seem honest; they carry this sense of world-weariness to them yet there's something trust-worthy about them.  You decide to trust your instincts and follow him.  After all, they've kept you safe for the last six months.  </span></div></div>",

Inside, there's two men with sharp features; both of them around thirty in age.  They watch as you enter and keep their eyes firmly on you, as if watching for any suspicious movements.  Jacque nods at them and they seem to relax ever so slightly, their eagle like gazes still fixated upon you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop right at the entrance to the room.  \"Alright Jacque, I think you owe me an explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, but I think this will help explain the situation a lot easier.\"  Your brother begins to strip rapidly and in your surprise, you simple watch him.  It isn't long until he's completely naked and your Gabby memories/personality tell you this is something completely out of the ordinary for the two of you.  One of the men approaches Jacque from behind and pulls out a long metallic looking strip and places it against his back.  It's a zipper.  To your surprise, it adheres and you watch in wonder as Jacque pulls it open.  You blink rapidly, not sure if it's some kind of optical illusion but there's no mistake.  A gash has appeared in his back and the skin in the opening is clearly not his.  His skin distorts as the figure within pulls and disengages themselves from the disguise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman emerges from the skin like a butterfly from its cocoon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer appearance was remarkable; young nubile flesh, long blonde hair and yet her face looked like it'd seen a war.  She was probably no younger than 18 yet she seemed mature and wise beyond her years.  The world-weariness that you'd seen in Jacque's eyes had clearly come from this woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quickly now I don't have time to explain, \"Give your Gabrielle skin to Gerard here and we'll make our escape.\"  As she said this, she pulled back another curtain to reveal two gagged and blindfolded women who she obviously intended to become a pair of disguises.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate.  Obviously, this is happening too fast and you don't know what you can trust anymore.  Sensing your reluctance, the woman walks over to you and grasps you firmly on the shoulders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I know you must be scared and confused right now David but I'm with the DGSE - French Intelligence.  We've been looking for you for a long time; ever since you pissed off the wrong people and went into hiding.  I'm here to offer you a change to get back into the game, a fighting chance.  But first we need to get those two agents off your tail.  And to do that, Gerard and Michael here need to take our places for now.  Rest assured, we can get you back to Gabrielle life once its safe to.  Until then, I need you to trust me until we reach the safe house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's something about this woman that you feel like you can trust.  Maybe it's the fact that she's completely naked whilst she spouts these unbelievable words.  Maybe its the fact that you've finally gone off the deep end.  Or maybe you're just tired of running and this opportunity, no matter how absurd, is what you needed to whip you out of your stupor; the comfort that you'd obtained from just living as Gabby and her family.  The friends and family you'd been forced to leave behind; maybe there was finally a chance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice isn't hard.  Shortly afterwards, Gabby and her brother leave the store followed closely by the young American couple.  Another hour passes before two cute French girls also depart from the store, one of them holding a quintet of coloured pens in her Chanel handbag.  </span></div></div>",

Even with your two decoys, your new 'friend' takes you along a plethora of different transport types and a maze of back alleys before you finally reach a dingy nondescript hole in the wall.  As you follow your companion deeper into the building, you start to wonder if you made the right decision.  She opens the door and you follow her into a sparsely furnished ground floor unit of some kind.  After she offers you a seat at the dining table, you wait anxiously as she goes into a nearby room to remove her disguise.  Even though you've only been wearing the unknown French girl's skin for a short time, you feel at home.  Exposing your natural born form feels strange nowadays especially now that you're in such an unknown situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DGSE agent emerges from the room as herself, dressed casually in a woolen sweater and pants.  Her eyes widen a little when she sees the pen you're pointing directly at her and she raises her hands in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time you gave me an explanation,\" you try to say menacingly but failing miserably due to your disguised voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wry smile forms on her face, \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"  You hear the sound of a cocking pistol behind you and you see a burly man pointing a large handgun at your head.  \"We're taking a very big chance contacting you like this so please let us just be civil.\"  She nods at her companion who holsters his weapon and takes up a position near the door.  Likewise, you lower your pen and place it back into your bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Yvonne Poesy and I am a member of the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure.  French Intelligence Agency.\"  She adds when she notices your confused look.  \"For many years now, we have been investigating a secret organisation which has been systematically controlling world events through the replacement of important individuals at key moments in time.  This organisation, which we have taken to calling La Dissimuler, has evaded our attempts to capture or contain any of its agents.  So we branched out and started tracking their recruiters.  That's what led us to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monsieur Anderson, you are one of a kind.  You are the only one who we know of who has rejected La Dissumuler's recruiters and also escaped successfully.  We can therefore offer one another something very unique.  You may have noticed that our technology is a fair bit more primitive than theirs.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd have to agree.  The zipper device that they possessed was a lot more conspicuous and less convenient that the pens.  Not only that, you had only been able to access the most recent memories of the girl you were wearing; a most inconvenient disadvantage for this kind of technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would allow us to study your pens in some detail, we will help you rescue your friends and family.  No matter how long it takes, you will have our resources on your side when you decide to make it happen.\"  Yvonne pauses for a moment to gauge your reaction.  Your gut feeling is that there must be something more to this.  Wouldn't it be far easier to just kill you now and take your pens?  You're pretty sure everyone in the room would agree that you'd be dead from a gunshot to the head before you could even take out a pen to defend yourself.  What gives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purses her lips at your silence.  \"We anticipated it may be a little difficult for you to agree to our terms so we decided to offer you something first.\"  At her indication, the male agent walks into one of the other rooms and drags out a very familiar figure.  An older teenaged girl with blonde hair.  It's Jessica.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush towards her as the agent hands her over.  She's clearly been drugged and her eyes are glazed over but otherwise she seems fine.  Jessica is shivering under the blanket they have draped over her as she's wearing nothing but underwear beneath it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would suggest that you deal with La Dissimuler's person first.  We have been unable to extract them from your girlfriend's skin which is why we have kept her sedated until your arrival.\"  The two DGSE agents watch in fascination as you pull out the white pen and extract a young male with an incredibly average face from Jessica's skin.  You look at him in disgust as the male agent quickly injects him with some kind of tranquillizer and drags him off to the other room.  With Jessica's skin cradled in your arms, Yvonne asks you once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you join us Monsieur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Hot spit flecks out if your mouth as you bark your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I am.\" You stare at Yvonne, then cradle Jessica to the sofa, taking a blanket and placing it over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. But you should not do... Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's too late. You fire then pen and watch as Jessica returns to normal. You watch as she stirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, looking around, she screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica! Calm down! You're OK! You're OK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck are you! Where the fuck am I?\" She's breathing heavily, clearly panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Dav...\" For a moment you forgot your new identity. The zipper really is an inferior method. \"Uh... my name is Marie. You're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's safe, you bitch? The last thing I remember is... Is... That douchebag Jimmy coming around and asking for me. Where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize there's no point to explaining what has happened in the past six months. For Jessica, only seconds have passed. Some intruder has been living her life, stealing her precious minutes and seconds from her. They enjoyed her 18th birthday party, graduation; you wonder if she's in college now. It's all pretty hard to explain, and you're not sure if it's even best to do so. You pause, then reach for the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Yvonne barks. She holds out her hand commandingly. \"Pen, now.\" You don't know why, but you obey instantly. Jessica returns to her state, and Yvonne turns to you, shaking the black device at you. \"Why don't you think, hmm? She does not know this face of yours! She does not remember what has been done! She needs to be brought out of this state by someone far more expert, who can help her recover. This will be traumatic, she has lost months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, sheepishly. The white pen solves that issue, but you're not sure saying as much would help. Yvonne casts her petite shoulders up, the blonde locks rising and falling dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need to pay for what they've done to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To others in your family, too. But this takes time, David. You need to take time. It is like bursting a blister, sometimes you have to wait for it to settle, hmm?\" She lightens, smiling and rubbing you on the arm. \"I know how much this hurts you. But use it. Together we can tackle La Dissumuler. Once we are on a level playing field with the technology, they will not be able to stop us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if anyone should have this technology. Who created it, and why? Where did it all start? Your mind is a mess of questions and queries. For now, though, you think it's better to listen. \"What do you plan to do with the pens?\" You begin to scratch at your stolen skin, feeling disgusted and ashamed just to be living like this. But it's the only way you know, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Study them,\" Yvonne shrugs. \"They are more advanced than our prototypes. We suspect the Americans may have more developed technology, but they are too tied up in their own bureaucracy to use it. French Intelligence does not have this problem. We use our zipsuits for active and counter operations, including wet work as necessary. I will take the pens, now, and your girlfriend. She will be restored, monitored in a secure hospital facility, given a story she can believe until the truth is made known to her. It's a difficult life, the one you have chosen to lead. Such an initial shock must be dealt with by professionals, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. And the pens - ha! they do look like stylos - will go to research. You will not get them back soon, if at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a little more apprehensive about the deal. The whole point of the pen was that you had a significant advantage, the person's memories. That prevents any really deep integration. Perhaps you could only give up some of them, and keep the memory pen for yourself. \"I understand Yvonne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poesy. Do not call me by my first name, we are not friends, recruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm a recruit, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'accord. You have survived a long time. But those skills are not enough if you're going to work with us. Normally membership of my particular section requires, obviously, French nationality. With you such a condition does not apply - your current body is French, is it not? So, then, training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My accent will give me away. I'll need a disguise.\" You try and be pragmatic. The current disguise was meant to be temporary, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do. We will provide a suitable candidate. Her name is Rochelle Tanzir. officer, Police Nationale. Selected for training but, unknown to her, washed out. Determined woman, though. Orphan, French-Algerian, grew up in Lyon, no close family. No friends, she just studies. A shame she is not the right material. But she has agreed to take part in a programme, and she is not close enough to her classmates for any to spot a switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I start right away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne pauses, and thinks. \"You do not need to do so. You can wait until Jessica is recovered. She will not be part of our team, but she can stay with you. It would mean our research team would be more likely to upgrade from our zipper, too. That would be an advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still be out of the fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne taps her lips. \"Not necessarily,\" she muses. \"You could do what you have been doing since you came to France: live the life of another. We have information that leads us to connect a string of robberies with group of individuals travelling the country in their professional capacity. It would be low enough risk, I feel, to substitute you in. We suspect this group does not contain any La Dissumuler agents, although the funds from their robberies are being directed to them. Your disruption, or participation as a sleeper agent, would be of great benefit to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what professionals travel the country. Actors? Some kind of sports team? A circus? Yvonne has been vague. It's a distinct option. Alternatively, the sooner you pass this training, the sooner you can fight back properly.</span></div></div>",

Sure, it's a brilliant opportunity that this big budgeted and resourced intelligence agency has offered you their help, but it'll all be for naught if you don't jump through their hoops first.  If you were caught or worse, killed on a mission because you had no training, you don't know if you could ever forgive yourself for messing up.  Even if you were just a sleeper agent, there's no way a group of wary individuals wouldn't notice anything amiss.  Gabby's family was one thing, but a group of La Dissumuler associates or sympathisers was another thing altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne leads you into the other room where you see a glass topped chamber, inside which you see a naked young woman lying there unconscious.  The capsule's cover is partial frosted over and you see a fine steam emitted from her mouth as she breathes slowly but rhythmically.  She appears tanned and has a long sleek chestnut coloured hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Rochelle.  You two will become very intimate over the coming months.\"  Your handler points to the woman in her glass cage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze upon your new identity, you realise that this is absurd.  You're going from a fugitive on the run to a French intelligence agent of sorts.  You have no idea why you've agreed to this in the first place, the offer has been a little too good to be true.  And the worst part is the fact that your new sponsors expect you to relinquish your most valued possessions, the C-set to them permanently.  The almost magical C-Set which has been your only true companion over the last six months.  The technologically advanced pens which has given you an almost unfair advantage over anyone who has come across your path and kept you out of harm.  Something about giving them up so easily just didn't sit right with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYvonne holds the black pen in petite hands and shoots it at Rochelle as soon as the lid opens.  Unbeknownst to her, you are still gripping the white pen in your right hand, hidden up your sleeve after you had freed Jessica.  As she turns to you, her eyes widen as you shoot her with the white pen.  Quickly, you duck out of the room and also freeze her male bodyguard; who had no expected any trouble as you'd left your handbag outside.  He'd made an incorrect assumption that all your pens were inside that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic started to set in.  Both your new DGSE companions were completely at your mercy.  None of them could move and you could easily erase or alter their memories.  But this opportunity was far too good to pass up.  The opportunity to get back into the fight but with the backing of an international spy network at your side.  You could take the simple route and just erase Yvonne's memories of the other pens and only give up the bare minimum; probably just the black pen or maybe also the brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also one other option you could think of.  As you looked down at the white pen, you realised how powerful its memory altering abilities were.  You gazed at the frozen Yvonne; a perfect disguise for getting into the DGSE and possibly their inner circle.  It would be easy enough to awaken Rochelle and make her think that she was you wearing her skin.  Obviously, it wouldn't be perfect but given enough time and memory alterations, you were sure you could make her become almost a perfect replica of you.  Meanwhile, you would become Yvonne Poesy, the seemingly experienced young woman who had been tasked with recruiting you to their cause.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yvonne stares blankly at you as you pluck the black pen from her petite fingers.  She continues to stare as you shoot her with the black pen and turn her into a pile of skin.  It was to be expected after you had hypnotized her with the white pen.  As you pick up her flaccid flesh, you think over the situation in your head.  The DGSE had offered you a way back in, a way to fight an unknown oppressive organisation that they had dubbed the La Dissimuler; the same organisation which had tried to recruit you 6 months ago.  However, you figured that there was no way that the DGSE was doing this simply out of the goodness of their hearts - there had to be another angle for them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you'd shown some street smarts and a complete lack of scruples when it came to taking over people's lives but that couldn't be the only thing.  The C-set was obviously their target but if that was the only thing, why would they bother even trying to recruit you in the first place.  There was simply too many unknowns in play here for you to just hand over the C-set without getting some honest answers.  That said, you didn't want to risk antagonising your new 'associates' by replacing your recruiter.  All you wanted was some answers and the key to them was Yvonne Poesy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you worked your way into the young infiltrator's skin, a chill spread throughout your body.  It wasn't the fact that you were still wearing Marie's skin as you slipped into another's.  It wasn't even the cold.  It was the thrill you had felt from living through other people's lives.  That thrill you had lost and forgotten when you'd settled into Gabby's life and stopped taking on new personas.  There was something that had stirred within you today when you had gotten the change to live a little, to slip around as a chameleon, taking on different forms as you needed to.  Maybe joining this organisation would help give that back to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had sealed the skin up, you shot yourself with the blue pen.  Instantly, the woman's memories flooded into your head and you sifted through them all, trying to find anything useful to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Helene Belamy.  The name Yvonne Poesy was simply one of her identities, one of dozens she had taken during her career.  Trained from a young age, she had been wearing zip suits on and off since she had been 14.  Due to this, even though she was biologically around 18, she was chronologically close to 30 years old.  Distinguished as one of the top in her cohort, Helene had been instrumental in operations which sought to curb La Dissimuler's growing influence in the modern world.  Despite their efforts, they were definitely losing the war.  Their resources, manpower and technology could not hope to match that of the shadow organisation.  The greatest risk was that the larger the DGSE grew, the more susceptible it became to infiltration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why they needed an X-Factor.  An edge to help them get back into the fight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Helene had been given this task, her instincts had been to kill you and just take your pens.  Nothing you had shown her, especially that foolish display with Jessica had won you any points.  However, the Director had specifically ordered her to recruit you.  Despite having the Director's ear, he would not be dissuaded from this and was adamant that this unfortunate American teenage be taken under the DGSE's wing.  Helene knew of many people who would disagree with that decision.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there in silence as you absorbed her memories, Helene's golden locks sway in time with your breathing.  You had a little more faith in the DGSE's offer now; it seemed honest enough even if there questions about our recruitment.  If the Director had enough faith in you, there should be harm in going along with it for a while.  On the other hand, if news got out about your 'defection', you might lose any chance you had to return to your hometown and rescue your family.  After all, your supporters were far and few in this foreign land.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Six months in the role of Yvonne Poesy, the young DGSE agent who had attempted to recruit you to their cause. Key word being attempted because it had been six months since you replaced her and awoken Rochelle and modified her memories enough that she could pass as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously it had not been an easy time for you. In reality, Yvonne was a highly trained field agent, experienced in the art of seduction, masquerade, combat - all things that you were not. Even with the power of the brown and blue pens, it still took a lot of effort to draw upon her memories, her habits, her training. And although you had almost gotten yourself killed or your cover blow more times than you cared to count, you had somehow completed all of the missions that came Yvonne's way. It had been a true trial by fire but you'd embarrassed enough politicians, assassinated foreign enemies and stolen technologies that you felt confident in whatever mission came next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour missions had been even harder because for the majority of that time, you'd been deprived of your precious pens. The pens which had kept you alive since your first encounter with La Dissimuler but you knew that R&amp;D was hard at work replicating their designs. The zipsuits had been a difficult substitute to use but they served their function well enough. Yvonne's training and abilities also helped tremendously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all missions. You'd lived out Yvonne's life, meeting up with her few friends and family, keeping up her rigid gym routine and even indulging in a few short term relationships. None of it lasted of course - her training and your instincts told you to keep relationships at a minimum to not get distracted from the end game. The dissolution of the insidious organisation which the DGSE called La Dissimuler. You'd come tantalizingly close on a few of your missions but they always seemed one step ahead. This was a hidden blessing you assumed, since your borrowed experience wouldn't truly be enough to handle a proper La Dissimuler agent. Both you and the DGSE had to bide your time for the proper moment to strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had been a good companion as well. Although you were in the form of Yvonne, you had maintained contact with her through Rochelle. After all, you were still her mentor and contact. Your frequent sessions with her meant that you had the perfect opportunity to turn her into a zipsuit. To replace her as you had Yvonne and through her form, meet with Jessica. Jessica had obviously been freaked out by the first time this happened but over time, she grew accustomed to her new situation. She understood that you had to work with the DGSE in order to save your family and friends. It had gotten to the stage when they'd even let her go outside with supervision. The supervision was clearly there to keep her under control but also to make sure that she wasn't reacquired by La Dissimuler.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was a special day though. Today was the day that you started the counterattack. Today was the day that R&amp;D were presenting their first replicated pens. </span></div></div>",

The Director of the DGSE had always had a soft spot for Yvonne and had considered her something of his protege. Rochelle was already seated opposite the Director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work with dismantling the Albanian trafficking network. Many mothers and fathers will be very happy once those poor souls return home. But enough of that. You are both here because we have finally cracked the code. We have replicated it at long.\" He pauses dramatically then flourishes a pen from his suit jacket. It's almost an exact match for the black pen that you used previously but this time it had a number of different buttons built into it. Almost like cheap four colour pens you could get from the local newsagent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first production model of our labour. Made some improvements to it we have. Our version has the functionality of all five pens that our good friend here gave us. We will be rolling out this device to our most trusted agents. Including yourself of course Poesy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes to hand the pen to you but pauses. \"Except I have noticed something odd as of late. Our Rochelle here has been progressing rather inconsistently with her training. Sometimes she will have amazing results and other times I question my decision to recruit her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRochelle goes to speak up but you cut in. \"David has been telling me that he is distracted of late. It has been six months since we offered to help him recover his family and friends but all he has been doing is training. He is anxious and impatient at how little progress has been made since he joined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a fair point. At least it would be if that were actually David. Isn't that right Monsieur Anderson?\" The Director stares right at you and points the pen directly at your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is ze meaning of this?\" you say, outrage in your voice as you rise to your feet. There's no where to run and Rochelle seems unusually passive given the events happening before her. The Director motions for you to sit back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you misunderstand,\" he continues with a grin, \"Rather than mad I am rather impressed. It took me quite some time to realise what was happening. I thought it odd that Rochelle's test results seemed to vary from week to week. Sometimes she was no better than when she had completed her entry aptitude tests. Other times, they were extraordinary. Then I realised one key factor - Rochelle always did better in the weeks that she met up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the Poesy I know is too professional to cover for an underling like that. In fact, she'd be much too cold to help someone I had ordered her to mentor. Someone she didn't even like. So the only explanation that made sense was that you, David, was actually Poesy. It wouldn't have made sense otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung your head. With the pen pointed straight at you, there was little point in lying now. He could easily knock you out or strip you from your Yvonne skin with the white pen's functionality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you'll skin me now right? You've gotten what you wanted. The power of the pens and now you won't have to deal with me either,\" Yvonne bitterly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the Director smiles. \"Absurdit\u00e9! On ze contrary, I want to congratulate you. You have managed to trick everyone in this office, myself included. You impersonated Ageny Poesy almost perfectly for six months and nobody noticed. You have completed all her missions satisfactorily, although I think there were some close calls there. If anything, Yvonne is all yours. You have proven a valuable asset with her skills and experience under your thumb. Alas, she was a great agent but together, I think you two are greater. Here.\" He casually tossed the pen over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A token of my good will. We are grateful that you have allowed us to replicate the insidious weapon of our enemy. We would be even more grateful if you would stay on and help us continue the fight with La Dissimuler. What do you say, Agent Poesy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've got to fight back against this mysterious entity that has entered your life, and is now happily living the lives of those near and dear to you. Your family and friends are in the grip of a conspiracy few could imagine exist. And, if you stand for anything, it's for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise, dabbing Gabby's tears away, and walk slowly and deliberately to the arrivals corridor, patting yourself on the thigh in thought. Gabrielle's body has, for the last few days, felt perfect on you. In fact, you can't imagine being a man again; the idea of looking at your dick again makes you feel strange, as if it's an alien appendage rather than part of your body. It's funny, you think; you used to consider it your <i>most important </i>body part. Now that it's gone - or at least submerged under Gabby's exquisite flesh - you don't feel like you miss it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the arrivals hall, and look for your targets through the crowd. The flight attendant you thought had been heading for the toilet was obviously caught by her friends, because she's making her apologies still, but finally heads to the restroom. You quickly single her out. If you're going to be a woman, you're going to be a beautiful one. Anything less would feel like a step down after several days as an undeniably hot French woman. You cut your way through the crowds and slip after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a drill you've done before. Outside is a ''toilets closed for maintenance\" sign left by some careless airport staffmember, which you hang on the handle. Then you walk in and quietly jam the lock; you're lucky that the door has one at all, but you're not going to question small mercies. You spot the attendant heading for a stall, and point the brown pen at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, information rushes through your mind. Pin number, cell number, flight numbers. Isla Clarkson, age 30 years, almost nine years' experience as a flight attendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss? Excuse me?\" Gabrielle's sweet French accent slips across your tongue like butter. You're going to miss the sound of her voice. The attendant stops, and turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She says with a thick Scots accent; evidently she's from a European airline. You don't hesitate a second longer: you lift the black pen and fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're out of Gabby's T-shirt and clothes, busy slipping her skin from around your ankles, when disaster strikes. You hear the sound of a door opening. Not from outside, but from within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman steps out of a toilet cubicle: the older blonde woman in floppy hat and sundress you saw earlier. You can only imagine what she must see: a naked man, with the loose, limp, mask-like face of a woman around his legs, staring at her in shock. A few metres away, crumpled under a crisp crimson uniform, the red-haired locks of a flight attendant. Her eyes widen, her mouth flops open, and you brace yourself for a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone comes. The woman continues to stare, mouth flapping like a fish, before her eyes roll and she falls into a faint. You waste no time in reaching for a pen and zapping her. Her stats begin to consume your mind. <i>Mrs Mary-Ann Whittling, aged... </i> Shit. In your panic you used the brown pen. You shake off the memories and grab the black pen, watching as she collapses into a skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the chaos around you. Gabrielle's beautiful body is trailing around your legs, her flowing, highlighted hair spread across the floor. In front of you is Isla, a Scottish flight attendant, with any lucky due to stay in town at least overnight. And, a little further on, Mary-Ann, who has just seen far too much. You could continue the plan as before, become Isla, revive Gabrielle and Mary-Ann and use the white pen to repair any damage with a quick memory wipe. But what if you get it wrong? And do you really have time to do that before someone else stumbles in on the scene? The alternative is to become Mary-Ann.

Or maybe you could stay as her while you work to free your family.

The feeling of gaining a woman's body is familiar, but still no less arousing as you pull her waist up to yours.

They would live her life, wearing her skin like a cheap suit until you returned.  It's unlikely that it would last long but the thought of some stranger wearing your girlfriend just gave you the shivers.  You already had to live through Elena, then in the guide of Jimmy, parade around in Jessica all day.  There's no way you'd let something like that happen again.  You just have to restore here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parking lot is not the right place.  You throw Elena's skin and clothes underneath a random car nearby.  You have no idea why you did this but you feel that there's no point in taking the imposter with you if you can't get her out of Elena's skin.  Jumping into the car, you just drive with no clear goal in mind.  This car is dangerous, Elena's handlers know about Elena and her life.  It's likely they already have a bead on you and its only a matter of how long it takes until they find her discarded skin in the parking lot and figure out you've taken her car.  You need to change vehicles quickly but to do that, you also need to change vehicles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you end up at a rundown motel in town.  You're breathing quickly, the panic and adrenaline from shooting Elena haven't yet worn off.  As you sit in the car, you observe the people around you and try to find yourself a suitable new disguise.  Lucy's body won't serve you any good anymore.  Elena will be able to identify you and depending on how deep the organisation's webs run, it's only a matter of time before they match you.  It's a cheap motel and the customers are suitably cheap as well.  You won't find any 'high quality' disguises here.  Discarding your plan to obtain a disguise here, you saunter up to the counter and ask for a room.  It's cheap but you only plan to stay the night.  Your room is paid for courtesy of the cash you took off Elena before you dumped her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw the bags on the bed and pull out Jessica's deflated form.  Your plan is to stay the night and remove Lucy's skin here.  Hopefully overnight, a pair of disguises will present themselves, maybe that redneck couple you saw down the hall or maybe even that rich businessman and the prostitute next door.  Any of them are choices but the first thing to do is restore Jessica to her original state.  You pull out the black pen and zap at her flaccid form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before she had inflated again and she wakes groggily.  She sees herself in a dark motel room and notices the strange chubby blonde above her and starts to panic.  With some difficulty, you manage to calm her down but it isn't until you pull off Lucy's head/mask that she finally believes your words.  It's a strange surreal experience.  You, with your head still halfway out of Lucy's neck, explain the entire situation to Jessica while she explains that the last thing she remembers is going to sleep last night.  Evidently, 'Jimmy' replaced her halfway through the night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Jessica takes it quite well and kisses you tenderly on the lips and comments on how brave you are.  She agrees to go on the run with you and the two of you plan to take some disguises tonight but leave behind Lucy and her mum's skin in the room.  You figure that the organisation will take care of that for you.  You go to shower after taking off Lucy's skin and when you emerge, think you see Jessica using her phone before whipping it away when you return.  It's a little suspicious but you warn her about contacting people you know since the organisation could be anywhere.  She nods in agreement and then goes to take her shower.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she's taking her shower, you get curious about what she was doing on her phone.  There's a pin lock but you've long figured out its her birthday and when it unlocks, you realise that she sent a text to an unknown number with the exact room number and address of the hotel!!  It's impossible... Jessica couldn't still be impersonated by someone unless.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know why he wanted to recruit you know.  You really are a smart cookie aren't you?\" says Jessica mildly with an evil glint in her eyes, pointing the black pen at you from the bathroom door.  In her rush to confront you, she only had time to put on a towel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an imposter aren't you?  I'm almost having a hard time believing that he thought that far ahead.\"  You guess that Elena anticipated foresaw that she might be zapped and put agents in Jessica's and Denise's skins in case you escaped and restored them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiles and smirks in a completely un-Jessica manner, her face twisted into a malicious grin.  \"I was surprised too when he requested I put on this skin just to be zapped but I guess it all payed off in the end.  Don't worry, you won't remember a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she presses the buttons, you dive for the other pens on the bed.  Not caring which one you use, you just press and swing wildly at Jessica.  Her beam misses its mark but when yours crosses hers, a large gash appears on her face.  She falters in surprise and as she stumbles dropping the black pen in the process, her towel falls off.  You press again and slice at her naked torso.  Another large gash appears and you dash forward and pin her to the ground.  Underneath the gash, you see another person's skin!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fire the laser beam like pen at her over and over, opening more and more gashes.  Jessica begins losing control of her fine motor control as you dig your fingers into the gashes and rip your girlfriend's skin from the imposters body.  Underneath is a young man, who can't be much older than yourself.  You have never seen this man in your life.  Plastered on his face is that same malicious smile that Jessica had given you before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you win,\" he says as you shoot him with the fallen black pen.  He collapses into a heap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have much time to wait.  Your location has been broadcast to the organisation and there can't be much time left.  You need to get out of here quickly.  Jessica's skin has suffered no lasting damage and you can already see that it's healed itself already and is ready to wear again.  While you'd love to escape as a couple, you doubt there's any time to restore her again and explain the situation.  All you know is that you can't stay in this motel a moment longer.  </span></div></div>",

The businessman seems like the ideal choice - generally they want to get away from their red light rendezvous as soon as possible. You listen against the wall: there's still the faint thud of sexual activity. You frown. He's going to be at it for a while. Then you hear a noise outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Way. Jack, I'm not staying here. Did you see that toilet?\" The voice is a woman's, with a faint accent you find it hard to place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already payed the creep at the front desk the money, all right? It's fine. You've slept in worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in Mexico, Jack. Mexico. This town actually has clean running water. I think we can afford to stay somewhere a little... cleaner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop being such a princess about it, Sandra. We're not going to trail around town to find another motel. Do you really want to sleep in the van? 'Cause that's what will happen.\" A third voice: another woman's, though far less prim, far more indie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a better choice than this dump, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've already paid!\" Jack protests again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...unpay. Please?\" Sandra is laying it on thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Is your little cheerleader brain really rattling around, struggling to understand the concept of 'no refunds'? This place is a dive. Customer service is not a priority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you, Kat. Just because you like to slum it. Look, Jack. I'll pay you back. I'll <i>pay </i>not to stay here. Just... just look at that toilet. Go back to the room and look at it. It's not even been cleaned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, fine! If it stops you whining we'll go somewhere else! Kat, you cool with this?\" Jack seems exasperated by the bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... ugh, fine. Whatever. Bring your girlfriend back to the car, OK? I swear though, if she's going to be like this all the way, I swear I will kill myself with prescription pills at the next drug store we pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be lucky we're bringing you on this road trip anyway, <i>Katrina</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has to be able to read a map when there's no cell signal, don't they?\" Kat practically spits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two quit it! You've been at each other's throats since we left, and we've got at least another twelve hours to go! Come on, Sandra. Let's return the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Let me get my frickin' backpack, first, all right?\" Kat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. You drop off the key. We'll see you at the van.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the footsteps separate outside: this is your perfect chance. Casually, you open the room door, bringing it to a close behind you: you don't want someone to look inside and see four skin suits lying across the floor, after all. You look left, just in time to see a couple head down the stairs, then to the right, just in time to see an army surplus green jacket head into a room. You don't hesitate. You walk along the corridor and push open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you whisper as you level the brown pen, seconds later the black, and fire them simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of minutes are a mad scramble as you virtually claw away the clothes and pull on your new face as quickly as possible. It's much smaller than your own frame: the woman (22-year-old Katrina Holly Brown, a film studies major) is barely above five foot two, but you're still able to slip into her petite skin easily. You pull on her head and shake her hair, dark roots bursting through a bleached white with blue ends. Amazingly, her piercings seem to have transferred with the skin, and you've got a stud in your nose and through your tongue. You don't have time to pause though - your pursuers will be here any moment. You throw on her cargoes, T-shirt, and green surplus jacket. Then you grab her backpack and head to your own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only have time to slip Jessica's skin into your pack, and the pens into your jacket. Lucy and Denise will just have to wait for rescue; you're sure the organization are capable of cleaning up such a mess. You slam the door, drop Jack's room key at the front desk and head out to the carpark, falling naturally into Kat's slouched, casual rhythm as you walk toward your new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took your time.\" Sandra - it has to be Sandra - spits as you reach the beaten up VW van. You slide open the back, toss your pack inside and throw yourself in, closing the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Just drive, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van heads down the road, into the night. As you begin to pick up speed, you look out the back. Another set of headlights have appeared in the distance; a set that turns into the motel parking lot. You breathe a sigh of relief, and slouch back against the van side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've escaped. You're itching to return Jessica to normal as soon as possible, but that would mean getting away from your new friends. But you're also curious about the pens. Maybe you should find out what they can do before you return your girlfriend to normal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sandra, it turns out, is the travelling companion from hell. When you first heard the conversation you thought Kat was a little bitchy, but Sandra's incessant talking to Jack about herself, her interests and her life slowly drives you crazy. You get the impression that Kat would have regularly interjected with a well-placed barb, but without her memories you don't feel confident enough to take on that role. Instead you do your best to look like a surly, sullen indie girl doing her utmost to ignore everything going on around her. You find an iPod in Kat's pocket, and pop in the ear buds to drown out the chatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat's body feels strange. You've lost around a foot in height, and that's a little disorienting; although fortunately the brown pen seems to have given you muscle memory, and it hasn't fazed you too much. Eventually the VW hits a chain motel - cheap but at least of a set quality - and Sandra begs Jack to pull in. Ten minutes later, you're in a room that seems to meet Sandra's standards: a twin with a cot bed in the corner. Evidently Kat is expected to take the cot bunk, but you figured she'd at least protest after the earlier hotel debacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Kat. That was the deal. You take any cot bunk, we get the gas and take you along.\" Jack stresses. You still have absolutely no idea where you are going, or what you're going to do with Jessica. Ultimately, either you're going to have to ditch your travelling companions and let them carry on with their road trip, or you'll have to restore Jessica, explain to her the nightmare ordeal she finds herself in (no mean feat - she won't have any memories of being worn as a skin by no less than two sinister spies, being left in a bag and car boot, and literally being sliced off by the white pen). Then you'll have to convince her to take a new disguise. Sandra seems the perfect choice: beautiful enough, and it might give you a break from her real, highly annoying personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Fine. I'm going to take a shower.\" You grab Kat's pack and head to the bathroom. You need space to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're going to smoke marijuana,\" Sandra remarks. You figure Kat won't let that go unpunished. You pause and roll her eyes like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who calls it that? Nobody, that's who. Nobody since outraged parents in the 70s. Peace, love, dope, you're such a square, daddio.\" You give the peace sign and your best mocking snark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you, Kat. Have fun getting high and wasting your life away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your blonde-blue cut, storm into the bathroom, and lock the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Jessica. You pull the skin out of Kat's pack, and lay it on the floor. Given the way your 'friends' were acting, you were tempted to test the pens on them, but given you don't know what they'll do, you figure Jessica is the safest test. You lay her in the bath, and reach for the two pens you're yet to identify. The white pen has a second setting, but given the first seems to be a skin remover, you're not quite willing to test that out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the red pen. You concentrate on Jessica and fire. Your head itches, but nothing happens to the skin. You scratch your head...and feel Kat's hair longer than you imagine. You turn and stare at her face in the mirror, and her eyes, stained with deliberately-crude mascara, widen in shock. You now have Jessica's flowing blonde locks, rather than her grungy cut. You hold the red pen and fire again, concentrating on Jessica even more. Kat's body begins to grow, her breasts popping out to push hard against her army jacket, as she takes Jessica's shape. It's still recognizably Kat's body, her height hasn't increased at all, but evidently the pen allows you to morph parts, like an automatic plastic surgery kit. A little experimentation later, and you've returned Kat to normal, having assumed every shape imaginable, from a Japanese Kat with spiky green hair to an Indian Kat with long, black hair that fell to the floor. The pen is definitely going to be useful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a knock at the door. \"I don't hear the shower, Katrina!\" Sandra. But of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off,\" you retort, reaching for the blue pen. You'd better find out how this one works, too. You point it at Jessica's skin and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories flood into your mind, an almost irresistible torrent of images, thoughts, feelings, sensations. You remember her mom and dad, how she ran away from home for a whole two hours when she was 12, convinced she was heading to Hollywood before she'd squandered her savings on chips and cola. You recall her studies, how she ended up going to the same university, on different courses, as her twin brother Jack - ah, so that's the connection - across the country from home. How she's spent most of her time on campus experimenting in every sense of the word, living a carefree life of booze and recreational drug use. When Jack said he was driving back home to their parents with his girlfriend, the insufferable Sandra, Kat asked to tag along for a free ride. Not that she wants to visit home particularly; she just needs more money. You remember everything. And Sandra's ridiculous drugs claim is perfectly founded; right now, Kat would happily be smoking a joint in the bathroom from her pack stash, wafting the smoke out of the small air vent. She's did it a few hours ago at a truck stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's another knock at the door. Now, with Kat's memories and mannerisms, you're confident you could impersonate her utterly. She's not exactly the nicest person in the world, but you still feel more than a little guilty you're currently usurping her life. And there's the matter of your deflated girlfriend in the tub, too. You ponder what to do.</span></div></div>",

But logic says people don't deflate in front of your eyes, that you can't swap your identity like you do your clothes. Logic struggles to overcome fear, too, or a master manipulator both offering and threatening at the same time. Lucy's face frowns, and you hand over the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart choice,\" Elena says, taking it from you. \"The brown one, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into Lucy's pockets to retrieve it, but you never make it. Something tells you to look up, and as you do, Elena has the pen pointing directly at you. \"Actually, don't worry,\" she shrugs. \"I'll get it myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the world turns black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake to cotton sheets, warm sunlight, and a gentle breeze. At first, you think the whole, crazy pen thing was just a strange dream. But as you wake you feel different somehow, as if your body isn't quite... yours. As you come around, you realize the room isn't your own: it's white, unadorned, sterile. The cotton sheet is actually a basic wool throw. The sunlight is actually a series of spots fixed to the ceiling, blaring down. The breeze is a gust from the open metal door. This is a cell. A windowless, basic cell, like for monks, prisoners, or test subjects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd want to wake up under some sheets, at least.\" The voice is a mans, low and booming. \"Welcome back, David. In fact, welcome in general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough, rubbing your head, feeling a mess of short, stylish hair: Lucy's. Shit! It was all real. You look down, under the cover of the sheets, and see Lucy's breasts and flabby stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" your feminine voice asks, turning to look at your visitor. The man is a giant: dark, muscular and grinning with friendly warmth. He looks as if he could be a cage fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safe house. Relax. It takes a few moments to recover from being returned. All recruits go through it; you have to know what it feels like, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you who zapped me?\" You ask. The man laughs in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You were mailed here for training. Sounds like you got the jump on her in the field though, huh? Not bad! I think that's a first for a recruit. Most times they swallow the story whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed too good to be true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right. But then, sometimes things are as good as people say, no? You might not feel like it right now, but you made the right choice. Why don't you get out of that skin? We've got to mail it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...mail? You said mail earlier. You mailed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's just a term we use when someone is transported as a skin - we don't stick you in a parcel and call a courier. You've lost less than a day, and we'll get whoever that is to her life by Tuesday morning. Oh, and don't take offense about being, what did you call it? Zapped? Think of it as travel without the hassle. Anyway, we can't separate host and skin once 'zapped': even we have limits. And we don't want whoever's body you're wearing to be posted as missing. So get out of the skin so I can arrange for her return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip out of the skin, under the watchful eye of your new mentor. It's uncomfortable, standing nude in front of him, only to pull down someone else's head, chest, arms, legs... and be nude all over again. The mentor takes the skin, and murmurs something about clothes in a locker against the wall. He vanishes, returning as you finish putting on white underwear, white socks, and a white jumpsuit: the clothes in the locker are all identical. You look around the rest of the cell. There's a box, with spaces for five different pens inside, resting on a barren desk. There's a jug of water and a glass too; your simple bed, a small sink, toiletries, and a mirror. That's about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mentor returns, opening the door. \"There you go! Better, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" you say. \"Look, I've got...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Questions. I know. Of course you do. So take a seat. I'm Harry, by the way. Not my real name, before you ask: nothing about this place is real. I'm probably the last person who's going to call you David, too. You'll be given another name to use, depending on the work you'll be doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work?\" You're still trying to get your head around being *mailed* somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get to that later.

It's an honor to be selected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" There's not much more to say. It sounds like he's describing the Illuminati.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, questions. Fire away. I'll give you...say...five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Four now. Think sharp, David.\" You curse your own stupidity as Harry grins. He's treating this like a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... what is this organization?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That question gets answered later in training. I'm not the best person to explain it, but I promise you, you'll get an answer to it later. Still got four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are my friends and family OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine. It's usual for two agents to replace key individuals in the recruit's life to make sure the recruitment goes...smoothly. In your case, your friend Jimmy was our active agent, and there was a sleeper too: I won't say who, it might freak you out. Rest assured, your friends and family have all been restored to their previous selves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see them again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't. It's policy, David. Sorry. They won't miss you, though, if you get my meaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're going to...replace me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temporarily, yes. Already have, in fact. You won't remember this, but you've already been replaced twice, a few weeks back, while we were assessing whether to recruit you. We can't waste an agent forever though, so we're going to tidy that end up. Don't worry - your family will be fine. We're very good at what we do. They'll be OK without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to blurt out something, but pause. Instead, you decide to ask the most important question of all. You ask it slowly and deliberately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you pick me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. That's a very good question indeed, David. When you can be someone else, a lot of skillsets become irrelevant. Age, physicality. We aren't looking for great intelligence, and charisma isn't always required either. We picked you because... well, you fit our criteria. I'm not the one who made the decision, but obviously you fit into a pretty narrow band of people optimal for what we do. Kudos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry rises, and flicks his head toward the door. \"You're welcome. Now, enough questions. Come, let's get started. We've got a lot of ground to cover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head at this whirlwind of barely-revealed information. You had five questions, but you're nowhere nearer to the truth. And you have no idea where you are heading.</span></div></div>",

Everything about this complex just seems otherworldly and the cleaners appear to have some obsessive compulsive disorder which requires to keep everything spotless.  There are doors along the walls but as Harry leads you down, he doesn't take a second glance at any of them.  All of them are marked with strange symbols, not unlike the ones on the costume-sets.  The two of you finally stop in front of one of the doors and your mentor ushers you in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gunther,\" he shouts at a white haired scientist looking fellow who is concentrating deeply on his work, \"Got a Type 2 here who needs a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly gentleman in the white lab coat runs over energetically and is surprisingly spirited for a man of his age.  He looks at you up and down as if appraising new goods that had just arrived and gives a satisfied nod.  He then hurries over to a nearby terminal and presses a button.  All of a sudden, the wall on your left opens up.  It's a giant door.  No... calling it a door wouldn't do it justice.  It's a well concealed gate of some sort and as it pulls back on itself, a number of white pods with glass tops fold out on robotic arms and line themselves up.  Harry waves at you to follow the spry old scientist as he hurries over to a pod while you peer inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside is a woman.  You almost jump back in surprise and Harry gives a little laugh as you bump into him.  The woman inside is a pretty honey blonde who looks like the girl next door.  You can see her pert breasts are at attention in that cold pod of hers and her slim figure is something that a lot of girls would die to have.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zis is Jenny.  She'll be yours for a while,\" Gunther says in a heavy German accent.  He presses a few buttons on the side of the pod and Jenny instantly deflates while the pod glass pulls back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your mentor with a Harry with a confused look and he gives a deep chuckle before he explains.  \"You've been assessed a Type 2.  Remember how I said some agents are fluid with their identities?  That would be you.  Just think about it, you took on a number of forms and adapted almost perfectly throughout the whole day.  Normally people are quite averse about entering other people's lives but you did it like it was second nature.  Plus, the reason why you've been given Jenny is that we think you have a good affinity with female skins.  Training is all about practice so hop on in so you can get started.  You'll be attending your classes as your new identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slip into Jenny's skin, Harry explains that you aren't hardly the first person to wear this skin.  Type 2's undergo special classes where they rotate identities every week and are graded on how well you can act as the person whose skin you're wearing and how accurately you can identify the other students even in different disguises.  By the end, the best students are able to tell exactly who their classmates are just by interacting with them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother huge load of information from your mentor.  You dress your new body in another set of white clothing and Gunther presses another button.  Jenny's memories flood into your mind but you can't tell if these are real or fake.  Was Jenny a real person who was abducted for the sole purpose of training these Type 2 agents?  </span></div></div>",

You turn and frown at him, honey-blonde hair swaying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jenny's light voice comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl whose skin you were in. We could have removed it. You'll see later, one of the pens is very good at it. But we wanted to see how you reacted to waking up as the opposite sex, then shipping off your flabby blonde friend back to her life. Didn't phase you at all. That's why you're a Type 2, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that unusual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like I said, most people can't do it. Given your induction was aborted, we weren't sure you could, either. That test confirmed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there many Type 2s?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple. They're less common than Type 3s or Type 4s. More common than a Type 1. It's the hardest role, if you ask me.\" You guess you'll have to learn the terminology as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... really helpful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try. Here, you'll never know who's who until you're good enough. Speaking of which... who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny Miller. I grew up in a small town called Woodbridge. I've got an older brother and a younger sister, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stow it, Jenny. I asked who you were, not for your life story. Think about your identity at all times. People don't just disclose that kind of crap. Be Jenny, not someone being Jenny and showing off about it. And don't let the others phase you; they may or may not work out you're new blood, depending on how good they are. We throw new recruits in at the deep end. You're going to learn it all: improvisational acting, cold reading, firearms, martial arts, surveillance, electronics, computer skills - plus additional grading as a Type 2 of course. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Harry points to a wooden door at the end of the hall. You nod, and head through it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd into a classroom. Unlike the rest of this barren, sterile place, it actually looks like a classroom, or at least a movie set of a classroom. Light streams through fake windows into a room with a whiteboard, tables, chairs. It looks like a typical community college room. There's about ten other students, of all different apparent  sexes and ethnicities, with ages ranging from 20 to an old, wrinkled man in the corner. this is Wessler college, Jenny's memories tell you, that you've been attending now for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a hand squeeze your ass, and jump instinctively. It takes half a second to compose yourself. Think like Jenny... think like Jenny. You spin round, and find yourself in the arms of a tall, handsome man, brown hair cut short. Penny's memories tell you immediately this is Alex Clark - your boyfriend. You grin, and give him a playful shove... after all, you're supposed to act in character. \"Not in class,\" you say, eyebrows furrowing in a cute tease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, gorgeous. You know you're hard to resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll just have to stay hard down there, won't you?\" You smile. Alex's eyes search your expression; the rest of his body is in character, but the intelligence there is definitely trying to see through your disguise. You guess you passed test one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're new,\" he says, low and quiet. Or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New?\" You put your hands on your hips. \"What does <i>that</i> mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New. To class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, don't be weird. We'll chat after class, OK?\" You do your best to focus. That's a recruit trying to phase you. You're not going to let them. You take a seat where you remember Jenny always sits - she likes the way the sunlight falls, and reach for her pen to finish drawing the elegant love heart frieze on the bottom of the table. You watch as Lowder walks in to the room. Theatrical to the ridiculous, Lowder is an English lovey who fops and fawns about, instructing you all on improvisational acting. You settle in for a lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busted.\" There's a call from behind you. Mrs Cheng, a middle-aged Chinese woman who usually spends her time alone to her thoughts, chirps up. You spin around, as do the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call busted, you Type 1 wannabe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, whatever do you mean!\" Lowder is beside himself, gesturing like a ham, voice wobbling. Mrs Cheng rises and grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Tyler; could spot you a mile away. Tyler in a Lowder skin. Busted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ham pauses, and suddenly drops all pretense. \"Ah, shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm rings, and as Jenny you - and most of the other students - stay in character, looking startled. Two men you've never seen before step into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recruits: halt simulation.\" Everyone stays perfectly still, rigid almost - except Lowder and Mrs Cheng. \"Good job, Type 3. What gave him away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He overdid it. That's when I first noticed. But Tyler has a tell, too. When he's in a skin he's always flicking his nails when he's nervous. Never seen Lowder do that, and Tyler isn't in class. Ergo, Tyler is Lowder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Tyler, you failed. Report back to your cell, and let's return our teacher no normal, shall we? And work on your damn nail tell! That kind of thing could get you killed - or worse, exposed. Mrs Cheng, good job. Everyone else, simulation will reset when the alarm stops. Improv will be in the afternoon instead; this morning will be manipulation and persuasion. Have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closes. Everyone is still. The alarm stops... and suddenly the world is alive again, with everyone living their fake life as if nothing has happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, you realize, is going to be one strange education...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Manipulation and persuasion turns out to be a pretty interesting class.  You learn about Niccolo Machiavelli and how to switch yourself off from the norms of society, to treat conventional morality as a tool, and to use whatever means at your disposal to lie, cheat and deceive yourself to a positive outcome.  It's definitely an eye opener and not something that you'd be taught at any conventional school you would've attended in your old life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's lunch time and immediately after class, Jenny's memories guided you straight to the cafeteria.  The food is surprisingly good but you just have a lean salad.  Even though you crave something more filling, Jenny needs to keep her shape after all and you have to stay in character.  As you eat silently, you see Alex sauntering up to you.  You deliberately ignored him as you left the classroom.  Your memories tell you that Jenny and Alex have a sort of love-hate relationship where she plays hard to get and he does all he can to keep you engaged.  As he approaches, you review the memories you have on him.  The two of you have been dating for at least a year within the facility.  Although all the trainees are closely monitored, you lost your virginity to him just a few months ago in a storage closet; not the most romantic location but your cells aren't exactly open for this kind of behaviour.  Jenny's memories show you how much she cares about Alex, even if she does play hard to get.  There's definitely a strong mutual attraction between the pair and you have to do your best to keep that up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no greeting of any kind when he arrives.  He grabs you by the neck and shoves his tongue down your throat.  You try your best not to be disgusted (you are a male after all), but you push him away.  Although you did your best to do this in a playful manner, Alex's face betrays the fact that you did something out of character.  He's trying to haze me, you keep telling yourself, as he strokes your face gently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans in close and whispers in your ear, \"You're going to have to work on your acting Jenny\" before giving you a wink and walking away.  It's strange.  In some odd fashion, you feel that this trainee is actually trying to help you improve your performance.  There were so many different ways that he could've embarrassed or humiliated you but he went another route.  You feel a twinge of gratitude to whoever's beneath that handsome Alex face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you long to figure out the schedule.  There's strict timing in place everyday and at least two classes per day.  There's classes on everyday except Sunday where you get to socialise with the other trainees.  The facility is monitored very closely and you get the feeling that you're being watched at literally every moment of your life there.  A few creature comforts exist; television, video games and internet rights have to be earned in response to good performance in class.  Obviously, there's no contacting the outside world but you get the newspaper everyday to keep you up to date on current affairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery Sunday, you return to Gunther for a new identity.  To prevent the other trainees from figuring out who everyone else is, cells are randomly reassigned every week.  None of you have any real possession and these are automatically moved between cells by some mysterious force which you have yet to identify.  About a month as passed and you've grown more comfortable in other people's skins.  Today it's a nubile young teenager by the name of Christina.  Her memories tell you she grew up in the South and has ambitions of being Miss Universe.  Today is also an important day.  It's the day of your first test.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your education is the strangest combination of classes ever set to a curriculum. Sometimes it's in a class, sometimes it's one-to-one, sometimes it's in groups. A third is basic spycraft: personal defense, weapons and tactics, surveillance techniques, a little hacking. The second third is acting. You are taught improvisation, high society etiquette, street corner cred, the finer points of being either sex and any age of adulthood. The final third is perhaps the most remarkable, though: psychology, philosophy and ethics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou learn how to cold-read others, assess their body language, predict their actions. That's all to be expected. You're taught about psychology too: how to convince, persuade, seduce. You're even taught about Stockholm syndrome \u2013 how you will grow close to your skins and current identities, and how to avoid making a connection with your temporary life that you can't sever. You wonder if that applies to your old life... or your new one in the Organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the philosophy and ethics discussions take you by surprise. You find yourself writing essays on the nature of identity: whether it is simply personal information and memory, or if you transcend the concept entirely. You discuss the rules of how to conduct yourself in a skin, why it is important to preserve a moral code and not abuse your unique position, and whether what you do is morally justified. You pen papers on the limits of memory adjustment, stealing lives, impersonating others. You even write a short treatise on why a technology with no limits requires limitation. All the while, stories such as the Ring of Gyges and the Invisible Man tease and taunt your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a Type 2, each week brings a new face. Early on, Harry explained that you have an affinity for playing women, so at least three-quarters of the time you find yourself as the fairer sex. You've been Cathy, Alison, Julia, Jane. You've been an 18-year-old Korean girl with a strict work ethic and organised life. You've been a 40-year old trailer trash waitress. Every time you take on a new life, you act like them 24/7. You are required to stay in role even while you perform the little 'tasks' you are set around the complex: find out something specific from a different trainee, steal an object unnoticed, replace someone without anyone realizing. Sometimes you pass, sometimes you fail. Always you learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers change in class too: every few days brings a fresh batch of faces. Sometimes your skin knows them, sometimes you know nobody and faces that you shared an intimate connection with become total strangers. At first you don't recognize who's who under the skins: the faces and personalities are bewildering. But gradually, like the rest of your training, it all begins to make sense. You begin to spot small details so that you can track the others. You begin to spot your own tells, too. You never say a word, always stay in character \u2013 unless you're made, which happens less and less as time goes on. You even begin to spot when your teachers are someone else. \u201cHarry\u201d, it seems, is just another skin \u2013 although Gunther appears genuine... or at least the same agent uses his appearance consistently. Every night, without fail, you write in your journal who played what role. You suspect the handlers know this, and that you'll get extra credit for it. If that's the case, though, they never say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore details emerge over time. As you improve, you are granted another pen, until all five lie in your possession. Black, for skins. Brown, for information. Blue, for memories. Red, for reshaping and morphing a skin's age, weight, hair color, eye color, skin tone. White for memory erasement and replacement \u2013 with a separate setting that can cut away a skin from another. As a Type 2, you are entitled to use them all in field work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh yes: the types. There are four types of field agent. Type 4's are the most common, and their training seems the most basic. A Type 4 is a bit part artist. If the organization needs a receptionist, a police officer, a bureaucrat, a Type 4 is called in. They play small but essential roles in whatever scheme is afoot. Sometimes they use skins from Gunther, at other times they are given a specific person to replace and impersonate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nType 3s are deep-cover operatives. They stay in skin, taking over someone else's life completely and living it almost autonomously. Some, you understand, have specific tasks \u2013 replacing key figures. Others are sleeper agents. You're given a lecture by one of them in the skin of a young, career-hungry intelligence officer whose job is simply to ensure their particular agency never discovers the Organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nType 2s are you: quick-change operatives. You infiltrate, flipping faces and skins with ease, never staying in a single identity more than a couple of days. Sometimes you are a thief, sometimes you are gathering intelligence, sometimes your job will be to replace a key individual to ensure a certain event passes as it must. Everyone distrusts the Type 2s, you quickly realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there are the Type 1s. Nobody is recruited as a Type 1; it's a role that is assigned. The Type 1s are all senior, experienced agents. If a Type 1 is called in, it's because something important is going on \u2013 or something has gone horribly wrong. The Type 1 is a troubleshooter, pure and simple. Some nights, you wonder if 'Elena' was one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're told several times who the Organization is and its purpose. Each time the story changes. Sometimes it's a corporate history, sometimes initially governmental before the organization decided to step up beyond its remit. Sometimes the pens are developed technology using some kind of quantum pocket. Sometimes they are alien tech. All of this is an elaborate way, you are convinced, of telling recruits one thing: it doesn't matter what the truth is. You are here, and you do your job. That's the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for your personal theories? One of the first explanations you heard is your favorite. There is no sinister conspiracy running the world: the truth is far scarier. The world is rudderless, meandering along with a lack of coordination at the top, individuals pursuing their own short-term agendas or long-term legacies. This creates conflict, but also creates room for humanity to strive for greater things. The Organization helps keep the balance. It acts as a sort of checks and balances system, preventing any one person or group from gaining the upper hand. It does this through replacement, subterfuge, and gentle nudges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're mulling on this particular thought one day as you head into the lab, deflated skin in hand. For the past week you've been Mila, but now it's time to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Gunther,\u201d you say. Your own voice always feels strangely alien now: as does your own flesh. You're so used to feeling everything as someone else that, when you emerge from your chrysalis, it's a disconcerting experience. \u201cGot Mila here, I'm ready for a new skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist shakes his head. \u201cNo new skin for you,\u201d he says slowly, pointing to a set of double-doors in the far corner of the lab. \u201cToday, you report for detail. Good luck, Type 2.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. Reporting for detail... that means they're going to send you into the field. You're both nervous and honored at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVell?\u201d Gunther's think accent barks. \u201cGo on! You'll be coming back here soon enough for ze Blanking process. Off you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what that means, but Gunther has never been a man to question; you once asked him about some of the strange tech, and he told you it was so far beyond your comprehension it wouldn't be worth his time to explain. The fact that you were in the body of Dr Mariana Cortez, an Ivy League graduate considered at the top of her field in theoretical physics, did not seem to bother him at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step through the doors. Behind them is a briefing room of sorts: comfortable chairs, a lectern, and a large video wall. On the screen is a familiar face: Harry's. The moment you step in he proffers his usual half-smile. It's a new Harry. The replacement is almost perfect, and if the TV wasn't high definition the impostor would have gotten away with it, but you can spot a few fine flaws. You don't speak, instead just taking a seat to await instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, David.\u201d He's addressing you with your real name, no matter how strange it sounds, as that's the flesh you're wearing; your own body is little more than a final suit, after all. \u201cWow. It's been a long road, hasn't it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d you agree. That day with Jessica/Jimmy/Elena as David/Denise/Phoebe/Lucy seems a lifetime ago. Several lifetimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you'll be glad that, today, the road to becoming an agent is almost over. As part of your final grading, we'll be giving you one last test. In the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as if a rush of butterflies has surged up from your stomach. A field test - both nervous and exciting. For a Type 2, that will invariably mean several skins. There's no denying you find that appealing, no matter how much your ethical standards require you to look after your temporary bodies. \u201cGreat,\u201d you say, enthusiasm spilling over. Harry grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you're up for it. Just don't screw up; we've invested a lot of time and effort in you, after all. And you've got potential, too. According to your trainers, you're achieving almost immersion: when you become someone, you are that person.

You're going to the social event of the year. And you're going to rob it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate as a series of images flash up on screen. Cedar Pines, a large, expansive five-star luxury resort, somewhere secluded. It looks like a showreel for the place: function rooms, a golf course... and blueprints of the entire complex, complete with cameras and alarm specs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't try and take in the intel. Plenty of time for that later, after you report to Gunther. As you're flying solo for the first time \u2013 in the field, with no support, but with the same level of control as any operative \u2013 you're getting Blanked. That will help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting what?\" you've never heard that term before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead to Gunther, he'll clarify what you do. Now, listen carefully. This luxury country club is hosting the wedding of Holden Parry to his blushing bride, Alexandra Vincent. Two rich kids from old money.\" Images flash on the screen of a wedding invitation, with a picture of the two twentysomethings. Holden is good looking, with a few flecks of grey in his hair making him look distinguished. As for the bride, Alexandra is by no means a small woman when it comes to frame: she reminds you of Lucy, the girl you were almost a lifetime ago. While Lucy was average-looking, however, Alexandra has a remarkable face: perfect cupid-bow lips and an aquiline nose, with gleaming hazel eyes. Part of your training is facial structure, and you know that if Alexandra did lose any weight, she could easily lose some of her natural beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you say, taking it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the wedding reception is being held at Cedar Pines. Security is going to be heavy. Not only is half the local high society scene going to be there, but so is the Scarlet Bloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" The image of a necklace appears on screen, ornate silver with a large, red teardrop sparkling at the centre. It looks like a ruby, but the caption states  'The Scarlet Bloom diamond'. You didn't even know diamonds came in red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very large diamond, to be worn by the bride at the reception. It's been in the Vincent family since they made their money off the slave trade 200 years ago. It rarely comes out of the family secure vault, and will be put back and left for another few decades after the reception. It's your job to switch the real Scarlet Bloom for our duplicate. The wedding and reception is the perfect opportunity - there's an almost endless range of people you could use to obtain an 'in'; we've got a complete guest list and staff list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your thoughts to yourself. The Scarlet Bloom isn't the real objective, here; if they wanted it, the Organization could have taken it from the vault years ago: personalized security means nothing when you can be any person you want. This test is how you navigate an elaborate social scene, and what angle you take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now, head to Gunther. He'll sit you down, and you can study your intel on the way to your drop-off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still confused, reeling from the sudden announcement and new information, as you enter the lab again. Gunther beckons you over, flicking switches, looking concerned, twisting dials that give readouts that make little sense to the untrained. Eventually he points to something that looks like a Van Der Graff generator: a smooth chrome orb suspended by a column. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHands out, place on top\u201d he says, indicating the machine. You step closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d Gunther barely looks up from his contraption, instead focusing his attention on several computer monitors simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the worst thing that can happen to you?\u201d he asks. This is a common Organization question: they want this hardwired in. The answer is not dying. If you die in another's skin, or your own, that can be covered up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExposure. Letting someone find out about us. Getting caught.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. Now, we don't want that to happen, but...\u201d the old man shrugs nonchalantly, as always his movements far too rapid for his supposed age, \u201caccidents happen, don't they? Field work is unpredictable, ya? So we use Blanking. Now hold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're uncomfortable with this, but you have little option. Your hands clasp on to the cold, slippery orb surface. Gunther flips a switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder violently, as an electric bolt fires through you: it feels as if every muscle in your body spasms before relaxing again. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther doesn't laugh at your reaction: he betrays virtually no emotion about it. \u201cNow, tell me how do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your hands and body. Everything seems normal, and you begin to shake off the soreness of the electric shock. Then you spot your reflection in the polished dome surface. You lean in, staring hard at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face. It isn't yours anymore. It's almost yours \u2013 there are traces you recognize. But every single prominent feature you had has been erased. You look... average. The only word for it. As if someone took the image of everyone in your age group and ethnicity, fed them into a computer, and asked them to produce an average face. You stare deep at your image. It reminds you of a video game character's face sliders being set to the mid-point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn't you just use the red pen? I could have done that easily enough.\u201d It's true: it's you, just with heavy plastic surgery. Enough that, should you be caught, you doubt anyone could trace you back to your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the red pen affects the body, but not the mind. You now have a safety net; a neural block that prevents anyone from finding out too much if you get caught.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't feel a block.\u201d You feel like some mad scientist has just electrocuted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn't; what would be the point in that? It would just prevent you from remembering your training. Think of it like a firewall, only open to zose with user access: you, and us, ya? Now, how do you feel? Emesis is a common side effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Groggy,\" you complain. \"Like I'm going to throw up.\" You resist the urge, forcing down the discomfort, compartmentalizing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly normal.\" Gunther smiles. Go back to your cell, rest, compose yourself. \"It takes time for the sensations to settle down. Now, what face shall you wear to begin with...\" he walks to the vats, musing over your mission...</span></div></div>",

He brings it out, and motions for you to get in. You're so used to the drill that you're slipping on the large, powerful legs before Gunther has time to reveal his next surprise. He pays you absolutely no attention as you replace your own body with the skin's, instead walking off to another corner of the lab, then back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, pay attention, Type 2. This is a prototype we are working on. As part of your test you'll be using it in the field. We'll be monitoring your progress through it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, your body replaced with your new flesh from the chest down, and pause donning the skin for a moment as you take the proffered item. It looks like a black pen... only it is subtly different, with a white stripe. This one has three buttons; one is separate, and two are joined by a switch, as on the white pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new pen?\" You ask, passing it back. You can never remember what pseudo-science name Gunther dribbles out for the devices. Neurostimulatoryquantumpocketmoleculartransductive... it's all science to you, and you spent most of those classes staring at Ms Martinez's amazing rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prototype 'pen',\" Gunther chews over the word, \"yes. We have been working on combination pens for a long time. Ultimately there is no reason to keep black, blue and brown separate; they are all used to create your new identity. Rather than clumsily switch between the three, this combines the effects. 'Zap' someone, as you insist on referring to it, and gain their skin, name, mannerisms, memories combined. Far neater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can't use the brown pen to find out personal information, anymore?\" One of the boons of a separate brown pen was gaining personal information; access numbers, things like that. Gunther narrows his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'll just have to use your intellect to do that, hmm? Instead of zapping everyone randomly like an idiot? I give you my latest invention and immediately you begin with criticism! I would like to see you develop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, sorry!\" Your new, gruff voice drawls. You're Kurt Williams, 26, working admin for a tractor engine parts company. For all your new found looks, they've given you a remarkably dull backstory. \"I didn't mean to insult...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether you mean to does not matter! Still, you may have a point. Perhaps. But for now you will have to adapt. There is no red button function either. No morphic capabilities. You have memory adjustment, skin removal, and skin creation complete with memories. That should be all you need for the task at hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther pauses, and looks at you with disdain. \"And clothes, Mr Williams. You will need those, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour taxi drops you off at the resort reception. So far you haven't seen your supposed handler; no contact has been forthcoming at all, although you've been given a stupid code to identify yourself with, and for you to identify them. Otherwise, you've felt distinctly on your own since arrival in town. The documents are committed, largely, to memory, and you've been working up a plan. The easiest way to get the Scarlet Bloom is, of course, to replace Alexandra Vincent. The only problem is that brides are notoriously busy at wedding receptions being congratulated. That's why you've arrived before the ceremony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCedar Pines is a stunning locale: an expansive resort dressed like a European manor house, surrounded by immaculately trimmed lawns and picturesque rows of - perhaps unsurprisingly - cedar trees. Beyond you can see a golf course, what pools like an indoor pool, and tennis courts. Far away, across a sweeping lawn, a marquee is being erected, large enough to seat a hundred guests. Silk ribbons are being hung from trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into reception, smile at the receptionist as you walk past, and keep going into the resort's corridors. Perfect; nobody has even questioned who you are, just assuming you're another guest. The resort, you know, is catering for other guests too, but it will be much harder to get into the wedding. Apparently it's going to be an open-air affair in the \"Harmony Garden\", whatever the hell that is. It's all been planned meticulously for months, and you've read the plans cover to cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, in suite 407, Alexandra Vincent will be getting ready for her big day. This is the ideal time, you know, to make a switch - as she's putting the finishing touches to her look and wedding dress, largely alone, occasionally interrupted by a stylist or fussy relatives. That will mean impersonating her at her wedding, which is your main point of hesitation over the simplest plan. Does a marriage count if the bride is only a costume? It's hard to say. Of course, there's an arousing thrill of replacing the bride at the wedding, enjoying the adulation on a day where everyone tells you how lucky, beautiful and perfect you are. And this could be part of your assessment - to see how far you will go in your mission and how perfectly you can hold up a masquerade, even in the most unique circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, there are plenty of other possible candidates. The bridesmaids are options, and so are some of the Vincent relatives: her cousin Ophelia, for example, has appeared on TV shows about her home in The Hamptons, and you'd have no problem borrowing the 25-year-old socialite's appearance for the day. Some of the Parrys have already arrived too, although groom Holden and his gaggle are staying at a separate hotel overnight, to keep the tradition of the bride and groom not seeing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there's the hotel staff. A wedding isn't a small business, and if you assumed the appearance of one of them, you'd have unlimited access to the wedding. You might even be able to locate the Scarlet Bloom before the wedding even begins, although that defeats the purpose. Your instructions explicitly state you must steal the Bloom<i> during the reception</i>. It's part of the test, and you suspect you'd be marked down if you made the switch without even stepping into the tricky social scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grasp the pen in your jeans pocket, reassuring yourself it's still there, and come up with a plan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fact that you're going through a wedding is, your training tells you, meaningless. When you can be anyone, the concept of a union between two individuals becomes strangely fluid. Alexandra is the obvious choice, and you're sure the true test is whether you can pull off a convincing masquerade where you will be the complete center of attention. You slip into the elevator, shifting a little in Kurt's muscular body. This is going to take all of your skill to pull off. Taking this route means obtaining - and switching - the Bloom becomes easy. It's the rest of the day that's hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive, walking down the airy, lavish corridor of the five-star hotel, the faint smell of jasmine drifting through the halls. Eventually you arrive at 407. This is one of the finest rooms in the hotel. It's not a bridal suite - the new Mrs Parry will be staying in another room with her husband tonight - but rather a room given over to the family for preparation. You give a light rap on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" The voice is deep for a womans, not quite reaching husky but giving an expressive vocal range to play with. You note with some satisfaction how you're already analyzing it. The months of training, and of being so many different faces, has evidently paid off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift, madam.\" You try and sound like you're from the hotel. There's a sigh, and footsteps. Then the door opens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra Vincent is stunning. She's already in her wedding dress, her curvy frame and generous breasts bursting free out of the shoulderless design. She's short, with her long, brunette hair flowing down her back in a shimmering, smooth waterfall. She's gone for a tussled look, a bride with wild, classic hair rather than precise styling; all the better for you, as it will be easy to comb once it falls to the floor. But it's her face that captures your attention. Her lips are a perfect cupid's bow, with pronounced features leading up to a large, though not unpleasantly so, nose. Beyond that perfectly styled eyebrows slip fiercely over sleepy opal eyes of exquisite blue. She's larger than conventional beauty, and could be a plus-size model. She takes your breath away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra stares expectantly. \"Yes?\" She asks again, hands on her hips. She's not a woman that's kept waiting. You brush inside, closing the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift,\" you say again, taking a few paces in to look around the room. It's large, twice the size of a normal suite, albeit with classic off-white walls and simple designs. A quick glance in the bathroom confirms that the bride is, for now, alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She says, chasing after you a little, although struggling under the blooming expanse of her dress. \"I didn't say you could come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn, shrug, and zap her. Then you stride over and lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a moment to remove the wedding dress. It's ornate, and you have to be careful with it, bringing the zip down slowly and muttering your thanks that she hasn't been sewn into it. Skin free, you hop on the bed and strip off Kurt's clothes, kicking them under the bed. You were deliberately cautious and chose a loose top for ease of slipping out. Now, naked in a stranger's body, you begin to slip into body number two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been a lot of different people, of a lot of different ages. You've acted out birthdays, given lectures, played boyfriend and girlfriend, husband and wife. But, watching your toes turn into Alexandra Vincent's dainty, painted digits, and your legs reshape into her shapely, waxed-smooth limbs, you feel twangs of guilt. This is the first time you've been a bride. You're robbing Alexandra, not just of her diamond, but of the best day of her life, too. You pull on her hands - nails trimmed to perfection - and ease on her chest and large breasts. Her body is overweight, and you pinch her sides a little in appraisal, but she carries her weight very well indeed. Finally, workmanlike, you flick her wild brown hair forward, over the mask of that stunningly unique face, and slip your head inside the suit, feeling as your chiseled jaw vanishes into the soft curve of her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra Vincent floods your mind. Memories, thoughts, ideas and aspirations. Mother is coming shortly to help you put the finishing touches, so you can get this damn wedding over. You don't want to marry Holden. You don't want to marry anyone. If it were up to you, you'd be able to carry on sleeping with who you want and enjoying the life of luxury your position provides. Unfortunately, the Vincent fortune is fading fast, which means your family needs a cash injection, courtesy of the Parrys. Holden's exasperating company, dull as dishwater, but he's wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, tilting your head at the new information, your new body's hair acting as a makeshift veil. Expertly you flick it up and back, wiping it free from your face. Alexandra, 25 years old, is making a power play on behalf of her family, it seems. You narrow her wondrous eyes, tucking one of her cheeks back in thought. Looking at your nude, voluptuous body, you can see how easy it was to wrap Holden around your finger. You pose, hands on hips, as you study your new appearance and listen internally to her schemes. Then you turn to the wedding dress strewn on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, your masquerade is complete and you unlock the door. You've struggled to slip into the tight confines of the white dress, the bodice clinging a little too snugly to your large frame, but not showing it on the outside. You look incredible, your silky hair tussled and a satin headband completing the look. Your pouting cupid-bow lips are painted in a soft palette, and you're standing at the dresser, hooking long, golden earrings into your lobes. There's a knock, and the door opens, Alexandra's mother slipping in. You look at her from the mirror's reflection, allowing Alexandra's mannerisms to guide you. She would keep working on her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, you don't know how to proceed. Alexandra's memories of her family's hardships have changed the situation. The Scarlet Bloom was sold years ago; the jewel that will hang from your neck is a replica anyway, designed to give the trappings of wealth the Vincent family simply do not have. That makes your mission entirely pointless, and you wonder if your Organization knew that. Do they still want you to swap the Bloom for your fake? Or would you be expected to report in? And do you continue with your mission, or do you abort? According to Alexandra's knowledge, the real Bloom is being held in a secure vault in the local bank; your father sold it to a wealthy financier who agreed to keep it there until the family was back on its feet. Perhaps you're expected to slip out of Alexandra and rob the bank, instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look wonderful, dear.\" Your mother, showing her age as she walks over in her light blue dress suit, walks over, touching you lightly on the shoulder. You tilt your head to squeeze her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! And that band through your dark hair. Stripes like a zebra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripes like a zebra? That's your handler code. Evidently this isn't Alexandra's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stripes like a tiger,\" you counter, turning around, keeping up the act; your handler will have to drop out of character first. They do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Very good indeed. The bride was a risky choice, but a smart one. And if I didn't know who you were, I'd never have spotted the replacement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say, far more casually than the real Alexandra would. \"So what's the problem? Or is this a check in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been a development,\" your handler says. You raise one of Alexandra's plucked eyebrows, and listen closely.</span></div></div>",

If they can track you (and maybe more. Who knows what technology they've developed in this weird science you're using?), they will know if you just jumped into the first person to get it over with. Training always emphasized planning and mastering the situation, not just the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you take a stroll down the wing where the signs point to the Harmony Garden. It's a rather confusing path of twisting and connecting hallways. The place must have had many additions that were just added on the last. The decor is consistent, but you can tell where the structures keep changing. Obviously, there isn't going to be a quick escape if things go awry, at least not back to the front or through the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there's a set of French doors, with white sheer curtains propped open revealing the outside. A wide walkway meanders through a flower bed towards a very large tree surrounded by hedges. The garden itself is closed off with one of those velvet ropes strung across an archway of blooming vines with small white and pale blue blossoms. It's fancy, secluded, and a bustle with hotel staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you can see, there are several entrances disguised through the hedges for staff to disappear and make their way to and from the kitchen and other parts of the hotel. It might be possible to circle around and catch one by surprise, but it would be more fun, and probably raise your grade, if you were part of the wedding party. So you retrace your steps and head up to the fourth floor to check out room 407.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take one step off the elevator and are promptly intercepted by stocky woman in a floral print dress that accentuates her endowments - a large belly and sinking breasts that almost meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you young man? This floor is for the wedding party,\" she toots in a snooty Northeastern accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall is swarming with staff and possibly personal assistants. <i>Do they still call them servants?</i> The woman's expression and tone is quite clear that you won't be going anywhere near room 407, so you catch yourself and look completely surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry.\" You swivel your head to look back at the floor indicator. \"I thought this was the next floor.\" Fortunately, you had punched \"5\" as well so that when she eases her head through the doors, she sees the button lit. You back in and smile, \"Wedding, huh? Lovely day for it. Please give my best wishes to the bride and groom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closes as the lady mumbles a thank-you, and you ride up one more floor. Strolling down it, you figure that getting the bride or one of the bridesmaids is not going to happen, at least not without some very careful maneuvering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end of the hall has a window that, fortuitously overlooks the wedding venue. Next to it is room 511, right above 411 and one of the bridesmaids. You were number two in the class for picking locks. Perhaps you can go through here and drop down on whoever is in 411. It's risky, again the extra points for success would mean a lot. You lean over and hear an announcer for a sports game, obviously the TV and someone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that fate is out to thwart you at each turn. Of course, you could use the pen on whoever is inside. You check on room 512 across the hall considering the same option. There are voices talking. Taking two is extremely difficult, but possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back out the window at the lawn with chairs and the altar set under a rose covered arbor as you weigh the possibilities. You're sure it would be easy to catch a staff person, but that is the <i>easy</i> way. This is your first real test, so they can't expect too much, but inside you want to impress them and move up in the organization. After all, you still don't know who or what is behind all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn back to the elevator, the door to 511 suddenly opens. Fortunately, you're not seen as they rush down the hall, but you will be seen when they turn around in the elevator.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The climb is a pretty direct route to the fourth floor. It's tempting too; it'll show off a series of skills that you've acquired that step away from your main 'role' entirely; a capability to get out of any situation. But if your lessons have taught you anything, it's that such bold moves are not always the right course of action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have plenty of time. The wedding has yet to start, never mind the reception. There's no need to rush and do something rash that could get you spotted, like swinging down from a balcony. You suspect you'll get more points for taking a slow, methodical, invisible approach than any risky stunts. You can take your time and move unseen. That's your job, after all. You are a Type 2: that means being able to change identity easily, fluidly, and unseen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and dart down the corridor, stepping into the elevator just as the door closes, smiling apologetically as the occupant of room 511 makes room for you. In keeping with the high-class style, the elevators are old, wood-paneled and elegant. And, like a lot of old, outdated elevators, it has an old fashioned 'stop' button to pause between floors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo went in to the elevator. By the time it reaches the ground floor, only one steps out. You pick up your gym bag, Kurt's clothes stuffed inside, and head toward the resort spa, your blonde hair tied up in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are, for the moment, Helen Pratchett, staying in 511 for a few days of well-deserved pampering. You work full time as an ad executive - the job has consumed your life to the point of burnout and this is your first true vacation of the year. When 'you' stepped into the elevator you were heading to the spa, clad in gym clothes; you wanted to run for twenty minutes on the treadmills and work off a breakfast that was a little too indulgent. Now that you've stolen Helen's very self for a short time, you see no reason to alter her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen knows the spa location, having been there before; every day, in fact. You walk down the turn-off, feeling the change in atmosphere as you taste the humidity in the air. The spa is off to the side, one of the newest parts of the resort, and has a glass roof to allow sunlight to spill inside. A glass wall behind an unmanned reception lets you glance through to the gym, rows of exercise bikes and treadmills facing large, wall mounted screens. It's practically deserted; a couple of guests are working up a sweat, but that's all. You spot one of them from your briefing notes: a lithe girl of Indian descent, power-striding to the thumping bass playing inside. Maya Patel, daughter of exceptionally wealthy parents and fianc\u00e9 of Alexandra's cousin Travis. Obviously she's getting trim ahead of the big day. She's a ticket to the fourth floor - you can't remember the room number, but if you became her you would. Unfortunately, while Maya's a potential disguise she is still not a relative or bridesmaid - you would probably need to swap into someone else to get close to the Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause by the reception desk, faking an interest in a whiteboard with class schedules and staff rotas while you discard Kurt's clothes into a towel bin; you don't need them any more, and keeping them with Helen's possessions would confuse her once you return her to normal. You're wearing Kurt's skin underneath; that's what it's there for, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brief stop turns out to be a lucky choice, as it gives you another opportunity. The spa staff have blocked out appointments on the white board, and under 'Jo - beautician' is a room number: 40... the penmanship for the last number is a little smudged. It could be a 1 or a 7. Either way, that's a golden opportunity; disguise yourself as the beautician and then replace the client. It's certainly going to be someone close to the Vincent family; it might even be the bride herself. That'll certainly gain you the kind of access you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the gym. Maya looks like she's slowing down, and sure enough, she stops the machine and takes a swig of water as she heads to the locker room. If you're going to swap skins, now is the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could slip into the beauticians' suite, a small, secluded side room to the left. You could easily copy whoever Jo is, and simply wait for her next appointment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you like the idea of quick access using the beautician, it may not allow you one-on-one alone with whoever it is you work. In fact, it's likely someone else will be there to chatter away with the client. You're just a resort service, after all, not their normal, familiar hair dresser. Besides, you have to finish the work and then return Jo somehow. Making a switch while she's suppose to be working on someone and expect her finish after \"blacking out\" could raise suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lockers you hear a shower running. There's no one else around, so  it must be Maya. You setup the swap ready to hit her when she steps out then get out of Helen and into Maya leaving Helen to awake in the shower with a slight memory loss from her \"slip\" there. Releasing them is always a concern so there's no suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ ~ ~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside Maya with Helen resting in the shower stall, you start to get dressed while sorting through her memories. Interestingly enough, you find that she isn't staying on the fourth floor and is in another wing. It seems that the Vincents are not very fond of this nouveau rich family nor her foreign appearance. Maya isn't fond of their snootiness either. She's only here because of Travis and has no interaction with any of the bridal party except when with Travis. She's in the gym to work off frustrations of how she was treated, or rather ignored earlier when passing some of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis switch may not have improved your position since even switching with Travis will be hard to coordinate and accomplish just before the wedding, which is the next time they'll meet. Of course, there's always switching with someone in the resort staff so you can get close during the reception. The more you switch and cover your tracks the more you learn and the harder it will be to trace your movements. It's actually something that should score you points, that is, if you pull everything off and don't get sidetracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one good possibility is that the resort's event organizer is also of Indian decent, though does not have such distinct features as Maya. Speaking of features, you're quite taken by Maya's assets now that you see them uncovered. Her breasts, though not large, are firm and exquisite round mounds with large beige areolas topped with thick brown nipples turned dramatically upward. You're tempted to arouse them to see how big and sensitive they are, but you can't risk it or take the time now. <i>Maybe later,</i> you promise yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also has another piercing besides the small one in her nose and the standard ear lobes. It is her navel with a gem completely filling it that seems to change color in the light from a deep emerald green to a dusky ruby maroon. It is hard to determine, and you catch yourself being mesmerized as you hold the skin around it between thumb and forefinger tilting it for the light. It's only when it flashes a cerulean blue that it dawns on you that it's a dark sapphire. Just then the sound of Helen starting to recover spurs you to quickly finish dressing and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any friends in the wedding and Travis with the other men at another hotel, Maya had no real plans now until it was time to get ready, and that was still far off. Her own memories were of trying to decide whether to lounge by the pool or look for Nancy Fralich, the event planner, for a little friendly conversation. You begin to ponder what those places may do to help you, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk along, the sounds of kids at the pool make both you and Maya think better of that. However, you realize that there are youngsters and teenagers attending the wedding. The younger ones are always running around creating havoc at receptions. It would be a perfect diversion if you were one, perhaps the cute, little Taffy Warwick, Alexandra's niece, who will be leading the procession tossing rose peddles. Or Cheryl Newsome, the groom's cousin who is at that awkward and defiant stage of sixteen and hopelessly flirting with every guy. Either might be able to con or slip the Scarlet Bloom away unsuspectingly, and getting them into the restroom by the pool should be easy so you can change into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the junction of the hallway leading either to the pool area or back front where Nancy's office is, you make your decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stop outside Nancy's office and knock on the door. So far, your switches have only distanced you from your intended target. Helen's skin was a key to get you closer to a suitable candidate, and you thought Maya would help with that. Instead, all it's done is cast you as an outsider. You need to find someone who has the access you require: that means Nancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter on her call and close the door behind you. The office is well apportioned, and best of all private. Nancy Fralich looks up, her clean, cream uniform sharp and crisp. She's older than Maya, comfortably over 40, a little large around the waist, with thin glasses resting on her nose. Her Indian roots are clear, although not as prominent as your current disguise's, and masked even more by a heavy foundation of make up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, m'am?\u201d She asks politely, looking up from her computer screen. She's clearly busy putting the finishing touches to the day. You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to ask a question about the wedding reception,\u201d you say, pleasantly. Nancy doesn't even rise from her desk; she looks like she's got more important things to do than answer questions. Still, as a hotel employee, she doesn't have much choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\u201d she says expectantly. You don't bother to ask: instead you just point the pen and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nThe large woman guarding the elevator doesn't even question your entrance to the fourth floor. She looks at you with some disdain, but then gets back to barking at personal servants. You straighten Nancy's glasses, smooth her hair, and walk along the corridor, your slightly large frame jiggling with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change to Nancy took longer than expected, mainly because you had to straighten her uniform and make sure there was no sign of it having collapsed to the floor, but also to help Maya after her blackout. She's currently being looked after by the hotel's trained first aider, who, with a little suggestion from you, has passed off this momentary blackout as exercise-induced. It's the second fainting spell he's had to deal with this morning, he grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've also taken advantage of your new position. As well as complete access around the hotel, your mind has a complete set of memories as to the arrangements for the day. Seating plans \u2013 private instructions from the snooty Vincent family to keep certain relatives as far from the top table as possible \u2013 and entertainment. You also know how the Bloom will be delivered to the bride, and more importantly have been able to plan an escape route. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is part of the reason you've decided to stick with the original plan of becoming one of the main members of the wedding party. You know they are all smokers, and could reasonably be expected to slip away, out of sight for a cigarette. Everyone else will be under closer scrutiny. A few minutes ago, you used Nancy's computer to send a memo to all hotel staff, ensuring the East Walk is left completely secluded tonight. This is a kind of private garden with a little, secluded pavilion at the end. You've also ensured its roped off to prevent guests from entering and interfering with your route. From there, it will be easy to shed any skin you are wearing and simply walk out of the grounds undetected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the bustling corridor. There's a mass of people \u2013 stylists, relatives and relations \u2013 bustling around 407. Private staff move between the rooms. You start walking purposefully, letting Nancy's mannerisms slip out and display themselves as you recall the room owners. 403... Ophelia Vincent. 404 and 405 is the Warwick family, parents in one room, daughter and nanny in the other. 406 is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d A North-eastern accent, dripping with old money, calls out. You turn your heavy frame and smile gracefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, m'am?\u201d you ask, exactly as the true Nancy had done earlier. The woman in front of you is not dressed for the wedding yet, but still reeks of class and style in her sun dress. She's deliberately made up, with tussled, curling brunette hair and an elegant, Roman nose. This is Madeline Warwick,  the bride's eldest sister and unhappily married (according to your dossier) to a real estate tycoon. Behind her, you watch as the second eldest of the Vincent daughters, Katherine, heads to her room, complaining to her PA about some minor point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted to ask about the entertainment,\u201d Madeline says, talking down to you as if you're far below her station. Nancy's manner remains polite, though her personality bristles. \u201cThe reception is such an important affair. It must be elegant. Do you understand? I want to ensure the brats are fully occupied. Kept out of the way. I've had Louisa take Taffy down to the pool this morning while everyone gets ready, but goodness knows what will happen once she's had some wedding cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrats? Obviously Madeline is a distant mother, and has left arrangements to her maid. You smile, and relay the information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d you begin to reel off Nancy's carefully planned scheme. \u201cAfter the buffet banquet there will be three acts. As requested, we have hired a spectacular wedding singer for the event; she's really something special. There will then be a band for those who wish to dance. We've also arranged for a magician to provide entertainment in a side tent, and his assistant will be moving around the main marquee, offering table magic for the guests. Finally there will be Chinese lanterns to launch at sunset. Is there anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeline seems satisfied, and gives you a curt response, turning back to her room. Further down the corridor, an older woman \u2013 the bride's mother, you presume \u2013 begins to make shooing gestures, pushing staff and stylists out of 407. \u201cAll right everyone, give my daughter some privacy! Everyone, start getting ready!\u201d She continues to shout commands, chasing staff down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch the scene impassively behind Nancy's glasses, and start to form a plan. You've now got the perfect window to become one of the key wedding group: the bride, one of her sisters, or one of her bridesmaids. Alternatively, you've been given another perfect opportunity. As Nancy, it's your duty to brief the performers for tonight. You could ignore the wedding entirely, and track down this table magician. It would be easy to perform a few tricks and then sleight-of-hand on the Bloom, eagerly offered up by Alexandra for a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder your next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as you are about to pick a target, a stunning blond addresses you. Her hair is already set beautifully above her exquisite face, one that even the top international models would envy. But it's the perfect posture striding forward that draws your attention. Even the puffy, terry resort robe can't hide her perfect hourglass figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss. You're the one in charge here, right?\" Her tone is confident but not downgrading like the others, though it's her deep sultry voice that commands your attention to her deep blue eyes. This is obviously Carma Hamilton, the maid of honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss. How may I help you?\" Nancy's professionalism takes over glad to be dealing with someone other than the uppity relatives, especially one who seems to acknowledge her position is not a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracefully, she takes your arm and begins to lead you away to the end of the hall as she speaks quietly as if not wanting the others to hear but not soft enough to make them concerned. \"I have some questions about the setup that I can see from the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of stopping at the window at the end of the hall, she quickly turns you into her room, 411. It's the corner room, the best room on the floor, that you recall was initially reserved for Alexandra but was switched to Carma the day before anyone arrived. It's quite nice with corner windows and wrap-around balcony, the balcony you recall that you had considered dropping down to earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this is a sign, although you don't believe in that mystic stuff. Science is your guide now. With the technology of the pen and your training, you can form your own fate, at least, to a great degree. That's what this mission is all about. It's not some sort of movie that has unbelievable coincidences just to put the hero into suspenseful, action-packed situations. This is the real world where real people can be actually zapped into real wearable skins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see the wedding setup and altar quite clearly, and it looks quite uneven,\" she continues after issuing you to the balcony railing. The slight breeze wafts a heavenly fragrance that must be from Carma. Nancy recognizes it as an aroma indicating her high fashion sense that Nancy has experienced being close to some of the most glamorous models who've come to the hotel. It's a breath of fresh air from the old-lady smell wafting in the hallway. However, to your own memories and body down at the base of the skins, it is boldly sensuous and arousing. You have to keep your focus with Nancy's skin to avoid doing anything stupid, and there are several stupid things you really would like to do if you weren't in Nancy's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Alexandra has insisted that we wear heels, we must have the ground level and solid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to you expectantly, probably because you know that the uneven ground was purposely prepared so that Alexandra would be standing on a slight step so as not to look like a little white puff next to Carma. Although, Alexandra's height and form were going to do that regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open your mouth to politely explain, she cuts you off. \"It would be tragic if someone would stumble and cause any disruption for an otherwise perfect day for Alexandra.\" Your training allows you to easily recognize the insincerity dripping from the words and the magnificent way she is manipulating you with a honey coated threat. Curiosity is added to your other emotions of why she is doing this. \"The aftermath could be devastating for the resort and staff with all the lawyers attending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I will make a note of that and get on it immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you add it to the \"To Do\" list in the steno pad Nancy always carries, Carma smiles and turns back into the room. When finished, you gaze at her magnificent figure from behind before pointing the pen and firing. Carma slowly deflates into a terry-robe pile setting her hair on top still perfectly coiffured. Good thing, too, since there would be no way for you to get it fixed in time and calling up a resort beautician now would raise too many suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strut inside and pull the drapes as you shuck your clothes and take off your outer skin. Setting Nancy down, you redress her skin then set her on a chair at the table where you'll eventually re-inflate her and console her about migraine headaches. But now you need to switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeping into Carma's skin you feel your muscles shift to well toned calves and thighs. Hips barely expand, but your tummy shrinks even more taut than the skin Gunther gave you. With the arms now smooth and just as perfect as your new legs, your chest adjusts from pecks to perky mounds topped with elegant beige circling a darker peak that reaches out into the cool air. Carefully, you lift the head and hair into place and make sure the back seals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarma is really the most beautiful woman you have ever been, or seen, or imagined for that matter. You stare into the mirror amazed that she is still single since she can obviously have anyone she wants, which may be a reason to be single.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories and feeling that come now show you that Carma and Alexandra grew up as friends but are not so much any more, at least Alexandra isn't to Carma. Once the marriage was announced, everything changed in Carma's world. She had always planned on marrying Holden Parry, having been intimate with him for years. The initial shock devastated her until she had a long 'conversation' with Holden as they lay together in bed the next day. It was not going to change their ongoing intimacies. It was just a family arrangement of convenience and money, the loss of it by the Vincent family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. Carma is already the mistress, as proven very early this morning before sunrise in Harmony Garden, but she is already plotting to become wife number two. In her mind, it's doubtful Alexandra will survive the honeymoon, and it will all start when Alexandra loses the Scarlet Bloom on her wedding day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts and memories from Carma put a whole new perspective on your plan since Carma already has set in motion her own scheme to steal the Scarlet Bloom. If you hadn't ended up here, you might have crossed swords with this sinister beauty, and possibly both failed the test, and perhaps even caught. Maybe there such a thing as fate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grin, as freely, maliciously, evilly, as Carma would. You're dressed to turn heads, a perfectly calculated move to overshadow the bride, who innocently took your advice on outfits for her bridesmaids. You lean down, fixing a flower to a gown that perfectly compliments your hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a bitch,\" you condemn in Carma's accent. Once you helped Nancy recover, you took your time getting ready, marvelling at the sheer, audacious evil of her plan. It chills you to think she spent the morning after her encounter with Holden reclining in front of the TV, painting her nails and watching tennis on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan is too good to ignore, though devoid of subtlety and lacking any morals. She wants to upset and distress Alexandra, give her the wedding from hell before her honeymoon 'accident'. First the walk will be evened, so Alexandra is feeling as self-conscious as possible. Then a few barely hidden barbs will be slipped at her weight. She'll barely be able to concentrate during the photos, and won't notice as Holden and the bribed photographer manouvre her into the wet, slippy, muddy corner of the Harmony Garden that was so heavily watered the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's all the treats Carma has planned for her so-called best friend, even before the reception begins. It doesn't mention that her first dance will be 'accidentally' danced at a faster tempo than Alexandra will find comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are just annoyances, though. The real wedding from hell starts when her priceless family heirloom, wrapped around her neck by her husband, will mysteriously vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarma's snake smile has fooled Alexandra entirely. It makes you feel a little sick. Carma is a vile piece of work. But, as you hear others gather to leave for the wedding, she's not the only bitch in this nest of vipers. The more you learn about the people at the wedding, the more they disgust you. The racism, the poor parenting, the self-obsession and, of course, plans to commit outright murder. But then you're walking around wearing someone else's body; who are you to judge anyone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance through the balcony doors, out toward the garden. As is tradition, the groom and families have started gathering. All that's left are the bride and her bridesmaids. There's a faint knock at your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carma?\" Alexandra slips through the door, earnest eyes looking at you sincerely. \"I... I'm not sure if... phew. I guess this is pre-wedding jitters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown Carma's most perfected, empathetic frown. \"Oh, honey,\" you say, stepping forward to give her a deep hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if you can go through with this. Carma's cold personality is planning murder. Murder; you have to stop that. You're sure you can, somehow, and still get the Bloom. But for Alexandra there's no happy ending if you ignore the problem you're confronted with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? Take action to stop Carma's scheme, prevent the wedding and still claim the Bloom? Or remain in character, no matter how terrible the outcome may be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's too late now to do much. You're both dressed and will off to the pre-wedding location shortly. Besides, this is the stuff that you are suppose to do when go on final assignment. At least you can get use to it without it really being your own doing. It's Carma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry your little head about any of this,\" you cheerfully chirp. Then you use the back of your hand on her chin to raise her head so her eyes meet yours now pulsating with Carma's most fake sincerity. \"You need to just ignore anything that seems off today. It's just your imagination. It will all be perfect no matter what you think, so don't. Do whatever makes you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Carms. Thanks, you're the best.\" With that she turns bouncing out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate that nickname since you were wee tykes. Soon, though, you won't have to put up with it any more. The thought pushes a sly smile on your lips as you float serenely after her. Everything feels so right that it hits you hard when you realize that you felt so in tuned with Carma that you had lost your own focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Never had that before. Must just be careful not to let her emotions and thoughts take me too far,</i> you think as you glide down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you and \"mom\" (Alexandra's shrew of birthright and the reason to their wasted fortune) ride the elevator to the main floor but leave by the back doors so as not to be seen. The resort purposely had the elevator installed to allow the bride to remain hidden. An elegant holding room is set aside where Alexandra and you will wait with the other bridesmaids until it's time. Mom stays for a few minutes regaling everyone with fabrications about her wedding where the elite of the elite came only to be outshone by her magnificent beauty (which must have been due to very heavy makeup, you think), but soon she leaves, nose in the air to the rest of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou while away the time holding Alexandra's sweaty hand and offering excessive comfort as do the rest of the bridal party. She's a neurotic wreck, and it's a good thing they allowed her a double dose of her medication today. However, each time she calms, you remind her not to worry about something else so she is almost twitching of all the possibilities of things to go wrong. By the time the ceremony is over, she'll be chugging champagne which will set her into the perfect mood so you can manipulate her without her remembering. When the Bloom slips from her neck, she won't even feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's such a lush. If Carma hadn't taken her to the hospital first week of college, she would have died of alcohol poisoning from just having consumed too much. Your thoughts turn angry knowing that if that happened you, er Carma, wouldn't have this problem now, but that was back when she was satisfied with your discards, not pulling the best from your loins. The image of Holden on top of her tenses your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Carma. I owe you so much for all this.\" Alexandra pats your arm and smiles happily at you misinterpreting why you just squeezed her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to make sure this all goes to plan, dear,\" you beam with a fake smile that she's never been able to recognize.  <i>Your debt will soon be paid,</i> you smirk inside from Carma's emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan simmers in your head knowing how plastered Alexandra will be by the end of the reception, and you've ensured there's a magnum of champagne in the bridal suite just for her. Will it be excessive alcohol consumption or some accident, slipping in the shower perhaps, or an overdose of medication combined, you don't care. It's all making you excited. No, aroused. The only thing that could be better is having the Scarlet Bloom here against your own body while Holden drives you to ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whoa. There it goes again. I wonder why this skin is affecting me so?</i> you think trying to reign in the feeling that's pushing you into Carma's perspective so frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to her memories of the Scarlet Bloom you find that Carma's only seen it once, long ago. It's been kept in the bank vault, too valuable to even take out for the fanciest occasion. Today though, it's a required right of all Vincent brides to wear it on their wedding day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no clock in the room, anxiety builds for you as well as Alexandra. Hers is the wedding, yours is the arrival of the Bloom. You've already got Alexandra to agree to let every bridesmaid try it on. If only you were the one to feel it on your chest during the ceremony. Ah, you'll have it soon enough. For once Alexandra has her accident, it will pass to her husband ... and to his second wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of that coming true has you close your eyes and are so happy to be Carma. A deep breath escapes in a quiet sigh at these thoughts. It is actually calming, too calming you remind yourself, your own mind coming back to the forefront. It's as if Carma's skin is taking you over rather than you controlling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you wonder if this is a malfunction of the pen, or even a trap set for the test. It's almost too convenient how everything you did lead you to Carma, twice. What if Carma - the person - is a modified skin. You've heard rumors that while a skin, things can be done to it and then return the person without them knowing. What if it is a self-sealing skin that you can't escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn! I should have checked the opening to see if it was normal,</i> you think starting to panic. That was barely mentioned in class, but you were too preoccupied with Nancy and Carma that you forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and wonder if you can get off somewhere and try it. There is a restroom just for this room, and one of the bridesmaids is on her way there. If you're stuck, maybe you don't want to go through with the plan. Or maybe you will be released if you make it back as Carma and still maintain secrecy. Or maybe you should switch, again, if you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock sounds at the door. That should be the delivery of the Scarlet Bloom. Carma's desire for it forces your eyes to lock onto the door. She wants to be near it so bad that your crotch is starting to moisten. Should you trust the organization, they must have tested the pen and wouldn't do something like this to you ... would they?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A serene, pleasant smile of false delight. You're so comfortable pretending to support Alexandra; you have been since you grew apart at college. You think of the end game, of Holden's grasp around your body, and feel your muscles tense with desire. Not long to go now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were worried about something in the waiting room an hour ago, although what has slipped from your mind.<i> Something to do with... pens, maybe?</i> It's hard to recall. And hardly relevant. You've been slowly increasing the pressure on Alexandra since the room, adding to her neuroses, planting doubts in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can you walk in heels and a wedding dress? Oh, don't forget your words, honey. Yes, dear, you stand over... whoops, how awful, you've fallen in the mud. Better get that white dress cleaned up or you'll look a state, won't you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of revenge. All coming to fruition tonight. It's like the poem. <i>And I sunnied it with smiles, and with soft, deceitful wiles...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a slow sip of the champagne, letting the fizz rush up your nose. It's almost time for the speeches, and the cake cutting, and that first, fateful dance. You glance over to Alexandra again, watching the haze in her eyes, wondering if she'll dance straight. The Scarlet Bloom sparkles as it sways with its owners tipsy motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect, you grin. You rise, and slip over, running a fingernail briefly across Holden's neck as you pass him, to slip down next to Alexandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we doing, Mrs Parry?\" You say, so sweet and innocent, listening for a tell-tale slur. Alexandra answers with a \"Wonderful, Carms\", her words already drawn out: a combination of the pills and the alcohol. You grin, and step out of the marquee for fresh air. A faint memory tells you that the garden path will be a nice, isolated spot. You don't know why you think that, but you decide to take a walk there. The air is pleasant, the scent of the flowers sweet... and perhaps there's a little whiff of pot in the air, too. Maybe someone has snuck out of the reception. You turn down the path, walking round the side of the summer house, and lean up against it, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't resist the urge any longer. You need to slip this masquerade and grin at how perfectly the plan is going. You slip your hand into your clutch, absent-mindedly checking your cell messages while you wait for everything to unfold in the marquee. There's a strange pen inside, and you wonder where you picked it up. Why would you, Carma Hamilton, have a strange pen? Maybe you'll throw it away after the reception. You pick up the cell, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my God! I've got snot coming out of my nose!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn on the camera, pointing it at yourself. Sure enough, there's a faint green trickle of slime, spilling out. Like a green suit.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWhat's a green suit?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nA green pen... the pens. The PENS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought of Carma's, you suddenly realize the grave danger you're in. You grab the pen and hit the white switch, cutting away Carma's beautiful head, freeing your Kurt skin. It's covered in green slime. You begin to wipe it away, scraping it off your face, wiping it against the wall you're leaning against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. A green pen means a suit that can convince its wearer they really were that person. You suddenly realize you haven't been pretending to be Carma Hamilton for the past hour; you've actually thought you<i> were </i>her. You need to change out of this skin and into another one, and quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is, you're now trapped. The reception is going on, and you're stuck in a garden, the body of Carma Hamilton, her head and perfect hair clasped in your hands. There's also no sign of anyone you could swap into quickly, let alone use to get back to the Bloom. This area is off limits, you put the order in yourself. Your only hope is that some guest decided to ignore the 'no entry' sign and sneak off from the reception for a short while, or that one of the staff is nearby, through one of the hedgerows. Either way, you've got to get out of Carma quickly - and back to steal the Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic and wonder what you're going to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's a noise on the other side of the hedge, so you slide down the path looking for an opening to see who, or what, it may be. Cigarette smoke drifts up your nostrils. It must be someone sneaking a forbidden pleasure as the entire resort and all its grounds are smoke-free. Two more steps, and you can make out a small figure, nondescript in the dark. Then a red glow illuminates the face causing you to smile. No one else is around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pen fires on instinct, and you zip around the hedge pulling off the Carma suit as you go. Within a couple seconds, you're there and quickly stomp the butt before it can do any damage. There's no way to know how much time you have, so you reseal Carma tossing her back around the hedge. The slime quickly dries and falls off like powder as you brush yourself. Fortunately it only works when in the suit, so you step into your new skin then pull the person's clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn training, you held the second fastest record for switching out of one suit and into another including clothing. It took you a while to master the complexity of women's garments, but now those aere almost as easy as stepping into a skin. That is good, because you hear footsteps coming down the path where Carma is. Carma should be waking up about now, but that's no longer your concern as you hustle back to the reception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you step into the the tiki torch and moon lit garden, Alexandraias dancing in her bare feet like a fairy under a spell. Everyone seems spellbound with eyes upon her. You ignore her and gatherd up the used glasses and abandoned cake plates setting them on the trays to go back to the kitchen. The flute and percussion music tease your ears as you wander and wonder about the hypnotized crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unholy crap!</i> you suddenly think as you realize it <i>is</i> a fairy spell or, at least, a high tech version. You remember this discussion in training, and that it is very dangerous for anyone in or out of a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one is moving except Alexandra. Your eyes keep drifting toward the florescent figure in the center of the ring, and you have to force them back to avoid being trapped as well. If you look at her for more than a few seconds, all hope will be lost, and you will become rooted to the ground thinking aimless thoughts and completely paralyzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not part of Carma's plan, so someone else must be after the Scarlet Bloom, someone or organization that has the knowledge and capability to invoke such things. Having almost been trapped in a greener as the green slime suits are called, you consider if it is your organization again. The shield glasses you need are in Kurt's bag back in the hotel. For an instant, you consider trying to get them, but that would take too much time. Your only hope is to maintain your willpower and see what happens, but your body has already turned toward Alexandra, and something invisible is pulling your chin up and twisting your neck to face her as well. You can't even make your eyes close any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It must be the music.</i> The only way to save yourself is to plug your ears and scream.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The music haunts you, lingers across your mind in a drifting melody that makes you want to do little more than gaze out into the crowd and watch Alexandra's strange pirouettes and arcs, but you plug your ears, only increasing the volume of the scream. Your false voice resounds through the tent, its pitch barely loud enough to prevent the strange chimes from touching your brain. It feels like you're fighting against an invisible fog, cutting through a misty veil that has enraptured everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, Alexandra Parry dances as if she'll never stop, entranced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger from table to table, knocking over plates and bumping into people, but nobody seems to even notice, so caught up are they in the strange dance. This is high tech stuff, you realize. Some would call it magic, but Gunther used to talk about the different permutations and possibilities of acoustic weaponry. Such a thought, he used to say, was as old as time itself. The Greeks knew it as a siren: the haunting melody making people oblivious to the calamity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue screaming. Screaming until your jaw aches. Screaming as you force your way toward your only salvation. Whoever is doing this must have 'made' you now, but you're sure you've spotted them, too: an ear plug in the crowd. It's too hard to concentrate on who it was at the moment, though. You just continue to force your way past mesmerized guests, toward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble and fall, just short of your goal. Your ears are uncovered, and the entrancing music fills your head again. Mechanically, your head begins to turn toward Alexandra, even from your prone position. You can't fight it this time. All you can do is reach out with your hands, fumbling, grasping, tugging...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music stops. You turn, shocked to see you managed to do it. You've pulled out the plug socket. Everyone stands for a moment, unsure what they were doing. Carma staggers back into the party, none the worse for - literally - wear, and Alexandra finishes her dance and looks utterly bemused. Amid the confused faces you recognize at least one frustrated scowl. You stagger to your feet, walk to the music deck, and retrieve the CD. Seconds later you smash it in your palm, and rush out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Carma suit wasn't the organization's doing. The room switch, the way down... it was a trap. A trap you fell for, and managed to get out of. Someone else is here, playing a high stakes game with you. They want the Bloom too, and now they know who you are. You're pretty sure you've identified them, but that doesn't mean they won't switch identities too. Behind you, guests are clapping Alexandra's 'performance' - although you doubt they realize what they are clapping. Other guests are talking about entertainment, even more are heading to the resort's toilets. The sun has set, and it's dark in the surrounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got a few options. Grabbing another disguise seems to make sense - you're recognized and if you're going to get the Bloom you'll have to go unnoticed, both by the guests and your rivals. That will be hard - especially given how everyone in this crazy wedding seems to be up to something. Alternatively, you could move against your rivals. They might have all the advantages, but you have a few tricks up your sleeve too. As a worst case scenario you could wait for things to play out, and either retrieve the Bloom from Carma's scheme, or obtain it from Alexandra as she and Holden head to their suite later.</span></div></div>",

Obviously, she works out which her memories confirm. She's even allowed to use the resort's facilities as a perk of the job. She was there earlier before her shift. You must have just missed her. She's also a health food addict. It seems a strange combination that she was off smoking when you suited her, but you have other things to think about besides analyzing her. At least there's nothing to indicate she was tampered with by your organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Suzy. How's the party going?\" It's Rob Johnson, a good friend of Suzy's. Tall and lean and platonic, though Suzy would gladly do him, but even her flirts have never drawn any interest. He's a dishwasher at the resort. Doesn't smoke and enjoys the good food of life: sugary and greasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird and wild like they all are. Fortunately, no one has climbed on the tables like last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could have seen that one. Not much fun just cleaning up all night after the rich, but it pays the bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Got another couple hours before we have to clear everything, but Rodney said we may have to stay later, after midnight. Don't mind the extra pay, though.\" Rob smiles and nods concurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney's the kitchen and bar manager. He's an ass that gets to strut around and give orders if he thinks anything isn't going right. He was one of the people with ear-phones during Alexandra's dance. Supposedly, they're connected to his walkie-talkie so he can use to call the kitchen or security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a blast comes through the kitchen speakers. \"Suzy, where have you gotten to? You better not be off smoking somewhere. There's glasses and plates piling up, and bring out some clean ones. They're using 'em up fast. Rob better have the first batch washed by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Rob share a shake of your heads and both mouth, \"Asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you carry back the tray of clean dishes, you think of how best it would be to get to the Bloom. As a service person, your chances of getting anywhere near Alexandra are slim. Maybe you could suit Rodney; he has a much better chance, and you could find out from his memories if he's involved in the fairy snatch that you foiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd be better if you could get back into the wedding party. However, Rodney will probably be watching you closely making it difficult to sneak off following someone who may go for a break to the restroom or just off down one of the paths. Plus whoever was using the Fairy dance tech is going to be watching you as well. Although, Rodney can't stop you if you have to use the restroom yourself as long as you're quick. \"Don't just sit around peeing all night,\" as he's liable to say per Suzy's past encounters with him on the same subject. He's a stupid, insensitive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you round a bend  behind the bushes, a guest approaches you. He's tall and moves nicely. You can tell he's well built the way he carries himself. With the light behind him, though, you can't make out the face. You could probably pen him and switch right here since no one should be using this path except the staff which is really just you until the servers are done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excusse me, m-miths. Is thiths the w-way to the rrrrrresthtrooms?\" His slurring indicates he's had quite a bit to drink, but that's not what draws your attention. You recognize the voice.

It's down this way.\" You point, balancing the plates you are carrying, down a walk that leads further into the garden. This is a perfect opportunity; as the groom you can comfortably get closer to the Bloom, and nobody would ask any questions. Holden sways, and gives you a dreamy, sleepy smile, turning the direction you pointed and beginning to stagger his way down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you look for somewhere to set down the tray of plates and turn, Suzy's flat shoes - ideal for waitress work - crunching the soft gravel behind. Holden's staggering all over the path, and you step into the shadows of the hedgerows as you stalk him.

A shadow emerges from the square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney. So you were right. Without another thought, he begins to shed his clothes, then grappling over Rodney's head, pulling his black hair in front of his face, and sliding it off. The man looks young - early 20s at a guess - but with a weasel-like face and pock-marked cheeks. You don't recognize him, but then, in your line of work, that means practically nothing. Without hesitation, he begins to slip into Holden Parry's collapsed skin, tugging his legs over his own, grabbing the torso and forcing it up, slipping his hands into the arms and flexing his new fingers - still wearing the wedding ring. In seconds the head is drawn over his own, and a naked Holden stands there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch in the shadows, watching this unfold. You've caught your opponent - assuming he's the only one. There might be more; Rodney wasn't the only one with a headset, after all. And your worst feelings as confirmed as the new Holden, flexing his muscles as he does so, slips into the groom's trousers and shirt, buttoning up the cuffs, and slides into the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switched to Plan B. I'm now the groom. Repeat, I'm now the groom. Any sign of our unwanted guest? Last seen in a waitress, Suzanne Goldman. Yeah, well, find her. One sec... shit. This guy's memories say she was on the main path less than a minute ago. Everyone, get over here. Comb the grounds! Hold on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolden, or whoever he is, turns to his pen set, and levels it at Rodney. A small green beam hits the still-deflated manager. \"Just covering our tracks,\" he says, firing another pen to reinflate Rodney. \"Right. Scout the place. I'm heading to the restrooms, you check the kitchens. She can't have gone far. Remember, Plan B. So hold fire until the honeymoon suite.\" Holden laughs. \"I'm going to have some fun with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep crouched, watching as 'Holden' turns and walks down the path, eyes searching. You hold your breath as he storms past, looking out for you, and relax a little as he keeps going. Rodney is beginning to stir, but he's not an option: unless you're mistaken, he's been converted to a greener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you head to the left, you could quickly slip past Rodney and work your way around to the entertainers' preparation area. From there you could easily slip into either the main marquee, or grab one of the entertainment staff: a singer, the band, the magician or assistant. Nancy might even be around, coordinating things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could wait for whoever comes to hunt you down. You've got a pen set of your own after all; you could surprise whoever is tracking you and impersonate them. Maybe you could even get hold of a green pen. You know Gunther would love to get his hands on one of those, break it down and find out what it's made of. It would be even better than coming back with the Bloom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're certainly not going to let whoever your opposition are take this from you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to take a big chance and get out of Suzy, seal her back up, and have her re-inflate. With luck, she'll just think she was daydreaming with a flashback/blackout from her days using those hallucinogens and not realize how much time has passed. Of course, that leaves you naked and afraid. There's all kinds of reasons that a naked man wandering around a wedding reception will draw attention, but you have no plans to wander around. Quickly you toss her with clothes still on over by the tray of dishes before the skin starts to inflate and sneak back into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring someone is bound to be by soon, your plan is to take one of them and go on the offensive from the inside. It's time to use your ability to blend into the scenery, or in this case, hide in the bushes. You recall how stupid the training session seemed as you were stripped naked and put into various suits and taken blindfolded into places where you should stand out. However, you found that you had an amazing natural ability to actually not be noticed. Of course, most of your life, you seemed to not be there. People would talk about you in front of you like you weren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know he would look much better in a green shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why he continues to wear those ugly brown pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like he's just trying to be difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Dad, I'm right here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, son. ... Do you think he even cares about his appearance, dear?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by a crunch of gravel and Suzy's voice coming from the darkness to your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me, you creepy dirt bag. I'm not some floozy you rich bastards can drag into the bushes and ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly stops, and you can imagine why. One of the thugs must have found her and used a pen to shut her up. Your only hope is to use your pen on that person before they realize that you've jumped and tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealthily you move up the path. Two silhouettes greet you as you get close. To your surprise it is Holden, or actually your mystery competitor in Holden's skin, and he hasn't done anything except clamp his hand over Suzy's mouth. As you watch her struggle, you notice he's got a white cloth pressed to her mouth and nose. Slowly, her struggles cease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's little you can do now. Well, you could use the pen on the guy in the suit, but that wouldn't be productive and could make matters worse. Instead you decide to make a radical move. As they say in training, if all the planning and technology become no use, do something so stupid and obvious that it will seem to blend in. So that's what you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa oh whoa oh whoa! Party! Party! Party! Hale to the bride and groom. Everyone celebrate nude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run past a shocked Holden and unconscious Suzy then through the bushes into the reception. You continue screaming manically as you weave through the dancers and the standing guests. With it now being dark and the lights limited plus the pulsating music, Kurt's skin you're wearing is not recognizable but you do draw several men to yell, \"Right on.\" \"Go for it.\" \"Let's go for it!\" as you exit down another path out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Security. Security. We have a streaker headed towards Lover's Maze.\" you hear squawking out of several walkie-talkies. \"Make that multiple streakers,\" comes a few seconds later. Obviously, some of the more inebriated must have shucked their clothes and followed you, just as you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you circle and see a pile of clothes along the edge of the bushes and one person hanging back laughing. A little stealth again and the fact that everyone is looking the other way where you and the others disappeared allows you the opportunity that you've been waiting for. You point the pen and shoot the person behind everyone then dash across, scoop up the new body suit and their clothes, then disappear down a path away from the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're running, you pull on the suit without missing a step and barely slowing down. It's a talent that got you special recognition during training and a free night of R&amp;R with the suit of your choice. It didn't actually work out as well as you'd hoped, but the skill now proves itself useful as you reappear in less than a minute with no one the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the shadows at the edge of the reception area, you consider your options. The diversion has sent security scattering making it easy for you to get away. The guy you've bagged is just an old friend of Alexandra's who she hadn't seen in years, high school actually. He probably got the invitation along with everyone in her high school who got spammed by Alexandra's parents hoping for the most gifts. He thought it would be fun to get a free meal and party with the rich and famous, something he never was able to do then, or now, being of a much lower class. Too bad because he seems to be a nice guy and even had a crush on Alexandra back then. He's not a loser, just a shy geeky type who plays video games and writes fantasy adventure stories in his spare time. His job is much less exciting but pays quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra is hopelessly staggering around as if she's still dancing to a very different drummer. You remember how Carma set her up with the drugs and booze, so she's probably completely out of it. However, nobody seems to notice, or care, except one. Carma is watching her closely slowly sipping some fruity-looking drink. Holden has just come back from dealing with Suzy and is purposely walking towards Carma. He probably now knows of Carma's plan, so maybe he thinks she was involved with Suzy. Hopefully, Suzy hasn't become collateral damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation seems so open up for you now. You can easily just walk by Alexandra and swipe the Bloom with your talented fingers. She would never feel it disappear. Although you could be seen by anyone and most likely Carma who's eyes hover like a vulture. Instead you can just walk by and whisper that there's a surprise for her down one of the paths linking it to Holden or her dad, or remind her of high school and ask for a dance taking her away while nobody pays attention. She'd do just about anything from a suggestion at this point. Off down a path, she'd trip and lose the Bloom. It would be a while as she wanders around before anyone notices it's gone and start a search. You'd be long gone with mission accomplished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you're still concerned about the others trying for it as well as the private security guards loitering around conspicuously still wearing sunglasses. Perhaps they're really night vision glasses. You'd like to uncover all those undercover, but that might mean playing musical skins with everyone still here since this test continues to unravel twisting every which way. Although, it might be good intelligence that the organization could use especially if you could get that green pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening your suit, you take a deep breath and ask yourself whether you need extra points out of this test, or should you just finish your mission to grab the Scarlet Bloom at the reception and head back?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Bloom is your goal, but the green pen...that would be something special, and really prove your worth. You know your decision before you even have pause to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pen is, at the moment, with Holden. So you know he's one of the opposition, too. There's a couple of other suspects for the other members of his gang. The security guards are one, each with earphones in that could have concealed their protection against the strange 'fairy dance' you witnessed earlier. Ophelia Vincent is another hot candidate: one of the bridesmaids, she seemed particularly annoyed, rather than confused, when Alexandra stopped dancing. It was a strange reaction. You guess it was 'Rodney' - now 'Holden' that switched out the music, so there's no lead there. And then there's Travis, Maya's fiance. He was wearing some kind of ear buds during the dance, you think. Could he be another possibility? That might mean returning to Maya's lovely form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty wild, wasn't it?\" A voice, strong and feminine, greets you. You turn and smile. She's an older woman, maybe in her mid-40s, with a powerful, striking face - the kind you expect to see in a boardroom. Her black hair is flecked with silver, and her bright red lipstick contrasts against the golden jewelry around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The streakers. Thank goodness we packed the kids off to the entertainment in another tent, or to bed, to let the adults get on with the serious business. By which I mean <i>drinking</i>.\" She smiles, and raises a glass to you. \"Clarissa Van Lewen. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rich. Rich Breadworth. Old friend of Alexandra's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So the Vincents still have some old friends? There I was thinking we were the only ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, and so does she, a laugh that rings hollow, echoing with money. \"So, are you enjoying this little get-together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" you say, leaning over to a buffet table and helping yourself to one of the small finger foods. Some kind of seafood; it slips and slithers down your throat. \"It's great to see Alex so happy, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Clarissa's smile widens. \"Although,\" she says, tracing a finger along your shirt, \"it's not just for her, this wedding. Everyone is entitled to a good time. Some enjoy streaking...I... prefer to lose my clothes somewhere a little more... intimate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush; it's Rich's reaction, but yours too. You're pretty sure you're being hit on. You look down at the wedding ring on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, aren't you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Married? Spare me. Do you know what my husband has done today? Kept himself busy and out of the way. Constantly on the phone, making plans, talking to that gastly manager... Rod something? He even had headphones in during the reception.<i> Headphones</i>, I ask you. Probably listening to some sports game. Not exactly what you call attentive, is it? But you, Rich.. you, I am sure, would be very attentive. Very attentive indeed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans forward, whispering in your ear. \"We can slip away, you know. You and I. You'd like that, wouldn't you... Rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it through. Out of the corner of your eye, 'Holden' is distracted with Carma. You still have time to snag the Bloom, and you're certain that you could slip into another face at the wedding and get closer to some of your suspects;it should be easy enough to rebuff Clarissa. But Mr Van Lewen, whoever he is, sounds like one of your rivals in disguise, too. It would explain why he's been so neglectful with his wife. And you know that 'Holden' won't be making a move until the bridal suite. Perhaps you could head off with Clarissa, back to the hotel. There, you could either switch with her and grab Mr Van Lewen, or find someone Holden and ambush him as he returns to the hotel. </span></div></div>",

The only thing it hasn't proven is whether you can tell if I'm really your contact or just another thief that happened to pen them and get their skin and memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she holds up a pen. You don't spend more than a nanosecond looking at it but watch her eyes looking for the telltale signs of another pair just behind those lenses. It's almost too shadowy to tell for sure, but you can see the pen slowly being leveled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choices are limited, and you have little time. Your own pen is in your hand, and you could do a preemptive strike. That way you can find out for sure, and it is acceptable protocol to verify your contact that way if you think he or she has been compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also option number two.

You lean in and slip your tongue into her waiting mouth, the taste of lipstick slipping down as you feel her tongue entwine with yours, and her body melt under your embrace. She closes her eyes, muttering satisfied murmurs as thoughts of the Bloom and the pen vanish and she begins to grip tight against Rich's suit, her finger nails clawing into your back. You grip her hard, swinging her against a hedged wall, pushing against her and feeling the heat of your bodies. She murmurs again, delirious with pleasure as you pull back, resting your nose against her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman's breath shudders, her breasts jiggling as the flow of pleasure trickles down her spine. She gasps for breath, collecting herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for a show of faith?\" you whisper, using your most seductive tone the Organization taught you. Clarissa Van Lewen's eyes gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" she coos. \"Now are you going to stay in character and keep going? Because I can feel this body just yearning for more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip her hair, tugging it back, nuzzling into her. She leans back, clearly in ecstasy. Rich isn't used to this, or experienced at all, but you know what you're doing as you expertly nibble on her lip. She's so caught up in the rapture of the moment, she doesn't even feel it as you slip your hand into her pocket, and she's beginning to slip out of her clothes while you've taken her pen, and the Bloom, and slipped them into Rich's jacket pockets. Again, you back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here,\" you say. \"And not in him. Let me get someone... better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa Van Lewen's eyes gleam. \"Sounds delightful.

You just managed to pull the wool over another agent's eyes. Now you have the real Bloom - you have no idea how she got it from Alexandra, and don't really care - and you just need to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simplest way would be to walk out the front gate, or the escape route you'd meticulously planned as Nancy earlier. But there are four other initiates and a Type A, if Clarissa told you the truth. They're sure to be guarding the exits the moment they realize the Bloom is gone. Either you can try to make a run now \u2013 as Rich or anyone else \u2013 or you can wait it out. There's a whole hotel of people you could disguise yourself as, and a convention tomorrow. If you can hold your nerve and wait until morning, you could slip out easily. They can't search everyone, can they?</span></div></div>",

By morning the place will be crawling with security and insurance agents that will take the place and everyone in it apart - literally. If your organization has this skin technology, you can only imagine what other types may be in use elsewhere if not in use or in beta in your own. Therefore, the others plotting against you know that you will make a break tonight. Only a crazed fool would stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maniacal laugh is quashed in your throat, but the smirk can't be suppressed. It beams as you waltz to the music with an invisible partner. They are about to find out how really deranged you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicker than you thought it would be, you get out of Rich and into another high school acquaintance of Alexandra's. She, too, was a nobody back then. From Rich's memories, you didn't even recognize her until you got in her skin and released her memories with the pen. She had been a pimply, chubby, dumpy girl who worked on the school paper and backstage for the dramatics department dreaming of being beautiful and recognized by everyone. That hadn't happened. She was no longer pimply or dumpy, although the flowing salmon dress with a pale-red rose design didn't hide that she still was pudgy. Maybe not beautiful, she definitely had a pretty face and attractive auburn hair that was full and bounced on her shoulders as she, now you, walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplated coming back in with Rich, but she had a date, and it might be too obvious that you had switched to be seen with him. Instead when you \"found\" Rich confused and on the ground when he reinflated, you told him someone said the food was tainted and he should get to a hospital immediately. That sent him off pronto and made him a prime suspect and a distraction since he would be gone before the search started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, as you re-entered the reception and headed to your date, everything seemed normal - too normal. The young adults were gyrating to the music, and the older ones were around the edges conversing. Holden was now dancing with Alexandra holding her so close that you couldn't see if Clarissa had substituted a fake Bloom or not. Carma was now in the clutches of a short, middle-aged gentleman whose head was perfectly aligned with her chest. She didn't seem to care as he stared into it while they circled to the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you miss me?\" you asked with a mousiness that could enthrall a cat and scooted up beside Tom Weikert. His eyes were focused at the entrance you came through and followed you all the way, his smile getting a bigger the closer you came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Missy, me?\" he offered in mock surprise, and you giggled as his arm went around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy Chamberland was quite a flirt, something she'd developed in college to get men, once her acne cleared up. Tom was a guy who worked across the street she had met at lunch one day and had been sweet on her for the past two months. So sweet that he hadn't even tried to bed her yet, but she was determined to end that tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Bloom wedged between your breasts for temporary safekeeping, you leaned over and kissed him, not as powerful as with Clarissa but good enough that you felt his arousal bulging his pants. It was going to be a shame that you would have to deny them both, but business had to come first. He easily followed you into the throng of sweaty, throbbing bodies  as you swayed sensually to the music. He began to imitate a drowning duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, you maneuvered him so his trip would send him into Holden and Alexandra. Well, it should look like he tripped and pulled you on top of the pile of the four of you. It was the distraction of your finger going from your lips to your cleavage that had him lose concentration while your foot leveraged him sideways and off-balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, Alexandra didn't cry out as you all fell on her. Only Holden blubbered some cursing. The closest dancers began to sort out the mass of arms and legs, and when you stood, you were wearing the Bloom instead of the fake-antique locket you had come with. That was now in Holden's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you anticipated, no one paid it any attention - for about fifteen seconds. Those closest watched Alexandra lying on her back giggling uncontrollably while flapping her arms as if trying to fly. After pulling Alexandra to her feet, both Holden and Carma gasped as she just kept on giggling then flew around the dance area waving her arms up and down. While everyone followed Alexandra, Carma and Holden just stared at you wearing the Bloom not knowing what to do. Obviously, if they brought it to the guard's attention, it would be secured, and neither would ever get hold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking so innocent as Tom backed away still apologizing, you just started to dance with him again and ignored the groom and maid of honor who were being dragged off to help corral Alexandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Phase 1 complete, you looked to decide where you should slip the Scarlet Bloom next and whose skin you could use while playing musical Bloom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It takes you almost two seconds to hatch a plan. If you're all going to play musical blooms, you might as well lead everyone on a merry dance. Only an idiot would stay, but you're staying. And only an idiot would give up the Bloom once they had it. So that's exactly what you're going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to dance, trying to make Missy's chubby face look as innocent as possible, with a slight smile and a deliberate ruffling of your auburn locks. You clutch Tom closely, pulling on his sleeves to bring him closer. He's still apologetic, casting nervous looks back as the main players at the wedding recompose themselves. Alexandra seems almost gone, and the singer - a Caribbean beauty - is holding her notes gracefully as she tries to gather some composure to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I did that,\" Tom mutters to you, oblivious to the fact the Bloom is now around your neck. Perhaps you're against him so tight he can't see it, although you're sure others can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" you say, full of Missy's general hopefulness before you drop into a whisper. \"It's not like I know her very well.\" You lean up and his him again, reassuring his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been a strange wedding.\" Tom says. \"Still, nice place, huh?\" You smile mousily again, then glance a familiar figure leaving the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very. Will you be OK sitting the next dance out? I need to pop to the restroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh... sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip away, through the crowd of the marquee, your eyes focused on the portly, uniformed figure of the Indian lady ahead of you. Nancy, heading back to the main hotel. She'll be perfect. In a few footsteps you catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" you say, your pudgy features beaming from under your auburn locks. \"Could you direct me to your restrooms? With all this commotion, I need to take a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy, as ever the professional, gives you a pencil-thin smile, and arches her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't see Missy's friendly smile turn into a sinister grin as she leads you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... that's the second time today that's happened.\" Nancy mutters, straightening her uniform, pausing at the mirror to make sure she looks unruffled, with a smile on her face. Her glasses aren't on straight, but in a moment they're fixed in the mirror. She gives a nod, and begins to turn to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never makes it. In a moment the door opens and one of the Parry cousins - Rebecca, you think (although as they're twins its hard to tell) - steps in. She gives one look to the surroundings, and begins to clutch a small black item in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Nancy says, pushing through, partly out into the corridor. Footsteps echo down it, meaning at least someone else is heading in this direction. Rebecca's hand returns to her purse, her eyes still studying the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy Chamberland is trying to climb up a stall, stuck awkwardly in the cubicle, her face a mask of pure, dazed confusion at how she got there. Her hands reach up to the sides, struggling for purchase as she tries to climb up out of her salmon dress, clearly loose and unzipped at the back. Rebecca turns and twists, looking down at Nancy as the older woman steps out into the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiles, staring at the trail of golden chain hanging from Nancy's coat pocket. The same golden chain that houses the Scarlet Bloom. She waits until Nancy leaves, then watches her begin to walk slowly down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what...what happened?\" Missy stumbles and slurs. Rebecca turns to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were drinking too much and you slipped. I helped you in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I was? I mean, I don't remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you don't remember,\" Rebecca snaps too sweetly. \"You've been drinking too much. Now tidy yourself up and get back to the party, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rebecca spins on the spot, ignoring the uncertain Missy, before slipping out of the door, and after Nancy. No doubt waiting for the perfect moment to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy looks confused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you smile maniacally, and burst out laughing using the portly girl's face. You step to the mirror, and flick back her auburn hair, sighing with satisfaction. You slipped a fake on to Nancy. The poor woman never saw it coming, and now, completely unaware about the game being played, she's leading your pursuers around the hotel. You laugh again, this time with a deeper voice than Missy usually manages. That was almost too easy. Now everyone's looking for the wrong person, and will be playing the wrong game of switcheroo all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps down the corridor, and pause again. It's not Rebecca's, or Nancy's, footfall pattern. You look in the mirror and chew Missy's lip. You could stay as her. Nobody would suspect that you'd do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everyone saw you stumble in to Alexandra; there's a clear chain of events linking you to Missy Chamberland, and it might mean someone else tries to become her temporarily. And you're already halfway out of your salmon-pink dress...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've got the pen at the ready as the footsteps become louder as whoever they belong to draws closer and closer to the bathtroom. You'd really like to stay as Missy, it'd make things so much more easier, but too many people saw Missy fall into Alexandra. Even with the fake on Nancy, if these people are really after the Bloom then it won't be hard at all for them to recognize a fake otherwise they'd be lousy thieves and nothing about the way they've thrown a wrench into your plan would describe them as lousy. So you stand there, in front of the stall, clutching the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps come closer, and closer, and you see... an outstretched hand holding a pen. You freeze up and the person the hand belongs to enters the bathroom and turns. The two of you stand there, pens drawn and pointed at one another, as you eye one another and you're surprised by what you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Asian girl, small and thin, dressed in a fancy black sleeveless dress, her dark hair held back with a contrasting white headband and bow and holding an expensive-looking purse. She's Madison Cheung, the 13-year-old daughter of Randall and Linda Cheung. Both work for the Van Lewens, Randall as an executive for their financial company and Linda as part of their legal team. The Cheungs, of course, have relationships with the Parrys and Vincents as well so it only makes sense that they'd be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\" Madison grumbles as her eyes narrow, \"We figured you would've been out of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiding in plain sight.\" you reply with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you switch the pen to white mode and hit it before Madison can do anything which causes her to freeze. You then hit it once more and the suit open. You move behind her and open it wider, pulling out whoever's inside. It turns out to be a man, remarkably average except for the fact he's a bit obese and, you think, a little older, probably in his 40s. The man has been blanked but that leaves you with more questions: why? Is there another similar organization out there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell those are questions that'll have to wait. They know you're Missy so it's time to switch disguises. You're a bit disappointed. Missy was chubby but chubby in a nice way, as opposed to Lucy Binder, with curves in the right places. You heft her large breasts, run hands over her wide hips: from curvy Missy to un-developed Madison. Quickly you hit yourself to open up the suit and strip out of it, then grab the Madison suit and step in. Once you're suited up you straighten the dress and the bow before catching sight of yourself in one of the bathroom mirrors: Madison's cute and is going to grow up to be a beauty, much like her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the Bloom off of Missy's skin and place it in the purse then reinflate her. You don't even check to give her an excuse, if they're onto you then you can't stay there long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back out to the party. The kids are mostly supposed to be separate but Madison was deemed mature enough to handle it which doesn't surprise you. Using the blue function you've learned that she's something of a child prodigy, very smart but also a bit serious and acts older and more mature than her age. You need to escape but after the close encounter and the blanked person in the Madison suit you're curious. Now you want to know just what's going on and that means getting to Holden. And to get to Holden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to see Alexandra laughing in a way that clearly indicates drunkenness. Madison's talked to her plenty. She intends to be a high-powered attorney like her mother and the Vincents, themselves producing many successful lawyers, have started grooming her for that role to work as <i>their</i> attorney once she's graduated college. You would need a way to get her all alone but... that doesn't seem possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madison!\" Alexandra calls out excitedly as she spots you. She then waves you over, \"Madison, c'mere!\" Not seeing a way out you acquiesce and head over to where she's seated with a few other people. \"Oh Madison, I haven't seen you in a few weeks! You look so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra, from what Madison's memories tell you, treats the girl much like a younger sister. \"And you look...\" you fumble for the right words; Madison is a girl who feels like she has no time for things like this, \"You look like you're having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am! I definitely am!\" she exclaims before turning to her guests, \"Sorry guys but I wanna catch up with Madison here so if you don't mind, me and her are gonna go for a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat takes you by surprise though a pleasant one. She's just made your job a whole lot easier. So she gets up and starts walking and you follow. She takes you to a tent, small and out of the way and drawn closed. She then stops and turns to you. \"You've been doing so good, too bad that you ran into a dead end though.\" Alexandra smiles, the slur in her voice gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat takes you by surprise. She's one of them. She must be blanked too: the blanking process makes an agent immune to the effects of alcohol, after all a drunk agent is a useless agent. Acting classes and such allow one to imitate the effects of drunkenness perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys finally got me.\" you reply flatly. \"Good for you. So what, are you going to eliminate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" replies Alexandra, \"Everything will be answered inside.\" With that she opens the tent and leads you inside where you see a few of your previous disguises: Maya Patel, Suzy Goldman, Missy Cumberland. There's also Clarissa van Lewen, even though she wasn't a previous disguise. There's a few more men as well that you don't recognize beyond the fact they're security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is definitely something.\" you say as you eye the situation, \"Where's Holden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" Alexandra says, \"We knew you'd come for her. Since I was Holden I had the easiest time of switching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you the leader of all of this?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra shakes her head. \"Me? Oh no, I'm just the right-hand for this operation. The leader's over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a desk right in front of you with a large chair with its back turned to you. Said chair then turns to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheryl Newsome?!\" you exclaim in surprise as you look at her, curly hair, slightly gawky. She flashes you a smile revealing her braces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised, yeah?\" she replies as she folds her hand, \"I've been in this girl since before the wedding. She was our key in here, I was our key in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask, \"Are you going to kill me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill you? Oh no no no, not at all.\" replies Cheryl, \"What's going on is that all of us have, at one time or another, worked for the Organization and we thought we were getting a bum deal. That asshole scientist Gunther, the vague and constantly changing goals, the constant nonstop work. I got put in here months ago, I was a Type 3, but I was in constant contact with other agents. Others who were disgruntled and felt they were being played.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you convinced them to defect?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheryl nods, \"Yeah. It wasn't hard. We've got these pens, we can be anyone. Why work for the Organization when we can work for ourselves? We've been waching you for a long time, David. We heard whispers of a new recruit and put someone in place before they could: your friend Trish, I think. We've been watching you since you arrived. You went mostly where we wanted. And when you used that pen on... well Missy, now, we knew it was something new.\" Cheryl stands up and smiles once more, \"We'd like to offer you a place with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eye her, \"So what do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever we want.\" she replies, \"We live a free life until called on; this is a Brotherhood and we look out for one another. Some times we get ourselves in nice lives, some times we sell our services. Mostly we like to fuck with the Organization; we thought getting the Bloom would be a great way to do that as well as net us a nice chunk of change. Then we saw that they were sending you to get it as well, their newest recruit right into our hands. So what do you say David, or Madison, or whatever you want to be called? Will you join us?\"</span></div></div>",

Don't you dare think about what happens if your train snags on the pathway.\" You rise, stepping toward the bathroom as the Bloom is brought in. Carma's eyes immediately flick toward it, desire to wear the gemstone pulsating through her body and driving her to distraction. A sense of excitement shudders through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap to your senses, and walk purposefully into the bathroom. Inside, Lucille DeWitt is powdering her nose. You give her a Carma smile as you join her at the sinks. \"Don't worry, your nose looks fine,\" you say with mock sincerity. DeWitt, at least, doesn't buy it. She gives you a look that could shatter glass. You smile, and study Carma's face in the mirror. Your mind rushes back to your training as you gaze intently around her pupils, looking for the telltale sign. A seal-suit is never completely possible. Nobody can ever become trapped inside a suit<i> forever</i>. It is, however, possible to encode a suit. Slowly, the mind of the suit will override the user. The user will simply forget they are wearing a suit. Gunther stated this is done with a green button. When you said you'd never seen one of those, his answer was simple. <i>Pray you never will. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, with the delicate poise required with Carma's nails, you reach up to your eyelid and turn it inside out. Lucille looks at you with disgust, but goes back to her own preparation. You search for the sign you were warned about in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why am I bothering with this? I already know I look perfect. Just ruin the bitch's wedding and get back to Holden.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're alarmed as Carma's thoughts penetrate your mind again. And you're even more alarmed when you notice the green ooze, beginning to pool in the corner of your eye. You reach up quickly and dab it. It's a thick, viscous slime, bright green. So far Lucille hasn't noticed, but it's only a matter of time. You spin, and rush to the restroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,\" Lucille says. \"A little nervous? I thought you were so composed, Carma.\" You hear her heels click out of the restroom. At once you grab for your pen, selecting the white setting, and begin to slice open the suit. Carma's head splits open down the side like a cocoon, as you force Kurt's face free from the mask. It's covered in green slime. Everywhere, your face, your upper body. You should have spotted the faint green ring around Carma's seal. This was a rookie mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself free, grab some tissue and begin wiping the slime off, throwing tissue after tissue into the toilet. Carma's body is useless as a disguise now. The opening left by the white pen has already started to seal up, and within moments she's a normal skin again, deflated in her dress, hair still perfect and poised. But you know that if you don it again, you're going to find yourself slowly turning into the murderous bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, and catch your breath. The wedding is minutes away, and you're now trapped with a deflated maid of honor, unsure what has happened. Was this a test as part of the Organization's initiation? Did they expect you to spot it? Or were they trying to get rid of you? A cold shiver runs down your spine. Maybe you've flunked, dropped out. Perhaps the way the Organization deals with failure is to trick its agents into donning a modified suit, trapping them forever as someone else. Perhaps plans are already afoot to spoil Carma's scheme, sending you to jail in another person's life and identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you need to think. Carma isn't an option, and you need to restore her. There's a ceiling grate ahead, and you imagine you could probably squeeze through it, zap Carma, and abandon the wedding altogether, chalking this up as a lucky escape. Once you're out of the air vents, you should be able to find a new skin - a guest or a member of staff. Then you can work out why someone had been 'prepared' with the green pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you can assume it's a test and find someone else to become. The door outside has opened and closed, and you can hear footsteps outside your stall. They sound alone. If you're going to continue with the plan, you've now got your only potential disguise standing outside...</span></div></div>",

She'd come to find her best friend. <i>Well, ain't got no other choice, as they say,</i> you think and grab up the suit leaving it in the gown. With the low back, you find it easy to step in without stripping her, that is after you check the seam at the opening - clean. Quickly, you seal the Carma skin then go the mirror while she re-inflates and make sure you're straight letting Alexandra's memories fill your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now what do I do?</i> you think feeling Alexandra's nerves twisting your insides. The manic sensations can only mean that a double dose was not enough. Thoughts of invisible demons everywhere are what comes to mind. Carma has done a great job on her. She's already thinking about the reception and having champagne to calm her. No. It's to numb her. She is scared to death ... You correct yourself at the unintentional pun. She is terrified of Holden and having sex with him. She doesn't want this marriage any more than Carma. In fact, ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarma's movement interrupts your check of your new memories. \"Carms, you OK, bunny?\" you call softly tapping on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? wha?\" mumbles from Carma followed a couple seconds later by an irritated, \"Just a ...\" Another pause and then the sickly sweet fake tone comes, \"Just a second, dear.\" Carma then appears smiling happily insincere at you. Unlike Alexandra, you can easily recognize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're missing the Bloom,\" you say concerned which lights up her eyes. She takes your arm and strides forward. You have to pitter-patter rapidly in delicate dinky steps to keep up in the bridal gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How can I steal it from myself now? And how crazy are all these people? I've seen soap operas that have less tangled relationships,</i> you ponder when Carma lets go and glares down at the bridesmaid currently sporting the Scarlet Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the best well-toned woman maybe just an inch shorter than Carma in her heels approaches. The new memories confirm she's one of the guards. There's two other women sporting business suits concealing heavy firepower your own training tells you. You wonder how many more will be at the wedding and reception, some that probably will blend in better than these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to think on working this out as you watch the Bloom be placed around Carma's neck. <i>God, is she ever spectacular wearing it.</i> It goes so well on her that you almost think it should stay. Even Alexandra's fond memories of her so-called friend trigger a smile to your face. Alexandra does care for Carma even more than a sister and would do anything for her to be ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy crap!</i> You, er Alexandra is in love with Carma! It's been ever since sophomore college when Carma and Alexandra loosened up under the alcohol and spent the night in the same bed. Alexandra had learned a lot and became more or less Carma's bitch from what you can tell. However, Alexandra saw it as love, though she never mentioned to Carma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn attendant arrives informing everyone that the ceremony is about to start. It'll be about five or six minutes before procession. Carma is still entranced by the beautiful stone at the tip of the elaborate chain round her neck pointing to those gorgeous mounds, the ones that Alexandra would like to marry and fondle today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bridesmaids begin to line up to be escorted into place while the guard taps Carma bringing her mind back to reality. You can imagine the thoughts she was having now that you were just recently inside her skin and mind, but you're glad to be out and safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that an Alexandra memory pops up. It's one of her promising not to let this go through, at least not without telling Carma ... telling Carma that she's in love with her and wants to marry her instead of Holden. You know that Alexandra is too crazy to ever actually do it, but maybe this is your chance to try to avert disaster or minimally save the bride from a tragic wedding. Perhaps it would work out and Carma could marry the girl and share the Bloom. It is a gay-friendly state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarma's eyes are still focused on the Bloom hanging awkwardly on you. No matter how it sets, it looks and feels like it doesn't belong. Alexandra's thoughts use memories of Carma's words to ignore it, and so do you. Now you have to plan how to get the Bloom and escape safely. There's time after the ceremony and before the reception where you might be able to slip free and snag another skin, plus halfway through reception is when the bride changes to less constricting and formal attire to party until she's carried across the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and the bridesmaids file out. The guards have left also, so it's just you and Carma, you staring at her and her at the Bloom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alexandra's perfect cupid's bow lips turn it into a nervous exhalation, and you flick her long hair back, shifting in your dress. Despite the immaculate - and thin - Carma standing beside you, radiant as ever and perfectly presented, Alexandra really is stunning for a large girl. You don't doubt that you could take someone's breath away if you chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's funny, honey?\" Carma says, her fake smile radiating malice. \"It's not the prescription taking too much of a hold, is it? You're sure you'll be able to walk up the path in those heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are having to take small steps to get by, it's true. But that wasn't the reason for your laugh. You glance down, watching your ample breasts heave and the bloom sparkle, catching the light. The chain is cool against your skin, which makes up for the warmth radiating from Alexandra when she thinks of Carma. And the stone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone is fake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's why you couldn't help but giggle. The whole plot from the Organization, and the whole set-up of Carma's, it's all absolutely pointless. The Vincent family is struggling financially. They think the Parrys are their way to a fortune, just as Holden believes Alexandra will bring him untold riches. Carma is planning to scheme, steal and murder for a fake stone. The real one is sat in a bank vault a little more than five miles away: the Van Lewens bought the real gem, and are holding it for the Vincents until they can regain their fortune from the Parrys... you laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Van Lewens have the Bloom. The Vincents are scheming to regain it after a financial injection from the Parrys. The Parrys, meanwhile, are trying to get rich from the Vincents. And while Alexandra Vincent has the fake Bloom around her neck, her best friend Carma and her future husband, both secret lovers, are plotting to steal the necklace and install Carma as the wealthy bride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nest of vipers. A soap opera dilemma. It's all become so clear. This is the test the Organization set. The whole point of today isn't the Bloom at all. It's to see if you could survive in such a twisting, labyrinthine world where everyone has a scheme. Carma, you realize, was zapped earlier as either a trap, or to prevent you from gaining her knowledge. That way you'd have been surprised by the plot and would have to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no point in continuing the wedding. The whole mission is just a setup. You might as well slip away and abort... or slip away and get into that bank vault. That would be easier said than done, of course. The only people with access are the Van Lewens - of course, they're at the wedding, but they're not going to be able to quietly slip away. Or you'll have to find a way into the vault through one of the employees; maybe even one of the guards in their sharp suits. And that's assuming you can even get out of the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to what you were taught in your training. The actions you take don't necessarily have to be in character. They just have to be <i>rationalized and explained</i> by your disguise. The worst thing that can happen to you is exposure. And if you need the leverage, you can twist a situation to your advantage if you must. And, while it wouldn't be stolen at the reception, there's a way you could take the Bloom, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, and turn to Carma, Alexandra's look of barely-restrained adoration in your eyes. You give her palm a squeeze, and think back to the moment Alexandra had burst into her room earlier. She was going to tell Carma how she felt then, too. You turn and, leaning up to her despite your heels, push your perfect lips against hers. Carma's eyes widen, and for once she looks uncertain. The evil bitch doesn't know how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush,\" you say, putting Alexandra on the offensive as you bat your eyelids. \"Carm, I have to tell you this. Before it's too late, I have to tell you.\" Tears are already beginning to well up in your eyes as you let Alexandra's emotions take over. Her breath judders out. \"You remember the night, don't you? The night we got a little tipsy, and entwined ourselves? It was so perfect, Carm. It was what I've dreamed about since then. I don't want to marry Holden. I don't care about the Parrys - that's my family. I want you. I always have. Please, Carm... please say yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarma's unable to keep up her pretense. She just looks staggered by the revelation. This, you know, is your chance. You provide Alexandra's face with a look of utter horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't... do you? You don't think of me that way? You don't feel it too? No... no, you don't, do you? You don't want me!\" Alexandra's tears begin to run. Carma still stands there, trying to compose herself, only looking shocked, stunned and unsure. You grip the Bloom in one hand, grasping the clasp in the other, dramatically bringing it off and shaking it at the stunned maid of honor. \"All this! All this is meaningless, Carma! There's only me and you! I can't go through with this! I just can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out of the private room, a hysterical bride, fleeing her own wedding. Nobody will question if you've \"dropped\" the Bloom in your mad flight. And the whole hotel will be abuzz with news of what happened. All focus will be on Alexandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you find a new skin to hide in, or even slip back to Kurt's, everyone's attention will be on the wedding, and not on you slipping away. You've explained everything that has happened, too: nobody will think something even stranger has taken place. Perhaps even more importantly, you'll have saved Alexandra's life. Her family may face ruin, and it's likely her love for Carma will go painfully unrequited, but she'll be alive. And nobody's going to question a hysterical bride fainting before she walked up the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash out of the room, and face a three-way corridor ahead of you. Left is out: that leads to the wedding, and while you could cause surprise as the bride bursting out into the garden, you'd be unlikely to have an opportunity to escape. Forward leads back to the spa from earlier: you could definitely find a place to swap there, perhaps into that beautician who was working in a side room. And then there's right, back into the hotel proper. You're pleased you took the time to scout out the location. There's plenty of options to find a hotel guest, or work your way into the gardens, perhaps to swap to one of the Van Lewens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your choice and, struggling in your heels and wedding gown, flee, Bloom in hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your epiphany has freed you of all worry and stress. The carefree child in you skips happily down the hall towards the spa where there are more rooms to hide and switch, though fewer people. It is an exhilarating feeling even as Alexandra's neurotic memories fill you with a sense of doom, ... no death, or really suicide. She has contemplated this many times before; yet with the help of drugs and therapy, she has lingered in a fantasy and avoided taking the final step out of this world. You hope that continues after you abandon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This thing is so fucked up,</i> you think. So fucked up even that you're tempted to get back to the wedding and zap as many as possible to get a complete inventory of this craziness, but you don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first door is an exit stairway from the floors above. Coming up is the entrance to the spa. There's a reception area inside that is sure to be staffed, and you aren't currently inconspicuous enough to just slip in. However, there's at most one person that a lucky shot could skin before they realized you were there. Emphasis is on lucky. Maybe you should take the stairs even in the bulky gown. Hopefully, there's a room or someone you can find up there before someone else finds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to eenie-meenie-minie-moe, the stairwell door opens and someone steps out in front of you not looking back. Before you think, you pen the person, and they shrivel to the floor. Must be your training as you grab the skin and clothes and are in the stairwell a second after you realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time to even see who your new costume is, only to check the opening (you're not going to be caught again) - it's clean, so you just pop out the back of Alexandra and climb in to your new disguise. There's probably just a minute before someone comes down the hall so you get dressed and flee back upstairs once Alexandra is sealed back and starts to inflate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the memories flood in, they lead you onto the third floor with fake Bloom in your pocket. Your room is 302, but it won't take long before the resort is on lockdown. No time to go in your room since escape will be tricky if not impossible if you're not gone in the next five minutes. Fortunately, your new person has a car in the lot. All you have to do is get there. Elevator too slow. Can't go back down these stairs. Out the window looks like the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert Foxworth, retired salesman invited to speak at the annual Casket Hardware conference that starts tomorrow morning. He was just taking a stroll around the resort and wanted to check out the facilities, not that he would use them although he really needs to.  He's sixty years old, pudgy, balding with a scattering of white hairs and a beard that make him look more intelligent than he is. Not athletic, but hopefully that won't be necessary. You just need to get to the bank and find a way to switch this fake for the real Scarlet Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly scanning through the window at the end of the hall as you raise it, you see the roof of the second floor meeting rooms and an access door at the far end. The wedding is taking place at the other end of the resort, but this is where the reception will be held. The drop is just a few feet and about fifty meters to the door. Piece of cake, except when you reach the door. It's locked. Nothing in his pockets except a bit of change from the soda machine and handkerchief. Then his memories remind you to check his wallet where he keeps his bank cards and an old paper clip. You eyes pop happily remembering the lock-pick class. A minute later you're down the stairs and out the side door at the edge of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe logical thing is to head straight to the bank where the Bloom is - and \"Bob\" happens to have an account - and get into the safety deposit box room and retrieve the Bloom. Of course, you don't know what box it's in, but nabbing a bank employee should allow you access to records to find out. Then again, everything that has seemed logical so far has been a complete contradiction. Perhaps going back and grabbing one of the Van Lewens might be in order. It's a bit trickier especially having the fake Bloom, but the wedding disruption should allow you an excuse to duck out to the bank. Maybe stash the trinket in Bob's car. You only wonder what bizarre trait one of them will have. Bob seems quite normal, at least so far. You can't believe that the Organization setup everyone, but then again ...?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bob is quite normal, you muse, scratching at his beard. Overweight, ageing, with high cholesterol and diabetes, but there's nothing weird about him. That comes as a relief. All you want to do is escape a wedding falling into chaos, where everyone seems to have a dirty secret or insane intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is the bank itself. As Bob, you could get into the vault - perhaps. But banks have cameras. If you try and swap with any employee, you're going to be caught on footage. There's a lot of risk involved. You'd have to somehow convince an employee to step away from the cameras. It might be possible in the safety deposit room, but then you'd have to return to the computer to find out which number is owned by the Van Lewens. The only person that would know that information immediately would be the manager, and, as it's a weekend, you can't imagine they'd be at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to Bob's car, and pull out his credit card. It's an old model, and while 'he' has left his car keys in this room, your lock-picking skills again make themselves useful. You slide into the driver's seat, grunting from Bob's weight, and look at yourself in the rear view mirror. Beads of sweat have formed on your balding scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting slow, old man,\" you remark to your own reflection, before pulling open the compartment under the wheel. In a moment you've hotwired the car, and are fleeing the chaos behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, can I help you?\" The bank's greeter, a smartly dressed young man, looks at you expectantly. You smile, and let your distinguished voice set his mind at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today, thank you. I'm just weighing up a financial transaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I can be of any assistance, let me know.\" The young man walks away. The bank is cool, calm and virtually empty. A couple of tellers are helping customers: a businessman is talking finance, an expectant mother is patiently counting out receipts, an Asian man approaching middle age is arguing about a cheque that seems to have bounced. In the corner, the customer assistant for the vault is sat at the desk, waiting to see if anyone requires service. The bank's cameras record all, and security guards are posted throughout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to a stack of leaflets, picking one up along with an impossibly small pen, and take a seat, pretending to fill it out. You look around while you do so, assessing your options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe direct route is to access Bob's account at the bank, and request a safety deposit box. That would get you into the right room, and then you'd have to see if you could swap into an employee without raising suspicion. Bank security is tight, though, and there might be a better alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the wall opposite your seat is a picture of a smiling, well-turned out woman, probably in her late 30s or early 40s. She's wearing heavy makeup, deliberately designed to give her a professional, confident look. She's in a sharp suit, with black hair cut into a voluminous long bob. The plaque underneath reads: <i>K. Wendel, manager</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brings a thought to your mind. The moment Alexandra recovers, the wedding is going to be plunged into chaos. The first thing people are going to try and do is locate the Scarlet Bloom. It's a fake, but that doesn't seem to be common knowledge - Alexandra hadn't even told Carma - and there were security guards looking after it. The security company is going to inform the bank, who will be forced to check on the real Bloom. That means an emergency procedure is going to begin, and the manager, wherever she is, is going to be called in, along with the local sheriff, to check the Bloom is safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could be far simpler, you decide. You walk over to the young greeter, and politely ask to borrow a phone directory. He looks at you for a moment, but then complies: Robert Foxworth is too old for the internet, and something as old school as a phone directory is exactly the kind of thing he might ask for. A few moments of flicking through, and you find what you're looking for. There's only one 'Wendel' listed in the directory, and the address is provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll have to move quickly: you're only a couple of minutes from the Bloom being reported stolen, the security guards determining its missing, and the emergency protocol springing in to action. Either you can go ahead with your original plan to use Robert to get into the vault, or you can take the slightly longer, but possibly safer, route: either head to the police station and replace the local sheriff, or head to the manager's house and try your luck there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being Bob is just so comfortable. His whole body is so relaxed even if out of shape. He really doesn't have a care. Talking at the conference is something he's done his whole career. In fact, that's the best thing going for using him - he can easily talk to anyone with great ability of persuasion. Just what you need to get info and find the box with the Scarlet Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe probability of swapping with the bank manager or the Sheriff is rather low considering what you'd have to do. Assuming Ms. Wendel is even at home, getting her alone to zap might be difficult. You might even have to expose Bob which would be a downgrade on your test having anyone you assumed be recognized. And what of the Sheriff? Is he out roaming in his cruiser or sitting behind his desk with other officers around. He could be out fishing in a number of secluded spots or watching a ball game with a bunch of other beer-belly ex-high school jock has-beens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, there's no guarantee that the security company will know to check the bank. The Van Lewens may not want to alert the authorities and have it widely known that they didn't trust the Vincents and their daughter to let her wear the real Scarlet Bloom and provided a fake. More than likely, they would just quietly check the safe deposit box not involving either the manager or Sheriff. Then you would totally have blown it and get a failing grade, possibly busted down to a Type 3 which would be worse then stuck in a green-slime suit and lose your personal identity forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. Staying Bob is really the best chance at success; and if you play it right, you might not even have to switch to make the switch. The last thing you want is to step into another of the organization's screwy setups that would continue or start a new soap opera of personalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man,\" you again address the greeter. \"I will be in need of setting up a safety deposit box. Could you direct me on what I need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, sir,\" he replies with a smile and standing. \"Please follow me. The person who handles this is Miss Charlotte. She will help you with the forms and walk you through opening the box and how the keys work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach a desk just outside the vault area where sits a young woman, twenty-five at most, who is immaculately attired in a blue blazer over a white blouse that is stretched to its maximum across her chest, You would think if she breathed that the button would snap. She has a mousy face accented with a button nose supporting large round glasses that magnify her hazel eyes which are expertly lined and shadowed. Her auburn hair is pulled to the back in a barrette rather than a pony tail so it hangs evenly spread across her neck reaching just inches below he shoulders. Bangs come down in front exposing just a half inch of forehead above her neatly plucked eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Charlotte, this is Mr. ... I'm sorry. I didn't ask your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxworth. Bob Foxworth. Well, really Robert but everyone calls me Bob, so please do, and ...\" Noticing her name tag on the blazer, Abigail B. Charlotte, you add, \"May I call you Abby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slightly blushes and smiles demurely as Bob's charm starts to work. \"You can, but everyone calls be Abs,\" she offers standing to shake your hand. As you do, a quick glance reveals that she definitely has trim abs when her blouse billows open at her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank the young man before sitting and then repeat your request to Abs. It's only about five minutes of paperwork and your flattering repartee before she has you wait while she enters it all in a computer. You banter about the double work of it since you could have entered the info directly. She agrees but states the bank likes to use their old process. She reads the paper form moving her glasses back and forth like a telescope as she types things in, stopping several times asking you for clarification. When she turns the screen for you to confirm, there's a couple errors you point out making her blush again. The color in her face makes her quite attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done, she spins the monitor for you to confirm and pushes over the keyboard for you to type in your passcode and check the acceptance boxes of the long description of terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May take me a bit to read this. Hope you don't mind. Just an old habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mr. Fox ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Bob,\" you correct with your best sales smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Bob. While you do that, let me get the keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand as she does being very old-school polite, and she blushes again. You can tell you've made a solid contact  and should be able to sell her on helping you when needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you sit, you notice that there is another tab open behind the Terms of Agreement which just happens to be a list of deposit boxes showing which are available. Obviously, she checked that to know what one she could get for you. Little did she realize that it also shows the Van Lewens boxes. They have two, unfortunately, both of the right size to hold the Bloom. Your name is on the next sequential box to theirs that is listed as just having gotten in the past two months. The other is years old. Hopefully, that means it was recently acquired just for the Scarlet Bloom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour training allowed you to flick the screen quick enough that no one could tell. You were also fortunate, that cameras were not focused on your back and could not see the screen, probably for customer privacy when entering their bank passcode. Bob seemed to be good luck, and you were now fully committed to staying with him as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing now would be how to cover your opening of the  the Van Lewens box. You know it takes two keys to release it - yours and the bank's that Abs carries that works in all the boxes. Each customer's key is unique. Of course, your lock picking is unlikely to require either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leads you in, you're the only two in the vault having passed through the big gate using Abs and the vault guard's electronic security cards. As you go in, you chat to Abs about why the boxes don't use cards in this technology age. Again a blush and roll of her eyes as she explains the old mentality of the bank's management. \"So old and cheap,\" she whispers in confidence, \"that they don't even have camera's in the vault, only coming and going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob's sales pitch is working well on your behalf as she continues to divulge information. Now all you need to do is get the Van Lewens box and switch the fake Bloom in your pocket with the real one and leave that in Bob's new box.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take much to persuade Abs to give you some time alone, after having removed your deposit box from the wall with your keys: a quick request and she's out the door, pointing to a buzzer to contact her when you're ready to leave. The second she's walked out the door you cross the room, pull out Bob's cards, and get to work on the next box over. It takes a little work, but you manage to pick the locks and open the box. And there, gleaming in the hard metal, is your prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scarlet Bloom. The real, genuine gem. It sparkles even more than its fake versions, the deep red tint inside catching the vault's harsh lighting perfectly. quickly, you take the fake Bloom and slip it inside. Then all you need to do is gather up the Bloom, place it in your pocket, and close up Bob's box. A quick buzz later and Abs is ready to lead you out of the vault again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but grin wildly as Robert Foxworth walks out of the bank, or when you hit the rendezvous and leave him in the safety of his own car, your handler providing you with a new set of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you can't help but ask, \"How did I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a test,\" your handler reports back. \"So we through you a curveball. In fact, we through you a lot of curveballs. The test wasn't so much about this trinket\" - the Bloom is held out on its chain - \" as whether you could navigate a particularly difficult social situation. The Vincent-Parry wedding was always going to be full of strong, deeply unpleasant characters. And yet you managed to get through it without being noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wedding was called off, though,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that doesn't matter. Alexandra Vincent did that; after she came to, she continued to try and run, hysterically calling for Carma Hamilton. Who, as you failed to note, was a little trap we set. Carma was caught by a pen yesterday, and we deliberately set her up as a potential greener.\" This seems to be slang for a trap suit. \"You didn't see that. But, when her thoughts started to come through, you didn't panic. You stayed calm and dealt with the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I didn't fail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish. You realized the Bloom wasn't being kept at the wedding, so you went to get it. That showed initiative. And your decisions to switch made it very hard for us to track you - and near-impossible for anyone else. It left a spate of 'fainting' attacks in the hotel. You could have used the white pen function to explain their missing 10 minutes: it would have been neater. However, the hotel is now testing its rooms for carbon monoxide, and it hasn't raised an eyebrow. So it's hard to fault you on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your switches were in character and trying to lead you to a goal. You switched far more than most agents would even attempt: six different skins. And you pulled it off. Nobody is questioning what happened at the hotel. In short, we're very impressed. Very impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I passed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did. The only thing damaging your grade is that you didn't spot Carma Hamilton was a greener. But, when you realized the situation you were in, you adjusted beautifully. Taking the bride was a good touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was the only option available,\" you report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless. It gave you the information you needed. Which is why we're offering you a choice. You can continue as a Type 2. Get some rest and relaxation, but we've got a range of field missions that require someone with your abilities. A little corporate espionage at a high-tech lab, framing a playboy in Las Vegas, manipulating an entire small town council to grant land rights to a particular company. But we're also going to offer you a bigger role. If you are interested, you will be upgraded to a Type 1. You'd still be required to keep your identity fluid, as you would a Type 2. But the missions will be more final: assassinate a corrupt businessman disguised as a particular person, or making it appear an accident; clean up someone else's mess by erasing evidence of the Organization. Arrange a bank account to siphon us money to us from inside a multinational. Alter the path of a satellite from a military base. It won't be a quick mission, either. You might have to stay in situ for a week, impersonating someone or switching identities as required, constantly studying a developing situation.

Your first mission is going to require a lot of swapping. Which is just how you like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief is simple. Three days ago the town was taken over, though they'd never realize it. Through another agent's incompetence, a black and brown pen fell into the hands of a gang of criminals called the Coburn Gang: Trent and Josh Coburn, and their accomplice Irene Copper. They've since used the pens for a spree of bank robberies, and the trail leads directly to Cameron's Peak, where it stops.

They don't realize it, but they've painted themselves into a corner. Organization agents are currently acting as the local highway patrol, stopping anyone coming in and out of the town for a quick test with the white pen to make sure they are who they claim to be. They've got to be in the town, somewhere. Probably in someone with power - the mayor, or local sheriff, or one of the wealthy families that have holiday homes here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your job to track them down and catch them, all without raising suspicion or attracting their attention. The Organization suspects they've probably split up, taking different lives, each unaware who the other actually is. You're also on strict instructions not to just shoot everyone and see what turns up. You're to investigate their possible lives by getting close to them, observing them and identifying them. They don't have any of their host's memories, so it should be fairly straightforward to spot people acting out of character. Once you spot one, you're to get them out of the skin with the white pen, zap them and contain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour intel is sketchy, but there are a few key members of town whose identity they could have adopted. The only question is where to start. It's a Saturday, so the Mayor will be at home with his family - if he's really the mayor. The Sheriff is likely to be on duty at the station, although the only cop you can see is a deputy, a black woman with hair beaded and tied up in a knot behind her head, snoozing in her cruiser on the main road. As for the richer families, you'll have to find a way into their mansion. Maybe someone is down in the main town, looking for entertainment or having gone shopping? There's a local cinema, tavern, pizzeria and a small arcade of shops. You're sure there's someone there you can become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown at the task ahead. It's going to be tough, but the first step is to find someone close to one of the possible candidates.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take much to persuade Abs to give you some time alone, after having removed your deposit box from the wall with your keys: a quick request and she's out the door, pointing to a buzzer to contact her when you're ready to leave. The second she's walked out the door you cross the room, pull out Bob's cards, and get to work on the next box over. It takes a little work, but you manage to pick the locks and open the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing there. Just an empty box, devoid of any contents. The bare metal stares back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not in the other one, either.\" Ab's voice resounds behind you. You never heard her enter the vault again. You spin around in surprise, reaching for your pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don''t,\" she says, leveling her own pen at you. \"You'll never make it before I zap you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let a look of puzzlement cross Bob's face. \"What do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbs shakes her head. \"Drop the act. You're a trainee, same as me. You've been tasked to get the Bloom. You worked out it wasn't at the wedding at all, so headed straight here. Only problem is, it's not here either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind races, but suddenly everything is starting to make more sense. The whole crazy wedding has been ludicrous, a delirious whirlwind of insanity. It's a giant set-up. The soap opera lives of the Holdens and Parrys and Hamiltons are real enough, but it's been a playground - a proving ground - for trainees. Whoever passes the test  gets to stay. You wonder how many other trainees...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's at least four of us,\" Abs continues. \"I made two of them. Didn't make you, I think; not until you came here and started breaking in to the vault. I caught you taking a look at the computer. This pretty face is perfect for setting people off guard. The mousy glasses, the barrette? She was too inconspicuous to pass up. I just waited to see who'd come for the Bloom. She has no idea it's already gone... which is hardly surprising. She has no idea what's kept in the boxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who knows?\" You ask, crossing Bob's arms. There are no cameras in the vault, so you might as well listen up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendel, the bank manager. She's home with the family right now; why work weekends when you have staff? The security detachment, perhaps. And of course Clarissa Van Lewen, who visited the vault with Ms Wendel late last night. My guess is that one of them was our handler, who decided to take the real Bloom and plant it at the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you sigh. \"The Bloom is back at the hotel? I just left there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be. Can't be sure. The Van Lewen estate is another possibility. Or Wendel might have had it relocated to another branch. Ugh... Abigail's here's memories tell me she's a total bitch, and was chewing her out about security down here. Of course, it's Wendel's fault there's no cameras, but Abs is too timid to fight back. Anyway, I've been waiting until Abigail's break so I can sneak off to the diner, swap skins and head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to that mad house?\" You refer, of course, to the wedding. \"I don't know if the wedding is even going ahead. The bride did some pretty strange things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even better,\" Miss Abigail Charlotte grins. \"Nothing duller than a wedding reception. If the wedding is called off, people will be scattered around the hotel. Security will be tight, but everyone's still going to make a grab for the Bloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But which? If there's four of us, there's at least five fakes, plus the real gem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing in our orders that said we can't work together. We could partner up. If we grab three stones each - from the others and from Alexandra - they'd have to pass us both. The others don't know they've been made, yet. Abigail's break is up in five minutes. You and I could grab a couple and head back to the hotel. Unless you prefer to work alone? Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to zap you here. Two people into a vault, one out? Questions would be asked, even if it would be easy to cover up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, slowly, as you consider your options.</span></div></div>",

And ultimately there's nothing to say you have to keep your end of the bargain: you could always use 'her' to do the dirty work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, we need to get out of here.\" Miss Charlotte is seems open about the predicament you're in. It's not possible to zap someone in the vault - it would rouse suspicions. \"But first things first, we need to make sure the 'Bloom' is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't have a copy of it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Miss Charlotte says. \"Upstairs though, come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both step into the lift, riding it up back to the bank floor. From the clean, sterile serenity of the vault, the sunlight and sound feel almost jarringly loud. You scratch Bob's beard, following the prim, smart walk of the apparently young bank clerk, trying to remember she's really one of your rivals. It's hard under such a smart uniform. She turns from her desk, side-stepping into a private office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, sir,\" she says, a businesslike smile. You nod and step in, acting the customer all the way, your finger resting on your own pen. If she makes one wrong move... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't. She steps to the desk and opens a drawer, revealing the light pink, glistening gemstone replica to your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Miss Charlotte says. \"The next step is to... shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, shifting Bob's frame to glance in the direction she's pointing. For the briefest of moments your heart freezes, then pounds with unrelenting force: you just fell for the oldest trick in the book, the 'look that-a-way'. But the strange sensation of the zap doesn't come. Instead, you see exactly why she's pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the main lobby, dressed in a smart cream blouse and grey business suit, is the woman from the photo earlier: the bank manager. Here to check the Bloom, as per the arrangements with the security guards. All hell must be breaking loose back at Cedar Pines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to see it's missing. There's no way I can sleight it into the vault without...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to,\" you correct hastily, pulling the draw strings and turning the small office blinds to conceal your presence. \"Just be Abigail Charlotte, and get her in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour waifish, young partner smiles, a vicious gleam shining beneath her glasses. \"Good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, and the surprised woman steps into the office, accompanied by her young employee who seals the door behind her. There's a look of confusion, before the manager's skin collapses to the floor, her suit and blouse crumpling beneath it. Your cohort leans forward, the buttons in front of her chest still straining, and passes the skin over. You appraise it, gathering up the large, black strands of hair that make up the bob. You begin to get out of your current disguise, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to leave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to reveal who I really am. You know the rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Charlotte grins. \"All right, sir,\" she acknowledges. \"I'll be at my desk. Come grab me when you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, having explained to a customer that he'd collapsed in the manager's office, both Katherine Wendel - 40, married with kids - and her assistant Abigail Charlotte are on the road, Kathy's neatly manicured nails at the wheel of her car. You shift, exploring your new form. For an older woman, Kathy's body is attractive: the heavy makeup on her face works, and there's something incredible about the volume of black locks that bounce playfully on your neck. You look out of her eyes, checking the mirror and the town that's slowly disappearing behind you. Kathy's thoughts are about pot roast that she's preparing tonight. Your thoughts are the Bloom. You've already lied through your teeth, telling the worried owner the Bloom - the real one - is safe and secure in the vault. The truth, however, is far different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got a mission, now. You and Abs are going to track down your opponents and steal their fakes. Then you're going to steal the real gem, where ever it may be. The wedding might be in chaos, but that doesn't change the rules of the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the car into the Cedar Pines resort, adjusting Kathy's hair and flicking it out of her collar, smoothing the ruffles of her suit. She dressed in a hurry when the alert came in, and she's a woman fastidious about her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\" Abs asks, beside you. \"We take them one at a time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We identify them first,\" you say, Kathy's voice - a trickling Mid West drawl that seems to elongate every thought - sounding out into the car. \"They might not be holding the same identity as before. We're effectively starting again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely,\" Abs says. \"We know they'll want to stick around. So we have a shorter list of suspects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough,\" you admit. \"The question is whether this is the right form to narrow that list down. Kathy Wendel isn't known to them, and nor is Abigail Charlotte. We look like bank personnel; they might try and slip into our appearance in the hope of learning something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be useful, if we have each other's backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or dangerous. I could always park around near the spa. There's bound to be someone we could intercept, what with the convention that's happening. We could shed these skins, leave them in a guest's room, and explore the hotel. Either we could grab a staff member and go solo, or we could try and find a couple and impersonate them. Nobody's going to suspect that, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbs nods. \"I don't mind either way,\" she decides. \"It's your call.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Going straight to the bank is your first thought. It's the fastest way to make sure you get the Bloom. The drive isn't far and you have the tools that would allow you to get in, grab it, and get out. But you stop, you need to think about this logically. Some times going with your gut is the way to go. Instinct can be a powerful guiding force and during your training you were told that more experienced operatives are able to intuit what to do, working on the fly and instinctively knowing the best path to take to get something done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those are, again, experienced operatives and you are most definitely not an experienced. Hell, this whole thing is basically one long training exercise. A sort of extended final exam or the Organization's version of a Master's thesis. You don't have the experience needed to trust your gut. Doing that got you into the trap that was Carma Hamilton and it's only through stopping and thinking things through that you were able to escape. Of course, your trainers had said, not all agents are able to go by instinct. Just as many take things slower, more measured. Each has their own strengths, their own way of doing things after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether you'll be able to go with your gut or not, you're certainly not in that position. You're in Bob Foxworth right now and you got there pretty much due to you panicking. It was a desperate gamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why take the risk? The bank will be guarded, there will be cameras. This viper's nest is bad enough. You're still just a kid and you're stressed as is. Better to take a slower approach, something relatively safer. You turn back and re-enter the resort. You'll become one of the Van Lewens. There is still risk in becoming one of them to be sure but it's risks associated with keeping up the identity and making nobody the wiser. So far, however, you've been doing well not arousing suspicion in any of your guises if you do say so yourself so it's a lesser risk and one far less likely to put your back against the wall with no way out like going up to the bank as Bob could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take quick note of the information you committed to memory before leaving for the assignment. The Van Lewen are a family long involved in the financial sector, going back to the Gilded Age in the when Ambrose van Lewen founded a financial services company that would eventually go on to become Van Lewen Financial which owns the bank that Bob uses, VL Century; so called because when current Van Lewen patriarch, Marcus van Lewen, founded the bank it was 100 years to the day of Van Lewen Financial's founding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus van Lewen is a man with a bit of an aged handsomeness of 54. His immediate family members, the ones that are with him right now at the wedding, are his 46-year-old wife Clarissa, 20-year-old son (and heir) Daniel, and 14-year-old daughter Alexis. You will have to become one of those four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to their room which your files told you was room 320, on the same floor as Bob's funny enough. It's locked, of course, but thankfully your training means that getting past an electronic lock, the type that a hotel would use, is quite easy. Inside the room you look for a place where you can hide out. There's a closet, open just a crack, and you make your way over to it. You remove the Bob suit tossing the suit and related clothing under the nearest bed before heading in to the closet and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's about 15 minutes before you hear voices and the Van Lewens, all four of them, enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you this was a waste of time, dear.\" the mature, cultured voice of Clarissa says as they step in. \"Honestly the Vincents are in such dire financial straits that they give us their most important possession as collateral. You expected anything less than dysfunction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expected that, for once, even a family such as the Vincents would be able to show some sense of decorum.\" Marcus replies with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Asks Daniel. \"We getting out of here or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Marcus replies, \"For the time being your mother and I will go back to the reception area, mingle a bit, try to assess the situation and smooth things over between the Vincents and Parrys. We'll be back in an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, gives me time to do a little looking around.\" Daniel replies in a pleased tone, \"There was this really cute waitress down in the restaurant and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's very good son, just remember be back here in an hour.\" Marcus replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, honey?\" Clarissa asks her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Alexis give a bored shrug, \"I guess I'll sit around here until you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's your target. You watch as Marcus and Clarissa leave. Then Daniel. The door closes and it's just you and Alexis alone in the room. You take the pen, making sure you grabbed it out of Bob's pocket before discarding his stuff under the bed, aim and fire. The girl immediately shrivels, deflates, and crumples to the ground. Gotcha!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerge from the closet and go over to the now deflated Alexis suit. You pick it up and hesitate for just a moment. So far you've been people around your own age or older. She's still close, just a few years younger. Still for a brief moment you pause but you quickly shake the hesitation and step in. Your legs become slimmer and shorter, but stronger as they adjust. Your hips a little wider and your ass and stomach more firm and small but perky breasts appear as you pull the suit up. Your arms thin out but like your legs gain a bit of muscle definition. Lastly your head and neck change and straight, brown hair that stops just short of your shoulders appears on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" you state quietly as you catch sight of yourself. You flex an arm, run a hand over your breasts and stomach. Alexis' memories come pouring in. She goes to Saint Siena's Girls Academy, a private and very exclusive all-girls school for grades 6-12 where she's among the top percentile of her class academically in addition to being a gifted clarinet player. More importantly for her, however, is that she's also a gifted soccer player. That explains the strong legs and arms, the girl keeps herself in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's equally girly and a tomboy and a bit of a daddy's girl. Though her brother is the heir to the Van Lewen fortune, Alexis' father dotes on her seeing her as someone who will take the family far once she's a bit older. For all intents and purposes she's a modern day princess and treated as such and though she's spoiled she's not quite as haughty as someone in her position could be. And that's when another memory hits you, one that tells you your luck has paid off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scarlet Bloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at the bank nearby, that much is true. However Marcus never had any intention to give the Scarlet Bloom back. The Vincents will eventually get a Scarlet Bloom back, it will just be a forgery, however, like the one currently in Bob Foxworth's pocket. No Marcus' real reason for getting it was simple: it was a gift for Alexis. It is kept in a vault at the bank though a secret one under, and accessible from, the \"real\" vault where most valuables are stored. And as it was Alexis' gift, she can go and see it any time she pleases. Something she likes to do once or twice a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've hit the jackpot you realize as you slip on Alexis' underwear. All of this time you went from adult to adult and in the end it was a kid, one not much younger than yourself, that held the key to getting the Bloom. You slip the sleeveless black dress on, put on the dark pumps, the long black gloves, the pearl necklace, and the white headband to push your hair back. A cute girl, you regard yourself in the mirror, one who will blossom into something as beautiful as the jewel you can waltz in and take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus and Clarissa return. So does Daniel with lipstick smeared on him. You pack your things, you're leaving. The Van Lewen estate is close by but you wonder... should you ask for a quick detour to the bank to look at \"your\" jewel? You assume that asking would be enough, Daddy would do anything for his Princess, but things have been thrown into chaos. Perhaps he might be on edge and waiting a day or so would be the better option.</span></div></div>",

It'll be about half an hour so the three older people decide to mingle a bit in the lobby. You tell them you'll catch up, that you want to double check your things to make sure that you didn't forget anything. Accepting this they walk out and you immediately dive under the bed. You fish out the skin of Bob Foxworth, then his clothes. You place your hand in the pocket of his pants and pull out the fake Bloom which you deposit into Alexis' purse. You then gather up the skin and clothes and head down the hall to room 302 where, after getting past the lock, you dress the skin in its clothes and then zap it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reinflates and Bob soon reappears though unconscious. He regains it in a matter of moments and looks around confused. After a bit of talking, you've convinced him that he collapsed and he says that it happens, he thanks you. Satisfied you duck out of the room thinking you're in the clear when a voice from your right calls out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Van Lewen, what were you doing coming out of room 302?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to see Anya Martinez, one of the many staff at the resort. She's a pretty young woman not terribly older than yourself, both you and Alexis, about 19 or so. Alexis and her had chatted a little bit during previous stays by the Van Lewens. She comes from the complete opposite background but Alexis found her to be kind of cool so she made it a point to talk to her. Unfortunately talking to her is something you don't want to do right now but you need an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, hi Anya it's just...\" you think back. The memories you had of Bob have already mostly faded. But you do remember that he has diabetes so... \"I was coming out of my room and I saw him walk out of his room and he just... collapsed. So I ran over to help him, he gave me his card to get in, and I stayed with him for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that's horrible!\" Anya exclaims in shock. \"That's Mr. Foxworth's room. He told us ahead of time that he's diabetic so perhaps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me that it happens. Some times he gets lightheaded and can't stand.\" you reply, \"But he told me he was alright and that's when you saw me coming out of his room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madre, but you're such a kind girl Alexis.\" Anya replies giving you a smile. If you weren't on assignment, if you were on a bit of a break, you definitely wouldn't mind becoming her. \"Thank you so much for helping Mr. Foxworth. I'll go in and just double check to make sure everything is alright with him though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was no trouble at all Anya. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I stood around.\" you say with a kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she goes into the room you let out a small breath. That was close but some quick thinking, and Alexis' natural kindness, got you out of that one. You pull your phone out of your purse, about 15 minutes in total have passed, so you head out to rejoin the Van Lewens in the lobby. The driver soon comes, right on time as he usually is. His name is Donald, an older man who has served as the Van Lewens' main chauffeur for the past 25 years. A comforting sight to all of them, most of all Marcus who appreciates his punctuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the resort is the distance you then turn to Marcus. \"Daddy, could we stop by the bank?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives you a quizzical look. \"Stop by the bank? What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to look at my gift.\" you reply, \"All of the excitement and seeing Miss Vincent with that... that fake made me appreciate the real one even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, darling, you can look at that gem any time you want.\" Clarissa says, \"Later. Right now I just want to get home and not sit around while you admire that thing for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom!\" you protest, whine really, \"You can just drop me off. Abby will be there and I haven't seen her in a while. I can just get her to bring me home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abigail...?\" Clarissa asks in exasperation, \"I swear, you and her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw Anya today too, right before I left, so that got me thinking of her.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa cocks an eyebrow. \"Her? Alexis, dear, I've told you that you need friends your own age and of your own social strata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, honey. She does like talking to her.\" Marcus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at him expectantly in a puppy dog fashion. \"Please daddy?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you and smiles. Like the memories told you, a total princess. \"Sure thing honey. Just tell Abigail it's the usual arrangement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, daddy! You're the best!\" you exclaim giving him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Clarissa huff, \"I swear, Marcus, you spoil her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be great being daddy's girl, huh?\" Daniel asks in a sarcastic manner. You just look at him and stick your tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\nBeing a weekend the bank is relatively slow with only light staff and a small amount of patrons. \"Alexis, how are you?\" the greeter, a nice looking young man, says to you with a beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Ethan. I'm good.\" you smile back, \"Is Abby here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abs? Yeah she should be here. Usual spot.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ethan.\" you say as you walk by. You walk through to the back of the bank greeted by tellers and even a few of the regulars. Alexis' presence in the bank is itself a fairly regular thing and she has a tendency to brighten up the room. You wave and greet back and eventually make your way to a desk where a young woman clacks away at her keyboard. She's a bit of a contracdiction, a mousey face framed by hair and with a pert nose and glasses to finish off the thing. It would make her look cute. But her body... her chest is practically straining her blouse and as Ethan called her, her usual nickname is Abs due to, well, her rock hard abs. Alexis is the only one who calls her Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Abby!\" you exclaim cheerfully as you walk up next to her desk. She looks at you in surprise for a moment and then smiles. You feel yourself blush a bit. Mentally you smack yourself. That's out of character, a total rookie mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough if it's out of character Abby doesn't seem to notice. \"Oh, hi Alexis! I didn't know you were coming buy today. You here to check out that gift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yeah, and to hang out with you a bit. Daddy said it was the usual arrangement so if you want to grab something to eat afterwards...\" you say and blush even more. That's when you realize that it's actually not out of character. This girl has a rather large crush on Abby. That means... oh man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up and leads you into the bank vault area where all the safe deposit boxes are. After closing and locking the door she opens one, there's a keypad inside, and enters a combination of numbers. The floor in the center begins to part and revealing a staircase leading to a sub-basement where the gem is stored. \"C'mon, gimme your hand. You know it's a bit dark and it's my salary if you hurt yourself.\" You take it and your face turns crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though there's a large vault door with one last keypad. You enter the number, Abby doesn't know this one and isn't allowed inside, and step in while the door closes automatically. You quickly scope out the inside of the vault. No cameras or anything. Of course not, who could get down here? And there, on a pedestal in the center of the vault, is the Scarlet Bloom. The real deal. You admire it and then remove the fake from your purse. You hold it up next to it: it's a great fake but the real one has just a bit more of a gleam. Carefully you remove a cloth from your purse which you use to pick the Bloom up, you then, fake still in the other hand, place the fake onto the holder where the real deal had been. You then carefully wrap up the Bloom and place it in your purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idle for a couple of moments and then enter the exit code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get your fill today, Alexis?\" Abby asks and you nod. \"Good. Oh and about that lunch? How about we get some kangaroo steak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pauses you dead in your tracks. \"Kangaroo steak\", that's the code for your handler. \"Only if we can get some kiwi milkshakes.\" you give the approved reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby's face breaks into a smile. \"Well done rookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a look. \"How'd you figure it out? Does this mean I fail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby laughs a bit. \"Rookie, I've been doing this for 20 years. I can spot an agent no matter how well they think they can disguise themselves. That's why I'm assigned to as a field handler for the graduation missions. Anyone else, including the real Abby? You'd have fooled 'em completely. This was less about getting the jewel than about how you handled a delicate situation, how you reacted to unknowns and things going south, how you improvised and appraised. It wasn't about the end result but the lead up, that's why we had you get the jewel when we could've gotten it any time, and I have to say you did well. Damn well. Using kid was an especially inspired touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thanks.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Actually, it's a real good thing you're the girl right now 'cause we've got another assignment for you. A Type 1 assignment.\" she says and you nearly spittake. \"The school she goes to? Saint Siena's? We had a Type 3 in there, long term deep cover agent to keep an eye on the place. It's a school for super-rich kids like the girl here so it's a great listening post. Only we think the agent went rogue. We need someone to go in, find the agent, and eliminate 'em and since you're already a student...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby, or the person in her skin, notices your expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you don't have to. We give agents the option of taking a day off inbetween assignments. We can get someone else in no problem. It's up to you.\"</span></div></div>",

Ivory walls surround you, a large, expensive luxury dormitory your parents paid for on school campus.<br>\r\nOf course, the rest of the dormitories are just as flashy, as their residents are no less rich. <br>\r\nYou'd just gotten in from the several hour long drive back down to campus, easily slipping back out of the bank with your assignment.<br>\r\nTired, your young, feminine face is uncharacteristically plain. It's as if her wide, pearly white smile paints the canvas of her face.<br>\r\nYou're going to be in this body for a while, better get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for a shower, you decide. Dropping the black straps of your black dress from your shoulders, you let it crumple to the floor in a useless heap of soft fabric.<br>\r\nRevealing the toned, bronze body of your host, sporting underwear the same colour as your dress. You pull a bang behind your ear and sigh, reaching around, you unclasp your bra and let it drop, then sliding your underwear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not used to the idea of staying in a body for long, you're a type 2. This kind of thing is for type 3s or 4s..<br>\r\nWell, the length of your stay depends on how fast you find the rogue. It should be easy. You only hope he's not smarter than you.<br>\r\nSliding open the detailed shower door, you step in and, to your surprise, find an array of buttons instead of knobs to operate the shower.<br>\r\nYou press one marked with a red H, and a warm stream of water sprays out gently from the large showerhead above, jets on the sides of the walls lightly sprinkle your sides. As you clean yourself, you sift through the girl's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis Van Lewen.. only moments ago she'd just left a wedding. Albeit she wasn't very excited about it.<br>\r\nYou're still a bit down at the idea of taking a kids life, even though it won't be for long. You don't remember being zapped, ever.<br>\r\nBut then again, that's kind of the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm..\" You moan quietly in your high, girly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shower is incredible, the water trickles down your curves smoothly, leaving behind it's warm sensation.<br>\r\nYou're using some expensive brand of body wash you've never seen before, forsaking the yellow scrubby hanging from the rack infront.<br>\r\nUsed to bar soap, you feel like you're using hand sanitizer to wash your entire body.<br>\r\nReminiscing about your family, you wonder what's up with them. If they're even themselves anymore. You can at least hope the organization left them alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you pull a bottle of shampoo from the rack. Your hands are foamy and it slips from your fingers. <br>\r\nClank! <br>\r\nThe noise fills the silent dorm, not even the shower is noisy. It's almost like a waterfall, ironically silent.<br>\r\nYou sigh, slapping your hands against your thighs. They jiggle with the impact, and you step back, bending over to pick up the bottle.<br>\r\nThe cool air behind the stream of water previously enveloping flows through your legs, causing goosebumps to rise all over.<br>\r\nImmediately, you jerk back up and step into the apparent safety of the shower's water. You giggle childishly, you're a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're.. a child..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis! Honey!\" Your father's voice calls through the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock on your bedside table reads 7:02, your memories tell you that this is the time Alexis regularly gets up for classes.<br>\r\nYour father also regularly calls you every morning to make sure you're alright. You don't see the purpose, but you're not Alexis.<br>\r\nWell, you get the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Dad.. I'm up..\" You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, get dressed and have breakfast, call me afterwards okay?\" Your father says rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay daddy, love you bye!\" You say, pulling the phrase right of \"the book\", or her memories rather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone beeps off and you throw the thick blanket from your body. To your horror, you're in nothing but a pair of panties.<br>\r\nWhat happened last night? You actually don't remember much.<br>\r\nThe cold atmosphere greets your warmer body, and your pink nipples instantly harden, goosebumps travel along your skin.<br>\r\nYou're reminded of that shower, and instantly crave one. Folding your arms over your small breasts, you skip along to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you're all dressed in your school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white blouse and tie, with a thick burgundy overcoat and the school crest on it's pocket. From the waist down, you've got on a loose pair of black jeans and a pair of sneakers. Alexis isn't one to dress up fancy, especially for school. She only had on such a nice dress because of the wedding, she actually hates dressing up. Pushing open the bedroom door, you walk out into the hallway. It's quiet, especially this early. The girl's common room is filled with other girls just like you in some ways, different in others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour memories tell you that a girl named Tiffany lives in the room on your left, Brianna to your right, down the hall is a foreign exchange student from Qatar.<br>\r\nMiranda Said. She's beautiful, long black hair, light brown skin, lighter than even Alexis'. <br>\r\nHer father's influence in the oil market gives her family power, you're thinking that she might be host to the rogue. <br>\r\nIt's your first day however, and you need proof. Alexis' memories tell you that she's also very shy and keeps to herself often. Sometimes she's bullied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the large flight of stairs to the ground floor of the common room, and make your way to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong dining tables fill the room with antique wooden chairs of equal worth to fit, the tables already set with linen napkins and silverware.<br>\r\nMany of the girls currently having breakfast however, are eating common food like Cheerios, Pancakes and Toast.<br>\r\nThis isn't what you expected, to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis!\" Someone calls your name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whip your head around to look at them as you walk to the serving counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your friend Baaja, a young indian girl. Alexis has been friends with her since she was enrolled here.<br>\r\nWaving at her, she smiles and resumes talking to another girl nearby. You pick up a bowl and walk to one of the cereal dispensers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cereal, should be a simple choice.. right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly there are about 15 different cereals. One dispenser even has a mix.<br>\r\nYou pull the lever on the one with fruit loops in it, and a plethora of colours tumble from the opening into your bowl.<br>\r\nA metal machine holds cold milk, another holds hot. You pour the cold into your bowl.<br>\r\nWalking to your friend Baaja, she scoots over and gives you room to sit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God I'm soooooooo tired..\" The girl opposite Baaja complains, she's clearly as tired as she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong, curly blonde hair covers her shoulders, her pale face complete with dark circles under her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've gone to bed early last night Diana!\" Baaja says, then stuffing her face with a slice of pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply take a spoon and eat your fruit loops, trying to block out the annoying chatter.<br>\r\nThe girls completely ignore you. In female circles, the only way to be recognized is to provide input, otherwise you're nonexistent to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass, and you're done eating. You leave your bowl on the table, as is the usual, and walk out of the cafeteria's double doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass is drawling, your teacher is a snobby englishman, about 40 years of age or so.<br>\r\nMr. Hemsworth, he's named. He's teaching you Geography. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, class, convection currents gather in the Atlantic to form a massively heat dense area which causes..\" You've lost him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness settles in at your head slowly droops, your forehead laying against your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis Van Lewen! Wake up, sweetie!\" Mr. Hemsworth sarcastically calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly raise your head and frown. Several other students around you are asleep, but your memories tell you that Mr. Hemsworth dislikes you in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues on with his subject, and you notice someone looking at you. It's Baaja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and waves at you, and simply return the gesture, before staring into space again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, you're walking to Math as Baaja interrupts you in the hallway. Her straight black hair flies infront of her face as she halts abruptly before you, and she sputters to fix it into place. You smile amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alexis! Mr. Hemsworth is always picking on you isn't he,\" She says, you two starts walking, \"I saw Brandon sleeping again, and Trish too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish?\" You sputter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Trish. Can you believe it? She's usually so attentive in class. Wonder what's happened to her.\" Baaja says, not recognizing your sudden words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply laugh it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day is over, you haven't uncovered anything yet. It's all just been a big boring cycle of events, probably going to be just as boring tomorrow.<br>\r\nYou strip Alexis' uniform off in the bathroom, and step into her lovely shower. As you wash yourself, you find yourself tiredly phasing out.<br>\r\nStretching, you reaching around your neck and dig your nails into your nape, pulling the two sides apart.<br>\r\nA seam splits as you will the skin to separate, and you pull yourself from Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a large butterfly emerging from a cocoon, your much larger body emerges from the small form of Alexis.<br>\r\nYou wobble on Alexis' small feet, from the waist up, you're you. David. Her torso flaps around like a hoodie tied around your hips.<br>\r\nYou look at yourself for a few minutes, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, pal.\" You say to yourself, before stretching Alexis up, tucking yourself back into her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou body shrinks rapidly as the skin melts onto you, morphing your body back into Alexis' smaller physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the water off, and step out of the shower. Wrapping a towel around your chest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alexis' body is always piping with energy you find.<br>\r\nYou pull on your underwear infront of the bathroom mirror, brushing your hair back and whistling a tune. <br>\r\nImpersonating someone utterly is something you've gotten used to, but it's never the same each time.<br>\r\nEverybody has a different, special way that they do things. The shape of their bodies, their inner tempo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the time you spent in the Scarlet Bloom trial, wearing skin after skin. It was entertaining, it showed you the power of the pens, as well as your own.<br>\r\nThat was probably the point, thinking about it. Slowing down feels.. well, slow. You're not actively trying to change identities and remaining in one body is very different. <br>\r\nRaising your old pair of black jeans, your male psyche takes over and you sniff them once, judging their decency.<br>\r\nDoesn't smell bad, might as well.<br>\r\nYou tug it on as you had done this morning, and you find a nice blouse to go over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping your feet into a pair of sandals, you leave your bedroom to go explore. But more importantly, to gather information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis! Hey!\" A girl appears infront of you a few steps from your now closed door. \"Trish was asking for you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at her, she's shorter than you by about an inch. Her name's Annie, nice girl but a bit quirky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What for?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno', she just seemed to want you really badly. Must be important! She said to meet her in the changing rooms.\" Annie nods, and then walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and look at the ceiling, before shrugging to yourself. <i>Might as well.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the changing rooms after a short walk through the moonlight courtyard outside of the cafeteria doors, you look around.<br>\r\nThe room is completely empty, as expected. You walk forward a few steps and open a sliding door into the showers.<br>\r\nA large expanse greets your eyes, on the right there are shiny wooden benches, long racks with hooks above them. On the left, large stalls with modern showers installed. You're horrified at the sight in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's skin lay flat on the marble floors infront of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they sent you after me, eh?\" A deep, male voice sounds from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip around and pull your pen from your side, but a large hand catches your wrist and wrends it to the side.<br>\r\nIt's your gym teacher, Mr. Randall. Or so your memories tell you. Looking up at his face, he's got a huge grin across it. He's caught you.<br>\r\nYou're dragged around helplessly, your much smaller body like a ragdoll against Mr. Randall's adult strength.<br>\r\nHe pulls you towards Trish's skin, and then quite literally picks you up, throwing you towards the benches.<br>\r\nYour body hits the wall with a loud thud, and then another as gravity slams you into the wooden finish below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething stops you from crying out in pain, and surprisingly, there's not that much.<br>\r\nYou recover quickly, staggering up, you regain your balance and look up to see Mr. Randall holding his pen towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've lost, pal.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not over till it's over. You've always been the guy to make high risk plays in life, and now is no exception.<br>\r\nYour hand snaking around to your pocket, at the same time you duck to the right, tumbling down to the floor as Randall hits the button.<br>\r\nThe beam spears through the air, narrowly avoiding your shoulder as you drop. Rolling across the ground, you hear him shout in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the f-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZAP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drops to the ground instantly, reduced to a flubbery pile. You stand up again, holding your waist with your free arm.<br>\r\nTucking the pen into your pocket, you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a type 2. <i>Pal.</i>\" You spit at him, as if he could even hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is really banged up, and as the adrenaline wears off, you're starting to feel your bruises.<br>\r\nWalking over to Mr. Randall's heap, you pick him up and turn him around. Opening the seam at the back of his neck, another skin lay buried inside.<br>\r\nAs suspected. <br>\r\nYou drop him to the floor, weakness overcoming your arms. Staggering backwards, you drop yourself onto the bench behind and relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.. was rough..\" You say, Alexis' tone tired and hurting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to figure out what the rogue's been up to when he cut communications with the organization. You strip your clothes off and peel Alexis from your body slowly, her muscles aching. The pain subsides as you emerge from your host, laying her skin out on the bench.<br>\r\nWalking over to the gym teacher's skin, you pick him up and reach into the seam, peeling the two skins apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flaccid skin of a teenage girl comes free in your hand, and you almost drop it in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer memories flood your mind as you don her body. Alice Clark, biologically 16, chronologically, about 24.<br>\r\nInducted into the organization after she survived an attack by another member who tried to turn her into a disguise, and was taken an interest in after she took the pen from the member she had incarcerated. She was useful due to her willingness to wear skins, but was suffered from bipolar disorder after switching between skins very often. Due to this, she was labeled a type 3 and installed in several locations off and on, the latest being the Saint Sienna's academy, where she'd decided to go rogue after becoming fed up with the organization's orders. She had worn several people during her time, even Alexis, but never left the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou admire your pale complexion, long blonde hair softly drapes over your shoulders down to your lower back, after probably years of no attention.<br>\r\nGazing into a nearby mirror, your soft blue eyes betray your previously evil intent. Pink lips pursing as you try to make faces.<br>\r\nYour breasts are larger than Alexis', probably a small C cup with small round nipples. You're slim and tall, a nice feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Time to contact HQ and get out of here..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to Alexis' skin, you quickly don her over your current appearance, her aches return and you wince as you move along.<br>\r\nYou look down at the gym teacher and shrug, zapping his skin with the black pen and leaving him there. You pull on your clothes, grabbing Trish's skin, you bundle it up and stuff it under your shirt to conceal it, even though you appear awkward.<br>\r\nYou walk back to the dorm room, ignoring anyone nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your cellphone, you flick it on and enter Alexis' pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5567. Simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour classes at the organization embedded their go-to number whenever contact was needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-800-SKINS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's horrible. You'd heard Gunther complaining about it as you entered the lab one day, and you quite agree.<br>\r\nWhy would the organization have a commercial number, and something as obvious as SKINS?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rings once, and a man answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Oh sh- Hold on one sec'.\" You frown and wait a few seconds, you hear movement. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the guy on the other end put on Elena's skin, or at least her head as you're now listening to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Wanna' get some kangaroo steaks?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if we get some kiwi milkshakes.\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who's in poor Elena now?\" You ask, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you in Alexis, Rookie? I hope you've got good news.\" Elena says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm all done. Got the rogue, a young girl named Alice Clark.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, I don't know the name though, must've been older than me.\" She replies, \"Alright, I'll send transport first thing tomorrow. Prepare yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You flip the phone off and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower, you bask in the temporary relief that is warm water over your bruised body. Slowly stretching your limbs, you reach around and peel Alexis off.<br>\r\nAlice's pale body underneath, you pull Alexis' feet from your own and drop her on the wet floor. Turning around, you bathe yourself again.<br>\r\nSuch a pretty girl should be well groomed, you almost feel sorry for her.<br>\r\nRepeating the external and internal cleansing process, you relax finally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've been playing musical bodies all day now, and you've ended up in one that is far from ideal, too much in the middle of this in-fighting nightmare, someone at the heart of everything, under the intense spotlight of everyone\u2019s eyes. But as the insane situation you find yourself in dawns on you, there's simply no way out without blowing your cover. You know from the bride's messed up memories that this isn't the real Bloom, but that was never the assignment. This has been about slipping through traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carms?\" You ask nervously, holding out a neatly manicured hand. She turns and gives you an insincere (though you pretend not to see it) smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now. We've started. Don't trip up. And keep your chin up, try not to do that awful smile, the one that makes you look like a constipated chipmunk. You know it embarrasses you and this is being filmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, she's even a bitch now, in her moment of glory, when she doesn't need to be. You know that she intends to get you drunk then quietly murder you. But that's not something you can change... is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you find yourself at the door. Nerves flutter through your current identity's stomach, torturing and tormenting you. You can feel your breasts grow warm and flushed as you march toward the happiest day of \u2018your\u2019 life. Suddenly you're out in the open, wind blowing soft against your cheeks and the scent of honeysuckle on the air. You push down your veil, and line up behind your bridesmaids and flower girl. Taking a deep breath to steady yourself, waiting for the music to start up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a moment.\" The voice comes from your side and you turn to see a woman with perhaps the most dramatic plastic surgery you've ever seen. Flowing blonde locks, a Botox'ed forehead and 'trout pout', and large, oversized silicone breasts. You'd guess her to be in her late 30s, and she's completely over the top, from long red nails to a white suit showing off too much cleavage. You realize quickly you're looking at Irina Parry, Holden's step-mother after his father walked out of the first marriage. \"May I borrow the bride before her big moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your apologies and step toward her, warily. Alexandra doesn't know her, and this is unusual, although Carma seems happy to delay proceedings for a moment; it just adds to Alexandra\u2019s nerves. You edge back into the hotel with her, just round a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...\" You begin in your most timid voice, only for her to round on you, jabbing her bejewelled finger in accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't even try it,\" She hisses. \"You think I don't know that this sham wedding is for the money? Oh baby, you bet I do. I did the same. Only instead of Holden I got his father. Less expectation to ride his cock, more time shopping and sunbathing. So if I were you, I'd turn around and run. Don't go up the aisle. Because the Parry wealth is mine. You got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha... what?\u201d You're astounded this is coming out, as Irina practically boasts of being a gold digger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, don't think it's love Holden wants. He's too busy fucking Carma. Oh yes, you stupid bitch. It's an open secret, if you're smart enough to see it. So turn around and run along now. Your big day is just a big mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're startled, which probably helps you fake Alexandra\u2019s appropriately stunned reaction. But this is also an opportunity. You could, of course, stay as Alexandra and either blindly go through with the wedding or cause a scene. Or, if you can get out of your white puff bridal gown, Irina\u2019s the kind of person you have no issue with when it comes to creating a new skin to borrow...</span></div></div>",

There's too much risk here, and you've got plenty of time. You give a brief smile as you step out of the elevator on the ground floor, making way with your shapely thighs for one of the bridesmaids, who seems to be hurrying up to the exclusive floor: you guess she was Jo's customer earlier. You give a neat nod, propping your glasses against your tan skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody suspects a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out, down the corridor, and across the lobby, heels clicking against the floor, Nancy's uniform tight against her body, making you feel magnificent. You watch as the staff pay attention to you with polite subservience given your position, and calmly walk out to the marquee waiting in the grounds. This is why you accepted the offer - not that you had much choice, cornered by an imposter in a car park. Right now, you are a middle-aged Indian woman, and nobody knows the difference. You have her knowledge, her skills... you are her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the marquee. Serving staff are still laying tables and arranging a dance floor. Technicians are checking the sound system, and securing power cables to make sure the event is perfect. You keep a firm gaze and disinterested air, striding through into the performer's area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'backstage' is small, an open space with brief screens for changing. Currently it's a mess of clothes and wires, with a small table and mirror set up for makeup. A few bags are set down, half-open, but everything is organized chaos. Nancy's inherently neat nature flinches a little as you look around with her deep brown eyes, and you lift up a costume, hanging loosely over the top of the screen, with disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" There's a voice from behind. You turn around sharply. Standing in front of you is a young woman, perhaps only 20, with short-cut blonde hair twisting out in a modern cut. She's a classic 'quirky' beauty - pale skin, large eyes, and round cheekbones with a wide grin. She's short, with a toned body under cargo pants and an old Iron Maiden T-shirt, and perky breasts creating an hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello,\" you smile. \"I'm Nancy, the planner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" She smiles and offers you her hand. You shake. \"I'm Janet. Janet Bolsh. Part of the magic act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Well, I just wanted to run through the arrangements for this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" the girl shrugs, blowing a bubble with some gum. \"Well, we're pretty much set. Dan's going to run the main show for the kids, I'm going to work the tables, do some basic sleights, things like that. Card tricks, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" you say, slowly, walking around the screen. \"Everything seems in order. Is Mr Hancock around? Or Ariel, our singer for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet wrinkles her nose. \"Nah, they're not around. So not much point running through things, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and smile, pointing the pen at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you say. \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your blonde hair, slipping the white fishnet stockings right up your thigh, and feeling the tightness of your corset. Janet's costume is elegant but arty, as it's meant to be. Finishing the costume, you lean forward to the table and set the small, undersized top hat on your brow. In the mirror, you can see Janet's mischievous eyes sparkling. You still need to put on her makeup - she hadn't decided whether to go for some clown-inspired look, or glittery mystique - but otherwise you're ready for the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chew your gum, blowing out a large pink bubble. Nancy's recovered from 'slipping' on the mess, and has headed back to the main hotel to leave you to prepare. Dan's still not back, and you haven't seen 'Ariel' since she made some snide remark about the event being beneath her and how much money the Vincents were throwing at her to attend. Janet's barely getting two hundred for the night, and is using it to pay her way through college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you care. Janet's just a disguise to get to the Bloom. And as her you can now you're perfectly placed to take the Bloom. You could just 'perform' a trick with it, and the real Bloom will be yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the actual event hasn't taken place yet. There's still time to take an alternative approach if you want. Janet's perfect and it's fun to be her, but this is meant to be a test of your skills. You could probably impress better if you somehow managed to join the wedding. </span></div></div>",

It's simple, really \u2013 a field exercise, under supervision of an agent already in situ. You're going to help Scott Jones lose his bid for re-election. Mr Jones is old money, and his family's connections have seen him inherit a seat considered completely safe. What we need is a little scandal to throw that open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that's the test: effectively help rig an election by sabotaging a candidate's chances. You're glad they're starting you gently. But then at no point have they ever done so: you recall you first, awkward encounter with \u201cAlex\u201d as \u201cJenny\u201d. That was a first day to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d you say, understanding the brief fully. It seems relatively straightforward. \u201cHow much of a scandal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's for you to decide. We want the election to be a contest: you're not going to destroy him, just throw the election wide open. Tomorrow night he'll be attending a charity gala. Well, I say charity; the reality is it's for his re-election war chest. That's where you'll strike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Harry's face a blur of intel whizzes past: key names, dates, events, table plans \u2013 the works. Everything the Organization has on the event and Mr Jones. It's too much for you to take in, but you try to concentrate. Harry laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't try and take in the intel. As you're flying solo for the first time \u2013 in the field, with no support, but with the same level of control as any operative \u2013 you're getting Blanked. That will help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell is Blanking? Nobody has ever even breathed a word about it before, either in class or during downtime. \u201cHarry?\u201d you ask, uncertain. Harry laughs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHead to Gunther, he'll clarify what you do. After that, you're getting mailed to your handler. That's all your getting from this briefing \u2013 opaque I know, but that's part of the test. Now off you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still confused, reeling from the sudden announcement and new information, as you enter the lab again. Gunther beckons you over, flicking switches, looking concerned, twisting dials that give readouts that make little sense to the untrained. Eventually he points to something that looks like a Van Der Graff generator: a smooth chrome orb suspended by a column. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHands out, place on top\u201d he says, indicating the machine. You step closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d Gunther barely looks up from his contraption, instead focusing his attention on several computer monitors simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is the worst thing that can happen to you?\u201d he asks. This is a common Organization question: they want this hardwired in. The answer is not dying. If you die in another's skin, or your own, that can be covered up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExposure. Letting someone find out about us. Getting caught.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. Now, we don't want that to happen, but...\u201d the old man shrugs nonchalantly, as always his movements far too rapid for his supposed age, \u201caccidents happen, don't they? Field work is unpredictable, ya? So we use Blanking. Now hold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're uncomfortable with this, but you have little option. Your hands clasp on to the cold, slippery orb surface. Gunther flips a switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder violently, as an electric bolt fires through you: it feels as if every muscle in your body spasms before relaxing again. \u201cFucking hell!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunther doesn't laugh at your reaction: he betrays virtually no emotion about it. \u201cNow, tell me how do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your hands and body. Everything seems normal, and you begin to shake off the soreness of the electric shock. Then you spot your reflection in the polished dome surface. You lean in, staring hard at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face. It isn't yours anymore. It's <i>almost</i> yours \u2013 there are traces you recognize. But every single prominent feature you had has been erased. You look... average. The only word for it. As if someone took the image of everyone in your age group and ethnicity, fed them into a computer, and asked them to produce an average face. You stare deep at your image. It reminds you of a video game character's face sliders being set to the mid-point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn't you just use the red pen? I could have done that easily enough.\u201d It's true: it's you, just with heavy plastic surgery. Enough that, should you be caught, you doubt anyone could trace you back to your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the red pen affects the body, but not the mind. You now have a safety net; a neural block that prevents anyone from finding out too much if you get caught.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't feel a block.\u201d You feel like some mad scientist has just electrocuted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn't; what would be the point in that? It would just prevent you from remembering your training. Think of it like a firewall, only open to zose with user access: you, and us, ya? Now, how do you feel? Emesis is a common side effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine.\u201d  A little groggy perhaps, but... you're going down. A buzzing sound fills your ears, like a fly behind your eardrum. Your head pounds with intense pain, pain drumming to the rhythm of your heartbeat. Suddenly you realize you're on the floor, cradling your head. You feel dizzy and faint. The world turns to darkness, black and blue spots flooding your vision. You're having some kind of fit, and the world is fading in and out. You can see shoes \u2013 Gunther's, you think \u2013 as you spin on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything goes utterly dark. In the distance, you can hear your own scream.</span></div></div>",

Plans for a hotel, the Union Hotel. Seating arrangements, table plans. Memos and emails. There's the gala plan too: the speakers, attendees, and staff rota for the evening. Even the music cues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dossier on Scott Jones \u2013 photos, date of birth, political history. Nothing personal or private, just information any good private detective could glean. He's 45 years old and married to Naomi, a rather stunning wife aged 43 years: a trained lawyer who now spends her time keeping up appearances and attending social events; she also helps out during the day offering pro bono legal advice. One child, his daughter Robin, aged 19 years, strawberry blonde hair like her mother's and a svelte body - she's blossomed into a beautiful woman. Robin is soon to graduate from the prestigious Woodbridge Academy, where she's an honor roll student with a flawless personal record. She will be returning home for the gala to support her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize, in the inky blankness, that this is the data from the briefing you've just received from Harry. Evidently it's part of the Blanking process: cover the tracks, and give you all the information you need for the job. You're still not a fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at that point you wake up, sucking for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, easy there.\u201d A figure looms over you, a tall, dusky woman with long, flowing black hair and a rich, exotic figure. In her hand is a black pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d you groan. The fuckers. They've just mailed you as a skin. And, to make matters worse, to prevent you questioning whether you've been intercepted by some unknown force, they've sent a friendly face to 'reassure' you that you're still an Organization trainee. You wish they hadn't... the memories that face conjures up are hard to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember my first Blanking, too. Rough times, huh? Don't worry. The first time is always the worst - eventually it's little more than a tingling sensation. They don't do it before every op, but it's for your protection as much as ours.\u201d Elena \u2013 for it is she \u2013 relaxes, a pleasant smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is this? You started this, so you'll finish my training?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Elena's exotic accent rolls over the words as she shakes her head, earrings chiming. \u201cI am not the one that recruited you. I was simply told to assume this \"Madame Elena\"'s body as an act of faith. You were thrown into something new, and we needed to snap you out of it. I guess your recruiter used this face, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" You rub your head, and look down. You're now dressed in a modest T-shirt and pants. Your head still rings. \u201cWhy the hell did they do that, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSend me as a skin?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeeps you fresh. Journeys are fatiguing. Your head may be sore now, but in five minutes, you'll be right as rain and ready to go. I'll make a pot of coffee. You rest up, gather your bearings. You'll need them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes half an hour, not the promised five minutes, but eventually you're feeling ready enough to move. You're in a crumbling shambles of an apartment in a poor quarter of the city: it's not your home town, not even your home state. Evidently the Elena wake-up call took some arranging. Your new friend explains that the Blanking method typically knocks an agent out the first time, but eventually it becomes more of an unpleasant, controllable jolt. In addition to reseting your features \u2013 most agents use the red pen to return to their idea of 'normal' between missions\u2013 it adds a neural firewall to prevent anyone using, say, a blue pen on you, and downloads the mission briefing direct to the central cortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is little small talk, and the topic quickly moves on to the task at hand. Elena explains that she is there to monitor your performance, but will not act unless absolutely necessary: you're on your own. She passes you your pen box, and you take your black, brown, blue, red and white pens from their slots. When you ask what the plan is, Elena shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe plan is up to you. As a Type 2, you'll have complete autonomy as long as you accomplish your set goal. I'll be marking you on creativity, initiative and results. Subtlety is everything; if anyone suspects that something happened other than the events you present to them, you fail. You've got a time limit on this \u2013 whatever embarrassment you decide is appropriate for Mr Scott Jones, it must happen at the gala tonight. That starts in five hours, so, by my count, that gives you nine hours in total to accomplish your mission. Switch skins as often as you like, but do not under any circumstances get caught: that's an automatic fail too, and where I step in to clean up your mess. Once you accomplish your mission, leave your skin \u2013 again, they must not question whatever you did as them \u2013 and return here. I'll then give you your grade. That's it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mull over your options, and the different routes you could take. The first way is to approach the hotel where the gala is held, perhaps become one of the notable guests for the evening or a staff member. That should give you plenty of scope to embarrass Jones and walk away. You could ask awkward questions, raise eyebrows with malicious gossip, 'accidentally' ruin the event for him in a way that hits his sponsorship hard. It's all relatively simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alternative route, and perhaps the more obvious, is to replace Jones himself. As Jones it would be easy to make a gaff or error that would put the election plans into chaos. But you're being measured on creativity, too. As a politician, Jones' family are also in the spotlight. Perhaps it's time Naomi did something that affected her husband's chances. Or maybe, as Robin, you could drop her little-miss-perfect routine, get drunk, perhaps even get caught doing a line of cocaine in the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a Type 2, it's your call on how to tackle the mission.</span></div></div>",

Targeting Scott Jones is too obvious, and has all kinds of unpredictable pitfalls. What you want to do is create trouble that brings him into question, yet ultimately will have little impact on whoever you impersonate. Naomi's career could be over if she did something inappropriate. But Robin? Robin's GPA and family connections will smooth over almost anything. She seems like your ideal choice to create a little chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem is how to 'acquire' her. Elena points out the same thing. The family home is too secluded; no way to sneak in, and CCTV will record any intruders, making it almost impossible to switch there. That's when it hits you, and a plan forms in your mind. Sagely, the agent listens as you outline what you're going to do. Then nods, mulling it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An interesting approach,\" she confirms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, having made several phonecalls to check out your hunch, you're slipping into your first skin of the night. Carefully you grap your new body's face and tug it over your own, flexing his muscles as you do so. Memories aren't required, but the brown pen already has you acting like your new host completely as you climb into his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when your training first started, in what seems like an age ago, you had found yourself as someone eager to become Miss Universe. If that skin taught you anything, it was that women put a lot of preparation into looking good for an important event like tonight. Coming straight out of her academy, Robin would have been sure to do one thing before heading home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder in your new body - Wes Lonsdale. You zapped him after repeatedly banging on the back door of his business, knowing it was sure to lure someone from the exposed front of house. So far, your plan has gone perfectly. You button up his jeans and saunter into the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wes, honey. Your next appointment is here,\" a woman - presumably a co-worker - calls. You smile, dropping into a characteristic Wes posture. In front of you, dressed conservatively, is the lovely Robin Jones. She's athletic, with wavy strawberry blonde hair twisting around her shoulders, stunning green eyes and a slight smattering of freckles across her nose. There's no question she's an attractive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave. \"Hey, girl! You're giving me some serious Amy Adams-Emma Stone right now! So what's it to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's smile could light up a room. \"I've got a charity event to go to tonight. It's important for my dad. So I was wondering if you could do something special? Something classy? You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap your fingers, picking up your scissors. You knew Robin would head to a hair salon before she went home; it was a combination of training plus instinct. And now, as her hairdresser, you've got the perfect opportunity for a switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" you agree. \"Come, this way. I've got some product out back I want to show you that will be perfect...\"</span></div></div>",

That you'd understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" You turn to Robin, holding your arms up in mock surrender. \"I am so sorry about this. I will be right with you.\" You strut over to the reception, picking up the phone. Your Wes muscle memory is your guide, and you keep your exterior composure. Inside, though, you're panicking. Before you started this charade, you agreed codewords in case you had to abort. Lou is how Elena would identify herself, if she had to switch skins and she could - it's a gender neutral name. Dishwasher was the panic button: it meant she had to speak to you in private instantly. Wes's arm scoops up the phone and pulls it to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is about fixing appliances, I told your colleague this morning. It's not the dishwasher, it's the freezer.\" Freezer - code for 'you can speak freely'. You doubt anyone is going to be listening on another line. You hear Elena's voice immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out now. This minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This minute. Drop that face you're wearing and look for a red sedan out back. Abort, abort, abort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line clicks dead, and you set the phone down. You can't help but let a look of utter shock pass your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hon, are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Wes' colleague, recovering your composure. \"Yeah, fine. Just... don't ever get a relative of a friend to fix your kitchen, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn on your heel, promise Robin it'll take one more minute, and slip out back. There, as hurriedly as possible, you get out of Wes, restore him, and use the white pen to make sure he knows he's got a customer to attend to, and has been telling people he's got a broken kitchen freezer. Tracks covered - albeit loosely - you dash out of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena's still wearing the fortune teller's skin as you climb into the front seat, almost immediately shocked by the rapid acceleration. You don't even have time to put on your seatbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Did I expose myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not you,\" Elena says, concentrating on driving. \"We've got a Class Blue and that means training is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class Blue. Blue is bad. It means we've got a shitstorm.\" Elena is utterly composed throughout all of this; the language seems to flow rather than be uttered in panic. \"That means we've got a real risk of exposure. Something, somewhere, went seriously wrong. Everyone goes into automatic lockdown: communications are severed, Type 3s vanish into their identities, everyone else finds someone to be and waits for pre-determined signals. No traces, everyone vanishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're going to vanish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. It's pure coincidence that you happened to be doing your final assessment in the area, but protocol is clear. You are the nearest Type 2, and that means you've just gone active to try and solve this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Active?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right - active. Don't worry, you were doing fine. Your approach was interesting, your attack from a blind angle that nobody would have imagined. You realized a direct change would be tricky, and worked out the perfect spot to make a switch with the perfect candidate to cause a little trouble. So far, you're a pass. It's just that now, you're going to have to pass for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp down your nerves. Your own body, with its strangely bland face, stares at you from the car's side mirror. You watch as the traffic passes and Elena negotiates bend after bend. Your stomach churns with nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the situation. Someone in Chicago was rumbled in an op. A Type 1 was called, and immediately the situation was sanitized.\" That's a polite way for saying that whatever happened wouldn't be making the news. You wonder if the Type 1 killed anybody, or if a mind-wipe was in order. Either way, something drastic happened. \"We caught almost all of it. But there's been a complication, so we need you to go in and replace someone. Her name is Samantha Reston. Make sure you've taken her place within the next half-hour. Once you're her, you call me on this number. I'll give you further instructions. The security password is 'weather report'. I will respond with 'chance of thunder'. I checked; it's clear skies all day locally, so nobody else should ask. I'll explain more then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little baffled by this whole development; it's so sudden, and a lot of responsibility seems to lie on your shoulders. You also wonder why, if it's so critical, Elena would be tasking you with it. Maybe this is another test? The real test, designed to haze you and see how you react under pressure? It's possible. Either way, you have to move quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you doing this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena pulls the car over, slowly down as she parks up at the kerb. \"Because this is a Type 2 job. I'm Type 1, and that means I kick ass. You're the specialist in subterfuge. So do what you do best. Find yourself a new face, get in there, and become Sam Reston.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out of the cab, pens in your pocket, and the car speeds off. It's only then you look across the road toward your target. It's not what you expected at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to infiltrate...</span></div></div>",

A direct confrontation is bound to end badly for you. Obviously this group \u2013 at least Elena and the person on the other end of the phone \u2013 have a plan. Given it's so far seen them turn your friend Jimmy, your girlfriend Jessica, her mother, a fortune teller, a photographer and a college girl into wearable costumes, you doubt it's a plan to further world peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s14.postimg.org/f64l5t2rl/1s_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s14.postimg.org/f64l5t2rl/1s_TXT....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch down behind Elena's car, listening to the conversation close. So far, the words 'you know how that goes' are the ones that concern you most: the result of your refusal to join whatever scheme they have. You already know that you're going to refuse, point blank. They underestimated your loyalty to your own moral code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena ends the call, and flicks away her cigarette, taking a moment to compose herself. This is it, you decide: no turning back now. Lucy Binder's frame rises, her bluer-than blue eyes glaring with your malicious intent. Whoever the Stranger truly is, they're shocked by this turn of events. You can see Elena gasp in horror as you rise, a look of incomprehension and fear as she notices the pen in Lucy's grip. For a moment she stands there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow wait...\u201d she manages to blurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not going to risk her escaping. Lucy's body drives forward like a coiled spring, her chubby legs moving you forward as quickly as her short skirt will allow. You shove the pen tight against 'Elena's skin', and activate it. Your opponent struggles, but almost immediately the dusky, beautiful woman ceases to resist as she hollows, then crumples into a pile at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s12.postimg.org/oaqnvyx7h/2ss_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s12.postimg.org/oaqnvyx7h/2ss_TXT...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that 'how it goes'?\u201d you ask, Lucy's usually sweet voice tainted with venom. You need to move quickly now. You grab the fallen cell then 'Elena', the skin still draped with that midnight blue gown, glancing around nervously to make sure nobody's watching your bizarre theatrics. Coast clear, you open the boot and deposit your opponent inside. Your mouth turns dry as you notice the two bags inside: Jessica in one, Denise Hunt in the other. You need to help them soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing you can do now, though. You slam the boot and climb into Elena's car. A quick search of her bag reveals yet another pen \u2013 this time one with several buttons \u2013 and her car keys. The rest of the items look mundane, probably the genuine Elena's belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waste no time in hitting the road.</span></div></div>",

Your legs, though chubby, are short and you have to adjust the seat to reach the pedals. It's also a weird sensation to occassionally glimpse yourself in the mirror, and see a blonde college girl with a new haircut. You're going to have to get used to it, you suppose. Although you don't intend to remain Lucy Binder for the rest of your - her? - life, it's the situation you now find yourself in. Your home, your family, your friends. They're all gone now. Once you return Jessica and Denise to the living, you'll have to leave town. There's no other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBzzzzzzt. Buzzzzzzzt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s11.postimg.org/u5uveuuyb/3ss_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s11.postimg.org/u5uveuuyb/3ss_TXT...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam on the brakes and pull to the side of the road. Shit: Elena's phone is ringing. This is the last thing you need. You stare at it for a moment in blind panic, wondering what to do. Fail to answer it, and the net you're trying to slip from will become a noose; a manhunt will close in on you, and you've already seen enough to know this shadowy collective could track you down. Worse, they could destroy your old life from within, slowly and deliberately. They can be anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you realize, can you. The phone has gone to voicemail, but given the impatience of the caller previously, you expect it to ring again. The car is parked on a long, empty stretch of road, with no sign of life in any direction. That gives you an opportunity to try a delaying tactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some hesitation, you climb out of the car and walk to the boot, grappling with Lucy's short locks as you do so. Finding the nub, you begin to slide her face away from yours, the mask hollowing and crumpling into a collapsed bib that hangs loose around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you grab the Elena skin, dragging it from the boot until it hangs out, a grotesque suit that dangles limp and sinister. You begin to guide your hand through its flowing black hair, trying to find the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s15.postimg.org/fd5j2tq2j/4ss_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s15.postimg.org/fd5j2tq2j/4ss_TXT...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, the phone begins to ring again. You find the entrance and, holding your breath, pull Elena's head over your own. Once more your flesh contorts to a strange new shape, bringing on strange and unusual sensations as you take on high cheekbones and a new set of teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere goes nothing, you shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Elena's voice, so mysterious and feminine, sounds odd making such a casual greeting, but you're trying to channel the impostor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you on Anderson?\" The voice is a bark, like nails against a chalkboard. Distinctly male, and distinctly vicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got him,\" you say, trying to mimic the casual style you heard earlier. \"Kid's still in his little costume for the night, heading to her house. She's got a lover, so we'll see what he does. I doubt he's going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" The voice is terse, speaking only when necessary. \"That gives you some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've set up a little operation on Hallend Drive; it's right in the middle of town. Number 24.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it,\" you answer. The real stranger spoke of 'borrowing' Elena before. It would make sense he knew his way around town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do. Swing by. Bring the Hunts.\" The line clicks dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause and marshal your thoughts. They are clearly expecting 'Elena'. You could always run, as you had planned initially. Or you could take the Stranger's place. After all, he or she has been wearing your friends, a little payback is in order. And if you can pull this off, you'll know far more about who you are dealing with...</span></div></div>",

You know it by reputation rather than having been there. A few of the more boisterous jocks in your class have boasted having gone down there to 'become a man'. None of them have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the town's red light district. A seedy row of houses with boarded up windows, a mess of dirty alleys behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull up in one of the alleyways and climb out of the car, walking gracefully in a dress of midnight blue. You're now fully in the Elena suit, having pulled over somewhere a little more secluded earlier. To your horror, when you'd examined Elena the the stranger's skin was also inside her, a thin layer hidden under the Elena flesh. It's now stuffed in the bag, beneath a bundle of flesh that, restored, would create Lucy Binder. The impostor was a man - more than that, you can't say. He was nondescript, just average in every way. A forgettable face commuting unforgettable horror, impersonating Jimmy, Jessica and who knows who else. Whoever he is, or was, there's a poetic justice to his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s22.postimg.org/rgfj9d641/5sd_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s22.postimg.org/rgfj9d641/5sd_TXT...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the bags from the boot, figuring it's best to bring them with you, and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the alley one of the town's prostitutes is plying her trade. Her face is beautiful in a seductive kind of way, a fierce dyed-red snap of hair cut into a tight bob that accentuates her dark eyes and wicked smile. She's deathly pale, almost powder white, with a lean, undernourished body caught in a tight, revealing dress. As she asks if her client if they want a 'party', you could almost imagine her as a vampire, leading her victim away to be sucked dry. Given the way she's talking, comments about rubber and restraints, you suspect her client would enjoy that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, focus, and enter the dimly lit hall leading to your rendezvous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't see the figure watching you intently from a truck parked nearby. Nor the strange electronic scanner held in his hand, the image of a body inset with another on its screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s17.postimg.org/w8lq37q1b/5s_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s17.postimg.org/w8lq37q1b/5s_TXT....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some dusky hot stuff coming your way,\" he reports, speaking cool and quiet into his cell. \"Hot on the outside at least, as a C-set skin. Looks like someone's wearing her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Ryan. Called me earlier, told me he'd be coming like that. He's used this face before, likes to borrow it when in town. Keep sharp; last thing we want us Anderson having tailed our recruiter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line clicks dead. The man in the truck sighs, and returns to his vigil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see why you're so attached to her. What did you say her name was? Elena?\u201d The speaker is as blank and unassuming as the agent you're pretending to be. He's perhaps in his mid-30s, with a face that doesn't look out of place in this run-down area of town. You smile, and pose as you saw the agent do earlier, twirling your hands in an exotic pose as you shake your stolen body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would like your fortune read, yes?\u201d You say, playing heavy on Elena's accent. Your new compatriot laughs and takes the bags from you, setting them down on a soiled, busted mattress slumped in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, who do we have in here?\u201d He's strictly business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your back to him, closing the door behind you. This impersonation isn't going to hold too long, you realize. The best you can do is answer as close to the truth as possible, get your answers, and get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe red's got a couple of skins I'm borrowing for later. Told you, I'm going to talk to Anderson at midnight.\u201d This is the best you can come up with; you don't know the details of their plans other than what you've heard. You can only guess as to their intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s8.postimg.org/5p8un6yz9/6ss_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s8.postimg.org/5p8un6yz9/6ss_TXT....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d your 'boss' says, unzipping the blue bag. \u201cAnd these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis girlfriend, Jessica. Her mom, Denise Hunt.\u201d Elena's Eastern European accent chips away at the names, distorting them with elegant pronunciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pulls up the blonde locks of Jessica, tugging her head out of the bag and letting it hang grotesquely. \u201cSo this is sweet Jessica Hunt, huh? Might be an idea to put a new recruit inside her, just in case something goes wrong. Got one downstairs, keeping an eye on the street.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d you agree, even if you are inwardly repelled by the suggestion he just made: that someone should be walking around as Jessica. You're still not even sure what kind of operation he's running here. You know it's not connected to your 'recruitment'; he invited the impostor to come and check out whatever he was up to. At least now you know there are two of them: this asshole, and his friend in the street. You wonder if that was the prostitute you saw, and her face was just another elaborate disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to speak and get some answers when he begins talking to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what's the verdict? What Type?\u201d The man is still focused on Jessica's head, her beautiful features like a melted candle in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry?\u201d You bid for time, pretending you didn't hear. Your hand slides toward the pens stored out of sight. The pens you stole earlier. You'll shoot if you have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said 'what Type'? For Anderson?\u201d The man turns, looking at you intently, his body suddenly coiled, as if ready to strike. Something about your manner seems to have set him on edge. You search for a clue as to what answer he wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's lips curl into a snarl. \u201cIf you're really Ryan, you know exactly what I mean. And I'm going to need an answer. Or I'll fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s7.postimg.org/ky97lzwtn/7s_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s7.postimg.org/ky97lzwtn/7s_TXT.j...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's see who you really are!\"</span></div></div>",

I can just shoot you and fucking find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pen doesn't give memories,\" you say, defiantly. Your opponent chuckles, waving the pen at you, his hands clenched tight around Elena's head. \"This one does,\" he states. \"Now what's it going to be? The easy way, or the hard way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in no mood to take the easy way. You dash for the door. You're surprised you don't crumble after a few steps. Already Elena's skin feels loose on you, her dress awkward, her movements inexact. The more you move, the more it feels like you're wearing a costume. You panic, and burst down the stairs, stumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s24.postimg.org/66qg1jr8l/9s_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s24.postimg.org/66qg1jr8l/9s_TXT....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the room, the 'boss' simply picks up his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Anderson,\" he says, almost bored. \"Coming your way. Bring him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the green truck's cab, the agent ends the call, opening the door and slipping out. He walks toward the building with a slow, metronomic gait. As he does so, he pulls out a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the door open downstairs. You hear the noise in the apartment above. You hear footsteps, slow and methodical, on the stairs below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s2.postimg.org/mz05qlgy1/10s_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s2.postimg.org/mz05qlgy1/10s_TXT....</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around, wondering where you're going to go. There's a door, but you can hear grunting sounds coming from within... it sounds like two people. Even if you did zap them and change, there's no way you'd be able to convince your pursuers that you're not an impostor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, there's the window. You can see a rooftop opposite, across a small alleyway. All you'd need to do is crawl through, muster enough courage, and jump...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Up is out of the question, and so is down. That leaves the door... you just hope that there's only one person inside. You slip out of Elena's skin and dress, leaving it on the floor in a desperate hope that it'll slow them down. Then, scared about what you're going to encounter, you burst through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight causes you to freeze in position, a little startled as you slam the door behind you. The prostitute from earlier is inside with her customer, by the looks of things in the middle of a session. You can see the look of delirium on the man's face as he lies, chained to the bed, a thick black leather mask over the top of his face. His cries of ecstasy continue as the woman from earlier, wearing little more than her profession's attire, leans over him, straddling his legs. She backs up the moment the door slams, turning in shock as she looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://postimg.org/image/656urdukj\" target=\"_blank\">http://postimg.org/image/656urdukj</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't hesitate. The red glow of the black pen casts a shadow over the room. The ecstatic groans continue, along with a sudden flapping as the body falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groans stop suddenly. The man seems confused, listening out from behind his blindfold, trying to work out what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe? What's up?\" he asks, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Time's up, lover,\" her husky voice replies. Only she isn't saying it. In the few seconds you've had, you quickly grabbed her head, pulling it over yours. Her white skin, almost ghostly pale, encases yours, while her hair, a violent, vibrant red bob, dances around your new neck. You quickly trace your hands across your new chin, making sure the disguise is in place before pulling the body toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soon?\" The man sounds disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... oh yeah. You're too much for me, tiger.\" You glide yourself into the disguise, feet slipping in to position, hands following, pulling the taught body up, cupping your now-firm handful of breasts to make sure they're perfect. With a final wiggle of your shoulders, you become your new disguise utterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://postimg.org/image/3xeq408i5\" target=\"_blank\">http://postimg.org/image/3xeq408i5</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I buy another half-hour?\" The man sounds desperate. \"At least finish where we left off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly slip on your clothes, as minimal as they are, and climb onto the bed. Then you point another pen at yourself.</span></div></div>",

And I've got other clients a'waitin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trace a fingernail, sharpened delicately, across his throat, then climb off. There's noise on the stairwell. You take a quick breath. Showtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing open the door. \"What's going on out here, hmm?\" you purr, in your perfect Vicki impersonation. The agent of the boss is staring at the Elena suit, out on the landing. He spins round as you give him a sultry smile, then a look of confusion and horror as you sight the clothes on the floor. Vicki's instincts for this part of town say you don't ask questions here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent looks at you. For a moment he looks about ready to fire, as if he knows you've taken on a new guise. But then he sees the John inside, without his mask. He seems to take forever as he studies you, then decides you're who you appear to be. There's no way you could replace a prostitute without her client seeing, is there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" he snaps at you. \"Get the fuck back inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s29.postimg.org/6959ldpfr/14s_TXT.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://s29.postimg.org/6959ldpfr/14s_TXT...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,OK...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as Vicki would, and close the door.

Every so often you pause and dip in to your purse, pulling out Phoebe's compact and staring at your reflection. You smile. You blow kisses. You give a cheeky wink as if you were a 1940s pin-up. You revel in Phoebe's classic style, the pearl necklace bouncing lightly against breasts well concealed in a simple sun dress. Your curls and bow sit perfectly on your head, as you survey the world around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a shopping mall, but no longer for goods. You're not interested in the clothes, or the games, or even the more high-priced goods. Instead, you're looking at people. Lives you could borrow for a time. You could be anyone, do anything. You could zap that man over there, pepper-grey hair and thin beard, and use his money to eat your dinner at the finest restaurant in town. Or you could shoot the woman in the beauticians getting a pedicure, with oversized breasts and silicone lips. You could seduce and enchant, or simply walk into the life of someone and enjoy it to the full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's what Jimmy would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy, the prankster. The one who just wants to have fun. He doesn't even see the real potential of what this means. The ability to be anyone, to act like anyone, to adopt their identity utterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the most powerful gift in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap your stolen nails against the glass of the automatic door as you exit the mall, heading straight for Phoebe's car. You've got big plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slip in the small cab, you turn on the radio and close your blushed eyes. You know everything to be Phoebe. You could go home to your girlfriend and your cats, or you could go to your studio and pick up your photography equipment, which would give you access to even more potential options. Or you could just take route one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy thought about pranks, you're thinking about riches. You could step into the shoes of a bank employee, and rob it. You could even just walk into a bank and empty an account - Phoebe has several thousand saved away. But why stop there? You could run the town if you want. The mayor, Tina Chan, holds a weekend drop-in. You could always borrow her life for a short while. A taste of power could do you good. Or perhaps you could borrow the life of a celebrity? There's a concert tonight Trish was talking about, or perhaps you could do something even more wild. You had considered going to that sci-fi convention just out of town. What better way to cosplay than to be someone else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, what about revenge? You and Jimmy aren't the most popular kids in school. You've had your fair share of rejection and humiliation. Fellow students, and even teachers, have made your life hell. Why not use this to get revenge? Principal Collins seems to have had it out for you. What if he suddenly found his wife was sleeping around, or had put laxatives in his evening meal? Or why stop there? The football team seem to think nothing can touch them. Why not become a cop and show them some justice? There's always a police cruiser parked outside the coffee shop in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and grin Phoebe's radiant smile. You know exactly what you're going to do.</span></div></div>",

You look into her eyes in the rear view mirror, and chuckle. \"Oh, Phoebe,\" you sigh. \"You're perfect in so many ways. But for revenge, you're not quite perfect enough. Just the first step in a wider plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rap your painted nails along the steering wheel as you consider your next play. As it happens, regardless of who you're going to take on, the plan is the same. You need a new identity, and Phoebe - or specifically her car - is going to get it for you. You rev the engine again and pile on the power, tires screaming as you make a turn onto the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two options for your next move. The football team are playing tonight. You have a whole host of strategies for taking them down a peg or two. You could take over one of the cheerleader squad and distract them, or become the coach or quarterback and ruin the plays. But part of you wonders if you should just shut them down early, sneak a sedative into their water bucket, or mess around with their kit in the locker room. As anybody from the janitor to one of the team, you could do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then there's Collins. His wife is an equally attractive possibility. Miranda Collins is well known in your school: a classic blonde bombshell, perfect shape and voluminous blonde locks. She raised eyebrows once when the school found the principal's online photo account, and took everyone's breath away as she was dressed as Marylin Munroe at a costume party. Collins did his best to have revenge on the students that found the account. And given that was you and Jimmy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and pile on the speed. 70...80...90. You're now at the limits of Phoebe's car, and you're laughing as you consider your revenge. Ms Franklin was always talking about the 'Ring of Gyges', and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. Well, this is absolute power. And a little corruption, to either Collins' or the football team's life, would be a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dashboard flashes blue, and you hear the wail of a siren behind you. Phoebe's eyes sparkle, and you chuckle, slowing the car down. Elegantly you straighten your dress and preen your hair as you pull over on the darkest stretch of road you can find. The sun's beginning to set, and you wait patiently as the officer pulls up behind you. The shadow begins to walk toward you, a flashlight in hand, which shines straight in your face. You blink for a few seconds, and look at the uniformed figure standing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not officer O'Sullivan, the only member of the local police department you know. It's much, much better. The officer is Hispanic, with long black hair tied up in a ponytail, strong features and large, pouting lips that are curled in irritation. You study the woman's shape under her uniform, admiring her athletic physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, officer?\" You chuckle. \"Tail light out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"License and registration, m'am.\" The officer says, barely restraining her irritation. You reach for your purse, and the pens within it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You say, before there is a short glow, and the sound of something falling to the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Julieta Suarez. <i>Officer</i> Julieta Suarez, as you straighten your uniform, and fasten your belt, handcuffs, baton, to your waist. You feel your new chest expand against the bullet proof vest, and walk back to the squad car, letting a confused Phoebe drive away. Calmly, you take your new seat, smiling with pouting lips as you 'accidentally' delete the latest files from the squad car's video record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have two options. Either you can head to the local stadium and mess with the football team - you could slip into another disguise, or even pull over the team on the way there and mess with them that way. Or you can head back to the station. You remember hearing that the delightful Mrs Collins works as a file clerk at the local police precinct. And now, as the trusted officer Suarez, you have easy access to the entire precinct...</span></div></div>",

Do you even know their first names?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a plan that does have its merits; with their names, you probably know enough about them to impersonate them reasonably. And the bodies are worth it, too. Martinez is a Latina who could have been a model or movie star; every guy in your class practically drools over her. Franklin on the other hand couldn't be more different. Short, mouse-brown hair, thick glasses, always so meek. You're amazed she's going on the party at all. But the idea of going wild in that shy shell is appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jimmy nods, walking over to the escalators. \u201cHannah Franklin and Julia Martinez. It's a pretty simple switch. We'll just wear our current looks underneath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, I want them back as they were,\u201d you say, meaning Jessica and her mother. Nobody is paying attention to your conversation; to everyone else it just looks like a classic mother-daughter fight in a mall. \u201cTonight, young lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy snorts and rolls his eyes, just like Jessica when she's in one of her moods. \u201cFine, Mom, whatever. We'll restore them when we get to the hotel room, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, Denise Hunt's hair bouncing around your neck. \u201cVery well. Now, let's pay that shop a visit, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine by me. Though what kind of mall has a bridal shop, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea; it's not like you've ever considered it. \u201cThis kind, I guess. How are we going to switch? We can't swap with the assistant \u2013 what if the dress needs a change? I don't know how to do that. And I'm not going to wait through a fitting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into the shop through the doors, the display room discreet behind a window display. \u201cLooks like we don't have to,\u201d Jimmy says, pointing inside. Four women are inside, checking out their dresses. Franklin is centre stage in her wedding dress, and \u2013 despite her glasses \u2013 looks stunning. As always, Ms Martinez's legs make you drool, and she looks incredible in her bridesmaid outfit. The other two women you don't recognise. One is taller than the others - slightly curvy with dirty blonde hair. The other is a stunning redhead, hair a long shower of curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho's it going to be?\u201d Jimmy asks. \u201cYou pick two.\u201d He passes you the pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, we're going in?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow's the perfect time, Mom. Let's get you a new look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy's right \u2013 the assistant is busy and the women are heading back to the changing rooms. With utter confidence, Jessica's body saunters into the boutique and slips, unnoticed, after them. You follow, entering the changing rooms just as the group vanish into their individual booths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's face grins. Jimmy's given you the choice of who to zap, both for you and him. You could zap Franklin or Martinez, and either be the hottest woman in school or a shy lady about to go wild before getting married. You don't know enough about the other women yet to pick them. So, you'll be one teacher, Jimmy the other. The question is: who do you want to be?</span></div></div>",

It might be better to bring in someone you trust.  Someone a little more trustworthy than Jimmy but also wild enough to use the pens for a little fun.  The trip isn't long and before you know it, Jessica is ringing on Trish's doorbell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish answers the door.  She's hot, sweaty and wearing a sports bra; its clear that she just got off the treadmill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Jessica,\" she spots you and adds \"And hi Mrs Hunt.  What can I do for you two?\"  She asks with a little puzzlement in her voice.  It's not too normal for Jess to turn up on her doorstep.

To turn up with her mum is not something that would happen too often.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just in the neighbourhood and we wanted to show you something cool.\"  Jessica has a very Jimmy-esque grin on her face but Trish hasn't seemed to notice anything odd.  She looks a little puzzled but invites the two of you in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like anything to drink Mrs Hunt?  My mum is out for a bit and won't be back for a while.\"  Trish has always been a polite girl, maybe a little wild when she's around friends but she's always had manners.  To her surprise, Jessica invites her up to the bedroom too and explains that Denise is part of the 'something cool'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you stand in Trish's bedroom.  It's pretty neat and tidy; despite her wild exterior, Trish has a bit of an OCD thing when it comes to cleanliness.  Clearly though, she has no idea what you're doing there as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude do you want to or should I?\" Jessica asks \"Bah whatever, I'll do it.\" she says without waiting for a response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same concentrated expression crosses her face as she moves her hands to the back of her head.  There's a ripping sound as Jessica's beautiful face deforms and deflates.  Trish's expression turns ashen as the opening becomes wider and wider until Jimmy's head pops deflated head of your girlfriend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.  What the hell is that!\" Trish exclaims \"What the bloody hell just happens.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the exact same reaction I had...\" you comment, \"Now could you get out of my girlfriend Jimmy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend... you must be David!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy proceeds to tell Trish the story from the start.  How he found these magic pens in his attic and had tested them out.  It eventually culminated in him taking Jessica's identity to fool you and draft you into this whole people costume 'club'.  By the end of his story, Jimmy has proceeded to slip himself back into the deflated head and resumed his guise of your girlfriend, must to your chagrin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish, for her part, takes this surprisingly well and responds by teasing the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, so you like older women huh?\" she addresses at you.  \"And you.  Are you gay?  Seriously, what guy decides to wear his best friend's girlfriend and then cock tease him?  I know you like pranks dude but seriously, that's kinda messed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looks down embarrassed and mutters something about Jessica being pretty or something to that extent.  Trish looks triumphant as Jimmy strips out of Jessica's skin and you out of Denise's.  You didn't have to take it off but you figure there was no point staying in character now that everyone was on the same page.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She shakes her head and giggles as her hair falls across her face in a messy blonde web. She cups her chin in fake surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at me, I'm Jessica, aren't I so beautiful? Blurgh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a light shove on her shoulder. \"That's still my girlfriend.\" You observe. Trish turns around, slowly, much more able to mimic Jessica than Jimmy. If anything this is more disconcerting: she seems to be having a lot of fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you haven't broken up with me? Oh, David, I thought you wanted my mother!\" Jessica's body grabs you and squeezes. She's fully dressed - Trish insisted on you two 'idiots' leaving the room for her to get changed. You grapple under her hug, and she backs off, laughing. \"Ha! This is awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you,\" Denise Hunt says from the door, combing her bob-cut hair with a brush Jimmy purloined from the bathroom. While Jessica was getting 'changed', Jimmy decided to slip into the only other skin available, and has been enjoying himself, it seems: while her skirt is on, Denise's blouse buttons are undone and her generous cleavage is exposed. She grips them with her painted nails. \"You know, older women ain't bad at all either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a dick, Jimmy,\" Trish says, Jessica's expression one of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jimmy is all fake innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're messed up is what. For starters, get dressed properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point? It's not actually my body, and we all know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a respect thing,\" you offer, slumped on the bed, watching this strange pantomime unfold: your two friends wearing your girlfriend and her mother. Jessica turns to you and beams her pearl-white smile. The relaxed posture is all Trish - Jessica carries herself with far more class - but that smile is perfect. Jimmy stands on the door, one hand on his slightly filled hip, the other wagging at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you lecture me, young lady! I am your mother!\" Neither of you find it funny. Trish just bows Jessica's head, raises an eyebrow, and looks a little disappointed. Jimmy, as usual, backs down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Trish-as-Jessica flops down next to you, nudging you as Trish would. \"What's the plan with this? We can't just sit around in my room all day. For one thing, it's not my room anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we go to the mall,\" Jimmy piped up. \"That way we can pick and choose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it with you and this mall idea?\" You ask. It's the second time he has brought it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I just think we might find some good candidates to be for a night. Think about it dudes.\" Mrs Hunt's body walks over and hops down on Jessica's bed, her easy familiarity at complete odds with the body of a 39-year-old woman. \"Right now, I'm the only one of us who isn't a teenager. I can get into places that you can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think the <i>mall</i> is the best place for new faces?\" Jessica's lips sneer. \"You really are a teenager. Think about the places we could go. I was going to see Analytical Engine tonight. They're a fucking cool band. Jessica likes them too. But with that little device, we could head over there early and get ourselves some backstage passes - even entry into the afterparty. We could party with Riley Lovelace... hell, I could <i>be</i> Riley Lovelace; she's fucking awesome. Just have to wait for her to finish her set, hide in her dressing room and shoot her. Or if that doesn't appeal, why not head to the basketball game tonight? No problem with front row tickets now. Still thinking small? We find head to one of the mansions in town and sample the lifestyles of the rich and famous for a bit. We could wing it with our parents we're on a camping trip or something. There's so many options. And you think of the fucking <i>mall</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a noise downstairs, like a car pulling up. Jessica's eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Look at the time!\" Jessica's fist punches you on the arm. \"You should have said something! I hadn't realized how long I'd been messing around with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You said your mom would be gone 'a while'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was. We've been up here for 'a while'. Fuck. What the hell do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise Hunt stands, waving the black pen. \"Oh, there's an easy solution for that, honey. You just wait here with David.\" At that, she virtually runs through the door, exposed bosom bouncing with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't! Not my fucking mother!\" Trish, as Jessica, pounds after him. There's the sound of a door opening, some kind of scuffle, raised voices. Angry, raised voices, debating what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Denise Hunt opens the door, a pile of skin and clothes in her hands. It looks exactly like Trish's mom, her shoulder-length locks hanging down across her face. \"Hey dude, fancy being Alyson O'Neil for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you fucking dare!\" You hear Jessica's voice echo up the stairs. Moments later, she's standing in the room too. \"You can't be my mom. I forbid it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't be such a hypocrite, <i>Jessica</i>.\" Denise Hunt scoffs. \"Besides, aren't your sisters going to be back later? We can't stick around here goofing off, and David needs a new face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just not my damn mother! David, I said no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a point about me being the only one without a skin...\" you chime in. You're not entirely sure the concept of being Alyson appeals, though. Being Denise was fun, but Alyson is a rather plain woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. We'll head out and get you one. To the concert, to the game, to a mansion. I don't care. Just... let's reinflate her, or whatever it's called; if you don't my sisters are going to wonder where the hell she is anyway. So return her to normal and let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or,\" Denise Hunt's body shrugs, \"slip her on and we can still do all of that. Just leave a note or something. Come on, dude, it will be fun.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's dark. You're cold, shivering in an alley out the back of a concert. Out of respect for Trish's wishes, her mom was returned to normal, dazed and confused in her living room. Jimmy had been eager to play-act as Denise, offering to even have coffee and a chat with Alyson, but it was clear Trish wasn't going to let him out of your sight, and if you had stuck around, Trish would have had to have been herself: leaving you as Jessica. The very thought made you uncomfortable. She's your girlfriend, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead you all headed off into town almost immediately: you, Mrs Hunt, and Jessica. As Jessica, Trish has already headed in to the packed concert venue with her ticket; the plan is for you to get her backstage somehow and meet up. Jimmy's promised to find a way inside for you, but you have no idea what that was supposed to mean. He left with the pen about fifteen minutes ago, disguised as Denise Hunt, and you've been hopping up and down outside, in the cold, wondering what he's planning. You wonder if he's bailed on you; it'd be like him to have found something else to occupy his time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, kid. Backstage passes only in the alley, move back to the queue.\u201d In front of you is a hulk of a man: thick beard and scarred face, a walking roadblock in a black security uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJimmy?\u201d you ask, uncertain. This could be his idea of a joke. Instead, the guard scowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d He's already moving forward now, shepherding you with his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... my friend Jimmy. I'm waiting for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I told you to wait somewhere else.\u201d The guard is now shoving you, pushing you back toward the main street and entrance. He doesn't look annoyed at you, just disinterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK! OK! Just stop shoving, all right?\u201d You begin to take a step back... only for the behemoth to burst into a grin you'd recognize anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJimmy! For... don't you know there are cameras around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot where I got this guy,\u201d he says, laughing a deep, resonating chuckle. \u201cNobody would have expected someone like Denise Hunt to be trying to sneak in, so when I explained I was lost, this guy volunteered to help. And he did. Now I'm the perfect Trojan Horse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what have you done with Mrs Hunt?\u201d You ask. You still feel you aren't on first name terms with your girlfriend's mother, and you don't want to think Jimmy's just discarded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, relax. I'm wearing her underneath. Turns out you can wear more than one skin at once, like a Russian doll or something. Cool, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreepy, is the word I would use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Come on, shrimp,\u201d Jimmy, as the guard, towers over you. \u201cLet's get you backstage, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the backstage area. It's crowded, people moving about with purpose, making final checks. There are roadies talking to each other with mics, checking the pyrotechnics one last time, moving guitars to the side. In the wings there is a small gaggle of people \u2013 friends of the band \u2013 watching the warm-up act perform. Music echoes through the area; music and the sound of a crowd hungry for spectacular entertainment. The place reeks of beer, sweat and stale cigarettes. Jimmy continues to push you along, leading you through the narrow confines. You pass a large table laden with booze, fruit and candies: the band's rider, you guess. He stops at a whitewashed door with a star on it, and raps three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d The voice is a woman's, a strong Californian accent shining through. Jimmy opens the door, and leads you through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is your standard dressing room, right down to the mirror with lightbulbs all around it. The table in front is filled with makeup and accessories, and along the walls is an extensive rack of clothes and outfits for the performance. Sat at the dresser, sipping what looks like herbal tea and honey, is possibly the most beautiful woman you've ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's curvy, in a way that reminds you of Marilyn Monroe, with a round, immaculate face with full cheeks - she could be anywhere from 25 to 35. Her sensuous lips are tainted black by lipstick and long, black eyebrows curving suggestively above expressive eyes darkened by expertly applied shadow. Her jet black hair hangs back in a flowing mane, perfecting contrasting a porcelain complexion that leads down to extensive, ornate tattoos on her arms. Her amble breasts are accentuated by a risqu\u00e9 black corset, tied with purple lace,which threads down toward fishnet stockings that shape her majestic thighs. She smiles at you, and you feel your trousers begin to tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Riley Lovelace says, relaxed and friendly, setting her tea down as she waits for you to speak. \u201cWhat's up, guys?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's more about what's about to go down,\u201d Jimmy laughs, shooting her with the black pen as he swings the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude!\u201d You hiss as quietly as you can as you watch the lead singer of Trish's favorite band deflate into little more than a costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Don't you want to get into that skin? It's about time you got to be someone else after Trish spoiled your fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride over to it, looking at the amazing face collapsed before you like a cheap Halloween mask, the exotic mass of long hair wildly drifting to the floor. Panic seizes you, not for the first time today. A cold mix of fear \u2013 at being caught and found out \u2013 and desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do want to slip into that skin and watch as her toned thighs replace your own. You want to feel the pull of her breasts, the tug of her hair, the cold metal sensation of her ear studs. You want to be adored by everyone in this building, purely for being who you are. You want to be, for a while at least, Riley Lovelace, lead singer of Analytical Engine, one of the coolest people in the world. You want to feel the restriction of her corset and long black gloves. Looking at the costumes in the rack behind you - changes for encores you guess - few leave much to the imagination, and the only one that does is a PVC bodysuit. Even her normal clothes,a red tartan miniskirt and purposefully ripped shirt thrown into the corner with careless abandon, aren't exactly modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one problem, dude.\u201d You point out, folding your arms. \u201cShe hasn't gone on stage yet. How the hell am I supposed to front a band I know practically nothing about? Jess and Trish are the fangirls, not me. There's no point being Riley Lovelace if I can't sing a single one of her damn songs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard's face takes on a characteristically Jimmy smirk as he pulls out another pen \u2013 this time brown \u2013 and waves it in the air. \u201cYou know, dude, I think that's what this might be for...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Hurry up, Riley, it's time to be you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helps you separate the costume that had been Riley Lovelace from the clothes Riley had been wearing, and soon you're putting yourself inside her. Your erection conveniently vanishes inside your Riley crotch. Soon the former Jimmy is stretching the hollow Riley head over yours, and the moment your body is entirely hers you feel a wave of Riley Lovelace memories flow into your mind, and your very self being remade into hers. \"You could have waited a minute,\" you complain in perfect Riley tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every minute counts, Miz Lovelace,\" he says, not sounding at all like Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put from your mind your David thoughts and let yourself be entirely Riley. You're a little annoyed at having to dress again. There's just a hint of pre-performance jitters, but no more than usual for the woman you now are. You finish dressing.</span></div></div>",

You smile, flicking a hair back into place, posing as Riley always does; it was no accident how you saw just enough thigh to get a rush of attraction when you entered the room. She knows the importance of always looking and acting the part; after all, why else would Debra Holgensen change her name to Riley Lovelace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be Gem, the reporter who's following the tour,\" you intone precisely, enjoying being the true queen bee of this performance. \"She usually swings by about twenty minutes before I go on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your voice. \"Yeah?\" you call out, echoing Riley's earlier pitch exactly. The door opens, and a waif of a woman slips in. This, Riley's memories tell you, is Gemma Beck, fresh out of college and eager to impress some music website editor and get a break in journalism. Riley agreed to take her along, partly because she's cute - Riley, it turns out, is bisexual, and from her memories a shameless flirt at times - and partly because she sees something in Gemma that most wouldn't: hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Gem,\" you grin, flicking your neck to beckon her in. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not interrupting, am I?\" Gemma has a notebook in hand. You wrinkle your nose as Riley would. It's all an act with her; she's being deliberately disarming, even if she's on full guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Just going over some security stuff. There anything else, uh... Dave, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. And no, Miz Lovelace. I'll go get that friend you mentioned.\" Pointedly, Jimmy drops the pens on the dresser. You assume he's going to bring Trish backstage too. \"Though she might need a costume change.\" The security guard grins, and walks through the door, no doubt to pull the same 'freeze, punk' prank on Trish that he did on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGemma turns and looks confused. \"What costume change? You got something planned for the show tonight, Miz Lo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, just as Riley would. \"How many times? Gem, it's OK. Call me Riley. And no, he's getting his wires crossed. I've got a friend from the area coming to the show tonight, but they're coming straight from work. She's asked if she can borrow something a little less formal, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, totally.\" From outside, you can hear the riffs of the support band burst louder. Riley's brain tells you their set-list is almost complete - which means you'll be on stage soon enough. \"So,\" another Gem question. \"Are you nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always. It's no fun if you're not. The sensation of nerves, dribbling up and down your spine? The rush of your blood as your heart thumps and that sweet adrenaline kicks in? It's a blast. That's what people come to see. They want to see a show where you're a livewire, just riding high on their hopes, dreams and desires.They want you to make them forget, hon. And when people want that much, it's got to make you nervous. Because that's the only way you'll get it perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley's tongue slips smooth over the words, her beautiful face mesmerizing the young woman on assignment. In your costume, you feel as if you could twist anyone around your finger. Weirdly, that's exactly Riley's thoughts too - the makeup, the corset and leggings are all just a role to her. But Gemma seems to swallow it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" she says, finishing taking her note. Next, she casts her eye to the pens. \"So what are those? Part of the act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you take the black one, just in case an accident happens, and slip it into your palm. \"You could say that,\" you tease. </span></div></div>",

I make a better Jessica than...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up a finger to silence him. Something about Riley's body just commands respect when she wants, and you use all of her inherent charisma to silence him. \"Not a chance. You're already wearing her mom and a security guard. Why don't you beat it and return them to normal, leave us girls to get changed, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Jimmy grabs the pens from you. \"I'll get out of this guy. Can't really get out of Denise yet, we can't restore her to normal at a concert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's got a point. You need to think about restoring people in a way that can at least be explained. If you're going to become Riley Lovelace permanently - and, sliding her perfectly manicured nails around the top of the corset, you can barely contain your interest in doing so - you need to leave no traces of what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then?\" Trish has paused undressing, and is looking at Jimmy expectantly. She's still Trish, entirely, and wants her privacy. Oddly, now that you're a woman, you presence doesn't seem to bother her at all. Jimmy rubs his tuft of beard, and shifts the massive frame of the security guard out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, dudes! I'll be back in ten when I've returned this guy to normal and found someone else to be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy heads off, and you turn to Trish, a filthy, flirty grin curving over your lips: pure Riley Lovelace. \"Let's get you in to someone more comfortable,\" you pur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnalytical Engine is a band with rituals. Riley's is to check her makeup, her hair, her costume - make sure everything, from every angle, is perfect. She calculates exactly how much cleavage a crowd can see - just enough to tantalize and drive them wild. Every aspect of the performance is stage-managed, from her image to the set pieces; the band's lead guitarist, a Chinese-American girl called 'Nessa, coordinates the light and pyrotechnics to transform the set into a blur of colors. It's frenetic music combined with precise art to create an unforgettable show. You look in the mirror and stare hard into the eyes of Riley Lovelace. There's no trace of David, no gateway to your true soul. In five minutes you're going on stage, and you're going to rock this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geesh, this Gemma is tiny, isn't she?\" You turn slowly, flicking your long, flowing locks over your shoulder. Behind you, Trish is pulling the mask of Gem's head over her own, the last of her much-larger body vanishing into the reporter. Jessica, meanwhile, is piled up in the corner. You're still waiting for Jimmy to return with the pens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to think of her as cute,\" you say, sliding over. Riley's lust for Gemma's naked body clouds your mind, intoxicating you a little. You'd have preferred Gemma to be Jessica, but Trish will do at a snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Trish frowns, shaking her head as she reaches for Gemma's clothes, slipping them on. \"Is that you, or Riley talking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all the same, now,\" you shrug. You have no intention of leaving this wild, exotic life of the ultimate rock chick. You're adored by millions, comfortably wealthy, and so stunningly attractive you've had photo shoots for major magazines, not just the music press. \"I'm Riley Lovelace. And this is my show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You're David. Wearing a woman as a fucking suit. Don't think you're keeping it that way. Think about what that means, David. It's tantamount to murder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to answer, Riley's mouth open to reply, when the door opens with a knock. A young Asian woman's head - her hair an elaborate, hair-sprayed birdsnest of vivid red hair - sticks through the door. She's not conventionally attractive, but she's worked at her small face with makeup. A lollipop stick hangs languidly from her red-painted lips. This, your false memories tell you, is Vanessa Zhou, your lead guitarist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Riley,\" she says in a thick Californian twang. \"You ready to... oh shit!\" Her head pops behind the door again as she glances at the half-dressed Gemma. You're glad she didn't get far enough to see the pile of Jessica in the corner. \"Fuck, you guys should leave a 'do not disturb' sign or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's cheeks, or rather the sweet Gemma's, flush with embarrassment. Riley, you know, would laugh at this, and you let her best, dirty snicker free into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were having an interview, \" you say. \"Full disclosure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no shit.\" You can tell that 'Nessa, while hardly a prude - she usually hooks up with a guy after the show - disapproves. She feels a little protective of Gemma, and has been watching Riley enjoy the game of seduction all tour. It's not that 'Nessa is against any potential relationship. It's just that she knows Riley will drop Gemma and find someone else to tease the moment the tour ends. \"Look, get your game-face on. Cassie's already started her pre-gig puke session. We're on in three minutes.\" Cassie Lewinski, the band's drummer, always throws up before a gig. It's her way of getting rid of the nerves. 'Nessa prefers to smoke a little something, and Riley... Riley just enjoys the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right. I've finished my vocal exercises.\" Riley's double-entendre comes out slow and seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well my fingers are nice and relaxed.\" 'Nessa Zhou gives as good as she gets, even if she's straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish, meanwhile, has finished putting on Gemma's clothes, and ruffles her hair, listening to your jibes. A quick glance at her breaks your Riley persona, and you wonder what happened to Jimmy. Is he pretending to be the guitarist? Or has he found someone else? If Cassie always throws up before a gig, it would almost be too easy for him to replace her, you suppose.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another knock on the door.  A young woman with short platinum blonde hair strides through the door and places an arm around 'Nessa, grinning with delight.  Those memories that you so graciously appropriated from the form you're wearing tells you that this is Cassie Lewinski, the band's tough looking drummer.  Cassie's short platinum hair and heavy eyeliner make her look quite the tomboy and her manner of dress reflects this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You busting on my vomiting again 'Nessy?\" she drawls.  Even if she acts tough and puts on her a strong Southern accent, Riley knows this is just an act.  The vomiting was an old left-over habit from back when Cassie was a beauty pageant contestant; an activity forced upon her by her overbearing mother.  The whole cutting her hair and running away from home thing was an act of rebellion against her teenage days.  When the members of Ani-E finally found out about Cassie's past, they never hesitated to badger her about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God woman, get a mint or something.\"  'Nessa went to push away her band mate; whose mouth obviously smelt like vomit but found Cassie holding only tightly.  \"What's that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you saw the black pen grasped in Cassie's hand as it fired point blank into Vanessa Zhou, turning her into a pile of skin and clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck dude,\" exclaimed Gemma, \"Stop fucking doing that?\"  For her part, Cassie had a giant Jimmy-esque grin plastered across her face.  She picked up the fallen guitarist and handed the skin to Trish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up dude, concert starts in 20.  You don't want to keep the fans waiting do you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy's plan finally clicks into place.  He wants the three of you to go up on stage and perform as Trish and Jessica's favourite band.  Analytical Engine.  The thought is incredibly arousing to you; to replace basically the entire band and play in their stead without anyone realising.  The thought of it excites you to no end.  For her part, Trish seems to be giving it some real thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\"  Trish grabs the skin and starts slipping into it without taking off Gem first.  You glance over at Jessica's discarded skin in the corner.  Cassie has obviously noticed you and shakes her head.  It'll take too long to explain to her what's happened.  You're inclined to agree.  After all, the last thing she'll remember is probably meeting Jimmy right before he zapped her and wore her like a cheap suit....  restoring her here would just confuse the hell out of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish eases into Nessa's skin without a problem.  Even before Jimmy zaps her with the brown pen to give her all of the guitarist's memories, she was acting almost exactly like her.  It must've been all the fangirling and the fact that Nessa is Trish's favourite member of the band.  In any case, you're pretty sure Trish is living her dream right now.  It's time to make that dream a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe band is amazing.  The three of you up on stage playing your hearts out.  You sing without missing a beat.  To your left is 'Nessa, currently being worn by Trish who plays better than your Riley memories tell you she's ever played.  Jimmy plays his role as Cassie flawlessly.  Of course, you can't take all the credit, that little brown pen which granted all of you the memories and mannerisms of your skinsuits is to blame but even so, the crowd adores you.  Ani-E blows them away and they scream in delight.  No one, not even Matt the bassist can tell that three of the four members are imposters.  It's the half-time mark and the members make their way backstage for a quick breather and a costume change.  You're huffing and puffing from all the singing but that sensation of being watched, cheered and worshiped by the thousands of fans outside; it's not a feeling you think you want to give up.  The euphoria makes you ecstatic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you kick back in Riley's dressing room.  There's about twenty minutes to get changed but your memories tell you it'll take less than 5.  Plenty of time to enjoy the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy fucking shit dude,\" says Trish, breaking character to express herself.  \"That was probably the highlight of my fucking life.  Nothing is ever going to top that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even like Ani-E that much, but I have to agree.\"  Cassie chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies ladies,\" you tease, \"don't get your panties in a bunch.  We've still got another half to get through.\"  You don't really know what's going to happen afterwards.  Trish's or rather Gemma's voice echoes through your head - 'it's tantamount to murder...'  A few more hours won't really matter will they?  Even a few more days?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\"  Nessa starts to say, looking over in the corner of the room.  Jessica's crumpled skin is missing.  It's only then that you realise that you'd forgotten to lock the door in your excitement to get on stage.  Thankfully Jimmy had hidden the pens in Cassie's pant pockets; neither you nor Nessa could fit them in your tight clothes.  The fact remains that your girlfriend's skin is now missing.  Who had come in here?  Why did they steal Jessica's skin?  Had they just taken it or were they wearing her form outside somewhere?  It's unlikely that the thief knew anything about Jessica's life; they didn't have the brown pen after all.  All they would know is that they found the skin of a pretty blonde girl in the dressing room of Riley Lovelace, a world-renown singer. </span></div></div>",

Riley Lovelace, the person whose life you are currently inhabiting, wouldn't just shirk her responsibilities to her fans and skip out on a concert and neither can you.  As difficult as it is, the show must go on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go show this town what it means to ROCK!\"  Your friends amazed at your resolve but after some brief resistance from Trish, the three of you plus your drummer head out on stay for the second half.  The concert is no less amazing in the second half as the first, the entire band plays their hearts out and no one but your best friends notice that Riley is a little more subdued that usual.  You do, of course, have your girlfriend's safety in the back of your mind as you pump out those tunes.  Nonetheless, Ani-E blows away its fans and no one is the wiser that most of the band are not who they appear to be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three of you retire to yours, or rather, Riley's dressing room, you're all tired beyond belief.  It has been an amazing experience but it's now time to track down Jessica's missing skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look!\" Nessa is there with a note of some sort in her hand.  You snatch it hastily and read its contents.  For some reason, you can't exactly place the handwriting even though you know you've seen it before.  There was short message written on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed.  Come around to the back room if you want to find Jessica again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to be told twice.  After explaining the note to the others, you rush off to the room mentioned in the note.  Not knowing what you'll find, your mind is a mess.  What was going on?  Was this all a test?  Why would they take Jessica's skin and more importantly, what had they done with it?  The last question was answered as soon as you opened the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you opened the door, your Riley memories told you what it was.  It was a mostly unused storage room filled with big boxes of something.  You didn't know because Riley hadn't cared enough to worry about the logistics of the concerts or moving arrangements.  However, sitting atop one of these large boxes was Jessica, legs crossed and wearing one of Riley's tight outfits.  She looked stunning, the form fitting silver dress hugging her form snugly and the corset underneath accentuating her natural beauty.  It was a testament to Jessica's looks that she looked as at home in Riley's dress as she did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush towards her, almost certain that she's an imposter; a suspicion that's confirmed when she raises a black pen towards you as a warning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh, no sudden movements.\"  There's an unusual look on her face, a mixed combination of Jessica's usual coy smile and another's cheeky grin.  But this was no playful warning; you could sense malice in her glare.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the deal,\" stated Jessica mechanically, \"The way I see it, I give you two choices.  One, you return to your happy but dull life.  My associates and I will erase the memories of you and your friends but you will remember one important fact.  The fact that these pens exist.  You will dread every person you meet, you will question every private moment that you spend with Jessica here.  You won't even know if your family is even your own.  And trust me, no one will ever believe you if you told them.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't much of a choice...  And the other choice?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join us.  Your skills have impressed us from the moment you took over Denise Hunt's life and moved on to Riley, we have been impressed by your adaptability and flexibility to take on any role convincingly.

Miles off-the-record, but you know the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it Miz... Riley!\" Gemma exclaims as she bounces out of the dressing room. As soon as Jimmy closed the door behind her, you get to work stripping out of the rockstar's skin. Gemma will have the scoop of her career by living a night as the rock goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing man?\" Jimmy worries aloud as you feel up that naked body one for time. \"I was hoping I'd get to wear that cute little reporter.\" The thought of the giant bodyguard squeezing into Gemma's petite form makes you laugh, but your brain is refocused after you remove Riley's head and her thoughts drift out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait Jimmy, don't worry.\" You assure Jimmy, smiling with a plan up your sleeve... well skin. Jimmy huffs and stands back at the door at the sound of Gemma bolting down the hall with some more beers. You're still buck naked when she opens the door. And the first thing you do as Jimmy grabs her in is fire the black pen directly at her. She deflates in Jimmy's monstrous arms. Jimmy's bodyguard reflexes catch the beers before they spill onto the floor, silent in their plastic cups. Jimmy is very confused when you strip Gemma's body. She is very cute. About 5'5\" red head with mousy glasses and a preppy style. But now you can see her generous... assets and you want them for yourself. You see Jimmy sporting quite a boner in his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jimmy can pounce into the suit, you dramatically shoot it with the black pen again. Jimmy is rather confused, but his eyes grow wide as you reach into the empty skin of Gemma to pull out an identical copy of that skin on the inside. There's now two Gemma suits. By shooting the suit, you make another suit inside of it. You were planning on letting Jimmy wear it, but for your plan to work, you need the remnants of Riley's memory. You quickly get dressed in Gemma's jeans, blouse, and converses. You shoot yourself with the brown pen and gain yet another set of memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's time for part two of your plan. You gently place the other gemma suit inside the riley suit. You're careful to get all the fingers and toes in the night places. Then you zip up Gemma. As soon as she expands in size, you zip up the Riley suit on top. You pop out of the door, grabbing the door beers as Jimmy quickly clothes the dazed rockstar. The first thing the new Riley sees is her old body entering the room with the beers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could pull it off,\u201d you say, gesturing at Riley\u2019s deflated body.  \u201cThe songs, the clothes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get cut off when the door to Riley\u2019s dressing room opens.  Both you and Jimmy\u2019s heads snap round to look at the interloper - A young Asian woman.  Her hair is dyed a vivid and artificial shade of red and piled up in an artfully constructed mess almost as big again as her head.  Almost every strand is carefully and deliberately placed, giving lie to the almost bird\u2019s nest like appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit is just as revealing as Riley\u2019s, a skintight dress with a black and white tiger stripe print that barely covers her upper thighs.  It clings tightly to her stick thin, painfully thin, frame.  You can almost make out her ribs through the dress and her small breasts are outlined by the fabric.  Her nipples poke through the dress too, making it clear she isn\u2019t wearing a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve seen her before, on a poster in Trish\u2019s bedroom.  She is Vanessa Zh\u014du, lead guitarist for Analytical Engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Riley,\u201d she says, taking a lollipop out of her mouth, presumably she got it from the rider outside.  Her SoCal accent is, if anything, thicker than Riley\u2019s.  She looks at you, at Jimmy and then finally at the bundle of flesh and hair that is the remains of her bandmate.  \u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t get any further.  Jimmy lifts the black pen again and zaps her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude,\u201d you exclaim.  \u201cYou can\u2019t keep on going around doing that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just did,\u201d grins Jimmy, flashing that wicked smile of his again.  He closes the door Vanessa left open.  \u201cHey, this is even better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter,\u201d you splutter.  \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we can both go out on stage,\u201d he grind again.  \u201cYou know, if you don\u2019t want Riley you can go out as that chick.  Get inside her skin, wouldn\u2019t that be fucking amazing, huh?  Huh,\u201d ne nudges you encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s even worse Jimmy,\u201d you sigh.  \u201cI can\u2019t play guitar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will with this,\u201d he says, pulling out the brown pen and waggling it.  \u201cI tried it out earlier, when you zap yourself with a suit on you get the memory and mannerisms of that person.  How\u2019d you think I was able to lead you straight to Riley,\u201d he asks.  \u201cThis dude knew it all,\u201d he adds, taping the side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the deflated body of Vanessa again.  Those exotic eyes are twisted out of shape and empty, surrounded by thick eyeliner.  You kneel down beside her and smooth out the hollow face with your hand, admiring it:  The perfectly arched eyebrows, the dainty little nose and the blood red lipstick that adorns her lips.  It matches exactly the shade of her hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa isn\u2019t a natural beauty, not like Riley, but her lithe frame is packed with something that you can\u2019t quite identify.  A special energy that shines through, even in her reduced state.  You idly daydream about putting on the skin and going out on stage.  Prancing about in front of the screaming, adoring audience as you riff on the guitar.  You\u2019ve always wanted to play guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caress the skin again and realize, to your embarrassment, that your pants are starting to tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes up you mind and you start stripping your clothes of with mounting excitement.  They go in a rough heap in the floor as they come off.  You don\u2019t care anymore, you will not be needing them where you are going.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dimly aware of a flopping sound behind you and turn round to see that Jimmy is doing the same, and has even taken the suit of the security guard off.  You blink a couple of times and turn rapidly away again.  Looking at your girlfriend\u2019s mother naked, even if she is holding the Riley suit ready to put on, isn\u2019t an image you want to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discard the last of your clothes and pick up the suit of Vanessa, disentangling it from her clothes.  Standing up, you hold her golden skin by the head and give it a shake until it rolls out and hangs loosely.  An inviting slit runs the length of her back, from the nape of her neck to her pert ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run a hand across your mouth.  It feels dry and you can not contain yourself any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as you can, you pull on the legs of the Vanessa suit.  You marvel at the way they come back to life, and the way that your own legs shrink down to Vanessa\u2019s lithe proportions as they slide inside the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the best is yet to come.  Your hard-on, by now, is raging, yet you watch in wonder as you hike Vanessa\u2019s skin up above your waist.  For a few moments, the skin is distended and stretched, just the way your pants were a few moments.  Then the mound starts to sink, reshaping to match Vanessa\u2019s flat groin.  You have only a second to marvel at Vanessa\u2019s shaven pussy before a tide of alien sensations overwhelms you.  That familiar hardness is replaced with a loose, warm and wet sensation, causing you to squeal involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep it down dude,\u201d hisses Jimmy from behind you.  His voice sounds different somehow and, after turning briefly round, you realise he\u2019s already in the Riley skin.  Her voice sounds odd without that thick accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore him and keep pulling on the skin.  Arms slide in empty sleeve-like arms and they swell to the same lithe proportions as the rest of Vanessa\u2019s body.  No longer flat, but still slimmer than your own arms.  You pull the torso close, wrapping it round your own body.  There is a momentary pain as your body shrinks to fit and then you can feel the skin as if it were your own.  The cold air in the dressing room causes your newly acquired nipples stiffen.  You lift a couple of slim fingers to your left breast and give it a gentle tweak.  Though Vanessa\u2019s breasts are nowhere near as generous as Riley\u2019s, in fact they barely register at all, you are still rewarded with an intense jolt of pleasure that sparks all the way down the back of the your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d you moan softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood huh,\u201d asks Jimmy, and this time with Rileys SoCal drawl.  He must have used the brown pen.  \u201cStill need to finish up and get dressed though dude, otherwise the rest of the bands going to have a fucking shock when they see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, but he has a point.  Or should that be <i>she </i>has a point now?  All that remains is Vanessa\u2019s head.  It hangs about your neck loosely, the styled red hair clinging and giving shape to it, such is the amount of hairspray she used to create the look.  With a quick tug, you pull it over your head and massage it into place with those slim fingers.  The skin settles into place, leaving your disorientated for a few seconds until Vanessa\u2019s face is your own.  That mess of hair feels heavy on your head.  You laugh a little, and it comes out in a light, feminine, register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can do anything else, you feel a sharp jolt hitting you in the back.  Spinning round, you see Jimmy\u2019s grin plastered over Riley\u2019s face.  She\u2019s holding the brown pen, pointed directly at you.  Vanessa\u2019s memories start to crawl inside your skull:  Her first kiss, guitar lessons, the disappointment her parents felt when she told them she was going to be a musician:  It\u2019s all there.  Crucially, the memories of playing the band\u2019s songs filter into place and your flex those slim fingers in anticipation.  You know now that they can move across the fretboard with frightening speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey \u2018Nessa,\u201d says Jimmy, mimicking Riley perfectly.  \u201cReady to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Nessa\u2019s, it\u2019s what her friends call her, personality slips into place.  \u201cWell not naked, duh,\u201d you drawl.  It feels so natural just being her, so relaxing.  Your stance shifts subtly, slipping into something more laid back.  A little \u2018Nessa memory tells you she smoked a little something in her dressing room earlier to take the edge off.  You fish \u2018Nessa\u2019s panties out from her dress and slip into them.  They feel snug against your crotch and you can\u2019t help but hug yourself and let out a girlish giggle.  \u201cI am so stoked for tonight,\u201d you say breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that \u2018Nessa or David talking,\u201d asks Jimmy raising Riley\u2019s eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome over here and find out,\u201d you smile, flashing Nessa\u2019s perfect teeth.  She sometimes spars with Riley like this, and Riley can give just as good as she gets.  That said, while Riley is happy to experiment with both sexes, \u2018Nessa is one hundred percent straight.  That thought leaves you momentarily nervous, especially when you realise that one of her habits is picking up a good looking guy from the audience and taking them back to her dressing room.  Suddenly that lollipop she had earlier seems ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok,\u201d asks Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thinking about something,\u201d you mutter as you slip \u2018Nessa\u2019s dress over your head, tugging it into position.  It feels far to short to the David part of you, but <i>just perfect</i> as far as your \u2018Nessa persona is concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d replies Jimmy.  \u201cHey, you want to get Trish in here now?  Or after the concert?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"After the concert,\" you say, grappling 'Nessa's breasts into place under the tight confines of the tiger print. \"What, you think I'm just going to walk incognito into a room of Ani-E fans, pluck a girl out of the audience, lead 'em backstage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course not,\" Jimmy, adopting Riley's flirtatious nature, slides over to you, tracing her hand along your arm. \"I'm the only one in the band who's plucking a girl tonight.\" You make a mental decision to stop thinking about Riley as Jimmy: her figure is too womanly, her face too stunning, to contemplate the reality that your male friend lies beneath in a masquerade. Besides, that's such a Riley thing to say; of the three female members of the band she's the only one attracted to women, and Matt the bassist is happily married with a wife in San Diego. Your delicate fingers gracefully sweep up to lift her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how exactly are we getting Trish back here?\" You cock your head, adopting 'Nessa's quizzical face, pouting your red-stained lips and raising one of your sublime eyebrows. It feels so natural to be her, think like her, act like her. It sends another involuntary shudder down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, someone's enjoying themselves,\" Riley coos. \" But to answer your question, I was thinking we take her back at the first break, pick her for the cover guest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe band's set list is carefully organized. Riley usually gets someone up from the crowd for a close-up serenade of a particularly slow, dirty cover of a popular tune. It's a cheesy trick countless bands do, and Riley usually tops it off with a backstage pass for the lucky concert-goer, before heading off to make her first costume change. You, or rather 'Nessa, then duels Matt with the sickest riffs you can invent to keep the crowd eager for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, your golden skin blanches a little as you think beyond that. 'Nessa doesn't invite anyone on stage, but she's always happy to find someone eager for no-strings fun after the gig is over. Her parents are strict Chinese-Americans who still seem to hope she'll grow out of her rockstar phase and settle down with some nice, wealthy boy. 'Nessa knows it's never going to happen. While 'Nessa likes guys, you're still a little uncomfortable with it. It's the only downside of this magnificent body you now wear; 'Nessa may not be a classic beauty, but the more you shoulder her personality, the more attractive she becomes, and the more you feel almost perfect in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK, 'Nessa? You look like you're going to puke.\" It's a Jimmy observation, masked as a Riley one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This band doesn't need two Cassies,\" you chide. Cassie Lewinski is the band's drummer, who, despite her tough appearance, has long made a habit of throwing up before every gig. It was her dashing out to vomit that prompted 'Nessa to leave their shared dressing room, grab a lollipop, and see what was cooking with Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough. Well, if you're OK, let's do this, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the security guard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'll deal with it, restore him and come up with some bullshit story. You go get Cassie and Matt. It's showtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ease into 'Nessa's lithe pose, grateful she'd already taken the edge off the nerves with a joint. It's time to be magnificent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has to be the greatest thrill in the world, you imagine, as you arch your back and send Vanessa's fingers flying across the fret in an ornate, precise dance, catching the strings to perfection as her other hand rides the plectrum's rhythm, letting it do all the hard work as it darts across the strings. The crowd are screaming, the show's lights cast sensational bursts of color across the stage, the noise is frenetic, loud, joyous. 'Nessa, you know, organizes the band's set pieces: she takes inspiration from Kandinksy, letting the band burst from shocking colors and pyrotechnic explosions. Right now you've succumbed utterly to her mind, enjoying the wild, exuberant ride of being Ani-E's lead guitarist. The crowd lift your performance to greater heights, the response to each song fueling the set with its energy. You finish your solo and rush across the stage, contorting your body to windmill your head in time to the Cassie's furious tempo, your elaborate weave like a hypnotic whirlpool for the crowd to gaze upon. You stop, staggering a little, as the song ends, and stride over to the amp to seize an open, ice-cold beer. Your tiny chest heaves, your tight costume is soaked with sweat, and a sweet sensation of pure, unadulterated euphoria shivers down your spine. There's no escaping it: you love being Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Riley Lovelace says to the crowd, toying with the mic, catching her breath from under the tight confines of her corset, \"we've done a lot of shows. Been to a lot of places. But you know the best show I've ever done?\" She pauses for effect, teasing the crowd, flicking back that magnificent cascade of raven hair. \"It's this one. This one right... fucking... here... tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd goes wild - it's like a wave of sound breaking against the stage. Riley Lovelace throws her arms open, basking in the adoration. You have to hand it to Jimmy, his impersonation so far has been flawless. With his Riley memories he's hit the notes perfectly on every song, all the while being the consummate showwoman. People have come for Analytical Engine, and the band are putting on the show of their careers. Your 'Nessa memories can't recall a time when everything just felt so... perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, this next song is a little favorite of mine,\" Riley says, walking over to you. You grin, offer a fake attempt at a bite as she gets near. The band's lead laughs, and begins to sing unaccompanied, sliding her body against yours in an achingly slow cover from another artist. 'Nessa's memories tell you to let Riley have her fun, while your own memories tell you Jimmy's ready to pluck Trish from the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Riley stops. \"Whoa...hold on. Sorry... sorry, 'Nessa. Hold on. Before we do this, I think we need another band member. Who's up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sea of hands rise up. You wonder how Riley/Jimmy plans on spotting Jessica/Trish. Or if he's got something else up his sleeve...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What the hell?!\" you exclaim, staring at the odd figure in front of you. You see Trish's head on Jessica's body. She's giving you a bright but naughty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, David,\" Trish tells you. You open your mouth, but she soon shushes you. \"You probably want an explanation, and you will get one. But you might want to hear it from Jessica too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she's talking, you notice her moving something on her back. She slips the upper half of Jessica's body off as if it were some kind of suit. Actually, it does seem like Jessica's upper body is nothing more than a deflated piece of skin. Trish maneuvers through her lower body, and her legs come out of what looked like a skin of your girlfriend, a somewhat creepy sight. She then zips up the skin, and, to your astonishment, it reinflates and becomes the familiar form of Jessica. She seems to be unconscious but not by much. You try to question Trish again, but she remains silent until Jessica starts to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" she mumbled, \"how long was I out for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a few hours, Jess,\" Trish replies. \"So, I guess it's time we let David in on our little secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's eyes shoot open quickly and fall on you. \"Oh! David! You're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...? How the...?\" you incoherently babble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened probably borders on completely impossible. You might want to sit down because it's a pretty long story.\" She gets up and goes to reach inside a drawer. She takes out a small wooden box and shows you its contents: one black pen and one brown pen. \"It all started when I found these pens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica proceeds to tell you how she had found the strange box in her attic. Its contents were extremely bizarre, and the instruction booklet inside raised more questions than answers. She had went to Trish's house to show her the box, and Trish suggested trying the devices on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I jokingly pointed and fired the black pen at her. You can imagine how surprised I was when I saw Trish suddenly turn into a deflated skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprised is an understatement,\" Trish chimed in. \"You panicked and thought you had killed me. You zipped me back up pretty quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica continued her story. After she had calmed down and Trish had woken up, they decided to follow through on more of the strange instructions. She had given the pens to Trish, and then Trish used the black pen. After getting over the shock of seeing Jess as a skin, she began to steel herself and started putting the skin on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I put my legs in, I felt a strange tingling sensation around them. When I looked down, I saw that I was moving Jess's legs, not my own. As I got my arms in and moved the zipper on the back towards my head, I took a look in the mirror and was stunned by the changes. When I finally put on the mask and zipped the suit up completely, there was no one but Jessica looking back at me. Needless to say, it felt amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish had spent a few hours trying out Jessica's body, going out and seeing things through a new perspective. At first, she had to remember to try and act like Jessica, but she remembered something about the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I used it, I felt almost completely like Jessica. I could remember her childhood birthdays, going through school, and, of course, her budding relationship with you.\" She winks at the end as she notices your somewhat flustered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From then on,\" Jessica continued, \"Trish and I would occasionally spend time in each other's bodies, sometimes with each other's memories and feelings. It's been an exhilarating experience, but we're ready to take it to the next level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Trish replied, \"if you haven't noticed, we're both girls. It's been cool to live life in another person's body, but we both have become curious about what it's like to be a guy. We haven't used the pens on anyone else because it's kind of rude to enter someone's body without their consent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd have to find someone who would accept our story and be interested in joining in,\" Jessica said. \"That quickly narrowed our options down to either you or Jimmy. Since Jimmy's not the type of person we'd trust with these pens, we decided to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wait. You two want to find out what it's like to be me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Jessica said. \"That's why we agreed that Trish had to be me so you'd be able to believe us. We're not expecting to use you as we please, just to find out what life's like on the other side. In return, we'll let you use the pens on us later. You've heard us talk about it. Aren't you curious to see what it's like to be one of us?\"</span></div></div>",

I thought you would've chosen Jessica..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to know why.\" you smirk, glancing at her in her naked stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nods and hands you the black pen, you take it quickly and examine the piece of technology. It seems pretty plain at first sight, but you notice the tip glows when you pressure the trigger a little. Your eyebrows raise in amusement and you suddenly zap Trish. Jessica yelps in surprise as Trish crumples into a pile of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus christ David! You could've warned us first!\" Jessica's face turns red and she stares at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, sorry.\" You shrug. <br>\r\nYour eyes catch onto Jessica's form as she bends over to pick up Trish's skin. Her curvacious hips, her slender waist. You realise why you're so attracted to her and start to wonder what it would be like to have that body as your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?\" Her voice suddenly snaps you out of your thought, \"David? You alright? You were just staring really weirdly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply smile at her, twiddling the pen in your right hand. She turns her back on you to put Trish's skin on her bed. Your arm almost lifts itself and aims the pen, your thumb slowly presses the button as the tip glows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jess?\" You hear the door slam open and Katie's voice comes through. \"Jesus christ, what are you guys doing in here?!\"<br>\r\nJess swings around and sees you pointing the pen at her, eyes widening, Katie starts to scream. Shit, you've got to shut her up and fast.<br>\r\nAs she turns to run from the door, you swing your arm around and zap her. Like Trish, she instantly falls to the floor, this time with clothes messily folded over and under her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David no! Why?!\" Jessica seems furious and you see her rush towards you in the corner of your eye. \"Give me the pen now!\"<br>\r\nYou're forced back as Jessica jumps on you, she grabs your hand and tries to pry the pen from it. Accidentally, you press the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing, you stare at Jessica's deflated form as it drops to the floor, now you've got a room full of skins and no idea what happened.<br>\r\nYou pick Jessica up and put her on the bed next to Trish, following suit with Katie's deflated body and clothes, you drop the pen on the bed and sigh.<br>\r\nAs you stare at the skins, temptation edges over your mind. You're really horny from that oral you gave to Jess earlier..<br>\r\nYou pull Jessica from the bed and turn her around, Trish used the neck right? You find a split running down Jessica's neck, along her back to her lower back.<br>\r\nPerfect. You pull it open and step in. It's as easy as putting on clothes. The leg are really tight as you stick your own through, you discover that as soon as you pull the skin up, your legs have changed into Jessica's. You wave one leg around and marvel at the sight. Continuing, you pull her hips and waist up, it binds to your body and you discover that your best friends Mr. Johnson and the Juice Crew have disappeared. Tracing your new genitals with a finger, you cringe as a sensation runs through your crotch. You stand there surprised for a few seconds, before you hurry to pull the rest of her body on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome..\" Jessica's voice mumbles, only it's coming from you.<br>\r\nYou stand there with your new tits cupped in your slender hands, biting your lip as you occasionally squeeze your pink nipples.<br>\r\nMoving to a full body mirror, you examine yourself for a few minutes. Your fingers explore places you've never seen from this point of view, and you feel things you've never felt. Having the weight of breasts on your chest is new, not having the weight of something else is too. Speaking of which, your hand probes the new space between your thighs and you giggle to yourself. Throwing your hair behind your shoulders, you turn around and move to the bed again. Why settle for one? You've got 3 skins to try. Suddenly you hear the front door unlock and you flick your view to the bedroom door. Make that 4..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the black pen, you don't even bother to put on clothes. Making your way downstairs, you hear Jessica's mom as she walks through to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess honey? Where's Katie?\" her familiar high but tired tone greets your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here mom! Can you come real quick?\" You call out in Jessica's tones.<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps as Jessica's mother approaches, she appears before you and yelps in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, put some damn clothes on!\" She yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need 'em.\" You smirk and you zap her with the black pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica dear, would you and your friends like any refreshments?\" Jessica's mom says as you stare at her in the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, it's only me.\" You giggle ridiculously in your posh facade, your fingers covering your mouth.<br>\r\nYour expression drops instantly into a casual expression of boredom. Groping your slightly larger breasts with your older, worked fingers, you sigh.<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Hunt, you're nice, but you're just too.. loose..?\" You say as you stare at yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\nClasping your right hand on your face, you will the suit to come off and pull. Instantly, your face wrinkles and slides off just like a mask.<br>\r\nYou work the rest of Mrs. Hunt's body from around your shoulders to your back, pulling the sticky material from your own flesh like a costume.<br>\r\nDropping the skin next to the toilet, you wander into the bedroom for another. How about Trish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's body is a whole new feel. You're so tight and packed up in here, it feels like the skin isn't just clinging to you, it's pulling on you.<br>\r\nShe's far shorter and it's almost nauseating as you cycle through different heights. One thing you've always preferred about Trish is her long dirty blonde curls rather than Jessica's straight blonde hair. It's much more eloquent in your opinion. Trish's boobs are much smaller than Mrs. Hunts, probably by about 2 sizes, but everything else is so perky, so taught and ready to roll. You catch yourself rocking on your toes a few times, eager to burst out smiling at any moment.<br>\r\nSuddenly, your phone rings. Shit.. who could that be..?<br>\r\nYou rush to your pants hung on the door and fish out your phone, it's Jimmy.<br>\r\nAlright, focus.. You do and reach an arm behind your head to your neck, digging your nails in, your skin comes apart as if it was made of chewed up bubblegum.<br>\r\nYou pull Trish's head from your and it hangs on her bosom, you answer your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, what's up?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Dave, you busy?\" It's jimmy alright, with his weird way of talking. It's like he's always up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sort of. Why?\" You mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this weird pen and it turns out, I can become people with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?! Dude, seriously?\" How the hell does he have one too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I used it on my sister and look,\" you hear the sounds of shuffling in the background, \"<span class=\"cppink\">I even have her voice!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.. I have one too..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Wow, okay.. Where are you? We can do some seriously epic shit with this stuff.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at Jessica's house with Trish's face hanging from my neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You son of a bitch, alright, I'm on my way over now.</span>\"<br>\r\nHanging up, you exhale deeply in anticipation, no you're really in for it. Knowing Jimmy, you'll probably get into some deeper shit than you're already in.<br>\r\nStripping out of Trish's skin, you fix the place up and put the skin on Jessica's bed. Dressing yourself, you go to the living room and turn on the TV.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt slightly embarrassed by having blurted out a retort as stupid as \"Or I'll tell mom\", given the circumstance. Claire was correct, Mom would never believe a word you'd tell her and would probably just make fun of you. Claire's hands lifted Jessica's deflated head from over her generously sized breasts and stretched it's neck open. You realized that if there was a best time for action, that time would be right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly you threw yourself at Claire, gripping her wrists and pulling them down. The sudden jerk and pain of your hard hold on her wrists caused her to release the skin, and her eyes to flash a look of surprise. Then you straight up punched Claire in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even make a noise as your knuckles snapped her head to the right. Dropping backwards onto the edge of Jessica's bed, her stolen hands cupped her aching cheek as you leaned over and grabbed her wrists again. Pulling her arms down besides Jessica's curvaceous hips, pressing them into the comforter's soft material, you snarled at Claire furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said,\" You spat, noticing Claire's look of horror as the control she thought she had over you was brutally inverted, \"Get the fuck out of Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just nodded quickly, you saw sparkling in the corners of her eyes as tears formed, and then ran down the sides of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the room while you reared up off of the Jessica and Claire hybrid beneath you. As you looked behind you to the ajar bathroom door, you noticed what looked like a pile on the floor, resting on top of a bath math right in front of the shower. You realized that the brown colour you were seeing was actually hair, brown hair.  Looking back, you saw Claire peeling Jessica's hips down off of her own, less mature and shapely ones. Jessica's pink, shaved pussy popped away from your sister's, revealing her slightly darker pelvis and genitalia, not as groomed as your girlfriends. The entire sight disgusted you, but you noticed the sensation of intrigue flaring up in the back of your mind. You wanted to know how your girlfriend's body felt, she was after all your girlfriend, and thus extremely attractive to you. You've admired her body externally for a while, now you want to know just what it feels like from the inside..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stood naked holding Jessica's skin in the air by the neck, her entire deflated body dangling loosely, stretched by it's own weight. Her hair cascaded downwards as her floppy head hung over Claire's knuckles. You saw a look of apologetic guilt on Claire's face, alongside the now reddening bruise you'd given her. You thought that Claire wouldn't need anymore convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I took her off-\" Claire softly said, before you snapped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is wrong with you, you disgusting little shit?\" You almost shouted, forgetting you were in Jessica's house, not your own. \"You realize that I basically did all that to you, right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking!\" She replied, holding her aching cheek as more tears streamed down them both. \"It was Jessica's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good fucking God..\" You facepalmed for a second, contemplating the next course of action to clean this mess up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" You said, \"How did you do all this? Wearing Jessica's body, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looks and points at the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A laser pen, it turns people into costumes when you shoot them with it.\" She explained. \"I used it on Katie and came over here, then I used it on Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her for a moment and then gave her an incredulous look, but then realized it was probably true, given that you were just sucking your girlfriend's pussy before your sister's head popped out of her neck. Furthermore, you did notice what looked like brown hair on the floor..<br>\r\nTurning around, you walked quickly into the bathroom, using your hand to push the door open. Instantly you came across a skin laying crumpled on the floor, and upon picking it up, you deduced that it belonged to Jessica's mother. Walking out, you threw the skin on Jessica's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Katie and Jessica?\" You glared at Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just looked away ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the bathroom, you found the pen on the sink counter and picked it up. Examining it for a second and then returning to the bedroom, you held it in your hand whilst you asked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we turn them back to normal..?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it takes a little while for them to fill back up and then wake up though.\" Claire said. \"Katie woke up on the sofa downstairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" You replied, then something clicked. \"Wait a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stared at you, waiting for your next sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weren't you at home watching TV right next to me?\" You asked, \"If you were home, then how are you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stared at you for a moment and then grinned widely, dropping her hand from her face. You frowned and looked down at the pen in your hand, then up at Claire again to see that her hands had moved to her neck just as she'd done with Jessica. Claire's face strained with effort as she peeled her neck open, following up with peeling her face away from the head beneath and dropping the mask down to reveal Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God you picked up on my lead, David.\" Trish smirked, putting her hands on her hips in Trish's signature stance. \"I was beginning to think I'd been wasting my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just gawked in absolute confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. not completely.\" Trish's hand moved inbetween her legs as she made fun of you, stroking Claire's pussy with her fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, really?\" You stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is actually me now, no more layers of people to take off.\" Trish said. \"We've had our eyes on you for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door opened, unlocked when you weren't looking. Katie exploded into the room grinning wildly, and shot you in the side with her own black pen.<br>\r\nA jolt of electricity shocked your whole body, and you blacked out.</span></div></div>",

As you open the door, nobody is to be seen, you take a step outside and look around after someone... still nobody around. Suddenly something on the ground catches your eyes, a little brown package is standing on he ground right in front of you. You  pick it up and takes a quick glance around you before you start study the package. The package doesn't seem to have any writing or address on it, it's just a normal looking package. \"Weird you mumble to yourself and take it with you inside. <br>\r\n\"Are you waiting for something in the mail Claire?\" You ask your sister. Claire looks up from the mobile and just shake her head, and then continue texting again. <br>\r\n\"Well, might as well...\" you think to yourself and walk up to your room with the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down in front of your desk and start open the box, you open it up and see a little strange looking wooden box inside. You pick up the wooden box and notice some carved words on the top. You read the words to yourself: \"Costume set\". Under the word it seems to be some kind of initials but they are to unclear to read. <br>\r\n\"What the fuck is this?\" You say to yourself. You open up the box and inside you can see a odd looking black pen looking thing with some strange inscriptions in it and a little note on the side. You pick up the pen first, the first thing you do is to look for a \"clicker\" at the back but it isn't any, instead it is a button on the middle of it. \"Well it's not a pen, maybe a laser pen then?\" you think to yourself and aims the pen towards the wall and press the button. A low buzzing sound comes from the pen, but you cant see any dot on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then lay down the pen and pick up the little note and take a glance on the writing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Costume device 1</b>\"<br>\r\n<b>This Device will turn any person into the perfect disguise.<br>\r\n- Aim the device on the person of your choice.<br>\r\n- Enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Remember that the person will not remember anything about the event<br>\r\n  or the time as a \"costume\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n- To remove \"costume\", simply think about leaving in and you will be able<br>\r\n   to make a opening.<br>\r\n - To restore the person, zip up the opening</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.. the fuck\" You say to yourself in disbelief. You stare at the \"pen\" once more before you suddenly notice it is a two layer in the box. You remove the layer and see another pen and a note. You pick up the pen and notice it look quite similar to the other one. The note that lay there is similar as well, you pick it up and start to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Costume device 2\"</b><br>\r\n<b>This device wi...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is as much you can read before the writing becomes all blurry, it seems that something has been spilled on the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the devices thoughtfully. \"I should try this thing out, just for the laughs\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe i should bring someone in on this\"</span></div></div>",

Figuring out you dont want any witnesses if this thing would actually work you decide to go to your brothers room next to yours, since everybody is down stairs and your oldest sibling is occupied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move out of your door and walk to your brother's silently, you notice the door is open so you lean over to the opening and take a look inside. <br>\r\nYour brother is sitting on the computer with his back facing the door. You silently move trough his door opening with the device pointing at your brother, Nick. <br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing\" You think to yourself as you press the button.<br>\r\nYou hear the small buzzing sound you heard before coming out from the device and you see Nick instantly freezes for about 2 seconds before he kind of crumples in the chair.<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" you say to yourself, before you turn around and lock the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around again, you see your brother sitting lifeless in the chair. You can see his head dangling over the back of the chair, looking like a empty skin or a disguise just like in the cocoon movie. <br>\r\nYou slowly move towards Nick while loud-whispering his name, making sure he ain't conscious.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, it really worked\" You think to yourself. \"This is crazy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving all the way up to Nick you see his empty skin lays over the chair you look at his emotionless face with empty eye sockets and with the mouth wide open, as you take a closer look to the open mouth you can see everything is empty inside, nothing, just air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head explodes with different thoughts about this, how crazy it is, how unbelievable. You can't help but being amazed and curious about it though, and you simply must explore this further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift up Nick's skin  high with both hands holding his shoulders, he is now just a lifeless skin with clothes barely hanging on. You lay the skin on Nick's bed, still just looking at it, pondering about how it will act as a disguise as the note said. You bend over the skin and drag the t-shirt he is wearing off. As you do you notice a large opening on his back, you turn the skin around and you see a big slid starting at the back of his head and all the way down to right above the bum. <br>\r\n\"So this is where i enter\" You say to yourself feeling the excitement grow a bit inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more hesitating your strip him for all the clothes before you strip out of yours aswell. Holding the skin in front of you with the back facing, you take a deep breath before you start putting your right foot inside the skin. As you place your foot into Nick's skin yo\u00fc feel the skin tighten around your foot as you slide it longer and longer inside before getting it in place. You struggle a bit but you manage to fit your toes into the skin's toes in the end. As you do, you can feel the skin tighten more and suddenly the right foot is now looking exactly like your brothers, it even feels just like it is your own. You touch the leg with your hands and you can feel them sliding up and down the leg, just as it does when touching your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting more excited you quickly put your other foot into the skin and feel the exact same feeling. <br>\r\nYou continue working the rest of your body into the skin. You start maneuver both of your arms into the skin. Suddenly you are almost done, the only thing missing is the head which is now dangling on your chest. You place your hands on each side of the head and slowly moving it over yours. As you feel the head fit, you move your right hand down to the nub and zips up the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the skin seals you feel a tingle run trough your body for about 2-3 seconds. <br>\r\nEagerly you walk towards the mirror in the room, you can't do anything but gasp as you see Nick's reflection looking back at you.<br>\r\n \"No way, this is impossible... \" you say to yourself, shocked by hearing your own brothers voice coming from your borrowed mouth. You move closer to the mirror, taking a closer look at your face. You open up your mouth and stick your tongue out. <br>\r\n\"Unbelievable, thats even Nick's tongue.... and teeth!\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\nYou turn around and see that it's no visible seam on your back. \"Woah, this really is the perfect disguise\" you say to yourself with a amazed look on your face.<br>\r\nYou take a peek down on your crotch, seeing your own brother's penis dangling between your legs, it's much bigger than yours. You look up again, seeing the whole body you know are inside.<br>\r\nYour brother is somewhat of a hunk, every girl you know says so. It kinda creeps you out looking at your brother naked like this, you move your hands up and down the body, pinching your cheeks a bit, still amazed and excited about the whole situation. <br>\r\nYou then start to flex your borrowed bodies muscles and a grin forms on your new face.<br>\r\n\"Well, this might be interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to..<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

This device is the greatest thing ever, with it, you can do whatever you like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you know where she lives as you have seen her in her house as she lives just a block away from your friend Jimmy. Wasting no more time you start to drive towards her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you about 4 minutes to get to Kimberly's house, you park your car and rush to the front door and rings the bell. Seconds later you see the door opens and you can't help but gasp at the sight of Kimberly in the doorway. She was smoking hot! You see her eyes, framed by long lashes, were bright, hazel and seemed to brighten the world. A straight nose, full lips - she seemed the picture of perfection. She wears a tight black miniskirt with a matching black tight shirt which shows off her huge cleavage. You stare at her perfect hour glass figure and down at her perfect shaped legs before looking up at her wide perfect smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she starts to giggle. \"Looks like someone like what they see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. ye.. yeah\" You stammer. \"You look smoking hot babe!\" You then exclaim, straighten up a bit, trying to act more like your brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in here.\" She says and drags you inside holding a tight grip on your shirt. <br>\r\nKimberly continues to lead you trough the hall and finally into her bedroom, where she calmly push you into her bed. You lay in her bed on your back and see her dive unto the bed and on you before she starts kissing your neck. <br>\r\nShe then seductively starts to unbutton your shirt and undress it, as soon as it's off she runs her fingers down your borrowed body's six pack. <br>\r\n\"Mmmm, i like.\" She purrs. \"Now how about that treat.\" She says as she gives you a sexy look. <br>\r\nYou see her fingers start to unbutton your pants and then drags them off as well. You can see your rock hard cock makes the boxer look like a tent. <br>\r\nKimberly drags off the boxer, leaving you completely nude. <br>\r\n\"Someone is happy to see me\" She giggles while looking at your penis.<br>\r\nShe grabs a good hold on your erect dick, and start rubbing it while she looks at you straight in the eyes, giving you a sexy smirk before she starts licking the tip of your hard one. You lean back and close your eyes as you start to moan by the feeling of her luscious lips and tongue working up and down your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the BEST day ever.\" You think to yourself. Getting sucked by this gorgeous woman who actually think you are your brother, the man she dates. The whole impersonating another person without anyone have the slightest idea arouses you almost as much as what Kimberly is doing to you right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm\" You hear from Kimberly as she continues sucking you off. Suddenly you feel her stop, and sits up. \"You can't have all the fun, can you?\" She then lay down on her stomach and struts her perfectly shaped butt towards you. \"C'mon tiger, do me!\" She says with the most horny voice. <br>\r\nYou waste no time and trust your dick into her vagina and start doing her doggy style. <br>\r\nKimberly screams with pleasure, which only makes you more excited, you grab her tighter with your brothers arms continue to bang her as fast and hard as you can. You can almost not believe how deep you can go with your brother's bigger equipment. <br>\r\nSuddenly you feel your borrowed cock just explode and you empty yourself into her as she reach climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you fell back on your backs in the bed and breath heavily. \"Oh.. Nick, that was amazing!\" Kimberly exclaims and lay her head on your chest. <br>\r\n\"You weren't so bad yourself\" You say still breathing heavily and still thinking how awesome this whole situation was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying in the bed dozing for a few minutes you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You move your hands to the back of your head and feel a little opening form. You widen the opening big enough so you can press your head out of the suit before continue widen the opening until it's as big as it was when you put it on. You work your arms out of the suit and then take a seat down and pull your feet out as well.<br>\r\nYou lay the lifeless skin on the bed with the back facing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nob appears on the end of the opening, you grab it and start leading it up towards the head, working just like a zipper. As you finish zipping it all the way up to the back of the head the nob disappears and you notice the body starts to change, almost like pumping air into a air madras. Within about 5-6 seconds Nick's body seems to be normal again but he seems unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get out of here before he wakes up\" You think to yourself. You quickly get dressed and walk out of the room and into your own. <br>\r\nYou sit on your desk admiring the pen, smiling just thinking about what you can do with it before you get cut of your thoughts hearing your mothers voice. <br>\r\n\"Dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" You answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out to the hall, meeting Nick who just got out of his, looking all thoughtful and confused. <br>\r\n\"Sup?\" You ask him while a grin forms on your face.<br>\r\n\"mmr.. nothing\" He mumbles back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n20 minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the food mom, it was delicious\" You say to your mother as you finish your dinner.<br>\r\n \"You're welcome\" She replies smiling. \"Would you be a dear and take the dishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... sure..\" You mumble not quite satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you about 10 minutes to clean everything up. <br>\r\nAs you finish everything you walk up to your room again and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, that feeling has made you quite the overprotective brother, suspicious of any guy that shows interest in her.

You make your way to the back of the skin and find a slit with a zipper just like you saw in Nick's. As you enter legs first, you can feel the sensation of the skin tightening around them. Instead of getting beefier, hairier legs, you are met with smooth, feminine ones. You work your way up, and you can feel a much different reaction than before around your crotch. Instead of the enlargement of your manhood, you can feel it disappear into your body and be replaced by a pussy.

So while David was lost in thought you quickly spun the pen towards him and clicked it setting off the device. At first it seem that nothing had happened to him but as a few seconds went by you could see David start to deflate and his clothing crumple onto the floor. After a few more seconds pass all that left of David is his clothing and a wrinkled skinsuit in his image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa it really works that freaking amazing!\" you say, while fondling David's skinsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you're about to turn David back to normal you decide to see this whole thing through and wear David's skin. So no one interrupts or discovers what you're doing you lock the door to your room and turn to pile on the floor. You quickly take David from under all his clothing letting anything on him fall to the fall and lay him flat with his back towards you where you see the opening into David. With the skin on the bed ready to wear you began to strip out of your own clothing until there was nothing on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked and alone with David's skin you take the suit by the shoulders and carefully and slowly push one of your legs into his slightly stretching the sides. When finally filling out the entire leg you could feel the muscles molding and moving finally becoming David's leg, you brush your hand across the surface of his skin and it felt no different than your own skin. With no more hesitation you greedily put other foot into the suit and felt it undergo the same changes as it became David's other leg. Coming up to the suit's crotch you saw that David's dick was about 8 inches which was a good 2 inch's bigger than yours and just a tad girthier as well, so not waiting another minute you pushed your dick into his and pulled the suit above your crotch. You could feel your dick grow those extra two inches before fully becoming David's which was now hard due to all the focus you were giving it. Quickly shaking off the temptations of jacking off in the middle of suiting up you continue to pull the suit over you and reach the arms where you slid one arm into suit and quickly did the same  to the other. The only thing left to suit up was David's head which with little fanfare you put over your own and caused the suit to sealed up all tight. as the last of the muscles moved and molded into place you turn your head and see David's face staring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing Testing 1 2 3, this here is new David\" you said while testing out David's voice and grinning all the way through it. \"not bad, not bad at all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down and grabbing the pen that made this all possible you consider the limitless possibilities and the endless fun you could have with it but there were two important matters to take care before any fun could be had. First there was still that hard-on that you're sporting and it was looking like it could use a real good session to tame it. The other is deciding on which of your families you're going to change into skinsuits so that you could move around easier without your families getting too suspicions of what you're going to be getting up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what to start with with first? </span></div></div>",

Thinking about having the chance to make Tina into a suit settled it. You'd go back to David's house and use his family as your test subjects!

Here goes,\" Jimmy laughed as he flipped the pen into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide watching it twirl end-over-end going up. But as it descended, a shiver ran through you, and your gut clenched. As it hit Jimmy's hand, his finger instantly triggered the device. A blue light radiated out, and you scrunched your eyes closed expecting the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Will it hurt? Will I remember? What could possibly go wrong?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant, you knew exactly what could go wrong - everything! <i>My god. It's Jimmy for Pete's sake! The most perverted prankster you know. Possibly in the world.</i> The possibilities flooded your head with terror of him pretending to be you and what tricks he could play with you getting the blame. Fiendish acts on your friends, on schoolmates, on family, on the world, on, on ... OMG!! On Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the silence had deafened you, right after that soft swishing sound and a thud on the carpet. Was it all over? Was it safe - if anything can be safe with Jimmy. At the time of any of his \"fun,\" you feel so embarrassed. Although afterwards, looking back, you do see the humor. Time heals, you guess. You hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jim-my?\" you whispered then slowly opened one eye waiting for him to pounce. But he didn't. In fact, he seemed to be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not gone exactly. There was a pile of clothes and hair on the floor where he stood. The pen was next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! It must have worked,\" you gasped in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over, you pushed at the hair. It rolled over to expose Jimmy's face. Eyelids were closed like he was asleep. Except there was no structure or roundness. Obviously, no skull. An empty skin head. <i>So like him,</i> you thought with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you lifted it up. The clothes still hung off it, so you had to undress him, or his skin. It was a bit warm and felt like real skin. Turning it around so not to stare at his privates, you found there was an opening running from his neck to his ass crack. Fortunately, not into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind spun with whether you should try it on or just turn him back to tell him it worked. If you did the latter, he'd probably call you a pussy wimp for not trying him on. However, the test was just to see if it worked. Now that you know that it does, you can start using it on others. Why waste time being Jimmy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you know only that he is a skin suit now but not whether it will really work as a disguise. Jimmy and you are different shapes - height and width - so even if you put it on, you wouldn't be exactly like Jimmy. Maybe you better try it to determine if it will work as a prank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusic started blaring through the walls as Jimmy's sister ramped up one of her favorite songs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn that down!\" you heard Jimmy's mother scream, and the music faded a bit. Maybe you should become one of them and prank Jimmy. That's for sure what he would do to you, turning one of them into a skin suit and putting it on before putting you back to normal and scaring the shit out of you somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered these options for a moment before deciding to . . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If it did work, then maybe you could advance to wearing one of his family and prank him. Although, if it worked, there was so much more you could do with it by wearing all sorts of people. Why stop with Jimmy's family? Your mind started spinning endless possibilities consuming all thought, leaving you catatonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said TURN THAT DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, back to the present. You stripped as the music slowly faded to where the walls and furniture no longer vibrated. The inside of the suit seemed infinitely dark. No matter how you held it to the light, you could see nothing. It made you nervous, but you put in your right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it was like pulling on pajamas with a footie and toes, but it went in smoothly without any friction. Once it bottomed out into the toes, there was a tingling and then there was nothing except the air against your leg, or rather, Jimmy's leg. You wiggled your toes and felt the floor as if barefoot - not anything on your foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not just a skin suit but a real skin. It must have attached itself to me or I became it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, you shivered but did the other leg with the same results. Up over waist, your rear cheeks filled out his. Your man-parts easily fit into his without aligning them with your hand. Amazing. Even more so was looking down at your new 'Jimmy' tools which were obviously a size upgrade from what you were used to seeing. They looked really good, and you almost took hold until you remembered whose they really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your eyes up, you inserted your hands and arms, shifting the skin over your shoulders. It began to seal itself up your back as you took hold of the hood of Jimmy's hair and face. With a deep breath, you pulled it on, your face fitting into it or, maybe, it fit itself to yours, you weren't sure. It just came on perfectly when you blinked and opened your mouth. You almost passed out as all your senses blanked for a couple seconds. Then it all felt normal, not a suit, just a regular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Jimmy's mirror, Jimmy looked back at you. Not a taller Jimmy your size. Really him! His short pudgy self seemed bewildered, so unlike his continually jovial self. You smiled. He smiled. It still wasn't quite right even when you tried thinking you were imitating his trademark smirk. You needed some practice for people not to recognize the difference. If only there was some way to ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The other pen. It's suppose to unlock the skin's memories.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through your discarded clothes, you found it. This will give you Jimmy's memories to help you act more like him. It will also allow you to see all the things Jimmy has done, some of which have been a bit perverted. <i>A bit? A lot!</i> And that's just the things you know about. Who knows what else he's done that may have been too perverse for him to brag about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you really want to know all that? Maybe you should go make a skin of someone else and test getting memories from them. You've proven the skin fits no matter the difference in actual physical shape. You don't have to continue with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, there are a few things that Jimmy won't tell you that you'd like to know. Besides, you could use it to get another skin and let Jimmy take any fallout.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sticks his head outside the doorway and looks around the hallway and seem to listen for something. <br>\r\nHe then turns back to you. \"Seems it's just Heather still inside the house.\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns his head just outside his doorway again and shouts down the hall. \"Heather! Can you come here for a second?\"<br>\r\nJimmy walks into the room again and stands next to you with the pen in his hand. He turns to you and says: \"Hope this works\" with a slightly nervous expression. <br>\r\nSuddenly you hear footsteps coming from the hall and Heather, Jimmy's 21 year old sister enters the room. <br>\r\n\"What is it now?\" She asks Jimmy with slightly a annoyed voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJimmy hesitates for a second, but suddenly he says: \"Oh what's that behind you?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Heather says and turns her head around. As soon as she does, Jimmy aims the \"pen\" at her and push the button. <br>\r\nYou hear the small buzzing sound you heard before coming out from the device.<br>\r\nBoth you and Jimmy's jaw drops in shock as you see Jimmy's elder sister instantly freezes and within a second her body contorts and crumbles to the floor like a blow up doll running out of air, leaving her laying in a heap on the floor together with her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me!\" Jimmy exclaims, after a moment of silence. <br>\r\n Still in shock you don't manage to do anything else then watch Jimmy rushing forward, picks up the heap of clothes and Heather's deflated, lifeless skin.<br>\r\nHe throws it on his bed and quickly locks the door. He then turns to you. \"Holy shit dude! It fucking works!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and try to calm yourself down, still feeling your heart pound fast. <br>\r\n\"Yeah... It totally.. did\" You a bit shaken. <br>\r\nYou walk next to Jimmy, and the both of you stands over the heap of skin and clothes laying on the bed, staring at it.<br>\r\n\"Dude, i can't believe that's your sister.\" You say. You reach forward, touching the skin, surprised how it feels just like touching a normal person's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Jimmy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Jimmy. \"So.. now what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy turns to meet your eyes and you notice a excited smirk form on his face. \"We got to test it obviously! Just think about the opportunities if this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing just seem to unreal to you, but you don't want to ruin the moment by objecting as Jimmy is clearly excited about it. It's his sister after all.<br>\r\n\"Uh.. yeah.. sure we got to.\" You then say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy, shaken with excitement starts to undress Heather's skin for clothes. He then holds the skin up high, examining it up and down.<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at this... unreal.\" he says and lay it back down at the bed, with the skin's back facing up, showing a opening that starts at the back of the head and stops right above the bum, ending with something that could remind of a nob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down and slightly widen the opening to have a  look inside the empty skin. \"So this is how you enter\" You mumble. \"There is now way neither of us can fit this, it's have to rip or something.\" You tell Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude... I just turned my sister into a empty skin with a opening with a... pen... claiming it to be a perfect disguise.\" Jimmy says frowning at you. \"It got to be some kind of... magic involved here. I don't think it will rip...\" He tells you, clearly confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" You say, not quite convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more delays! I want to test this out, no matter what.\" He says determined. Jimmy has always been the most daring and adventurous of you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat in the couch and watches as Jimmy takes a final look at the skin. \"Of with it\" he says to himself and start undressing himself.<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" You say and look away as you see him pull of his boxer shorts, leaving him naked right in front of you.<br>\r\n\"Jeez, stop being a crybaby. You've seen me naked.\" He tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at him in curiosity as you see him pick up the skin with the opening in the back facing him. You see him take a deep breath and slowly put his right foot inside.  You see his foot move further and further inside, filling the skin's lifeless leg. \"Dude! it fits like a glove!\" Jimmy exclaims. <br>\r\nIn amazement you watch Jimmy standing with one leg inside the skin, now looking exactly like a female leg with no indications that it's actually Jimmy's inside it. <br>\r\n\"It doesn't even feel like i have Heather's skin on my leg, her leg feels just like if it should be my own!\" Jimmy says in excitement.<br>\r\nThis clearly thrills him even more as he quickly put his other leg inside as well and drags the skin further up his body. He then maneuvers his arms inside the skin and within few seconds he has pulled on the skin's arms like long gloves. You can't help but be a mix of shocked and amazed by the sight you now see. You see Jimmy's head on a gorgeous naked female body standing in front of you, grinning from ear to ear. <br>\r\n\"Now for the final piece\" He says.  He grabs the lifeless head and pulls it over his own. He works his hands around the face trying to fit it right. <br>\r\nYou gasp as you see Heather's face suddenly shapes perfectly over Jimmy's head. The eyes open and you see Jimmy's sister's clear sky-blue eyes looking at you, filled with glee.<br>\r\nJimmy leads his now female right hand to his back, grabs the nob and seals the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy, now looking exactly like his older sister Heather turns to the mirror in his room. Gaping and with the eyes wide open on his borrowed face, Jimmy moves his sister's hands up and down his tan new body, around the tight bubble butt and hourglass waist. He cups her boobs and watches them rise and fall before you notice a huge grin on his face. \"This is awe....\" He exclaims but then stops in the middle of the sentence, moving one hand to his throat. \"Ha ha, oh my god! My voice!\" He continues laughing with his new feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! I'm a girl! My own sister!\" He almost shouts in your face, shacking of excitement, cupping his breasts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT is awesome! Unreal!\" You exclaim back with almost as much enthusiasm.

''Are you alright there?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jimmy, or rather, Heather, looked at each other and froze. You slap Heather on the arm, and to your relief, Jimmy realized that he must answer. ''Yeah mum!'', Heather shouted, her hand reached to her clothes on the floor. No telling what chaos would erupt if Mrs. Wilson saw her eldest daughter, stark naked with his son's friend. Out from the corner of your eyes, you spied the pen and quickly grabbed it. Heather, practically scrambled to get her clothes on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know your brother don't like it when you go through his stuff.'', Mrs Wilson's voice was heard again. Heather frantically fumbled with her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He said okay!'', Heather shouted, she threw the bra behind Jimmy's bed, hidden away from view. She picked up her panties and swiftly pulled it up to her crotch, before starting on the tank top and blouse, before at least the jeans fit snugly on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi Mrs. Wilson.'', you gave a nervous grin when Mrs. Wilson ran out of patience and burst inside the room. She smiled at you, before addressing what seemed to be her daughter. ''Mom?'', Heather looked at her, hiding the obvious adrenaline rush. ''Where's Jimmy?'', Mrs. Wilson said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He might be out for a while.'', you spoke up before Heather could. Heather just nodded in agreement, her eyes wander to her reflection on a full length mirror. The clothes were a bit crumpled, but she managed to get decent in such a short time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Wilson shot a subtle but piercing glare at Heather, whom got the message and scoot outside promptly. ''I'm sure he'll be back soon.'', you smiled, pocketing the pen. ''Alright then.'', she then disappeared with Heather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you heard the door clicked, breathing a sigh of relief, you took out the pen and examined it further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That was close.'', Heather giggled as she got back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So... how does it feel?'', you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Amazing dude! It's like I'm her!'', Heather exclaimed. ''Wait! I AM her!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Can you... like... access her memories and stuffs?'', you remembered about a story you've read in Writing.com. Funnily, somehow the events that unfold before your eyes seemed to bear resemblance to the rather surreal things that happened in a story you've just read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What?'', Heather looked at you quizzically, ''No dude, I don't think so...'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I see...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This' great, but I'm thinking of moving up.'', a very Jimmy-esque grin popped up on Heather's face. ''It's like, she's still my sister dude.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow, just moments ago, he was having fun with Heather's features. You threw the pen to her, ''So, what do you want?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I say...</span></div></div>",

We should start off small, since we don't really know how to use the pens yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather looks at you and nods affirmatively, \"Good idea, let me get out of this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her shirt up, she lets it fall limply to the floor, soon followed by her bra.  She throws her hair back, her breasts bouncing naturally as she peels the skin at the back of her neck forward, shutting her eyes, as the skin folds move forward, her facial expression relax as she loses the ability to make them.  Jimmy reveals his head as he lets Heather's hang over his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! This is some really heavy stuff man.\" He says, imitating the movements of wiping sweat from his brow. \"It's really weird having her body with my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, looks weird too.\" You both start laughing. He unbuttons his pants and shakes them off, then pulling down his panties. You look away for a moment, feeling like you're invading Heather's privacy, Jimmy notices this and grins. A few seconds later, you hear Heather's voice say something to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, look at me..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over with your eyes, you notice that Jimmy put Heather's face back on and is striking a sexy pose. You cover your face with your hand as you try your hardest not to burst into a nosebleed. She slowly walks over to you and pushes you back onto the bed, crawling on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, stop. Stop!\" You shove her off of you as she bursts into hysterics. \"That is not fucking funny, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of shaking in laughter, Heather sighs and peels her face off, quickly following with the rest of her body, revealing the disturbing sight of Jimmy's naked body, complete with erection and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Jimmy, put your clothes back on.\" You shut your eyes and try to force the image out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Afraid to meet Mr. Johnson here?\" He laughs and pulls his boxers on, followed by his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so gay, dude.\" You say, peeking to make sure he's at least got his underwear on. Relieved, you open your eyes fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, if we're gonna' be turning people into skins and wearing them, we're gonna' be seeing each other naked a lot more regularly.\" He states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, you realize this is actually true and reply with a simple shrug. The two of you get up, grabbing the pens and putting them into their box. Putting Heather on the bed, you zip her up and leave her to re-inflate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you're talking to Jimmy as you get off the bus. The two of you walk towards the main entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you brought the pens, right?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did.\" He presents the black one, before shoving it back into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm thinking we could lure someone alone at recess or maybe at the end of school.\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looks at you and smirks, \"You bozo, you're horrible at making plans. Hell, we could zap someone right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you arrive in the hallway, walking up to your lockers, you retrieve your things before meeting up in the Boy's Locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's the plan,\" Jimmy says,\"We're gonna' go into the Staff room and ask for Ms. Martinez, take her to an empty classroom and boom! We zap 'er.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's sounds perfect, why would she follow us and what classroom is gonna' be empty now? It's like eight o'clock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me on this, pal.\" Jimmy nods and the two of you walk to the teacher's lounge. Knocking on an already open door, Mr. Porter, your gym teacher, looks up from his desk at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you two want?\" He practically spits, he pretty much hates everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need Ms. Martinez to help us with something. Do you know where she is?\" Jimmy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Porter stops for a moment and looks absently into the air, drooling with admiration at the thought of Ms. Martinez.  Snappign out of it suddenly, he shakes his head and looks at Jimmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's in the counselor's office with some other kid.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jimmy says, and the two of you disappear before he can even look up from his crossword puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\" He says, looking up, \"Whate-... Jimmy? Freakin' kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the door to the counselor's, you can see two figures inside through the frosted glass. \"Counselor's Office\" clearly painted on in large black letters.<br>\r\nJimmy pulls out the pen and looks at you, you nod back at him. Opening the door, you two walk in simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should re-.. Excuse me? Don't you know how to knock?\" Ms. Martinez says quickly in a thick Latin accent, looking up at you two with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl sitting closer to you is a girl about a year above you named Ashley White, she's well known for her position as the editor of the school's newspaper. Consistently pressured by the school's popular clique to either add in or leave out minor details in the paper's rather scandalous articles, she's usually seeking guidance from Ms. Martinez, who also works as the Guidance Counseler. You briefly glance as her face as she looks back at you two. Wearing glasses with thick black frames, her hair, long and brown, flows over her shoulders and back. underneath is a loose plaid cotton shirt and a pair of black skinny jeans. She wiggles her feet continuously as a sign of her generally uncomfortable state. Overall, she's a pretty girl, but she's nothing compared to Ms. Martinez. <br>\r\nMs. Martinez, first name Julia, middle name every guy in highschool's wet dream. She wears a small black jacket with a white cotton shirt underneath, a black pencil skirt that reveals above her knee, brandishing her lovely thighs. Long black curls flow down over her shoulders, she wears red lipstick to accent her already luscious lips. She bats her eyelids at you, before clearing her throat to stop your staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to tell me what you're doing here or shall I just give you both detention?\" She says, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jimmy suddenly points out the window a surprised expression on his face, \"Holy shit, look out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls are gullible enough to look towards the window, when Jimmy quickly zaps both of them with the black pen. Looking to you, Jimmy shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was easy.\" You say, walking up to the two skins now draped across the chairs. </span></div></div>",

Jimmy decided to take Ms. Martinez's skin after a short debate. You settled for Ashley's instead, she wasn't that bad after all. Jimmy pulls the skin up over his chest and pushes his arms through, you watch in amazement as Ms. Martinez's bombshell body little morphs into existence, her breasts seem to just appear, rather than inflating in a cartoon fashion.<br>\r\nLooking at her curved waist, your eyes drop to her legs and in between, you shudder at the thought of what it'd be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>David.. what are you looking at?</i>\" You hear Ms. Martinez suddenly say. Snapping out of it you look up and start apologizing for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia starts laughing in Jimmy's comical manner, and you join in, somewhat disturbed. Looking down at the naked skin of Ashely White in your hands, you hear footsteps to then see Jimmy walking up to you, rich olive skin shimmering in the sunlight that pierces through the blinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need that, silly.\" She says, taking the skin from your hand, instantly your erection gets ten times worse and you feel it pulsating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls the chair besides you around and sits you down in it, before proceeding to grip your member and begins massaging you slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jimmy, what the fuck are you doing!?\" You say in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, let me entertain you.\" Jimmy says using Ms. Martinez's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside of you is telling you not to let him, but you body is just in euphoria right now and you could probably just explode all over her face right now. Or, his face. Oh God. This is incredibly disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, Jimmy stop!\" You say, leaning forward, suddenly, Ms. Martinez plunges your cock into her mouth and begins to suck, groans eminating from her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuuuuuuuuu..\" You say as your body leans back limply, you feel powerless to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurping the tip of your dick, Julia smacks her lips and takes a deep breath, before looking up into your eyes as she leans forward again, licking your shaft lengthways with the entire length of her tongue. You feel your cock instantly pulsate at the sight and you're trying your best not to explode right this minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy... Stoo- agh, agh! God damn it!\" You moan as she teases your sensitive tip with the end of her tongue, swirling around it before slowly sucking it on the end of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright sugar,\" Julia purrs in her accented voice, \"You can spray it all over my face, or I can suck it down for you like a good whore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the absolute fuck is wrong with you?!\" You reply, before she smirks and suddenly deep throats you, choking noises vibrating over your dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet fuuuuuuuuuck!\" You say as you splurge in her mouth, your seed instantly being sucked down as she holds your cock to the back of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia stops for a moment, you feel her still sucking, but less so. She's cleaning it up, you realize. Slowly, she slides her lips up your cock before pulling them from your head. Giggling, she gives your dick a kiss before licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain your senses now that it's over, and you lay still in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy.. did you just- did you just suck my dick?\" You struggle to say, huffing. Waving a finger as Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been wanting to try that for a while. Just wanted to know how it felt.\" She giggles and smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, man, that shit is so gay.\" You say, trying your hardest not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was kind of hoping that.. you'd return the favour..\" Julia says, giving you a strange puppy dog look that you find extraordinarily cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, I'm not gonna' suck your dick.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, she leans back on the counselor's desk after clearing some stuff and spreads her legs, revealing the tight folds of her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that.\" She purrs, winking at you.</span></div></div>",

You then exhale deeply as you mull over the situation. You struggle with a little bit of decision making but you then give Ms. Martinez a side glance, taking in in her mature yet tight body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine dude, I'll return the favor.\" you say to Jimmy as you shift your body towards him. You suspect he might be enjoying this a bit too much but you'll have to ask him afterwards about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright bro! That's what I've been waiting to hear!\" Julia tells you excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get down on your knees and wrap each of your arms each of Ms. Martinez's thighs, holding them for balance. They feel soft yet firm and really smouth, your dick twitchs a bit in reaction to feeling her body. You're about to go down on her but Jimmy stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up man, I want to try something. You know how these are suppose to be the perfect disguise kit using these pens? I've been thinking, what does the other pen do? It has to help us blend in with our disguises right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then turns around part way, leaning back, and grabs the brown pen off the other side of the desk. Before you can say anything Jimmy zaps himself with the brown pen and instantly freezes for a moment. It feels like it has been forever but only a few seconds pass as you then see Ms. Martinez blink a couple times before looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, this is amaing David. This brown pen gives me her mannerisms and memories!\" Julia exclames. \"We can act just like them and none would be the wiser. Not to mention I get all her past experiences in having sex, I can just guide to exactly what you need to do.\" Putting the pen down, raising her hands to her breasts, she cups them and lifts them up gently while squeezing them softly. \"Who would of thought that a counselor could have such a rockin bod.\" she tells you in an un-Ms. Martinez like fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then brushes her left hand through her hair, tucking it behind her ear. She smiles at you and says \"Are you ready for me to give you a one on one tuturing session David? Maybe if you pass this little test I'll give you some extra credit next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you're rock hard but you know what you have to do and lean in towards Julia's pussy and begin to lick her clit. You work on her clit teasing it a bit before you move onto the other parts, slowly lapping her up, playing with your tongue. She grabs hold of your head and shudders a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to go and use your hands David, give my clit some more attee-e-e-en-tion.\" Julia tells you excitedly as you immediately follow up on her directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are enjoying the shudders you feel going through Ms. Martinez's body and the odd sweet and tangy taste of her pussy. After a few minutes of this, Julia gently grabs your shoulders and pushes you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you did well on your test David, I think it's time I let you in for a little extra credit.\" She tells you with a very goofy and Jimmy like smile.</span></div></div>",

She lifts her feet up around you and locks them around your waste, pulling you in. Grabbing your penis with both hands, she guides it into her stolen vagina. At first she plays with it, rubbing it up and down on the outside before finally telling you \"I'm ready David!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting a moment more, you begin to pump in and out slowly at first. Julia puts her two hands behind her on the desk to support herself while still keeping her legs locked around your waste. You groan lightly as you enjoy the the feeling of Ms. Martinez's warm and moist pussy around your dick. After several minutes of this you feel like you're about to explode and begin to pull out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?

She then clamps around you even more, tightening her  legs, refusing to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh!\" you growl at her in a low voice as your cum inside her, releasing all your sperm. You can feel the muscles in her vagina flexing as they squeeze around your dick trying to milk you.  You collapse on top of Julia as she falls onto her back on the desktop. Both of you just lie there for a minute, trying to catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have a hard time going back to my body after this dude.\" she tells you between breathes. \"How about you get your fat ass off me now so I can breathe David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh oops, my bad man.\" you say as you blush and roll off and onto your back on the desk right beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So stud.

She begins to clean up as she waits for you to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up as well andstart to clean up and put your clothes on.

She then swiftly hides the pile containing Ashley's skin and her clothes under the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have to wait long before you hear a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ms. Martinez,'' you hear Trish's voice coming from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It seems that <i>your </i>friend has arrived,'' Julia whispers in her accented voice and grins at you. ''Come in,'' she announces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Trish enters the room. As soon as she sees you, Trish beams a smile which you reply with a weak one. You are not sure what Jimmy is about to do and what Trish's reaction would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Take a seat there,'' Julia points to a spot on the sofa beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You wanted to see me, ma'am?'', Trish says after she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, yes. It's about your friend. He's been up to something again,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow at Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jimmy? What's he done now?'' Trish turns to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What? No, it's David,'' Julia exclaims before Jimmy realizes that he is breaking character, ''I mean, <i>no</i>, your friend Jimmy didn't do anything this time.'' Julia recovers, ''In fact Jimmy is an exemplary student that the two of you should follow.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Trish almost chuckle at that. Everyone in the school knows that Jimmy is one of the most frequent repeat offenders in the school. He never done anything serious, but his pranks have often landed himself (and often you as a reluctant accomplice) in hot waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You think I am joking?!'', to your surprise, Julia raises her tone and glares at both you and Trish. From your past experiences with Jimmy in the counselor's office, Ms. Martinez can be a bundle of fury. Especially if she noticed that Jimmy was ogling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia paces around the sofa, ''Let's just say, we got to know each other better. <i>So much better</i>.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Ms. Martinez stops talking, you see Trish beside you crumpling into a pile of skin and clothes. ''Fucking hell Jimmy!'', you jumps away from the sight, almost falling on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia chuckles as you struggle to compose yourself, making her way to a mirror hung up on the wall. Though you've seen the process before, seeing it happening an inch away from you makes it feel rather surreal and unearthly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Oh</i>, I do look sexy when I'm angry,'' Julia smugly murmurs to her reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I thought you're going to let her in to all this?'', you say incredulously as Jimmy gathers up what's left of Trish and piles it on the coffee table, next to the pile of what used to be Ashley White. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude,'' Julia stops and looks at you, ''Knowing Trish, she'll probably tell us to report these pens to the cops and I'll definitely get some stick for wearing Julia here.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, <i>wearing</i>?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh? Yeah, wearing,'' Jimmy explains his choice of word. ''Cause they're like, well you know, ''Jimmy struggles to explain, ''You put your body in them and they're like clothes that you wear outside your body.'' Jimmy stops as soon as he sees the expression on your face. ''Oh, you'll know when you <i>wear</i> Trish.'' Jimmy grabs Trish's skin and holds it up for you to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You want me to wear her?'', you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't you always want to know what she thinks about you?'' Julia smirks, \"'Sides, I want to try this Miss Newspaper Girl over here.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that it's the usual Jimmy trying to goad you into doing things, but at the same time it brought the curiosity that you've always had to the forefront of your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I <i>know</i> what you're trying to do Jimmy,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin spread on Julia's visage, ''You're learning well, young Padawan, '' she pauses, ''But, if you don't want to, maybe I'll wear her myself and <i>show</i> you what she feels.'' </span></div></div>",

Jimmy has a good knack of worming his way under Trish's skin, but to <i>literally</i> get under her skin. The thought made you almost snatch the skin from Julia's hands. <i>Almost</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you have to wear her yourself stops you from acting on that impulse. You look at the dirty blonde hair that hangs from Trish's deflated head. There's no way you could bring yourself to do that to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Then, you'll be happy with Miss Newspaper Girl?, Julia snaps her fingers and brings you back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fine,'' you grab Ashley's skin from the pile and holds it in your hand. It's cool and feels rather unearthly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh-uh,'' you hear Julia clucks her tongue, ''Turn around, I need to get undressed,'' she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply, but not before making a remark of your own, ''I seem to recall that you were alright with it before.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There's a difference,'' Julia's accent is thick, ''Don't worry, you'll know soon enough.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of your eyes, you see Julia's clothes on the sofa, as Jimmy strips his borrowed body. ''You know what to do,'' you hear Julia calls out, ''Unless you need some encouragement.'' she adds in a lower tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fuck you Jimmy,'' you scoff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you look at Ashley's skin and begin to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Looking good,'' Trish's voice makes you gasp and turn around, ''So, how does it feel?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there agape, lost for words as you drink in the sight in front of you. Trish stands there in all her naked glory save for her arms that she folds to cover her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh</i>,'' Trish unfolds her arms to let you see her moderately sized boobs. They look firm and hangs tightly on her. ''You like what you see, <i>David</i>?'' Trish smirks as she sashays closer towards you, ''Will you cheat on Jessica for these?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jimmy,'' you exclaim, but you are surprised at the new voice coming out from your mouth. It's at a higher register than you're used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's just me here,'' Trish continues to inch forward and you find yourself walking backwards, ''And I want you, no matter what you look like.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heel hits something and the next thing you know, you stumble backwards and land on the sofa. ''Jimmy,'' you stutter, ''Trish, stop.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Psyche!'' Trish suddenly stops and grins. But not before she steals a quick fondle at your perky bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jimmy, dude. Not cool.'' you breathe a sigh of relief. The sound of your own voice still feels alien to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You should've seen your face, or maybe <i>her</i> face.'', Trish chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Very funny,'' you try to let out a chuckle too, but it comes out feebly. ''Go and get something on.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But I'm always like this when no one's watching,'' Trish grins, ''I remembered when I went to that nudist beach with mom. Great times.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Re- really?'' you try to find your footing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Of course not,'' Trish cocks her eyebrow at you, ''You seriously believed that?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But I thought you-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nope, haven't used the brown pen yet.'' Jimmy finishes your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So that part about her-,'' you pause when you brain catches up on what you are about to say, but you decide to say them anyway as you see Jimmy's grin plastered on Trish's face, ''wanting me?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know,'' Trish shrugs, she pauses, ''Or are you disappointed?'' she teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, I already got a girlfriend,'' you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, how does <i>she</i> feel?'', Trish points at your borrowed form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's unreal,'' you holds out your arms in front of you. They're slender and rather pale compared to your real ones. ''And I think I've lost height.'' you continue, noting that you're now a bit shorter than Trish. ''And these,'' you cop your perky breasts. After a brief hesitation let yourself the indulgence of an appreciative squeeze. ''It's crazy, it's like I'm her duplicate or something.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''As far as anyone's looking concerned, you <i>are</i> Ashley White. Just like I'm Trish O'Neill.'' Jimmy corrects you. ''But,'' you see Trish holds the brown pen in her hand, ''If I zap you with this, you'll be be her inside and out. It's like when I'm in Ms. Martinez's tight hot bod. I know everything she knows, how she acts, what she'll do-.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But deep down, you're still Jimmy.'' you cut her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Correct,'' Trish grins and before you can say anything else, she zaps you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like a torrent of water assails your mind as memories filters into you. <i>Ashley's</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Glasses,'' you call out to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''My glasses.'' you repeat your command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Right,'' as Trish walks away, you see her lightly tanned ass swaying, ''Here, can you see without them?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks,'' you wear them and looks around. Nothing really changes, which means that, ''There's nothing wrong with my eyes, I just like to wear them,'' you shrug. It's as if her whole mind is an open book to you, but you don't merely read from that book. You're also writing it and living it. And because you have access to her memories, you know that Ashley is late to meet up with some important people in the school thanks to the untimely interruption. <i>The cheerleaders</i>. They want to speak to Ashley about the article she's writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile forms on the edge of your lips, Ashley did want to write the article that way for a purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your milky flesh, that means the cheerleaders now want to speak to <i>you</i> and <i>you're</i> the one who's late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Give me those pens,'' you tell Trish whilst you start donning Ashley's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! What're we going to do?'', Trish stops fondling her breasts to look at you. <i>So immature</i> you thought as you slides Ashley's skinny jeans up your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You stay in Trish, and see how her life looks like.'' you grab the brown pen and zaps her with it. ''Don't forget to zip up Ms. Martinez and hide my stuffs. I'm going to have some fun as Ashley.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa,'' Trish says woozily as Jimmy recovers from the input of memories into his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you find the black pen and quickly pockets both pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou primp yourself in front of a mirror, doing your hair the same way that Ashley would have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You okay dude?'', Trish says, ''You seems a bit odd, I know it comes a bit strong.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you see Trish still stark naked, ''Never better actually,'' you stop to fondle your boobs. ''But Ashley's late so, I must go, ''you smile and quickly feel up Trish's ass before she could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'll see you at lunch!'' you grab the school news articles before exiting the counselor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way down the hallway, you can feel people's eyes on you. Especially boys. <i>Good, let them stare</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's not as beautiful or well endowed compared to some of the more influential girls in the school and certainly nowhere close as Ms. Martinez. But she has a certain girl next door vibe that she cultivated for her own gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you round a corner, you see a few students huddling around a locker. <i>The undergrounds</i>. Stories about them are notoriously hard to dig up and Ashley don't often have the chance to write anything about them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pens start to burn a hole in your skinny jeans. <i>Maybe you should change your plans</i>.</span></div></div>",

For now, you have to go and see the cheerleaders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley knows how much trouble they can create for her and as <i>you're</i>  Ashley for the time being, you don't need the trouble they could stir up to make your new life difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You can't put that on!,'' a blonde girl exclaims near you. <i>Leah McBride</i> Ashley's mind tells you <i>Always the hothead</i>. She's of course referring to the article for the school newspaper the previous Ashley have written that's now under scrutiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other cheerleaders are standing nearby. Not all of the 15-strong squad, but the few that knows the importance of what's written in the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But I need a picture to go with it,'' you pretend to protest. Ashley has always enjoyed riling Leah up, the distrust and irritation between them was mutual. ''And <i>we </i>think this will reflect greatly for the squad,'' you say, ''Shows there's a lot of hard work too'' Ashley has often used this to shift any blame away from her, implicating that the decision was made by the entire student newspaper committee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ms. Martinez gives me her 'okay'.'' you add, after you see the mixed expression etched in the cheerleaders' face. You're lying. In fact, Ms. Martinez was turned into skin and worn like a cheap suit just before she was about to comment on the article. Ashley normally wouldn't be comfortable telling a blatant lie like that. However, as you're <i>not really</i> Ashley and if push comes to shove, you can always zap Ms. Martinez and get her to tell whatever you want her to tell, you don't feel nervous at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentioning Ms. Martinez's name seems to have the desired effect as you see Leah turns away in exasperation much to your amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't you have another picture?'', a calmer voice grabs your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sonya Xie</i> your mind gives you another hint <i>De facto head</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We think this is the best,'' you plead your corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You do have a better one for the school, don't you?'', a smile forms on her Chinese-American feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well,'' you feign being torn about the matter, ''I do have another one.'' you fiddle with your phone for a few seconds before finding the shot, ''Here, took it myself.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing the importance of her position as the editor (and a prolific journalist), Ashley has always try to keep an amicable working relationship with the various influential groups in the school, including the cheerleaders. In that, she often accepts favors for them and in turn, she gets news and juicy gossips. <i>A mutual symbiosis</i> your mind adds. Noting that the existence of an unofficial school newspaper has been making Ashley's life more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleaders huddle around Sonya as they evaluate the shot that you have just suggested. Having them stand so close to you will probably give you a boner if you are still in your old body. But now in your borrowed body, you just feel a slightly damp patch on your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya looks around and after a brief look around to measure the reaction of her fellow cheerleaders turns to you, ''We think this one's better for the school, thanks Ashley,'' Sonya returns your phone back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry about it,'' you beam a smile at the cheerleaders. Some of them smile back, but you could see there's one that has a smile wider than anyone else, even than the one that you have on your face right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few periods passed uneventfully and you spend the time trying hard not to let your mind wander around in class which proves to be a tough task. You don't see Trish either, as she doesn't share all of Ashley's classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bell buzz you quickly gather your things and make your way to the bathroom reserved for a-listers. You have a free period next and there's someone that you can't wait to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's already a girl in the bathroom preening herself when you enter. You recognize her face as the one who has the biggest smile back then. <i>She should</i> you say in your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Lindsey,'' you call out to the girl and hold your arms out for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh,'' the girl turns around and beams a smile at you before going in for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let the hug lingers a bit longer than usual, feeling her prodigious bosom presses against your borrowed body's modest one and taking in the scent of her platinum blonde hair. She is the reason you were having a hard time keeping your attention in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David, you probably would've shot your load the moment her luscious body grinds against yours. <i>Lindsey Young</i>. Still a junior, nevertheless she makes herself known throughout the school. Her alluring visage and her slim and toned body with curves in the right places helps her to do just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They wouldn't say it,'' Lindsey says after she pulls away from the hug, ''but you took a great shot.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, I'm always happy to help the squad.'' you smile conspiratorially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Although it's a shame, I quite like the old picture.'', Lindsey says, looking pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course she would</i>. After all, she was the one who suggested you to set the picture up that way. Ashley's memories told you about the plan that Lindsey orchestrated and with Ashley's help, managed to get the squad to take a picture after their routine that won the state championship. Of course the photo made Lindsey look better than the rest of the team. Lindsey promised a juicy gossip for the editor in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second picture however, was Ashley's own idea, knowing that the squad will never accept the first picture. It's a shot of the squad doing their championship winning routine, but it was deliberately taken when Lindsey was at the centre of the formation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gaining both the squad's and Lindsey's favour</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appraise the cheerleader in front of you. Ashley's mind appreciates Lindsey's ability to combine her looks and her crafty skills. Although neither you nor Ashley will be able to see it as you'll both be graduating, it's clear that she'll be made head cheerleader in her senior year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom from the things she's trying to pull though, it's clear that she thinks things aren't happening fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''See you later,'' Lindsey packs up her stuffs and starts to march to the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Actually,'' a smirk forms on your visage as you turn around and zap Lindsey on the back, you watch as the girl slowly deflates ,''I need to borrow you for a minute.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering the Lindsey's lifeless skin and her belongings, you enter a cubicle, ready for your next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels weird when you take off Ashley's head, the deflated skin hangs loosely against your chest. You flip open Lindsey's compact mirror. Your head looks out of place atop Ashley's slimmer build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath. In the few hours of your imposture, a new world has opened for you that you never thought existed. Jimmy always rambles about some conspiracy of what really happens behind everything in school. Well, he is right to some extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you're about to uncover some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your head back inside the hollow part of Ashley's skin and feel it morph back. <i>Now comes the step into the unknown</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertainly, you don Lindsey's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath as you exit the cubicle. <i>They should really clean the place</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile expands on your face as you tuck your new platinum blonde hair behind your ear just like the previous Lindsey would. On your other hand you carry a paper bag containing Ashley White's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom's as deserted as when you enter it a few moments ago. So you walk up to the basin and take a good look at your new self. <i>Not bad</i> you think as you press your boobs together, letting a deep cleavage form between them. That's Ashley's mind talking. Your own is quite happy to commit the sight forever in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the brown pen in your hand for a second. <i>Is this going to work?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, you've proved that wearing a skin over another skin is in fact possible, but having Lindsey's mind on top of having Ashley's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, you have no choice other than to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch your face in the mirror, it's not unfamiliar anymore. You thought it would be different, but it was exactly like when you put on Ashley's skin for the first time. Her whole life opens like a book to you, essentially, you have <i>become</i> Lindsey Young. An unnatural grin spread over your face, but really, <i>you</i> are Ashley White. But behind all that, <i>you</i> are still David Anderson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour self exploration is stopped before it can even begin when you see two girls shuffle into the bathroom from the corner of your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wannabees </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't matter, you've done what you want to do anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPromptly, you take all your belongings and exit the bathroom, with the pens safely inside your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Trish walks towards you whilst you walk down the hallway. <i>Jimmy</i> you think as you see Trish trying to ogle your chest. That's perhaps the most obvious way anyone has checked out your boobs. That's Lindsey's mind speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should talk to him or better yet, play a prank on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you really don't want to let Jimmy know about your new borrowed body.</span></div></div>",

It feels great just living the life of another, not tied to anyone nor fearing the consequences of your actions. Of course your not that malicious in that you would ruin someone undeserving but the excitement is certainly there. Deciding that you needed somewhere quiet to think, you head to the school library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering through the library doors you see that it's pretty empty except for a handful of kids doing some kind of group project at one of the larger tables straight ahead of you. To your left is the schools media center specialist and her aide sorting through some books to re-shelf. Mrs. Quiver is a wrinkly old hag, your Lindsey thoughts surface; she is always barking at the students who misbehave. On the other hand the aide is kind of pretty with short black hair in a bob cut. You decide to head to the back of the library where there is a storage room that rarely sees any use. Fortunately the door's view is blocked by the shelves of books in the library. You look around once and then quickly sneak inside, closing the door. At first glance you spy a row of more shelves with old musty books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good</i>, <i>I'll be undisturbed back here</i>. Walking to the back of the room you see an old couch with a couple boxes stacked on top. You take a moment and clear it. It's a little bit more of a hard job in Lindsey's body but not too bad considering that she has to work out as a cheerleader. Taking a seat on the couch you plot as to what your next move would be. A grin forms across your face making Lindsey looking a little devious if anyone were to see you. <i>You're a real trouble maker Ashley, I like that</i> Deciding that having a partner in crime would definitely be useful, you decide that Ashley the school newspaper girl would be the perfect person to fill such a spot. From what you have seen in her mind, she would love to get into the skin of others. The reason she seemed to run all those articles about the various groups in the school to make them look bad was done out of jealousy on her part. Especially the athletic crowd. Sure you could of used your best friend Jimmy but he's way to unpredictable and never plans ahead; of least with Ashley, she's smart and cunning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are content leaving Jimmy with Trish's skin, <i>He can be her or take her off and restore her for all you cared.</i> With your decision made, you decide to you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With your knowledge of Ashley's psyche, there's a chance that she might turn on you. At least with Jimmy, the two of you trust each others. <i>For now</i>, Ashley's mind quips, but you wave that away. Jimmy has been trustworthy with the pens, there's no telling what Ashley might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock on the wall captures your attention. <i>Aww shit</i>, you groan inwardly. Being too distracted by the pens, you've forgotten that you've got chemistry class lined up after the free period. Mrs. Lee will probably hang you if you missed her class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you make your way to a bathroom, whips out your phone and send a text to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Dude</i> where were you?'', the words sound strange coming out from Trish's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I was around,'' you smoothly reply. Not wanting to let Jimmy know that you've been wearing Lindsey's skin, you've ditched her skin and clothes in the girls' bathroom nearby and made your way back to the storage room in Ashley's skin. Lindsey should wake up anytime soon inside one of the cubicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to change back to David Anderson in the girls' bathroom though, ''Where's my stuff?'', you ask Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Here,'' Trish passes a plastic bag to you. Rummaging in it, you're relieved to see that Jimmy has not forgotten anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip quickly, but cast a glance at Trish, ''You're not getting out of her? We have Mrs. Lee for chemistry.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I know,'' Trish says lazily, ''I'm skipping, give me the pens.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, she's gonna kill you.'' you reminiscence about the time when Jimmy purposefully tinker with one of the bottles of solutions in the lab, of course no one can point the finger at Jimmy, but you noticed Mrs. Lee gave your friend a death glare. However, you toss the pair of pens to Trish, ''Well, you've got to anyway, Trish got her class too and I'm not letting her skip. Find someone else to <i>wear</i>.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy groans, but he starts to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious idea enters your mind, ''Although, I think I've got someone for you.'' You pick up Ashley's phone and dials a number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat your crotch area, it's reassuring to feel your usual equipment there again. After your short <i>meeting</i> with Ms. Martinez this morning, you've been deprived of it. The skin of Trish and Ashley and their clothes lay in a corner, shielded from view by some boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, not far away in front of you, Leah McBride stands in all her naked glory with a devious smile on her face. Her grayish blue eyes twinkle with mischief. You feel a tent forming in your pants as she brush her blonde hair away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Not bad dude,'' Leah grins and cup her generous bosom. That's one or perhaps two other things that Leah is known for aside from her flaring temper. And maybe her visage too. As Ashley, you don't notice that too much, but now you're <i>only</i> David, suddenly you realize that you've never stood this close to any of the popular girls, much less a cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nah, that's Ashley's idea.'' you turn away and start dressing Trish's body, the truth is, you're trying not to make the tent in your pants more apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'll leave you to it then.'' Leah hums a tune and you hear the door shuts behind you.''I've got cheerleading things to do.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was quick</i> you mutter silently as you labour to clothe Trish and Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour phone ringing distracts you from your research on your history homework at home. ''Turn your Skype on.'' a distinctively female voice commands you from the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh?'' you mutter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just do it,'' the voice from the other end insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jimmy?'' you say to the person on the other end whilst setting up your Skype. You haven't seen him or Leah at all after you got Leah for him in the storage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are bored anyway, so you decide to follow the instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, someone invites you for a video chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey,'' Leah's visage appears on your screen with a dazzling smile plastered on it. The smile isn't the only thing that captures your attention though, she's wearing a grey tank top, revealing her impressive cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, '' you stammer out after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles and doesn't seem to have any qualms that your were ogling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, wait here. I'm going to get something.'', she gets up from her seat and disappears from your screen, letting you see a glimpse of her room.

Casting your glance to your surroundings, you see hundreds of eyes are also watching them from the bleachers, some with admiration, some with envy, others, lust. After all, it's the graduation day of your cohort. The graduation ceremony has ended, closed with a speech from the head cheerleader herself, who also was the valedictorian of your cohort, not surprising though. After all, you've spent some time <i>as</i> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the bleacher, you could see Ashley White and a bit further, standing with the rest of the teachers, Ms. Martinez. There are a few other familiar faces that you notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Where's, Jimmy?'' your girlfriend gives you a nudge that breaks you away from your thoughts, ''It's not like him to miss something like this.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in the sight of the assemblage of cheerleaders who are getting into position, you recognize a lot of their faces, after all, with the pens' aid you were able to get to know them, some more intimately than others. <i>Sonya, Leah, Lindsey, Kelly, Meghan</i>, you rattle off the names in your head as one by one, they take their position. There are a few others that you don't really remember and there are some new faces, no doubt new recruits to replace the old guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you shrug as you really have no idea where Jimmy is,''He didn't say anything.'' you say a bit louder as the crowd has suddenly begin to get noisy, ''Trish?'' you ask Trish who's standing in the row behind. The last time you saw him was during group photos, before the speech by the principal. You are puzzled however, as Jimmy sent you a text message the night before, telling you to clear your schedule on graduation day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish shrugs, ''Knowing Jimmy, he probably is somewhere down there taking video,'' she laughs. Your girlfriend giggles and you chuckle at that. But your attention and several hundred others of students in your school are quickly distracted back to the cheerleaders who have begun their routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as all of the students start chanting in tune with the cheerleaders' routine, you find yourself joining them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Where were you dude?'', you plop down on a bean bag in Jimmy's room while your best friend struggles to improve his kill death ratio on a console. It's quite late in the afternoon when you got a text from Jimmy telling you to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I was there, don't worry,'' Jimmy says without taking his eyes off the telly. You crane your neck to look at the screen, but can't help but to snicker as you see his character gets himself killed by a camper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, for the love of-, Jimmy swears and rage quit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So what did you want me here for?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knowing smile appears on Jimmy's face and he produces a cloth bag from underneath his bed. ''Anna's holding a party, and we're invited.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, which- oh, Marquez?'' you pull a mental image of the brunette cheerleader. You remembered reading one of Ashley's articles that the Hispanic-American junior is a strong candidate to be the next head cheerleader, aside from Lindsey and Leah. You don't remember having worn her before, but she has a pleasant face, framed by her long hair that extends to a few inches below her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy pulls out a skin, much to your surprise, you recognize the person, ''So you were - ,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yep,'' Jimmy smirks as he lays the skin down on the floor, letting you see the features more clearly now. Jet black hair that is usually kept neat in a ponytail is freed. You imagine her high cheekbones, her taut body and the brown eyes. Sonya Xie's skin lies in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''When did you-?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Before her big speech,'' Jimmy cuts you again ,''You know, the one about dilligence, friendship, fun, and blah blah blah. Boring stuff, there's a lot that she doesn't tell us.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So that was you!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knowing grin spread on Jimmy's face, ''And a few days ago I made arrangement for our little party too, as her.'' Jimmy points to the skin laid out in front of you. ''See, I told Anna it's customary for <i>more realistic</i> candidates of next year's head cheerleader to give a small party.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And she bought it?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hook, line and sinker, thought I told her not to tell anyone.'' Jimmy rummages inside the bag again and pulls out another skin. ''Girls are obsessed with secrets.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Isn't that Kelly Miller?'', you grab the skin from Jimmy's hand and examine her features. Short platinum blonde hair covers her deflated face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yep, but anyway. They got a party tonight at her place.'' Jimmy grins and takes two more skins out from the bag,'' Leah, Lindsey, and maybe a few more girls.'' He tosses the skin of Leah and Lindsey to you, ''They didn't want to come, jealousy I suppose. I still don't get girls,'' a smirk appears on Jimmy's face as he brandishes the two pens that have changed your lives forever, ''But they might just change their mind.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at what Jimmy is suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Go on then,'' he tosses Sonya's skin near you, ''I'll let you choose first.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the assemblage of skins in front of you. After a short moment of thought you pick up a skin and get ready to change for the party.</span></div></div>",

''I know everything, <i>David</i>, the things you two have done and about these pens too,'' she brings the two pens into your field of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, not sure how to process all this.

She wears a grey hooded sweater which covers her torso and a matching track pants. You decide to go to Leah's and face the music. She lives in a rather typical neighborhood, which surprises you. You've always thought that the cheerleader bunch consists of well-off girls. <i>Well-off, good looking girls</i>, your mind corrects you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Get in,'' Leah says curtly and close the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, you follow her and pass through the living room. A woman in early forties smiles at you and you return the smile. Considering the face and blonde hair, you guess that the woman is Leah's mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the dining room, you see a middle aged man glares at you. <i>Must be her dad</i>, you thought. You attempt a feeble smile, but you swear you are only met with a more piercing stare. At least now you know where Leah got her demeanour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house, although not massive, is very spacious. Following Leah upstairs, you realize that this must be where the bedrooms are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''She got you too huh?'' Jimmy greets you after you and Leah have entered her room. There's a faint twinge of embarrassment in his apologetic smile. He's wearing the same clothes he wore earlier to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You son of a-,'' you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Boys,'' Leah's voice stops you. ''Drop it, yeah?'' She sits down on her bed and looks at you and Jimmy levelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and take a look around the room. It's a girl's room. Purple color dominates the room, save for the white ceiling. There are some teddy bears around the room and some make-up scattered on the vanity table. Aside from that, the room is sparse in detail except for a wardrobe and some drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey,'' Leah clicks her fingers,''Doesn't mean that you can look around.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy tries to suppress his snigger, but that just invites Leah's glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I've hidden the pens, so don't try anything,'' Leah lets her sentence hang to emphasize her threat,''Look, I know what you two were doing with the pens, yeah?'' Leah continues, ''Impersonating people at school, doing <i>things</i> as them, including me.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I couldn't believe my eyes when this piece of shit,'' she motions to Jimmy,''put on my little sister's skin and <i>transformed</i> into her.'' Leah's words are shaky with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your turn to glare at Jimmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''He then zapped himself with the brown pen and acted just like Sarah - my sister, would. He thought I didn't see him.'' A triumphant glint appears on her eyes. ''But I did, and gave him a taste of his own medicine. If it was Rob,'' Leah mentions the name of his older brother, the school's star quarterback last year before he graduated,''He would've ripped Jimmy apart.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look, whatever we did,'' you try to apologise, ''We're sorry, and we won't use the pens ever again, right?'' you turn to Jimmy. Although the pens has open up your world, they do bring to the fore, some of your more malevolent nature. You remember the time when you were wearing Ashley's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh, yeah. I'm really sorry.'' Jimmy mumbles half-heartedly. Just like he usually does when one of his pranks got discovered before it could blow up on someone's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''If you want to make up for it,'' Leah says softly, ''there's something that you two can do.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a thin smile on Leah's face. From your longstanding friendship with Jimmy, you know whatever comes out next won't be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There're some people at school,'' Leah continues,'' who would benefit from having someone else fill in their shoes, temporarily. Give them a new perspective. People like Ashley, that double crossing bitch,'' she pauses, ''or Lindsey, the girl thinks she's so smart.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy perks up at that, a stupid grin plastered over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'll keep hold of the pens and give you the skins to wear and things you have to do,'' Leah ignores him, ''But if you're really good, <i>sometimes </i> I might let you choose who you want to wear.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm in!'' Jimmy exclaims excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Looks like your friend's in,'' Leah turns to you, ''Of course I can't force you.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give it a good think. As much as the pens has allowed you to experience things that you wouldn't even possibly dream before, but the pens have been and could continue to be a source of much troubles. Your mind remembered the time when you found the pens abandoned on your front porch. It's unlikely that they appear there by accident. Someone must've placed it there and you're not sure you want to know who they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might be a good chance for you to walk away from those pens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Jimmy, who now couldn't contain his excitement and at Leah, who continues to wait for your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm - ,'' before you realize it, you've started to speak.</span></div></div>",

So you don't dawdle around and in insert the your arms into the holes where they should be going and pull Kelly's face over yours to complete the transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't just the set of weights that's now attached to your chest that disorients you, but also that you feel a few inches closer to the ground than you normally would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly Miller isn't a petite girl, but neither is she tall by any measure. In fact, now that you have measured yourself against Jimmy's bookshelf, she's barely taller than Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance downwards and immediately, your field of view is obscured by the set of weights that you've desperately try to keep your mind away from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy hell</i> your mind screams when you push the mounds together using the sides of upper arms. An impressive cleavage forms between your boobies. There's no way to see your feet at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa,'' a female voice tears you away forcefully from your thoughts,\"Guess what they say is true, the bigger the mountains the better the view.'' That's Meghan and she sports an awfully out-of-place goofy smirk that only Jimmy can muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's not what it- ,'' you stop yourself, realising that the voice emanating from your throat is of a higher pitch. But that's not the only thing that makes you stop mid-sentence. Although Jimmy's stupid grin is plastered all over Meghan's face, it doesn't stop you from ogling her in all her naked glory from the neck down, ''- meant,'' you finally get to finish your sentence, just as Meghan sashays towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You guys better be ready!'', Leah's voice comes from the other side of the door, ''Or <i>else</i>.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fucking hell,'' the words sound off coming from Meghan's mouth. ''I suppose we better get dressed then, before the bitch comes in.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I heard that!,'' Leah's voice booms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good!,'' Jimmy shouts back, but he complies, going over to take Meghan's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh a relief and collect Kelly's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What now?'', Meghan folds her arms and look at Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, <i>is this</i>,'' Leah whips out the brown pen from her purse and zaps Meghan squarely on her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa,'' Meghan reels back. She blinks twice before a smirk comes to her face, ''Oh, <i>I see</i>. Very smart.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you mean?, '' just as the words escape you lips, memories flood into your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Laters!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't forget!, Leah exclaims just before you exit the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time before entering Kelly's house. You saunter through the living room, the room  feels both alien and familiar to you at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it a bit further, you walk to the kitchen and rummage around the refrigerator for some orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mooom,'' a voice cuts through the whole house as your lips are about to touch the bottle. You look around to see the source of the voice. <i>Ugh</i>. That's Kelly's reaction when you see Sarah Miller, Kelly's 10 years old kid sister standing by the doorway between the living room and the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What is it sweetheart?'', a woman in her mid-forties comes to her, which your mind tell you is Kelly's mother. Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Kelly's drinking straight from the bottle,'' she tattles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Kelly,'' the mother gives you a look of disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ugh, fine,'' you relent, and see Sarah sticks her tongue out playfully. You take your time drinking the orange juice, whilst having some small talk with <i>your</i> family members. Before, you are having a hard time differentiating your thoughts to the thoughts of the people whom you're wearing. Now as you engage Samantha and Sarah to some idle talk about school, you remark in your mind of how smoothly you are able to carry out the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou excuse yourself though, there's something else that you want to do upstairs. In <i>your</i> room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder course through your body, but you persist, tweaking your already hard nipple. Looking at your own disheveled reflection in the mirror, it's clear that you've start to get yourself in a fine state. You exhale slowly, as if trying to channel the reverberation within yourself outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your boobs rest on the palm of your hands, before giving them an appreciative squeeze. It turns into a full on fondle as you attempt to cover every inch of your supple mounds with your curious fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should be ready about now</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grind your crotch and bust on the bed, working yourself good. You whimper and will yourself on as you tease the outside of your cunny with one hand, whilst making a neat work of your bosom with the other as the pressure and intensity continue building from deep within you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you plunge your fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and beg for mercy from yourself as your fingers move around. Seemingly having a mind of their own, hitting the desired places, amplifying those reverberations. And you keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the explosion happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp for air as waves of immense ecstasy wreck your entire fiber of being. It leaves you weak with tears forming around the corner of your eyes. After catching your breath, you let yourself relax in the afterglow, feeling content and sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chimes from Kelly's phone wakes you up. Meghan's requesting a video call. <i>What's Meghan - </i> then you remember that Meghan's currently being worn by Jimmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, fuck</i> you jerk and look at the clock. Relief washes over you when you realise you still have some time to prepare for the party. Instead, you quickly wrap a bathrobe around your body and accept the call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey,'' Meghan waves at you on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey,'' you say weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look what I could do,'' the screen zooms out a bit. Before you see Meghan again, but this time, she's in a perfect split position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would've impressed you, but then again, Kelly have seen a split executed perfectly many times, '' I'm hanging up, I need to prepare.'' you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait! Wait!'' Meghan quickly exclaim, ''</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A Jimmy-esque grin that looks out-of-place appears on Meghan's face. She holds up what seems to look like a facial mask, before she moves a few steps back. Then you recognize the mask as Leah's deflated face, you can see the rest of her body too, flapping lifelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips and you bolt to sit upright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What? How did you manage to do that?'' you stammer, not entirely believing your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You have much to learn, young Padawan, '' Meghan puts the skin away from your view. Instead, the pens are now shown on your screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm coming there right away,'' you get up from the bed. Your unrestrained bosom jiggle violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait,'' Meghan's voice emanates from the speaker on your phone, ''Better yet, let's meet up at the party. See you there!'' The screen goes out as the video call is terminated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the-?</i>. That's typical Jimmy. Doing what he wants, dragging everyone in his wake and as usual, you're the one who have to keep a <br>\r\nwatchful eye on him. Despite that, you feel a gush of relief, knowing that at least your fate (and Jimmy's) doesn't rest on a junior's every whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab some clothes that Kelly has prepared for the party. Apparently, the party's important, then again, <i>everything</i> that Sonya held is important. You take some new scanties too, having soiled your old ones, before making a beeline for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya greets you with a hug. ''Glad you could make it girl.'' She looks rather different than usual, wearing a dark rimmed rectangular glasses that complements her high cheekbone, with her hair pulled back in a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks babe,'' you reply, drawing from Kelly's mind directly. You let yourself sink into Kelly's mind. That's when you realise that the two of them don't get on too well. Kelly resented Sonya for taking the position of head cheerleader and always thought that the girl who transferred over in her junior year won the position because of her parents' wealth. Kelly herself isn't living in relative poverty, but having a mansion with private pool pretty much blows the everyone else out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Everyone's over by the pool. If you want a bite, there should be something in the pantry,'' Sonya beams a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sure,'' you quip, ''Have you seen Meghan, or Leah?'' you ask. You haven't been able to get in contact with Jimmy, but as you see a few other guests walking around, it's clear that he wouldn't be here in his own skin, as you wouldn't. You look around, <i>Cheerleaders and some important people, huh</i>. So these are the <i>important people</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya looks around, ''Meghan's here,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou engage Sonya in some small talk, before heading to the pantry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat something turns to be a full fledged feast. Pizzas, canapes, and cheesecakes are laid out in the open, overlooking the pool just a few meters beyond it. There are some drinks laid out, there doesn't seem to be any alcoholic drinks served. Although that just means that everyone brings their own as you see some empty beer cans laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Kyle Portman feeding himself some cheesecake with his fingers. He used a knife to cut a square out of the cake, decided it was too much hassle to use the plastic fork and took it into his fingers and swallowed the thing whole. It's a disgusting but amusing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, seen Meghan anywhere?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice his eyes flick to your chest, where they rest for a brief moment, then to your own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''She's just there,'' he points to the direction of the pool, before forgetting the rest of his dignity and lick his fingers clean. It's astounding how this guy is an important person, a thought that Kelly's mind shares with yours. Although you know that it's because he's a star basketball player. A damn good one at it too, rumours have it that some colleges have actually offered him sport scholarships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sugar tits,\" he winks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually laugh as you walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab Meghan by the wrist and lead her to one of the less crowded corners of the mansion. Mansion is the correct term to describe Sonya's house. It's huge with a massive pool at the back of the house where most people are now located. ''What were you thinking?'' you say in a hushed tone. ''Where's Leah?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Left her in the car,'' a wide grin appears on Meghan's face. She pops a small square of cheesecake into her mouth, ''Have you seen this place? It's huge.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I have, '' you say. ''Wait, that's not the point, how did you do it?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's not the right time, yet,'' Meghan insists and discreetly wipes her hand on a beautiful embroidered table cloth, ''Speaking of which,'' she raises her tone, ''Great party, Sonya.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks girls,'' Sonya hugs you both, ''Join us in the pool will you?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Sonya's gone you see Anna Marquez -  one of the cheerleaders -  and Jackson Myers -school quarterback- discreetly walking upstairs. There's a twinge of jealousy pulsating within you and that's when you realize that Kelly has got her eyes set on the quarterback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Woops,'' Meghan says, she must've seen them slinks away too, ''Looks like Leah's plan goes down the drain.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What?'' you say querulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Duh</i>,'' she sigh, ''Do I have to explain everything here? The reason Leah gives us these,'' she points at you and then herself, ''is so that she gets a clear shot at Jackson,'' she adds in a lower tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes follows the pair until they disappears from the spiraling stairs upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan links her arm around yours, ''Don't worry, we'll do something about them later. Let's enjoy the party for now.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime flies and despite never attending one of these parties for important people before, you realise they're not that much different from the parties that your cliques often made. There was even a lone wolf smoking something out of a bong in one of the corner of the pool. Except for, of course, the venue. Most people have left but as you're waiting for Jimmy, you're still in there, chatting in a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry boys and girls, I have to borrow her for a while,'' suddenly Meghan appears out of nowhere and takes your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Are we going now?'', you voice your concerns as Meghan leads you around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, oh, there she is,'' Meghan quips. A few paces in front, you spot Sonya and Ryan Chambers, the student council president, among three other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey girls,'' Sonya sees the two of you and waves you to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Can we talk for a minute?'', Meghan states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, sure. Join us.'' Sonya scoots over, moving closer to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's something important,'' Meghan says, not moving from where she stands, ''Isn't it?'', she turns to look at you. Having been subjected to that, you have no other choice but to nod, awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown appears on Sonya's face briefly, before it dissipates as quickly as it appeared, ''I guess I better take a look at it then''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan leads you and Sonya upstairs into a vacant room. She points to a T-shirt sprawled on the floor, ''Isn't that Myers'?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya looks puzzled and bend down to inspect it, as soon as she does that though, she quickly begins to deflate. Meghan holds the black pen triumphantly in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Help me strip,'' Meghan say, turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make short work of Meghan's clothes and Jimmy pops out from inside Meghan, before sauntering over to Sonya's skin and inserting his body inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have the honour of zapping the Jimmy-infused Sonya with the brown pen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

''It's like an unfair advantage to the rest of humanity,'' Jimmy then goes into a full rant about how good Sonya's life is. Coming from a very wealthy family, she's both smart and well endowed. Both of her parents are negotiating some business in China, and so gives her the room to throw a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You haven't told me about how you get those pens off Leah,'' you interrupt Jimmy's rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Must you be caught up about it?'' Sonya moans as she slips her matching panties on, ''I got Leah to lend me the brown pen, and that's what she did. So, I must've been really pissed because I zapped her with it, as if I'm zapping her with the black pen.'' She pauses while she grabs her clothes off the floor, ''Then the strangest thing happened, her memories flowed into my mind. So I found out where she kept the black pen and zapped her with it.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must've been a stroke of luck, as neither you nor Jimmy knows that the brown pen can do that. You thought it only works after you don a skin. That must've been the reason why Leah allowed Jimmy to borrow the brown pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That bitch, she had it with her all the time.'' Sonya efficiently gets herself looking decent again. Lastly, she puts on her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are you going to do now?'', you stop Sonya as she walks to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Getting back to <i>my</i>party of course,'' she says confidently, ''I can't leave the guests like that,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That was a rush,'' Sonya lays down on her bed whilst you look at her. The last of the guests have returned home, leaving you and Jimmy alone in the mansion. Although of course there's a housekeeper who's currently cleaning the mess left behind by the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya gets up, ''Now that we're here, and won't be interrupted'' she sashays towards you, ''Why don't we have some fun? Who'd you want to wear? Or you'd rather be plain ol' David?'' she gestures to the array of skins spread on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Anna, Leah, Meghan, Jackson</i> and of course, Kelly, who's skin you're now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, who should you be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The chapter is split due to word count)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are pondering the choices you have in front of you, when you hear the sound of fingers being clicked. ''Why don't you try her out?'', a wicked grin appears on Sonya's face, Jimmy is referring of course, to Sonya. You look up at the head cheerleader, Jimmy has gotten her stripped to a matching pair of black lace scanties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I thought you're going to to let me pick!'', you protest, trying to avert your gaze at her exposed DD cups, although of course, as you gaze downwards <i>your own</i> DD cups fill your field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We'll be here all day,'' as soon as Sonya finishes her sentence, ''You're gonna like her.'' She peels the skin at the back of her neck forward, shutting her eyes, as the skin folds move forward, her facial expression relax as she loses the ability to make them and an unnatural bulge appears on the nape of her neck. Jimmy reveals his head as he lets Sonya's hang over his breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine your reflection in the mirror. There's the distinctive high cheekbones, you muse to yourself. As your gaze travels downward, it comes into contact with the pair of DD cups that you try to avoid just minutes earlier. Eagerly, you cup them in your hands, weighing the soft and supple mounds on your palms. Much to your surprise, the sizeable mounds are bigger than Kelly's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping to take a breather, you marvel at the technology behind the pens. Your eyesight is actually rather blurred and you theorise that Sonya is actually shortsighted. You grab the black rimmed glasses on the vanity table and don them on. Instantly, you feel everything comes into focus. She must have been wearing contact lenses at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand cupping your buttocks makes you yelp in surprise. You turn around to see Jackson Myers, the school quarterback stands just inches in front of you, ''So? Not bad right?'' A Jimmy-esque grin appears on his face. You can see his abdominal muscles and the tree-trunk thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude,'' you protest. You stop yourself. You have been accustomed to hearing yourself speak as Kelly, hearing a slightly accented voice coming out from your mouth sounds rather weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy however, doesn't seem to hear you as his eyes are fixated upon your mounds. Suddenly, with Jimmy ogling you, you feel very naked and cover your exposed bosom with an arm and your cunny with your free hand. You inadvertently see his cock going erect as if in slow motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I want to call a favour,'' Jimmy says when he has been freed from his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What favour,''? you narrow your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You remember the counselor office?'' The grin on Jimmy's face unsettles you, ''Where Ms. Martinez gave you a blowjob?'' Jackson shakes his semi-erect penis in front of you with a goofy Jimmy-esque look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, I'm not putting that in my mouth,'' even in it's semi-erect form, Jackson's shaft is bigger than yours, as much as you hate to admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Maybe this will change your mind,'' Jackson holds up the brown pen and the next thing you know, memories of Sonya's life filters into your mind, unbidden.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No?'' Jackson looks at you with puppy eyes that Jimmy usually pulls when he tries to get you or Trish to take part in one of his crazy schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No,'' you reply curtly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But Sonya doesn't have a problem with it before. You should know, you have her entire mind in there now.'' Jackson points at your head. ''Well, it was a little big for her mouth.'' Jackson chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush as you catch a glimpse of Jackson's now fully erect shaft. Apparently, the head cheerleader and the captain of the football team had enjoyed some tete-a-tete without anyone else knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, I might look like this, but I'm not Sonya,'' you get up and start to don on Sonya's scanties, trying your hardest to suppress Sonya's carnal desire. Ignoring the growing wetness in your panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please,'' Jackson pleads, ''Just use your hands then. I'll stop after I blew my load. I promise.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate as you're about to get your new body looking decent again. Jackson's shaft is still looking like it is going to poke someone's eye out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Please. It'll be just like jerking yourself off.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tremble at the thought of what you are about to do, ''Fine, just once.'' the voice comes out from your mouth, but you're not thinking clearly anymore. Slowly, you approach Jackson's lumbering form and wrap a hand around the girth of his cock. You feel it throbs and pulsates wildly as if it's an independent living being. You had to use another hand to help cover the entire length of his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring it's better to get it over and done with as quickly as possible, you tap into Sonya's mind. Much to your surprise, she has had a lot of experiences. You try to blot out the ones where she did it with Jackson even as you move your hands up and down the shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started stroking the entire length slowly, just like Sonya's mind tells you to. Then you gradually pick up the pace as Jackson thrusts his hip backwards and forwards. You ignore the tip of his dick which rubs slightly against the underside of your panties every time he thrusts his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson's legs tremble and from Sonya's mind, you see this as a cue. Gripping the shaft tightly in your hands, you coax its underside. Jackson's grunt and the warm and sticky feeling on your slim and toned stomach tells you that the deed has been done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There, done.'' Your voice is shaky and breathless. You could hear Jackson's laboured breathing. The cock in your hands, however, just continues to pulsate and throb wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm sorry, I just can't,'' Jackson takes you by surprise as he effortlessly lift your body and unceremoniously dump you on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jim-,'' you try to yelp, but the sight of Jackson yanking your panties off and splitting your legs wide stops you. You never finished whatever you are about to say as you gasp when he slides inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun's already high when you wake up the next day. There's no sign of Jimmy anywhere, although the assortment of skins are still there. You take note of the array of lifeless skins who are really students at your school. Slowly, you slide off the bed and walk to the en-suite bathroom in Sonya's room. You feel dirty and sticky, so you welcome the warm water that pelts your entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as the memories from last night starts to sink in. You've done it on the bed, on the vanity table and on the bed again. It has been a while since Sonya got laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time in the shower, exploring every inch of your borrowed body. Admiring her taut and long legs, the hip that supports her ample bosom. If you were on the receiving side of the handjob you gave Jimmy yesterday, you'll probably have came in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Last night was good, right?'' Kelly has an annoying smirk plastered on her face when she sees you coming out from the bathroom. That's the skin that was missing from the pile. She's wearing a tracksuit that you know belongs to Sonya, Jimmy must have taken her for a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look, I know I was being a dick last night. But I just couldn't stop.'' Kelly stands up and looks at you in the eyes, ''You seemed to like it too.'' she sniggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You mean, you're just being you?'' you can't help but to recount the intense pleasure you've felt last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look, we've got this <i>power</i>,'' Kelly slowly unzips her tracksuit to reveal her generous bosom, encased in Sonya's black lace bra. ''There's a lot of things that we can do,'' both the tracksuit and the bra drops to the floor. Kelly then jiggles her boobs alternately in front of your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''With greater power comes greater responsibility, you should know.'' you reprimand your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't you mean fun?'', Kelly pushes you on to the bed and undoes your bathrobe. ''Like this, '' she spreads open your legs and buries her face into your pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, what do you think we should do with her?'' Jimmy looks at you, motioning to the Leah skin that lays sprawled on his bed. The two of you have exited your borrowed 'skins' and re-inflated them. But there's still the problems of Leah. She had found out about the pens and the things you two have done with those pens. So you decided to go to Jimmy's place and think things over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''She knows about us and the pens,'' you say, ''But we can't just make her 'disappear', she's got a family.'' you state slowly, as if you're convincing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Right,'' Jimmy paces around the room, ''and we can't 'play' her all the time. We've got our own family. Our own lives to live. We've even got school on Monday.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, what do you think?'' you glance at Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know dude,'' Jimmy says in exasperation. ''I wish she never found out. I'll go with whatever you decide.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it's typical Jimmy trying to avoid making decisions that he might be blamed for later, but at the same time, Leah's still a problem you have to find a solution to....</span></div></div>",

Jimmy holds the skin up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We can't let her 'go missing'. Think about their family,'' you take the skin from Jimmy's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, but,'' Jimmy pauses, ''Well, I guess it'll be fine. After all, no one will believe her anything she says about these pens right?'' Jimmy chuckles nervously, ''Everyone's gonna think she's bat-shit crazy.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Exactly, '' you nod in approval, ''We'll just have to be more careful from now on.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I know, I know. Stop bringing it up alright?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up the black pen and aim it at the lifeless skin that was once and will again be Leah, before Jimmy stops you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Not here,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What? Why?'' you look at him incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What if she gone crazy and wrecks my place?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''She won't.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You can't guarantee that.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, where?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let me think,'' Jimmy paces around the room, ''The school's empty at this time.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sling the duffel bag you're carrying over the fence that separates the school's boundaries from a local park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Come on,'' Jimmy urges you from the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fucking hell,'' you mutter. Of course you can go through the front, but that will risk you and Jimmy getting seen by members of the soccer team who's using the school grounds for practice, some which are your friends. Instead, the two of you opted to enter from the rear side where there's a lot of buildings that would usually be used for various extracurricular subjects during school hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a soft thud and swiftly move to Jimmy's position behind a wall after he gave the thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking doubly sure that no one sees you, you take out Leah's skin from the duffel bag. You and Jimmy have tried to dress her up as well as you can. Of course, it was hard going as the clothes just seem to 'wrap' around the skin with no body to hold them in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set Leah's skin on the ground and wait as time takes its course and Leah's skin starts to fill. Thankfully, her clothes remain in place and cover her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think we should just go,'' Jimmy fidgets nervously whilst looking around the perimeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We need to tell her,'' you state. It feels like you've been waiting for an age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Still- '' Jimmy protests, but he doesn't get the chance to finish as you silence him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''She's stirring,'' you whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah wakes up with a jolt and stares at you and Jimmy wide eyed. Just as she is about to open her mouth, you whip out the black pen and point it at her. Leah flinches as if you're holding a loaded gun aimed at her head, slowly her lips shut together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We've got the pens back now,'' you say in slowly, ''I'm sorry about what this dick did to you,'' you motion to Jimmy, ''But we promise to leave you alone, if you leave us alone.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah,'' Jimmy quips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defiance on Leah's face fades slowly and she bobs her head down and then up again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good,'' you whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jimmy then exit the school the same way the two of you came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, that was fucking cool!'' Jimmy chuckle, '''We promise to leave you alone, if you leave us alone''', he repeats the line you said just minutes ago, although with some exaggeration that makes you look like someone from the mafia in a really crappy movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'd rather not do it again,'' you take a bite from your burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry about it. I'll be careful from now on.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend, or what's left of it prove to be quite fruitful and rather calm. You're able catch up on your date with the girlfriend and get a decent amount of work done for a school project you have been neglecting while the pens are relegated to the bottom of your desk drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Am I interrupting anything?'' Jimmy says with a sly smile as he introduces himself to your table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jimbo,'' John raises an eyebrow at your best friend, ''Depends on what sort of trouble you gave Ms. Martinez this morning,'' but he scoots nearer to his girlfriend to give some space for Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I haven't. I've been behaving.'' Jimmy says in faux innocence, which elicits a snort from Eric who now sits in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's lunchtime and you're in your table, with some of the usual suspects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's John Fletcher and his girlfriend, Samantha Brown. You are fairly close to the couple, having gone through some double date with them. Samantha is actually Jessica's best friend, or BFF as they like to refer themselves as. You got to know John better when he transferred over to your school and joined the soccer team as the goalie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's Trish whom you've got to know well since years and years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen lastly, there's Eric Nguyen. The only person in your clique that wears glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn many sense, it's as if things are back to normal. That's what you think before your eyes catch Leah's. She quickly averts your gaze and settles to her own table, with fellow cheerleaders. There's an unspoken convention in the school that there are some tables in the cafetaria 'reserved' for the A-listers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You thinking to use the pens?'' Jimmy speaks after the last class ends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, why?'' you say in-between packing up your things. You have practice with the rest of the soccer team after school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let me borrow them.'' Jimmy gets straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fine,'' you grab the pens from the bottom of your bag. You've been reluctant to leave it at home, for the fear of someone accidentally finding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Great, thanks!'' Jimmy couldn't snatch the pens fast enough from your hands and bolts out of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What's gotten into him?'', John approaches you. ''It's just some pens.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know,'' you shrug.</span></div></div>",

The library at a Saturday isn't exactly the most packed room in town. A few senior citizen huddle around the newspaper area not far away from the research area where you, John, Jessica and Samantha set up camp to tackle a history project. It's as much a joint research effort as it is a double date. From the corner of your eyes, the library lady, hell-bent on preserving the order and silence at the library busies herself with some magazine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a week has passed from the time you gave the pens to Jimmy. Although you saw him at school and sometimes after classes, he seemed to be less available than he generally would be. You try not to think about Jimmy abusing the powers of the pens, but that's the most plausible explanation in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What's so interesting?'' Samantha returns with some books and with Jessica in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just discussing our third wheels,'' you say, ''They've gone AWOL.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't mind. They could get a bit distracting sometimes, ''Samantha says and takes the seat beside John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You distract me,'' John leans in and snatches a quick peck. Maybe a bit more than just a quick peck afterwards, but you don't really pay attention anymore as your girlfriend takes her seat beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn many sense, it's the return to normalcy that you doubted you'll never see again after you found those pens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for the nagging doubt at the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I haven't seen you all week, what are you up to?'' you put down the controller and grin smugly. You're back at Jimmy's on Sunday afternoon to give him the mandatory once-a-week whipping at FIFA Ultimate Team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Stuffs,'' Jimmy shrugs and throws his controller on his bed. Try as he might, he never beat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour conversation is interrupted by a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes, come in!,'' Jimmy yells without taking his eyes off the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather comes in wearing a white tank top and denim hot pants. You quickly try to avert your gaze as to not ogle her directly. You haven't seen her since the time that she was turned into a lifeless skin that Jimmy then wore. The first victim of the pair of pens in your possession. Your mind goes to the time when she crawled on top of you, her body brushing against yours. The tank top and hot pants leave little to imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you want?'' Jimmy doesn't glance at his sister as he continues to fiddle with the setup of his team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just looking at what you're up to, twerp,'' Heather snarkily answers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Then you can make yourself useful and be a witness of me beating David at FIFA,'' a grin spreads over Jimmy's, ''Sorry dude, you're going down.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whatever,'' Heather sits beside you with her legs crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dream on dude,'' you chuckle. You're not going to let Jimmy win and you certainly wouldn't now, especially now Heather's sitting beside you. You glance to your right, at where Heather is seated, but you focus your attention back at the screen. The match has just started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Lucky shot,'' Jimmy curses after you scored a goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Looks like Heather's going to be a witness of my victory after all,'' you chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We'll see about that,'' Jimmy mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jump out of your skin when you feel a hand snakes along the side of your thigh. While it isn't enough to make you jump, it's still enough to make your team lose possession of the ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's the comeback!'' Jimmy says in glee as his team scored against yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the fuck?</i>, you glance at Heather, but she's fixated on the screen and doesn't look at you. You notice that she's sitting a few inches further back from where you're sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second half, you make a few good chances, but the anticipation of something unusual happening kills your concentration  and you end up wasting those chances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''David'', you hear a barely audible whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring it, you focus even more on the match. You can't lose now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''David, David,'' the whispers are still barely audible, but they've picked up some sense of urgency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you can't help but to glance at the direction of the voice, only to see Heather shaking her boobs at you. Her tank top is pulled up, just above her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Alright!,'' Jimmy's shout snaps you back to reality. His team has scored another goal, ''Looks like you're going to lose,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scores in the dying minutes of the game and there isn't any time for you to get another goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, what,'' you say, flabbergasted. ''Jimmy, I-''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're not getting away out of this one dude,'' Jimmy chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, Heather, she was-,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What was I doing?'' Heather cuts in with a quizzical look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You were-, '' now you can't finish your sentence as you feel Jimmy's and Heather's eyes look at you intently, ''Fuck,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is it wrong that I want to shake my boobs at your face?'' Heather grins uncharacteristically and strips her tank top off. Meanwhile, Jimmy howls with laughter just centimetres away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, the look on your face,'' Jimmy can't contain his laughter for the umpteenth time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fucking hell Jimmy,'' you mutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You guys should've let me in sooner,'' Eric quips. Of course, the entire fiasco involving Heather was orchestrated by Jimmy, with Eric's help. Apparently, Jimmy has told Eric about your new playthings and the two of them conspired to play a prank on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Still, it was pretty neat, wasn't it?'' Jimmy holds up the deflated skin of Heather and casts it on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I still can't believe that these pens are able to let me be anyone, '' Eric says with a hint of curiousity in his voice. ''The technology behind this thing must be from some alien source or it could be secret government research. How did it end up with you?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know,'' you shrug. A lot of the things that happened doesn't make a lot of sense to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's hard to describe, but I felt like I was really Heather,'' Eric nods at the skin, ''Except for a small voice in the back of my mind that retains my sense of self. I even seemed to turn into her.'' Eric takes off his glasses, ''Normally, I couldn't even see clearly without my glasses.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look, are we just going to discuss about these pens all day, or are we going to make a good use out of them?'' Jimmy takes the pens away from you and Eric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you have in mind?'' Eric re-adjusts his glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, the three of us have the entire day free tomorrow,'' Jimmy smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, what?'' you can't believe your ears. It's true the three of you have some free classes, but not all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry about it young Padawan. We took care of everything.'' Jimmy shares a knowing smile with Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Jesus</i>, Jimmy. Just promise me no one got sent to the ER.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Have you guys told John about these pens?'' Eric's question draws both your attention and Jimmy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No,'' Jimmy says slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, we should, then we'll have our D'Artagnan.'' Eric quip, ''He should have all his subjects all cleared out tomorrow as well.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, I don't think we should let him now about this.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why don't we let him decide,'' Eric turns to you. </span></div></div>",

You and Jimmy are back in the Counselor's Office almost an hour before the school starts. This time, Eric comes along with the two of you. You managed to convince Eric that it was best for John not to know about the existence of the pens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, hurry up,'' you whisper when you see Jimmy holds up the skin of Julia Martinez for Eric to see. Every footstep that you hear emanating from the hallway makes you more and more paranoid that one of those footsteps will stop right in front of the door of the Counselor's Office and demand to see Ms. Martinez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hold her for me,'' Jimmy hands Ms. Martinez over to Eric and starts to strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Tell him to hurry the fuck up,'' you mouth to Eric, who is just standing there whilst Jimmy holds the skin of Ms. Martinez back in his hands again. You have no desire to explain to anyone who might walk into the Counselor's Office why a naked Jimmy Wilson is holding what looked like a deflated sex doll that is uncannily resemble Julia Martinez in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I never thought that I'll be looking forward going to this place again,'' Jimmy throw a grin in your direction. He gets your annoyance though, or maybe it's the prospect of being able to wear Ms. Martinez again. Swiftly, he plunges his legs into Ms. Martinez's hollow ones. You just hope that by standing in front of the door, the silhouette of your head blocks the silhouette of Ms. Martinez's body reconstructing itself as Jimmy's body disappears inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's good to be back'', Julia Martinez shakes her head to let her long black curls settle down over her shoulders. She then grins uncharacteristically at Eric, who is standing just a few inches opposite her and who is taking in the sight up close and personal, ''Liking what you're seeing?'' Julia hefts her breasts and thrusts them to your friend's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but to notice the rising tightness in your pants and you can't help to think what's going on inside Eric's mind at the moment. But you do know that the only thing worse than being in a room with Jimmy Wilson holding a deflated Julia Martinez sex doll look-alike, is to be in a room with a naked and slutty Ms. Martinez shoving her breasts towards another student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jimmy,'' you beckon your friend and motion to the pile of black jacket, matching pencil skirt and a white blouse that belonged to Julia Martinez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Almost forgot,'' Julia giggles, ''But first, hit me up,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the brown pen from your pocket and with a sweaty palm, zap Julia with it. The student counselor reels from the ray as Julia's mind filters into Jimmy's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Holy shit,'' Eric breathes. For a moment, you think he might hyperventilate, but he sits himself down on the couch and take a few deep breaths. ''This shit is awesome.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, now.'' Julia Martinez looks respectable again when she beckons you and Eric to sit down on the other side of her desk, ''What can I help you boys with?'' She pauses and a knowing smirk appears on her face, ''Anyone special in particular?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looks at you uncertainly, ''Well,'' he hesitates, ''Ughh.'' Eric groans. You are surprised to see Julia's feet encased in stockings are stroking at Eric's tent underneath the desk with a certain fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude,'' you start to say when Julia interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You'll have your turn later,'' Julia interjects, but she doesn't take her attention away from Eric. ''Your friend here did very well yesterday and helped Jimmy won the game, so I think he needs to be rewarded a little bit.'' Julia walks to a wooden cabinet nearby and takes out a sealed condom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school counselor then walks to Eric and unzips his pants, before fishing out his half flaccid member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''A bit on the small side, isn't it?'' the counselor smirks and opens the packet in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, not cool.'' Clearly your friend Eric is unamused by the earlier comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia slips the condom on Eric's shaft and at the same time, strokes the entire length with her dainty fingers. ''You're going to have to prove me wrong then.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fuckkkk,'' Eric curses as a wave of pleasure emanates from his dick and up his spine. Jimmy uses a hand to jerk your friend off whilst with the other he is groping Julia's breasts vigorously. Eric's member is quickly standing at attention by the ministration and the sight of the usually strict Ms. Martinez feeling herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're not thinking of cumming yet,'' Julia states, although it sounds more like a command. The stimulation proves too much for Eric however, as he shoots his load inside the condom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That saves the cleaning up,'' Julia returns to the Room after flushing the used condom down the toilet. You don't even argue that it's bad since condoms aren't the easiest thing to breakdown naturally. ''I hope you guys have come out with some names.''</span></div></div>",

You cannot understand why would Eric suggest two of the biggest Jocks in the school. <br>\r\n\"Miss Martinez\" Eric said as he looked towards you. \" We shall give her an old school private lesson.\" Eric had a crooked smile and you at that moment knew what he had in mind with those two boys. The duo were your batch's most physical sharpened dudes. You remember once in the locker room getting a glimpse of John's equipment after the shower. The dude was blessed with a rod alright. You remember you were quite put down after that moment. Its not that you were any bad but he was insanely gifted. Genes you thought to yourself. John had a sister Rachel, a blond beauty with a body of a star singer like a young Katey Perry. She was surprisingly not a cheer leader. You knew she could easily get in the squad. You remember that she was quite athletic back in the days but her brother's sheer dominance in the schools sport team and constant sleeping with the cheer leader squad made her avoid that scene entirely. She was however dating John. You never had any gripe against John but he was quite possibly the most well sculpted lad in the school, more so than Brad. Because his black hair and dark eyes were something your girl would sometimes get lost into. He was a nice, specially among the jocks. You could tell that if Brad was the tank of the football team, John was the carry. <br>\r\nJimmy or rather Juila let out a laugh but it sounded almost cute coming out of miss Martinez's mouth. \"Hurt your feelings, have I Eric?\". As she moved closer to the mic to make the call. \" Na, miss Martinez, there is no one I would rather do in this school at the moment and I always had  thing for her.\" He continued. \" You know but the thing involved a gang bang and a lot of deepthroating\". Julia looked taken back for a second but let out a sly smile from her face. I guess you could say memory and experience of Julia mixed with Jimmy's willing to try anything made it all more interesting. <br>\r\n\"Well this should be fun boys, let's get you something larger first.\" She winks and calls in the Brad and John.<br>\r\nAfter awhile they entered the room saw miss Julia sitting on the table with her perfectly round butt resting on the edge of the furniture. \"Come in boys, have a sit. I need you to fill me up on something.\" As they sat down Brad's body flattened and dropped into the chair with his clothes. John shocked and confused as he looked next to the bag of skin sliding off the chair; got zapped; and after a moment was nothing but a male sex doll.

What about her family?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm dead serious,'' you look at your best friend, square in the eyes, ''I'm making this choice for both of us, unless you want to decide what we're going to do with her.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Shit dude,'' Jimmy paces around his room, before slumping on the bed, ''Fuck, it wasn't to be like this.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, it did, because you fucked up,'' the tone in your voice start to rise, ''Who's going to say she's not going to tell the cops or the government? These pens, they're not normal dude. Do you want some FBI on your front door tomorrow?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Who's going to believe her?'' Jimmy gets up, ''I mean, a pen that turns people into skins?'', he gives a nervous laugh that doesn't seem to do anything. Except only to aggravate you more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Who says no one will?'' you're half-shouting by now, but you don't care, ''Can you?!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a palpable tension in the room that accompanies the silence that ensues not long after. You and Jimmy just stand facing each other, not uttering another word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are we going to do with her?'' Jimmy's whisper is the one that finally breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following few weeks took its toll on you as a widespread appeal from Leah's family spread through the town after a few days of Leah's disappearance. Her mother appeared on the local news, her eyes were red as she wept throughout the coverage. So was her sister. Her father keep up the strong front. It was one of the biggest news in your town for a few weeks. There were appeals everywhere, even in your school of Leah's disappearance and your stomach turned every time you walk past a poster or a badge. Your life was hell for the first couple of weeks from the guilt, but they lessen as the appeal subsequently began to subside slowly and people resume their normal lives. Except of course, for the McBride family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops never found anything. There were zero leads, even after investigating the last known whereabouts of the junior year cheerleader. A few of the cheerleaders were questioned, but there was nothing for the cops to gain. It was as if Leah had vanished from the earth in a single day. </span></div></div>",

The slight pain on your knee joints prevents you from striding across the room like you used to do. You stop by a table top which is littered with picture frames. They are digital of course, the pictures on the frames switches around every few seconds. But they're all a picture of you and your late wife, Trish with your adopted child from Trish's earlier relationship. The whole thing surrounding Leah created a huge tension on your relationship with Jessica and the two of you broke up a month after that. You didn't get into another relationship for the rest of your senior year, preferring instead to bury yourself with your studies and the soccer team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt paid off however, as you got a scholarship from a prestigious university in Australia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you left, you decided to leave the pens in Jimmy's hands. It was as much as due to his pestering and at the time, you didn't think that you'll ever be using it again. Later on, you found out that he had shared the pens and their secrets with Eric Nguyen, a mutual friend of yours and Jimmy's. You kept in touch with Jimmy and Eric. A spectator sometimes to their crazy antics, as they donned on various skins. Though Eric was definitely a safer hands than Jimmy. The guy was clearly only interested in finding out more about the pens and gaining new experiences. He was also more able to resist Jimmy's wild ideas than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to your hometown briefly after you finished your graduate studies. It took a full 7 years, but by then you've been able to move on and you've secured a job for yourselves back in Australia. On an off-chance you met with Trish and after rekindling memories of the old times, the two of you decided to take it to next step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and cast your gaze at the rest of the photo frames. That was nearly 50 years ago. There are other pictures too, of your siblings. All of them are in America and you keep in contact with them occasionally, although you haven't seen them physically since the last 5 years or so. Your child had moved back many years ago to America, to be closer with her biological father and after Trish's death four years ago, there had been no contact with her. You just hope that she does well, wherever she might be. Somehow, after her 20th birthday, you never seemed to be able to connect with her anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door breaks you away from your reverie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yo, gramps. Ready to go yet?'' a Caucasian guy strolls into your house unwelcomed and make himself feel at home by heading straight to your prized rocking chair after you open the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Screw you,'' you grumble and close the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I must say you don't look bad for an OAP,'' the Caucasian gets up and flexes his biceps, ''Not as good as me though.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, yeah,'' you mumble, ''Go help yourself with something from the fridge while I get ready.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I've had enough digestives, thanks though.'' the 30-something Caucasian takes out a can of chilled beer and opens it with a satisfying click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way to your room, you take a few seconds to take it all in. It's very likely you'll never see this place anymore. You move to the cupboard and flings the doors wide open. You rummage the bottom drawer for a few seconds,before finding the latch that will allow you to lift the false bottom. From the depth of the drawer, you take out a small safety box which inside, contained something you've kept secret all your life, even from your wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa,'' the Caucasian guy's voice and subsequent burp startles you, ''It looks as if it was just made yesterday.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Jesus</i>, Eric,'' you growl and pick up the thing from the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry dude,'' Eric grins, ''I forgot you're real old now,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're no spring chicken either.'' you mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, actually,'' Eric fiddles with something on the nape of her neck. The Caucasian face contorts and loses its shape, before turning into a flabby piece of skin, revealing an Asian face underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fucking hell,'' you mutter as you examine your friend's face. Eric Nguyen should be the same age as you do, but rather than turning all wrinkly, he looks like as if he's in his mid-30s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I know, right?,'' Eric returns the Caucasian face back, ''It seems that being inside a skin temporarily stops your metabolism rate, although the person that we wears still age normally.'' Eric look at the skin of Leah that you've got in your hands. The secret you've kept for so long. ''You better get ready,'' Eric shrugs, ''We've got a flight to catch. I'll wait outside, since I don't want to see your wrinkled dick,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch Leah's skin out and lay it down on the bed. You're never sure what witchcraft or technology allows the skin to look as if it was just made seconds ago. It looks as silky and lively as it was when you first hid it decades ago. The empty eye holes seems to invite you of the prospect of seeing those vibrant blue grayish eyes again. The supple breasts that creates the amazing cleavage which you can never forget. The dazzling smile that gives you an instant hard-on many years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you stretch the opening slit on the back of the neck and feel the skin around the area parts until it reaches just a point above her tailbone. You haven't done this in the longest of time and you can't help to wonder if it will still work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the passage of time has made the skin loses its almost magical nature. You raise a leg and feel the inside of the skin brushes as you slot your leg in. You do the same with the other one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps years of not being worn had rendered the technology ineffective. You align your torso with the skin's and slides the entire length of your arms inside the skin's as if you're wearing a pair of gloves that extends to your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it just wouldn't work and you, Jimmy and Eric have been wasting your time all along for the past three years and a half. You pull Leah's face over yours, aligning her empty eye sockets over your own and making sure that the rest of the skin fits you perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and look at your reflection in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps your worries are unfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Here's your IDs, passports, some money, letter of introduction'' a Japanese woman in her late twenties hands you a small rucksack, ''There's also a new phone with a preloaded number, which should be useful for you,'' her accented English sounds rather odd, but she says it with such fluency and confident that you can't help but to smile. ''Have I missed out anything else?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No,'' you shake your head, ''I'll be fine, plus Jimmy should be waiting for me, right?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know Jimmy,'' the woman rolls her eyes, ''Knowing him, it's a wonder he's able to attend his classes at all.'' The woman glances at you, and she must've noticed the amused look on your face, ''He'll be there, don't worry. Definitely not as himself though.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Thanks Eric,'' you say after you familiarise yourself with your new stuffs. You decided to not take anything from your old flat. They would just remind you of the life you've left behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's Keiko,'' the Japanese woman says sternly, ''I suggest you start getting used to your new identity too, <i>Rachel</i>'' Her expression then relaxes, ''You're welcome old pal. OAPs like yourself and Jimmy should stick together anyway,'' she chuckles. ''Well, you can go anytime now, I've got a flight back to Narita to catch.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Screw you,'' you laugh and exit the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'll visit you guys sometimes,'' you hear the woman shouts before you close the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at your reflection in the mirror. The grayish blue eyes that look back at you are tired from the long haul flight to Athens, but also excited from the prospect of your new life. You take some time to use the new phone and text Jimmy, telling him that you've arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hello, Ms. Jones,'' the customs officer greets you after you handed him your passport and letter of introduction, ''What's the purpose of your visit.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, I've always wanted to visit Greece. Always wanted to see the scenery and culture. I'll be teaching English too, as a volunteer.'' you calmly say the phrase you've practiced and refer to your letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customs officer spends a few minutes looking through your documents, before he stamps the passport once and returns the documents to you, ''Welcome to Athens.'' he says with a smile, ''Enjoy your visit.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I will,'' you grab your documents and beam a smile at him and walk past the arrivals lobby where Jimmy has been waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman behind the wheels grins widely and throws a glance at you. She's lithe and tall, standing at almost 6 feet with long flowing brunette locks with neat bangs covering her forehead, ''Isn't that Leah?'' she says. There's a distinctive Russian twinge in her accent. ''Dude, she's just as I remembered her.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, I know,'' you manage a chuckle, the seat belt is creating a great divide between your bosom, ''So, who are you now?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, we haven't even introduce ourselves,'' the woman gives a melodious chuckle, ''My name's Natasha Avdeyev, currently a first year student in the local university. Oh, I play volleyball and teaches English on my spare time.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, but play along, ''I'm Rachel Jones, currently taking a gap year to travel the world and teach English.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Strange. It seems as if we've known each other for the longest of time. I'll take you out to see the town, but first, let's go to my apartment where you'll be staying while you're here.''</span></div></div>",

The beautiful faces and figures are clad in the tight, but rather conservative school colours of purple and white. ''Great work girls!,'' Sonya finally speaks. Kelly doesn't hear the rest of the captain of the cheerleader squad's farewell speech, as she's too preoccupied with her own thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the end of an era. For seniors like her, it was essentially the last time they will perform at high school level. Kelly's eyes wander to Sonya, and some of the senior faces in the group. It's a seven and eight split between juniors and seniors in the squad. Of course there's the junior varsity squad too, which is the breeding ground for hopeful cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''As per tradition, I'll let Meghan to lead us for the last cheer,'' Sonya's slight nudge brings Kelly back from her wandering thoughts. The new captain beams brightly, which accentuates the dimples on her cute face, framed by shoulder length black locks. Kelly can see a couple disgruntled faces too, belonging to Lindsey and Leah. They try to mask their displeasure of not being selected, but Kelly is good at reading people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Go team, go!'' the roof shakes and everyone high fives each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm water feels good on Sonya's skin as the soon to be ex-captain of the cheerleader squad let herself relax under the shower. It had been the most intense routine the squad had ever attempted, but judging from the rapturous applause from the bleachers, it was worth it. The opposing squad made the same effort to go out with a bang too. It was the last competition for the year and everyone, especially the seniors were giving it their all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation in the changing room has quietened down, with a few members returning home whilst the others, like herself, opt for a quick shower, before leaving school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya feels a couple of soapy palms on her generous bosom. They are lithe and dainty, and they start to fondle her breasts lightly. Teasing her nipples, the hands are now more aggressive. Sonya chuckles as the hands try and fail to cup her mighty bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They're more than a handful,'' Sonya hears Kelly's voice and the Asian American turns around to face her groper who has an inane smirk on her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Not as good as yours though,'' Sonya reaches out to fondle Kelly's impressive pair. The two cheerleaders grins before they break into a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This shit is awesome <i>bro</i>,'' Kelly blurts out and holds out her balled fist to Sonya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Remember, we need to keep up appearance,'' Sonya smirks, but she can't resist and bump a fist to Kelly's outstretched one. ''Who's still out there?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glint comes on Kelly's eyes that matches the one on Sonya's. ''Meghan's there. I think Lindsey's still here too.'' she says breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Let's give them a visit then.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, what if Heather or your mom sees us?'', Kelly grabs Sonya's wrist before she leaves the car eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're right,'' Sonya looks down at the cleavage she's sporting and chuckles. ''Don't worry, we'll just zap them,'' Sonya brandishes the black pen from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi Ji-,'' Jimmy's mom never finishes the sentence as she deflates quickly into a lifeless skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Where wer-,'' Heather likewise plops onto the floor as a skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Done,'' Sonya smiles smugly, ''Now we have the whole house to ourselves.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wicked,'' Kelly grins inanely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Should we do it now?'' Sonya asks her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why don't we do it in my room instead?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unearthly bulge appears on the nape of Sonya's neck as something or rather someone struggles to break out of her skin. Moments later, Jimmy's head is on top of Sonya's delectable body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aww, man. She'll be perfect for the picture,'' Kelly pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Trust me dude,'' Jimmy shakes his head,'' You don't want to. Her family's super rich, I think she might even got connection to the Chinese mafia. You don't want them to find you.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Uh, oh,'' Kelly mumbles, ''I guess so.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry bro,'' Jimmy quickly divests Sonya's skin off himself. He rummages inside Sonya's bag and pulls out the deflated skin of Meghan Reyes. ''She'll do just fine.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin returns to Kelly's face, but it doesn't last long as her face contorts, bends and waves, before it deflates, drooping down on her massive bosom. Instead, now a different head is on top on Kelly's body. A mop of unkempt scarecrow-like hair and average, although admittedly unimpressive features looks out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It still feels unreal,'' the male head looks at Kelly's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry Matt, you'll get used to it,'' Jimmy chuckles. He is already looking out of place, his male torso sitting atop Meghan's hips. Swiftly, Jimmy inserts his arms into Meghan's and they are transformed too. Jimmy simply aligns is facial features inside Meghan's head to complete the transformation. Jimmy grabs the brown pen and zaps himself with it, giving him access to the newly minted captain of the cheerleader squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're still not done yet?'', Meghan says waspishly after the brown pen's effect wears off. ''I'll give you a hand, or two. Or maybe I should just stand here and give you some, <i>motivation</i>''. Meghan smirks and thrusts her bosom out for Matt to see. They are a shapely pair. Taut and perky, as opposed to Sonya's and Kelly's generous proportion. The cheerleader's main feature isn't her bosom, Meghan squares up against a wall and does a perfect split. The new captain is more athletic and lithe compared to her predecessor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Holy shit,'' Matt says breathlessly, the show that Meghan puts makes it harder for him to take Kelly's skin off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You might be my cousin, but you're hopeless at this,'' Meghan grins as she looks at Matt's struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Right, what next?'' Meghan coos and turn to Matt who is busy on his phone. Dressed in her cheerleader uniform, she snatches the phone from Matt's hands. ''Well, these are good,'' There are a few photos of herself posing for the camera, there are some other photos of her and Matt together. ''I like this one,'' Meghan chuckles at the photo of her hand around Matt's dick. ''But we can't send that.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Jimmy, with Meghan's unwilling help were taking photos to show to Matt's 'tormentors' in his previous high school where Matt's was bullied. Matt's parents decided to move him to Jimmy's school for his junior year as well as to move him to live together with his cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know bro,'' Matt grabs his phone back,'' Thanks, I suppose.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whatever for?'' Meghan quips, but she doesn't stop rubbing herself over her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This,'' Matt motions at his phone, before pointing at Kelly's sprawling skin. ''Sharing these pens with me.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy stops and laughs, ''Don't worry,'' Meghan's melodious voice comes out instead, ''We'll have so much more fun. Have you send those pictures yet?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No. I decided not to,'' Matt sighs, ''I don't have to give them the satisfaction. It's time for me to move forward with my life.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Did you knock your head on something while you're trying to get out of Kelly's skin?'' Meghan laughs. ''But yeah, fuck them. You can start anew here. Besides, I doubt your bullies even have any idea on your new life here. Maybe we'll get a cheerleader to pop your cherry.'' Meghan says mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude,'' Matt let out a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Speaking of moving on with life,'' Meghan says, ''I'm gonna miss this.'' She gropes her bosom fondly,''Those too'', she motions at the other skins scattered on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why don't you take a gap year?'' Matt suggests. ''You can stay at high school for another year, or two.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cogs are turning in Jimmy's head. He hasn't decided yet on his major. David seems to be destined for Australia after the bad breakup with his girlfriend. He even got a grant and scholarship secured. Eric secured his early placement offer in a well known university after a stellar performance on his exams, bested only by Sonya, and he seems to be intent to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should get David and Eric together for a last hurrah, with Matt too as their D'Artagnan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know what bro, maybe I should take a gap year after all,'' Meghan grins as Jimmy contemplates the thought of returning to his old high school as someone else. ''But now that we're here, who do you want to wear next? I call dibs on this one,'' Meghan quickly adds.</span></div></div>",

The dyed auburn haired manager of the legal department at the Health Department glares at the two younger females on the other side of her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry aunty,\" Cecil Edwards, the younger of the two, shifts upright on her seat, stifling her giggles. The final year Public Health student has her short blonde hair in a ponytail. She's currently interning in one of the hospital managed by the Health Department<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be quiet,\" Natalie Swenson smoothly brushes her blazer. The 24 year old administrative staff at the Department then breaks into giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all aren't kids anymore,\" Myrna gazes sternly at her two nieces. The brunette was her elder sister's and the blond one from her younger brother,\" Especially you, Natalie,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sorry,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Myrna's satisfied, she dons her reading glasses and types in her username and password on to the computer screen in front of her. Just as she has done for the last 15 or so years. As she remembers this, a thought entered her mind that she's pushing 45. That thought is immediately chased by one wondering if she'll be able to find a nice guy and get married. She had a few relationships in the past, but as both her studies at Columbia and her subsequent job at a top tier law firm take priority most didn't last very long. Although she still thinks of herself as an attractive woman, she can't deny that the years haven't been too kind to her. Wrinkles have started to appear around her lips and on the corner of her eyes, but nothing that can't be brushed over. It's the weight that worries her, especially around her waist. Although she's not overweight, but she can't seem to fit in some of her old clothes from the law firm time anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrna shakes the thought out of her mind and concentrates on the work that's she has on her plate. There's some data that she has to alter without alerting too many people. From the corner of her eyes, she sees Cecil and Natalie already up to some mischiefs. She just hopes that they can concentrate at their work. After all, they both got in on her recommendation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil is the better looking of the two, which she has inherited from her mother. She used to be in her high school's gymnastic team. Her lithe and lean physique plays to her advantage. Natalie on the other hand, takes more to her mother. More endowed but just like Myrna and her sister, is prone to gaining weight quickly if left unchecked. At the moment, however, time is on her side. Not to mention that she must have burned a lot of calories from the nightly sessions she's having with her newly wedded husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's done.\" Myrna breathes a sigh of relief. It was some work, but she manages to make the required alterations to the database ,\"Now, you need to get the IT manager to make the changes, \" she looks at Cecil. \"You need your manager to approve the changes,\" Myrna  says as she turns to her other niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please,\" Natalie smirks, \"With these,\" Natalie cups her breasts with both hands, \"It'll be easy. And unless Tim is really gay as the rumours circulating around suggests, there's no way he'll be able to resist you,\" Natalie moves one of her hand on Cecil's derri\u00e8re and gives it a good caressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it done,\" Myrna rolls her eyes. She logs herself out from her computer and tidies up her belongings,\"Then let me know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to be that Japanese chick again?\" Natalie perks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Myrna puts her blazer on as she prepares to clock out for the day,\"Depends on how fast you guys are moving\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then!\" Natalie grabs Cecil's arm and the two make a quick exit. Leaving Myrna shaking her head at the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mr. Jenkins, the security guard at the Department is giving her a toothy grin. He is an elderly man, perhaps nearing retirement age. A bit of a harmless pervert too, Myrna thinks as she feels Mr. Jenkins' eyes rest on her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having some guests over,\" Myrna smiles as she continues clocking herself out on the system. \"My nieces are here to spend the weekend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrna turns to face herself on the full body mirror in her room. Her hands slowly unclasps the bra that supports the weight of her mounds. She runs her hands over the globes, admiring them. She still looks well preserved. On a good day, she could probably pass for a woman half her age. She tugs at a bit of fat around her hips, a sign that she should be more disciplined with her workout routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrna grabs an ornate looking black pen and points it towards herself. A quiet hum resonates in the room as a beam of light hits her. A slit opens up on the nape of her neck. Her fingers pry at it until the slit opens wider. Myrna's face begins to lose its shape as something struggles to burst out of her nape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA head bursts out from Myrna's nape as her face now deflates and lays on her mounds. The head that appear is distinctively female, with high cheekbones and pointed chin. Short jet black hair complements her somewhat attractive features, those typical of someone of a Japanese descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk breaks on the woman's face as she examines the contrasting view of her head seated atop Myrna's more generous body. \"I shouldn't, she says in a slightly accented English and draws her hands away from the insides of her thighs. There's a lot of things that she needs to do and the last thing she wants is to be mocked by Cecil and Natalie. Especially  Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From the monitor screen inside her private quarters, the aide to the Officer sees the four figures circling the box. The previous president had forbidden the use of surveillance system inside the facility, but without anyone knowing, Rick Jones has installed one by himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk appears on Michelle's face. The same one she's now hacking to receive the feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Is it bigger on the inside?\" the discreet speaker near the screen picks up a spec ops' conversation with her colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spec ops' question is answered when Rick Jones touches a seemingly ordinary panel. Revealing an archaic pad which he then punches his authorization code into. The box lets out a low grumble and a slight hissing noise before one of the walls opens up to reveal an illuminated area within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not,\" the female soldier could be heard speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area is small. Perhaps only four meters square. In the middle however, an ominous opaque box the size of a baseball is suspended in midair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle Robertson then sees her commanding officer beckons the others to follow him inside. It's a risky operation and there's no telling what might happen. The machine whirrs softly as the opening starts to close rapidly. Michelle knows the hour is close as the entire room begins to shake. With the adjustments made, hopefully there will not be another explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they gone? James Kim looks up at Michelle as she walks into his private quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gone,\" Michelle sits down by the Korean born scientist. At 16, he is shaping into one of the best computer scientist in his adopted homeland. If not the whole world. Michelle looks at the boy, if only he can stop playing one if these new online games in his spare time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this thing started then,\" James looks at Tanya Summers. Born of a Ukrainian mother and American father, the 27 year old scientist is of no lesser pedigree than James Kim. The newest member of the team, she has brilliant blue eyes and short blonde hair that she usually tie into a ponytail. Being a new member though, she usually keeps to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya now seems to be intent of showing more of herself as she unbuttons her uniform to reveal a light blue lacy bra supporting the weight of her bosom. They aren't impressive, but they are well proportioned to her frame and start walking towards James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, when my parents told me to join this program, I thought I'll be bored out of my mind,\" the boy says. A tent starts to appear on his pants as Tanya brushes her palms against his cheeks. James leans in for a kiss which Tanya reciprocates eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it was,\" James sigh after he pulls away from Tanya's face \"Until I met you guys. Thanks for those pens\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I get to be a chick, in this body,\" Tanya quips as she let her bra falls onto the floor. \" Why don't you join us?\" she wraps her hand around Michelle from behind, letting her chin rest on Michelle's shoulder while her bosom is pressed against the Officer's back. Michelle turns to face the girl and immediately explores the inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Michelle slides free from Tanya's hold. The aide brandishes a black pen and shoots herself with it. Her face starts to deflate and lose its forms as something struggles to come out from the nape of her neck. When the bizarre struggle ends, a distinctively male Asian head is perched atop Michelle's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not going to use it,\" James points to Michelle's skin which is currently discarded on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on then,\" Eric replies, not bothered by the fact that Tanya Summers us kneeling on the floor sucking him off. He had been keeping himself in check inside Michelle's body, not wanting to let Jimmy and Matt have the satisfaction of mocking him as being the dame as them. The months of playing the role of the professional officer Michelle Robertson however have caused a lot of pent up desires. Especially after he had access to Rick Jones' surveillance system and made a few additions on his own. Nie that Matt and Jimmy are in the past or possibly even another dimension, Eric could fulfill those desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, the prepubescent boy inserts his legs unto the skin. It's something that he had a few practice over a month. He still marvels at the power of the pens sometimes. Especially now when he sees his pale torso atop Michelle's dark toned legs. Turning into an African American is definitely something new for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You keep thinking 'what to do', what to do'. So at night you thought to take a walk and relax a little bit about all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking in the park when you saw an old begger sleeping in the bench  and from the look of it he seems very very sad. You approached and said \"hey old man are you OK, you look sad. Thought you could tell why\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No son don't worry about it I was just thinking about my past and jus......\" he stop saying midway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if you don't mind can you tell me what happened to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm in telling you, It will also keep me relax while talking about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe told you, how since childhood his life was like shit, he was orphan and no one would adopt him. He run away at the age of ten and started selling drugs and weeds for others, he also got addicted and because of that he became homeless and now he just go around new places and started begging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's all son, my boring sad story\".

Your head is pulled around and you see Sonya's face closing in on you, then your lips touch. Eyes wide, you reflexively push Sonya off you, your hand feeling her toned abdominal muscles from years of cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Sonya asks, arms wide as she looks up at you after steadying herself. He's got the Jimmy look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, why do you always want to have sex with me?\" You ask, albeit suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jimmy-esque expression of excitement currently plastered across Sonya's face freezes, before he stares at you awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, Ms. Martinez, now Sonya?\" You say, \"You know you could easily be fucking someone else, like their actual partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya seems to blush, and you're surprised by this reaction. Usually Jimmy would say something witty, or sarcastic, but he's silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy.. do you like me?\" You ask, after a few seconds of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Jimmy scratches his neck, a quirk he has whenever he's nervous. He used to do it whenever he was being scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. no?\" He nervously laughs, still scratching his neck. \"I-It's the pens..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the pens, I know how they work. You can act like someone, but you don't think you're them.\" You retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno' man, this is really weird right now..\" He says, his voice becoming quieter. The way he moves Sonya's body is very unlike her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and walk to the bed, sitting on the side still naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me, man.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I..\" Sonya's high, feminine voice trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************************************<br>\r\nArm around Sonya's shoulders, you're currently hugging her as the two of you sit on the edge of the bed. Tears have been streaming down her face for the last few minutes after Jimmy confessed his feelings to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you stood up for me when Brent and Dan..\" He gasps, trying his best to compose himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first time you met Jimmy as kids, he was getting beaten up by two bullies behind the school. They'd thrown his stuff all over the floor and were pounding him against a wall. You stepped in, and managed to get the two to back off. Jimmy never really had any other friends than you since then, and he had family problems too. Maybe that was why he couldn't be accepted. Jimmy pulls pranks under the guise of fun, but all he really wants is attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's scared. He's using the pens, and other people's bodies to express himself.. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to hide it.. but..\" Sonya sniffles again, wiping her face with her arm. \"What are you gonna' do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy..\" You're at loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya springs up out of your loose grasp and backs away from you, her face red and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, you hate me don't you!\" She screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Jimmy, calm down!\" You say, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonya suddenly reveals the two pens in her grasp, and stares at you angrily, you can see the feelings of betrayal across her face. She hesitates, before turning her back to you and running out of the room. You run behind her, witnessing her head disappear in a flurry of black ponytail as she quickly flies down the stairs.<br>\r\nYou run down behind her, before she opens the front door after grabbing what sounds like keys. You can't leave the house, you're naked and you don't have any male clothes. All the other guys here are jacked up and way bigger than you. A car starts, and you see Jimmy hastily driving away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************<br>\r\nHastily throwing Kelly back on, you pull your tight dress back up your figure and quickly throw your shoes on, before hurrying down the stairs. Car keys in hand.<br>\r\nSlamming the door behind you, you get into your car and leave, whilst on the road, it occurs to you that it'll be hard to fix this without screwing up anyone's agenda.<br>\r\nJimmy has the pens, and you don't know where he's gone. Furthermore, you can't just walk into your house without freaking your parents out.<br>\r\nThen you remember that Kelly used to be a good friend of Jessica's before she was kicked out of the cheerleading squad by it's former captain.<br>\r\nTurning a corner, you change direction towards Jessica's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************************<br>\r\nAs you get there, you see Sonya's car parked on the street and hastily get out of your own. Running to the door, it's open.<br>\r\nPulling the door open slightly, you look inside, the TV is on, but that's about it. Slowly, you enter. Shutting the door behind you, directly ahead from the door is the stairs to the 1st floor, on your left, the kitchen, to your right, the living room. You kick your shoes off out of habit and look into the living room.<br>\r\nYou hear voices from above, it's Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonya? What the hell are y-\" She's cut off abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint up the stairs and throw open Jessica's bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy's gaze flicks to you, tears staining his cheeks as he peels Sonya off. Quickly, he grabs Jessica and pulls her clothes off as you stand in the door and stare in shock. You watch as a bulge stretches Jessica's deflated form, travelling up her neck as Jimmy ducks his head through. Her face comes to life, and she looks at you. Jimmy contorts her back in horrendous ways to climb into the skin without taking the head back off. In a few seconds, Jessica stands before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find me?\" Jessica asks, her voice morose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pure chance.. I had nowhere else to go.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walks up to her dresser and picks up her phone, then looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna' call you tomorrow.. tell you to come over. Break the news.\" Jessica's lips tremble, you see her eyes starting to dampen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What news?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy killed himself.\" She quickly replies.</span></div></div>",

Jimmy's across the poolside sitting with a bunch of guys and one other girl on a few beach chairs. Leah's missing, you notice.<br>\r\nConcerned, you're currently unoccupied, as Kelly isn't much of a talker. Making your way into the mansion, you glance through the many doorways as you slowly walk through. The living room is inhabited by 3 people, a couple currently making out on the couch, and a lone wolf smoking something out of a bong. Probably weed. Looking into the kitchen, there's not much food left, you see Kyle Portman feeding himself some cheesecake with his fingers. He used a knife to cut a square, and then took it into his fingers and swallowed the thing whole. You're almost disgusted, but amused too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, seen Leah anywhere?\" You ask him from the entrance, leaning your head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice his eyes flick to your chest, then to your own eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, last I saw her she went upstairs with Jackson, she looked pretty wasted.\" He says, licking his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You say, moving from the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, sugar tits.\" He says jokingly, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually laugh as you walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************************<br>\r\nThe door isn't even closed, you hear Leah and Jackson upstairs as indicated by low groans and muffled moans. As you climb the spiraling staircase, you find the source of the sound is the first room you encounter. Peeking your head through, you see Leah's legs around Jackson's waist, her clothes in a heap on the floor.<br>\r\nSomething shimmers in the lamplight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pen? What if I..\" You whisper to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you what?\" A voice whispers in your ear from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt and spin around, it's Meghan. She's holding her mouth trying not to laugh out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you peeking at?\" Meghan says, still giggling at your unamused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks for herself, and notices the same thing you did, her eyes light up. Suddenly, she storms into the room. You look at her as she goes, running in quickly towards Leah's clothes. The two lovers don't even notice her as she scours Leah's pants pocket to pull the two pens out, she then unceremoniously points the black pen to the pair and zaps them into skins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're back on top buddy!\" Jimmy announces, shaking his fists in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, good job?\" You don't know whether this was a good thing or a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, we should get revenge on this bitch for trying to control us.\" Meghan says, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy pulls you into the room and locks the door, before pulling his top off and unclipping his bra, exposing Meghan's moderate bust.<br>\r\nPeeling her skin from his torso, he strips and then walks up to Jackson's skin. Grabbing the black haired stud, he quickly gets into his image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're almost turned on as he turns around to you, Jackson Myres is the football team quarterback and he's practically a greek god.<br>\r\nHe smirks at you, before shaking his still erect penis at you with his goofy jimmy-look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some, sweetie?\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip and shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, just do whatever you were gonna' do.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll stay as Jackson and we'll take Leah back to her house and restore her in the morning. You get out of Kelly and wear someone in the house, and when she wakes up, I'll romance her a little before we zap her again!\" Jimmy explains his plan, almost laughing in excitement. \"Imagine the look on her face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, sometimes you're a little concerned for Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************<br>\r\nUnlocking the front door using Leah's keys, you enter the dark house. Leah's things in her bag and yours, both slung over your shoulder.<br>\r\nJimmy glances around, still in Jackson's body. Everyone's asleep considering it's almost 2 am, you think. Closing the door, the two of you go upstairs to her room.<br>\r\nAs you try to creep, Leah's mother suddenly opens her door, expect Leah herself of course. Before she sees you two, however, Jimmy zaps her and then runs into the room, zapping her father as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, close one.\" He whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown at how good he is at using the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's her sister? She was hot stuff. I might want to finish what I started.\" He says, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy opens her sister's bedroom and peeks in, she's sprawled over her bed with her laptop shut besides her. He zaps her quickly and grabs her skin, taking it with him. Finally arriving at Leah's room at the end of the hall, you two throw the door open, no longer needing to keep quiet. Turning the light on, Jimmy throws the girl's skin on the bed and you dump Leah out next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's get ready.\" Jimmy hands you Leah's sister's skin. \"How about her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the skin and frown at it's drooping, morose expression.</span></div></div>",

The skin seems to expand a little to accommodate before magically shrinking to what must be the her usual size, ''Whoa, I kind of miss this shit. How do you think they do it?'' Jimmy says in awe, more to himself than to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering Jimmy, you take a look at the skin you're left with and sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Better get on with it dude, boss lady's waiting.'' Jimmy quips. He's already halfway through his transformation, with his pale torso sits awkwardly atop a wide hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I know,'' you grumble. In a swift motion, the inside of Meghan's deflated legs has already wrapped itself around your legs. You know what to expect by now, having experienced the unreal sensation previously. So you don't dawdle around and in insert the your arms into the holes where they should be going and pull Meghan's face over yours to complete the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Whoa</i>'', you hear a female voice gasp behind you. Turning around, a platinum blonde haired girl has taken Jimmy's place. She seems to be shorter than you or Jimmy, in fact, you're not even sure if she's taller than Claire. But there's a couple of things that takes your attention and it seems that these things have taken the girl's attention too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy grabs his new boobs and gives them an appreciative squeeze, ''Have you seen these?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact you have and your eyes almost water at that. They're conveniently more than a nice handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, '' that's the only thing you manage to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You guys better not be fucking around in there!'', Leah's voice comes from the other side of the door, ''or <i>else</i>!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fucking hell,'' Kelly curses, ''Put her face on,'' she says to you. ''and get dressed, before the bitch comes in.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I heard that!'' Leah's voice booms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good!'' Jimmy shouts back, but he complies and starts gathering up Kelly's clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you put Meghan's face over yours and collect her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What now?'', Kelly folds her arms and look at Leah. That only serves to accentuate her bust more as her bosom rests on her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, is this,'' Leah whips out the brown pen from her purse and zaps Kelly squarely on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Whoa,'' Kelly reels back. She blinks twice before a smirk comes to her face, ''Oh, I see. Very smart.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you mean?, '' just as the words escape your lips, memories flood into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah drops you off in front of Meghan's flat which she shares with her half-sister with a stern warning that you do not forget about the party later on. Climbing on the flight of stairs turns out to be a distracting endeavour as your hips sways with every step you take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly lady next door greets you and as you engage in some pleasant small talk, you are amazed by how easy for you to sink down under the guise of Meghan Reyes, wrapping her memories, mind and personality around you like a cloak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough though, you excuse yourself as there are things that you want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan's reflection in the mirror looks inviting. Her cute face framed with short black hair is adorned with a pleasant smile and dimples beckons at you. Dressed in matching light burgundy scanties, you take in the sight of yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercoming a slight wave of inhibition, you lean forward and use your hands to push the side of your boobs together, creating a prominent cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy hell</i> your mind screams at the reflection of Meghan Reyes pushing her boobs together and smiling at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few step back and do a full split in one try. Meghan isn't the most buxom - with that title belonging to Kelly - or the prettiest, but her medium build body is lithe. You amuse yourself by doing a series of gymnastic feats inside her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've worked yourself good, you hit the showers and get ready for the party.</span></div></div>",

It's always like that. Once he gets going, he forgets about silly things like learning from his own mistakes. It's because Jimmy did do whatever he wanted, that you two are now in this situation. And it's not like you aren't tempted, but Leah is hardly someone you can trust. Of course, she can always make you a victim, instead of an accomplice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked me and I said no.\" Turning to her you add, \"Are you going to use the pen on me now? Because I don't want to play your game?\" You try to sound somewhat confident, but you don't think that it fools Leah for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't.\" Leah doesn't sound happy with your decision, but she is keeping whatever she thinks of it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, don't be such a stick in the mud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, now Jimmy resorts to pestering. Why did you go to him first, anyway? Right, because you are thick as thieves and if you stick around he WILL convince you. Just like he always does. It's the main problem that stays: If Jimmy screwed up once, what's to stop him, or Leah for that matter, from doing it again? You love his pranks, but most of them go nowhere because he has so little self control. Not that you are a paragon of restrained by anyone's standards, but that doesn't make it any less true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you want to do this? Fine, I'm not spoiling your fun, I'm not telling anybody, either. Just keep away from Jessica and me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah lets out a deep sigh, but then shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly what I had hoped for, but okay. If something comes up, I'll give you a heads up.\" You nod, though you have no idea why she is so agreeable. She turns to Jimmy. \"You can go home now, too. I'll keep in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both get up, but you hear her voice coming up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go, one thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant you see Jimmy crumble into a pile of clothes and his skin. You turn to her expecting to see her pointing the pen at you. Instead, she calmly puts it back into her pocket and smiles innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect? That I risk hiding the pens out of reach, after seeing what Jimmy and you did? Well mostly Jimmy, what you did wasn't so bad. You just fucked a teacher and pretended to be Ashley. Your weird friend did a lot more. \" She shudders at the memory. At least she doesn't fault you for 'volunteering' her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't really hide them, but why zap him?\" You nearly shout, but remember that her parents are still at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah just looks at you incredulously and then it hits you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He never got inside as Jimmy, did he? So your parents can't see him leave either.\" This time you do role your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he didn't, you know him better than I do. I don't know many guys as carefree as him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she starts to pack his skin and clothes inside a non-descriptive bag, you think of Heather, Jimmy's sister. You guys were nearly found out at the very start, because he was so careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just zip him up at your place or in an alley or something.\" She holds out the bag, but hesitates for a moment.</span></div></div>",

Isn't she the one who asked you to join her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Your eloquence astounds even yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you pick me to be Jimmy's victim?!\" Leah all but shouts. She takes a couple of breathes before continuing, \"I've never done anything to you! I know I'm... temperamental, but I've never bullied anyone or something like that. Fuck, I've more than once made some dumb ass jock <i>stop</i>. So why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a lot of truth to her words. She wasn't the easiest to get along with, what with her being so headstrong, but she never went out of her way to embarrass someone. There was a reason she was one of the popular girls at school. Nobody becomes popular by treating everyone like garbage. Of course, there were exceptions, like Ashley. That's when it hits you! You did it because Ashley hates Leah, hates her bulldozing attitude, her insistence that she knows best and so on and so forth. You've called Leah because Ashley would've done that. But that means that the brown pen is a lot more persuasive than you first thought. Turns out Jimmy isn't the only one who screwed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley...\" you murmur as you think about what that means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak up! What about than conniving bitch? I know that you've been her when you called me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got both pens and know what they do, right?\" She frowns and says yes, so you continue, \"I've been Ashley and you know she hates you. So that's the only reason I can think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an awkward silence. That was probably not what you should've said. Great, now you feel guilty on top of awkward. How does that even make sense? Leah holds all the cards right now and yet you feel guilty. These pens really mess with your mind. You should try to get away from her, after finding out that she plans to manipulate everyone she needs to. Not to mention that you already said 'no'. Still, you decide to do something to ease your conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the brown pen, I think. I got so comfortable being Ashley, that I don't think that there was much of a difference between me and the real deal. For what it's worth I'm sorry and.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her slump down on her bed, the bag with Jimmy inside forgotten. She grips her knees before she looks at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it come to this? I've never been so... so.... It's all wrong! The moment I put on your sick friends skin and used the brown pen everything went wrong. I wish I'd never done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were worried. \"What did he do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do? It's not about what he did. Heck with these pens, I'd do a lot of things, too. It's what he <i>thinks</i>.\" The way she emphasized that last word sends chills down your spine. \"He is completely sick, a total psycho.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know Jimmy likes to make practical jokes, but...\" You never get to finish before she cuts you off with a hand on the pen. She doesn't point it at you, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes you. You are his best friend. Fuck that, you are his only friend. So now listen to me. James Wilson has never cared one bit for all those people he hurt with his dumb jokes, not for a single instant. The only regret he has is when he gets caught. Among his plans for the next days were such pearls, like wearing your girlfriend to cheat on you, so that you would be free for more <i>interesting </i> ideas. And if that wouldn't work, he planned to zap <i>you</i> and make Jessica break up with you. He is jealous of her. And remember, <i>you</i>, he likes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than why did you ask us to help you?\" You really didn't get her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep an eye on him, of course! I mean, I'm no saint. I don't mind using these pens. But as long as I keep him... busy, maybe, just maybe, he wouldn't do any of his really bad ideas. And before you ask, you I wanted, because you are the only one he listens to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now that I've said 'no', what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucked if I know. Tempted to simply get rid of him, but you can't simply let the skins lie around.\" She points to the bag. The skin is slowly stretching itself into a more 'natural' position. \"And as bad as he is, I don't think I could...\" She let her voice trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" It's hard to imagine that she has thought about killing Jimmy. He couldn't be that bad, right? But Leah really looks really distressed, so maybe it's you who is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to look out her window. The sun is setting and its brilliant light makes her family's garden look simply breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These pens, when I understood what they were, it was like a new world was opened. No idea why I'm telling you this. Now you'll tell your friend and I will always have to look over my shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown appears on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A smile, probably one of relief spread thinly across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea, actually..\" She resolves, looking up to you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled.\" You say in a low tone, almost remorsefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy was a nice guy, or so you thought. You never thought him devious enough to think of doing something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was going to break up my relationship with Jessica..?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the bag holding Jimmy's skin, and once you look into the bag and see Jimmy's deflated visage staring out at you, something hits you.<br>\r\nJimmy's mother was a good friend of you own, and that's how you met Jimmy himself. Because of that, his mother used to call your house regularly to chat with both you and your mother, followed up usually with Jimmy asking you to do something \"funny\" with him over the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think something's wrong, I've gotta' go.\" You glance quickly at Leah and say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognizes your sudden look of urgency, and demands to know what the problem is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop Jimmy's bag and open the bedroom door, shouting at her behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me later, I've gotta go now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the front door, you glance around you at the street, before looking back at the small, closed window beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock again and wait a few more minutes, the car is there, but nobody seems to be inside. Jimmy's mother is an esteemed lawyer, and you know that she'd never be somewhere without her car, especially since she's always running around for business. Your worries intensify, and you open the side-gate leading into the backyard. Walking down the side of the house, a large orchard of trees on the neighbor's side shields you from view. Looking up the side of the house, you notice that the bedroom windows are open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! It's me, David! Anybody inside?\" You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply, as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the backyard, Jimmy's dog perks up and runs out of his wooden shelter. As it nears you, yapping in it's usual, happy bark, you notice it's horrible condition. The dog is starving, it's ribs visible under it's thin coat of fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rupert, boy, what the hell happened..?\" You quietly whisper to the dog, patting his head as you kneel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, you look around the back of the house and walk up to the backdoor. Twisting the knob, it turns. You're happy you don't have to scale a wall anymore.<br>\r\nOpening the door, you walk into the seemingly abandoned house. Rupert scuttles in behind you, his claws quickly scratching against the floor tiles with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You repeat. \"Anybody home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking each room, everything seems as it should be. You march up the stairs, Rupert's little body zooming up them past you. You watch him zip around a corner and disappear from sight, barking excitedly. You suddenly remember that he does that whenever Jimmy's sister Heather is around, and quickly you run after him. Entering Heather room, you cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRupert excitedly sniffs and licks Heather's deflated, naked skin, laying crumpled up on the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back out of the room and hurry to Jimmy's mother's room. Throwing the door open, you groan in horror as you discover her skin sprawled across her bed, also naked. Her clothes scattered across the floor messily. You discover a stain underneath the skin as you move it, a large uneven circle on the white sheets.<br>\r\nDropping her, you hold your mouth as images of what could have happened here flash through your mind, you try not to vomit. Jimmy went home and zapped his family.. probably during school. You imagine that's why you hardly ever saw him until later on during the day as Ashley. You need to restore them, but you can't leave the house with them as you have no means of turning them back to normal, and if they woke up outside of their house, that'd cause problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking downstairs, you collect yourself and notice the phone's display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">7 Unread Messages</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the play button, and a series of messages are played for you. A few clients, until you hear your mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">Wednesday, February, Fifth, 3:21</span>\" The voicemail's automated voice calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandra, it's me, Marie.

If you're caught in this house by yourself and the skins of two women, you'll be in the some deep shit. Suddenly, the sirens of a police cruiser sounds in the far distance. You glance out the window and are barely able to make out a car headed this way, flashing lights and all. You turn and run up the stairs to Jimmy's mother's room. Throwing your clothes off and into a closet, you pick her skin up and stretch it open, stepping into it hastily. Quickly donning the skin, you shrink in height by not much, and you feel your chest's weight as breasts materialize on it. Throwing her hair from over your new face, you find some underwear from a drawer and quickly put them on, following up with an t-shirt and shorts. Running into Heather's room, you stash her skin away in your new room, burying it under a pile of bags containing files. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? This is the police, open up!\" A man yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning down the stairs after making sure everything is nice and tidy, you unlock and open the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good evening ma'am, are you Sandra Wright? We received a call from your friend \"Marie Anderson\" that you were in possible distress.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I see your identification, please?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, let me get it for you.\" You say, turning and walking back up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember seeing her handbag up in her room, on a large mahogany desk. Opening the door once more, you find it and pull an ID card out of one it's pockets after quickly searching it. Arriving downstairs again, you present the card to the policeman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ma'am, thank you. We'll clarify this issue at a later date, but since there is no apparent need for any escalated security measures, we'll leave you alone.<br>\r\nThe department will call you sometime soon.\" He says, and nods in conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Officer.\" You say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch him walk back to his car, get in, and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming the door, you fall against it, your nerves finally giving out, almost making you break out in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What has Jimmy done..?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\nYou get home quickly and try to call Leah on Skype, but to your dismay, she's offline.<br>\r\nSearching her up in the phone book, you call her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Her mother answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ma'am, can I talk to Leah for a second please?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, David, she's out for a bit. She said she had something important to do. Probably cheerleading.\" Her mother explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks. Have a good evening.\" You say, putting the receiver down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, your phone buzzes in your pocket. Fishing it out, it's Jessica. You hit the answer button and put it to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey lover..\" Jessica seductively purrs, your eyes widen in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess? You okay?\" Instantly you recognize something wrong, Jessica would never lead you on sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than okay, baby, come to my house. I've got something good for you.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the call end, and suddenly something pops up on your screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica holds her phone out infront of her whilst spreading her pussy with her free hand, her tongue sticking out over her chin, with an evil glare in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh God no, give me that.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you'd ever want to happen to Trish is for somebody like Jimmy to literally get under her skin. Besides, if Jimmy got into her skin, he'd give you hell.<br>\r\nYou pick up Trish's skin from the carpeted flooring. Long, wavy dirty blonde hair hangs forward as her deflated head flaps like a hoodie. Trish is an athletic type, always has been. Her mom runs marathons, and though she's not at that extreme a level yet, she probably will someday too.<br>\r\nYou envision in your mind what wearing Trish will feel like, but you know it can't come close to the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escapes your lips as you stare at Trish's messy hair. Might as well get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put Trish down in the chair nearby and take off your shirt. In the corner of your eye you notice Jimmy unbuttoning his shirt, then proceeding to molest his unfortunate body for the hundredth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never get over this.\" Julia says, smiling childishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and strip completely, kicking your clothes to the side before turning your attention to Trish. You unbutton the light blue blouse she was wearing, revealing her grey sports bra disfiguringly constricting her deflated body. Raising the flaccid body up, you take your time to remove her clothing. The sports bra gives you a little trouble as it's so tight around the bunched up flesh, but then easily comes off after a few minutes of picking and peeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow..\" You say absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's body is tanned, with slightly lighter tan lines showing her almost daily use of a sports bra. You wonder if it's the same for her crotch, before shaking the perverted thought from your head. Pulling her jeans off quickly, revealing a pair of tights underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude look, she's wearing boxers.\" You say to Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, girls sometimes do that when they're too insecure to wear panties like REAL women..\" Jimmy says in his real voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over in surprise to see Julia Martinez's chest hanging from Jimmy's waist, her long black hair cascading over her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I just got a crazy idea, hold on.\" Jimmy says suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Jimmy walks over to Ashley's skin under the skin and pulls it out, stripping her shirt and bra off, he opens the seam in her back and ducks in. Her arms fill with Jimmy's and you see the bulge of Jimmy's head travel up her neck before settling into her own head. Jimmy adjusts the mask with his new hands before turning directly to you and grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada!\" Ashley says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.. you're wearing two of them..?\" You wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've got Julia on the bottom and Ashley on the top. Sick, right?\" Jimmy says, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of fucked up.\" You state, dropping Trish's underwear on the chair next to the rest of her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever man, I think it's cool.\" Jimmy says. \"<i>Oh, I've always wanted such a firm ass! Mmm..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring him, you turn Trish around and pull open the seam down her back, stepping into her. Your legs are wrapped in her muscle and flesh the moment they settle into place and you lose a few inches in height. Quickly you pull your new hips up and your genitals are compressed out of existence by Trish's. A firmly toned ass covers your own flat one, bronze in complexion and curvy in shape. Trish is completely shaven, and you raise your eyebrows in appreciation.<br>\r\nPulling up her torso, you stick your arms in and feel them tighten, thinning into Trish's effeminate versions. Your stomach tightens around the waist and you feel your ribs compress incredibly, causing a thin waistline. Trish's moderately sized breasts inflate on your chest, hanging tightly. Topping the mounds are two brown nipples, somewhat small, but you don't mind. Pulling Trish's head out of the way, you grope your breasts momentarily and shiver as their sensitivity.<br>\r\nQuickly, you stretch her neck out and push your head through the gap, pulling down, you compress your two faces together and bind them.<br>\r\nInstantly you feel the new weight of long hair on your scalp, as your new face allows you make an expression of wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, this is sick..\" You say in Trish's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must've taken more time than you thought because Jimmy completely reversed the skin order he used for his little trick. Ms. Martinez stares at your short but toned form, slightly shorter on Ashley's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're hot man.\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make this any worse than it has to be.\" You snap at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises his hands and his eyebrows, slowly shaking his head left and right. Suddenly, a look appears on his face, one that indicates he's come up with a new idea. He was \"Jimmying\" as it were. Julia's long elegant fingers grasp what appears to be a brown version of the pen and brings it out of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just remembered we had this all the time. It came in the box.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah..\" You remember it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's try it!\" Jimmy exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, he points the thing at you and a loud ZAP shocks you temporarily. Emotions hit you like a hard tequila on a friday night, and you're instantly overwhelmed. You start to cry, sniffling as you wipe your tears confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you okay?\" Jimmy says, equally as confused as you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright..\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? What to do you feel?\" Jimmy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish.. was in love with me from the moment I started dating Jessica..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupid David, why would he date Jess? She's my friend but, I just don't understand. We've been friends for years, why can't he understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your arm in the shower, you let the hot water stream down your body, your breasts slightly squeezed by your working arm.<br>\r\nThe water builds up, then overflows, spilling over the edge of your forearm and splattering against the white tiles of the bathroom floor.<br>\r\nSimilar to the state your eyes are in, the tears just won't stop overflowing.<br>\r\nYou sob, that's all you can do. David doesn't see it, you've been trying and trying, but he's just so blind.<br>\r\nThe only person that seems to want you is Jimmy. Jimmy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of David and the times you spent together flash through your mind. You grew up so close, almost like twins. That's probably why he doesn't like you.<br>\r\nHe's never liked you, he never will. All because of Jessica.<br>\r\nIntense jealousy and hatred build up in you, you start to think of all the malicious deeds you could fulfill to hurt their relationship.<br>\r\nThen you realize, you can't. David's just too nice for you to ever hurt him. Sadly, it's not the other way around.<br>\r\nHe doesn't know he's hurting you, that gives you some solace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-David.. why..?\" You whimper to yourself, leaning against the cold shower wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoosebumps run across your skin, and you feel yourself touching your nipple. Hardened, something unlocks within you and your crotch heats up.<br>\r\nYou're thinking about David that way again, you realize. Stop it! Stop it now!<br>\r\nDavid's holding you, caressing your chest. He appreciates you over everyone else. You feel his lips travel down your stomach, you feel..<br>\r\nYou feel your fingers rubbing your clitoris as your knees buckle in pleasure, biting your lip, you struggle to keep your moans suppressed.<br>\r\nSitting with your back against the wall now, you spread your legs slightly and push two fingers into your cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's.. s-so good..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your insides as you fantasize about David, you feel time fly past you as you imagine everything you'd ever want him to do to you and more.<br>\r\nYour abs flex and relax involuntarily, your muscles contract as you approach climax, your thrusting increasing in pace.<br>\r\nSuddenly, your pussy contracts around your hand and you moan loudly, juices trickling over your fingers.<br>\r\nPulling your hand from your crotch, you watch the slightly white liquid slide down your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you eventually.. David..\"</span></div></div>",

Sneaky sneaky my man.\" She says, wagging her finger at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her pull her underwear on and fasten her bra over her bosom, quickly re-dressing herself. It's almost unbelievable how pristine and lady-like Jimmy managed to make himself look, normally he's a huge mess. That's probably Ms. Martinez, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's see. I can use the PA system to call her out of class.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to a small mic on her desk, she clears her throat and licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allie Davidson, please come to the Counselor's office immediately. Please come to the Counselor's office, thank you.\" Jimmy says in Ms. Martinez's confident tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looks up from the mic at you and winks. You simply shake your head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better move this skin, though. Wouldn't want to freak her out.\" You state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, right.\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the skin and throw it under Julia's desk, then you sit in a chair and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does Ms. Martinez's body feel?\" You ask suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up from her lap and grins, before looking down at her breasts and promptly playing with them. You raise your eyebrows and understand instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good, if I do say so myself.\" She replies, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking sounds from the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Martinez?\" A voice asks, female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, come in.\" Julia flicks in her accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and Allie steps inside, you see a look of surprise on her face when she notices you sitting there.<br>\r\nShutting the door slowly, she walks up to the seat next to you and nervously pulls it from the desk, slowly settling into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted me.. ma'am?\" Allie asks, looking at Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as a matter of fact, I did. I've been hearing some things about you, something about a tattoo on your back..?\" Jimmy lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Jimmy and frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What kind of crafty trick is he going to use..?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I don't have a tattoo..\" Allie says, frowning in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see for myself, please stand up and turn around.\" Jimmy commands her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she gets up and does as told. Looking over her shoulder back at Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see your back, please lift your shirt. Don't worry, the glass is frosted.\" Jimmy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about David..?\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're honestly surprised that she even remembers your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, look away or you're in detention.\" Jimmy says, you notice his hand moving under the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" You reply, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I don't have any-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the crumpling of the girl into a pile of warm flesh and clothes and you get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, you're a fucking genius.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right.\" She replies, flicking her long black hair and smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to Allie's skin-heap, you pick her up by the hair and examine the freshly made suit. Flicking her plump, pink bottom lip with your finger, it jiggles lifelessly as her face sags equally so. Her limbs are long and flaccid, like noodles. They wave in the slight draft created by the room's convection current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try her on man, what are you waiting for?\" Jimmy says. \"Meanwhile, I'll try on Miss Newspaper Girl over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down Allie on your chair, you strip out of your clothes and notice Jimmy doing the same to Ms. Martinez's body.<br>\r\nTurning your attention back to the skin, you pull her loose clothes from her now deflated form and turn it around, discovering the long seam down her back.<br>\r\nYour cock is as hard as it was half an hour ago, but that's all about to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it man.\" You hear Jimmy say in his actual voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across at him, you notice Ms. Martinez being peeled off, her breasts deflating and flapping with Jimmy's movements.<br>\r\nPulling the seam open, you notice that it can expand elastically. Sticking your right leg into the suit skeptically, you slowly push it down through the skin's tight leg.<br>\r\nInstantly, you feel the skin contract around your leg as soon as your toes fit into place. Painted a dark purple, they shine brilliantly in the ceiling lamp's light.<br>\r\nMuscle forms tightly around your leg, you can feel the difference already and you're not even close to being in Allie's body yet.<br>\r\nFlexing your thigh, you run your fingers over her incredibly toned leg muscles. She's a sprinter after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Jimmy, he's admiring your new leg also. You see him nod frantically, ushering you on to continue.<br>\r\nPushing your other leg into the girl's, the same thing happens and you stand up, slightly shorter now. As you pull the waist up, your genitals seem to be squeezed out of existence as a vagina takes their places. Your ass is significantly toned and quite firm, and your hips have widened into a luscious curve.<br>\r\nAllie is far paler than you, and the contrast between your complexion and hers is a sight to behold. A brownish male sprouting from the back of a pale white female.<br>\r\nYou stick your arms into hers and even they are more toned than your own. You used to think yourself at least a little built, but you aren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jessica was lying the whole time!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's chest automatically fastens to yours and you feel your ribs and shoulders squeeze inwards, two globes inflating together on your chest. Topped with bright, fleshy pink nipples. Allie's face hangs loosely from your neck, resting on your right shoulder, her long dirty blonde hair cascading over your right breast.<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, you touch your labia and cringe at the sensation of squishy flesh in between your thighs. You're used to your thick 7 inches. Now this is just weird. Tucking your head into the top of the seam, you push your head up through Allie's neck and into her head. It's so incredibly tight it's starting to hurt.<br>\r\nQuickly, you push and pull her skin around your head until everything's in place, and you feel a slight nausea. Turning around, you notice Jimmy halfway into Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, damn, she's hot as fuck.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel.. amazing. Woah!\" You exclaim in your new voice. Allie's voice is very soft and dainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy quickly stuffs his arms into Ashley's slim ones, before throwing her hair behind his head as he slips it into her neck. <br>\r\nQuickly, he adjusts everything and smiles at you using Ashley's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, baby, what do you wanna' do?\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley breaks the kiss off and pulls her head back. You open your eyes slowly. <br>\r\nYour heart is racing and you're slightly stunned. Looking around, you try to pull yourself together.<br>\r\nA primal passion consumes you, something spawned out of the emotions of your stolen body.<br>\r\nPushing Ashley onto the floor, you crawl on top of her and lick her neck slowly, starting from the collarbone all the way up to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus C-Christ, David.. mm..\" She moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving over her chin, you kiss her lips and press them firmly, holding it in bliss for a few seconds. The urge to breathe overwhelms the urge to fuck, and you break your lips, sucking in a deep gasp, before your lungs settle. You move down on Ashley, using your fingers to tickle her abs, they tense and flex sporadically with your stimulus. She giggles, before gasping as you suddenly plunge two fingers deep into her cunt. Fingering her slowly, then quickly, and slowly again, you rub all sides of her pussy, trying to find the spot. You know you've found it when suddenly her pussy flexes around your hand and Ashley's legs bend involutarily, her toes curling as she cums all over your hand. You pull your fingers out and stick your head inbetween her legs. Pushing your tongue against her now dripping wet labia, you almost lap up her juices before massaging her clitoris with it. Jimmy can't stop moaning, fortunately Ms. Martinez's office is located in a secluded area of the building where not many students pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley finally forces you off of her and stares at you, almost as if you were a savage beast trying to kill her. Stumbling back, she leans against the wall and recuperates. You pick yourself up and grin madly, licking your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley reaches around and peels her face off, Jimmy quickly revealing himself, strips Ashley's body off. Holding his cock, he's ready to rumble as it's already rock hard. Walking up to you, he reaches around and grabs your thick ass, pushing you onto the desk, previously cleared by your shenanigans with Ms. Martinez's body. Feeling Jimmy's head touch your labia, you moan as you finger yourself. Suddenly, he pushes it into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie's memories take you back to when she first lost her virginity. She was 9, her uncle was visiting the farm house from Ireland at Christmas.<br>\r\nAllie's father let her tend to the cattle in the barn house whenever she wanted to, it was fun. Her uncle caught her alone in the barn, and had his way with her.<br>\r\nShe cried endlessly, but never told her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts shaking as Jimmy pounds your cunt, you feel the tears drip down your cheeks as you moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about to cum... I'm gonna' do it!\" Jimmy says, his face with a look of restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllie's PTSD kicks in and you scream, visions of her uncle flashing through your head as Jimmy cums inside of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bursts open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on here?!\"</span></div></div>",

Holding his cock, he's ready to rumble as it's already rock hard. Walking up to you, he reaches around and grabs your thick ass, pushing you onto the desk, previously cleared by your shenanigans with Ms. Martinez's body. Feeling Jimmy's head touch your labia, you moan as you finger yourself. Suddenly, he pushes it into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations were amazing, Jimmy was pounding Allie's cunt over and over while you moaned in pleasure and followed his rhythm.  It felt like you were almost on autopilot, with Allie's body knowing what to do on it's own.  You could feel the building climax, Jimmy started thrusting even harder and you both reached orgasm simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wow\" he panted, as he fell back onto the floor \"that was exactly what I fucking needed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too busy relishing in the afterglow of your own orgasm to respond to him.  You smiled as you thought about the hot body you were currently wearing, and the pleasure you keep getting from it.  You reached up to caress Allie's tits as Jimmy stood back up and started to pull the Ashley skin back on.  That's when you realized the two of you had been in there for a while and Allie was probably expected somewhere soon.  Jimmy was now slowly starting to put Ashley's clothes back on over his new skin, making sure to feel his new assets at every chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess since Ms. Martinez no longer needs me, I should head towards my next class\" you said, smiling at the sound of your new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I should get Ashley here on schedule too\" Jimmy said, groping himself through Ashley's clothes \"I just gotta revert Ms. Martinez first, don't wanna leave any evidence\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jimmy went to work cleaning the mess on the floor and replacing everything on Ms. Martinez's desk, You went to work redressing your hot new body.  Grabbing the pile of clothes Allie had been wearing before she became your latest ride, you pull her underwear out.  A bright pink g-string and matching bra...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"great\" you moan to Jimmy \"I can't believe this is what she picked to wear today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy finishes the desk and looks over at you.  A smile crosses his face \"dude, Allie is so fucking hot!\" he keeps working on the office clean up but keeps you in view so can admire your new body as you get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the thong up between your legs and slide it up tight against your crotch, the feeling of the material against your cunt brings a slight arousal to you.  You blush as you think about getting to wear it for the rest of the day, realizing you actually like that Allie chose to wear it today.  But you're not gonna let Jimmy know that!  You put on her bra and catch a glimpse of yourself in the reflection off the tinted glass window of Ms. Martinez's office and smirk.  \"Jimmy was definitely right\" you thought, \"this IS one hot body\" and you run your hands down your new skin one more time before putting on the rest of Allie's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the new Allie and Ashley walked out of Ms. Martinez's office and closed the door behind them as the guidance counselor slowly regained consciousness behind her desk.  The two girls separated at the end of the hallway, each heading towards their next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>David walked down the hallway, loving the feel of the bright pink thong that was between Allie's ass cheeks.  The natural swing of Allie's hips caused a slight erotic feeling as the thong shifted slightly back and forth, grinding against his new lower regions.  David was loving the looks he was getting in Allie's skin from the other students in the hallway, Allie was an exceptionally beautiful girl and she was well known for track abilities.  Not to mention the amazing shape she was in from all of her sprinting training.  Yep, David was wearing the form of an incredibly hot girl and nobody was any wiser to that fact.  This secret knowledge was keeping him slightly aroused as he stopped at Allie's locker and pulled the pens out of Allie's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about the amazing functions of the pens and he was grateful for the brown pen's ability to bestow him with the necessary memories and mannerisms to imitate his host perfectly.  While he was momentarily lost in thought, he didn't notice the person approaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Allie!\" a bright and bubbly voice spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to see Rachel Donahue, a junior sprinter for the track team looking at him and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Rachel!\" he returned, smiling and quickly shoving the pens into Allie's locker for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? I'm still a little sore from yesterday's practice\" you say, hoping to distract Rachel from asking about the weird looking objects you had just stuffed in Allie's locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, same\" she said, \"coach really pushed us since our meet tomorrow is against our rival school.\"  Rachel then bent over touched the floor, trying to stretch out her legs.  You stood there and looked at the gorgeous girl before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was a 5'4\" natural strawberry blonde with a bombshell body.  You could see her shirt and bra straining against gravity to keep her 34C's from hanging too low towards the ground.  Looking down her back, you could tell her gray yoga pants were slightly see through from this close and that she was wearing a black lace thong underneath them.  Since you appeared to be Allie, one of her good friends, she had no inclination to assume that you would be checking her out while she stretched.  As she started to unbend, you averted your gaze back to Allie's locker.  Feeling your body start to get hot after that visual stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you think today's practice will be worse?\" Rachel asked you as she again stood facing you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, coach promised us a rest day after that work out\" you responded, using Allie's memories to aid you  \"I'm actually looking forward to it\"<br>\r\nyou told her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough in reality you were mostly looking forward to changing with the rest of the team in the locker room before practice, and the shower in your new skin afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it won't be too bad. See you this afternoon!\" Rachel spun around and headed into her next class. You smiled at her and returned her goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a mental note as you watched her ass move back and forth as she entered the classroom across the hall. She was another potential host for the future.  Closing Allie's locker, you walked to her next class, Biology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the classroom door and took Allie's seat towards the back of the classroom.  Allie was one of the few students in her Biology class with any visual impairment, so she had a seat in the back row, perfect for covertly exploring your new skin.  Sitting down, you take out Allie's Bio book and notes while the biology teacher begins to lecture at the front of the class.  Taking a quick scan around the classroom, you find everyone else paying attention to the lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\" you say under your breath as you slowly slide a hand put your skirt and begin playing with your new clit.  A few minutes go by as you feel your arousal increasing, thinking about your perfect imitation of Allie while talking to Rachel.  You can feel the pressure starting to build and if you continue you know you won't be able to hold back soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you excuse yourself to the restroom and finish?  Or take a break and just try to wait for the school day to end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The teacher acknowledged you and allowed you to leave for the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly excused yourself and headed towards the women's restroom down the hallway.  As you walked through the hallway, you groped Allie's ass checks and snapped the bright pink g-string between her ass cheeks.  Whimpering slightly at the pleasure it brought to Allie's crotch, you pictured how hot it would look if you saw Allie doing this in the hallway.  You smiled as you opened the door to the women's room, reminding yourself that you could do a whole lot more than just imagine watching Allie.  You could do whatever you wanted with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked to make sure the restroom is empty other than yourself and then check out your reflection in the mirrors.  One of the hottest girls in your school was staring back at you, and her face reflected your lustful expression.  You brought your hands up and groped the tits attached to your chest and felt your new pussy getting wet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Allie's body is so easily aroused\" you stated to your reflection as you moved a hand down under your skirt, feeling how damp her thong now was.  As your face started to grow flush, you stripped off the tight pink tank top Allie had worn that day and pulled her white ruffled athletic skirt down off of her legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you staring at the reflection of Allie playing with herself in a lacy pink bra and matching g-string.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move Allie's things into a stall and close the door behind you, your hand moves past the pink thong and into Allie's eager vagina, playing with her clit.  Your other hand was groping one of her tits and pinching her nipple in extreme arousal.  Moans escaped from your lips and you knew it wouldn't be long before you brought Allie's erotic body to climax.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pleasure increased, you went faster and harder until Allie's body climaxed and you let out a sound of pure passion and contentment as her body released fluid from her pussy.  That had felt great, but the sex with Jimmy had still felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about finding someone else to fuck with Allie's hot body while you put her clothes back on and fixed her hair in the mirror before walking out of the restroom.  </span></div></div>",

He had decided to stop at Allie's locker quickly to fix her makeup in her locker mirror. As David was reapplying Allie's eyeliner, he saw the school's overweight loser of a security guard Officer Hurley moving behind him. David let out a quiet sigh before he turned around to deal with this new annoyance. \"Hi Officer Hurley, can I help you with something?\" David asked, a smile across Allie's cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 52 year old 5'10\" overweight security guard peered down the hallway in both directions before taking a step closer to the fake girl in front of him. \"You can tell me how you turned that girl into your own costume plaything\" He said to David in a straight forward manner. David could not hide his look of surprise and as he turned to run, Officer Hurley grabbed Allie's shoulder and pulled David closer to him.  \"No no no! I'm not trying to get you in trouble! I'm hoping you'll help me get a new body too\" the obese man whispered into David's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Hurley released his grip and David started swiftly walking towards the security office located on the far side of the school. Officer Hurley was close behind him, staring at  Allie's ass cheeks quivering from David's rapid pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, a naked David and Officer Hurley were sitting in the security office finishing up their conversation. Officer Hurley was holding Allie's loose skin up and examining it \"So the pens can turn people into skins that give you the person's shape and memories when you put it on?\" Hurley asked. \"That's pretty much it in a nutshell\" David answered, then he continued \"I can't believe you caught me by watching the surveillance footage of me entering Ms. Martinez' office but never coming back out.\" Officer Hurley smiled and explained why he had stopped David in the hallway in the first place. He knew that his life was a joke and he wanted out. He was tired of the students always making him the butt of their jokes and insulting him behind his back. He wanted a fresh start in life and he already knew whose life he wanted to steal. The senior girl who constantly berated him for being a miserable failure, Felicity Baker. Her popularity and wealthy family made her a great choice already, Hurley's hatred just made her the perfect choice for him. David smiled as the large man in front of him was finishing up his story, a plan already developing in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thank you for letting her out of your class to come down here. Okay I don;t wanna take up any more of your time, buh-bye.\" Officer Hurley put the phone back in its stand and laughed. He was going to have a new life soon! He was going to steal the life of a hot, popular, and wealthy 18 year old girl and nobody would ever find out. Just the idea of being able to see Felicity's naked body anytime that he wanted was exciting him. The sight in front of him was also a culprit for the large tent forming in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was very aware of Officer Hurley's stare as he was putting Allie's skin back on. He didn't really mind the man staring at him, Allie was gorgeous and Officer Hurley's stare was enough to get David's crotch hot. David finally noticed the security guard's erection and felt Allie's thong beginning to soak through once again. David knew there wasn't enough time to let mount the security guard's massive shaft before Felicity showed up, and he needed to be hidden by the time she opened the door. Looking around the office, David found the perfect hiding spot and smiled. As he walked around the desk where Officer Hurley was now sitting, he made eye contact with the security guard.  The bulge in Officer Hurley's pants was now threatening to rip through the man's pants. He slowly unzipped and dropped his pants, his eyes never leaving the underwear clad blonde coming towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Felicity Baker stood outside the door of the security office. She was glad to be out of History class early since her teacher was a real creep, always looking at her when he thought she didn't notice him. However, being called down to the office of that fat slob wasn't much better in her opinion. She knocked on the door and waited for a response. She heard Officer Hurley rustling around behind the door before she heard him say \"unhh...come in!\"<br>\r\nFelicity opened the door expecting something out of the ordinary, but found Officer Hurley sitting behind his desk. The security guard had an odd look on his face as he gestured for Felicity to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 5'6\" brunette bombshell sat in empty chair in front of her and crossed her legs as she looked at Hurley expectantly, waiting to hear why she had been called there. Felicity was wearing a tight long sleeved white v-neck shirt, a grey tennis skirt and wedged sandals on her feet. Officer Hurley looked at Felicity sitting right there in front of him and tried not to reveal his secret glee. Felicity had no idea what he was about to do to her or about the Junior track star currently blowing him under his desk. He looked down briefly at the blonde pony tail bobbing up and down, Allie's lips and tongue working to pleasure his large shaft. He looked back up at Felicity and before she could say anything Officer Hurley pointed the black pen at her and turned the hot senior into a pile of clothes and skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was busy under the table when he heard the pen go off. As he wrapped his lips around the shaft in front of him, David had one hand teasing Allie's nipple and the other hand was massaging Allie's clit. David could feel the security guard tense up just before he blew his load into David's mouth. Hurley stood up as David moved out from under the desk to spit the cum into the trash. Hurley moved around the desk to inspect his conquest, removing the loose skin from the clothes around it. The man began to strip down, his hands shaking with excitement at the thought of what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked over at the naked security guard as he pushed his fat body into Felicity's skin. Hurley had gotten both of his legs into the skin and he already felt the tingling sensation as his legs slimmed down to match Felicity's long, smooth legs. David was amazed at the elasticity of Felicity's skin as the security guard finished fitting his impressive bulk inside of her. As the costuming process finished, the man inside of Felicity's skin stood up and began to explore his stolen body. Hurley ran his hands through Felicity's long brunette hair and slowly moved his hands down, exploring every inch of his luscious new form. He wanted to see his new slim and sexy reflection so he moved into the security office bathroom to look in the mirror. He saw Felicity staring back him from his reflection, her naked body moving the way he wanted it to. He was amazed that the beautiful and athletic girl he was staring at was how everyone would see him now. His eyes kept going back to the perky D cup breasts attached to his chest and he found his hands couldn't give the soft fleshy globes enough attention. As he watched the image of Felicity busy groping herself, it dawned on him that his manhood was gone. He looked down at his new crotch and immediately began to explore the outer lips of Felicity's...his new vagina. He could feel his stolen skin beginning to heat up with sexual desire and he needed to release it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The school day had ended twenty minutes ago and the hallways were already empty. He needed to get to the girl's locker room to change for Allie's track practice, but he couldn't help taking a detour past Mr. Henderson's classroom to check on the new \"Felicity\". As he approached to door he could muffled sounds from the classroom beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peered through the door's small window and smiled at the scene he saw inside. A topless Felicity was moving up and down behind Mr. Henderson's desk, her large perky tits bouncing in rhythm. Even though David couldn't see the entire scene from his vantage point, he knew the ex security officer was riding Felicity's teacher and enjoying every second of it. David stood in the deserted hallway for several minutes, one hand down the front of his skirt and the other tweaking one of Allie's nipples through her pink tank top. Before he could work up his stolen body, he was startled by a vibration from Allie's cell phone. He quickly pulled his hand out from the skirt he had on and pulled out the phone to see who had messaged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA text from Rachel was on Allie's front screen: \"Where r u?? Practice starts in 10 min!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid sighed and looked back at the scene in the classroom, Officer Hurley was groping Felicity's large tits as he tried to stifle a moan. Mr. Henderson had no idea the gorgeous 18 year old brunette riding his dick was nothing more than a skin being worn by a middle aged, over weight man. David could feel Allie's nipples start to perk up at this thought and he quickly headed back down the hallway towards the girl's locker room. He could meet up with his new friend after Allie's track practice for all the details, but he needed to get there first. Allie would never normally be late and David didn't want anything to seem unusual about \"Allie\" since she left Ms. Martinez's office that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe responded to Rachel's text with a quick \"on my way!\" as he hurried down the hall.</span></div></div>",

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary to any of the other girls as David opened Allie's locker and pulled out her track bag before beginning to remove his tank top and skirt. Pulling the ruffled white skirt down to his ankles and stepping out of it, David finally snuck a few glances at the girls around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne locker down was Katie Hunt, his girlfriend's little sister. She had just joined the track team this year but she was already a good addition to the team. She was talking to another sophomore and had her back towards David at the moment but he knew her by her voice. Katie was wearing tight spandex shorts and David couldn't help but notice how great her butt looked in them. He had always thought she was cute but her short time on the track team had already started to tone the girl's body. As she started to put on a spots bra David turned back towards Allie's locker and grabbed a pair of tight black spandex shorts to put on himself. Deciding to keep Allie's thong on, David stepped into the spandex and pulled the garment up his shapely legs until it was snug against his crotch. He then took off Allie's bra and donned the athletic shirt she had packed that morning, letting Allie's body go through the motions basically on auto pilot.As David took a seat on the bench to tie up Allie's running shoes Rachel came over and sat down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you were almost late for practice! what's up? Is everything okay?\" she said, a look of slight concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Rachel, everything is totally fine. I just had to speak to Mr. Henderson quickly about the exam next week\" David responds, glancing back at her and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hate having to go see him outside of class. I can always tell he's checking me out through my clothes.\" she says before standing up to head towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! He's such a creep!\" David says and then he giggles, as he checks out her ass with glee. Standing up, David assumes Allie's role of sprinting team captain and tells the rest of the team to meet outside in 2 minutes to start stretching for practice. Then he and Rachel head towards the door to the athletic fields behind the school. David smiles as he opens the door and lets Rachel exit first, nobody was suspicious that he wasn't actually Allie Davidson.</span></div></div>",

As the captain for the girls sprinting team, he got to lead their stretch circle before the coach took over the practice of the entire track team. The girl's sprinting team only had four students on it including David's current skin so it was a very \"intimate\" stretch circle for David. He spent the short time using Allie's memories and flexible, athletic body to correctly perform each stretch and then he would \"help\" one of the other girls correct her posture. Giving him the opportunity to get very close to each of the girls and study them. He spent the most time \"helping\" Rachel, and checking out her body as intimately as he could without giving himself away. He was certain that he wanted to try out her body at some point, he just wasn't sure when that would be yet. He was still too enthralled with stolen flesh he was still wearing. Plus, there were definitely other candidates on the track team for himself, Jimmy, or even Officer Hurley to wear in the near future if they so chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone was done stretching, the entire track team circled up around their coach Ms. Miller to continue practice. Ms. Miller was a 5'5 dirty blond woman in her early thirties. She was the school's health teacher and she was currently engaged to one of the biology teachers. She had been a track star in college and she looked like she could still run a race now. David was fixated on her body as she gave practice instructions to the team surrounding her. Her breasts were a perky B cup from what David could tell and her body was toned from her continued healthy life style. David used to fantasize about her ass as she walked around the classroom when he took her health class last year. Her body was another that he wouldn't mind wearing at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later, he was heading back into the girl's locker room with the rest of the team.

Then David returned to his current situation, stripping his stolen flesh as he watched the other girls doing the same. He had a hard time maintaining his composure as he watched the rest of the team stripping down around him, Allie's body starting to respond to his excitement. Girls were talking and laughing openly, their glistening bodies on display as they removed their sweaty clothing. As girls started to head for the showers on the far side of the locker room David realized he would get to live out a scene many men had fantasized about, he would get to shower with the entire girl's track team. He was practically drooling as he followed the rest of the team into the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the shower stalls was big enough for 3 or girls to go at once and David followed two girls into the furthest shower stall without noticing who he had followed. He was mesmerized by the wet naked bodies he could steal glances at as he walked past each stall. Inside the shower stall, one of the girls turned on the water and the sudden stream brought David out of trance. He quickly identified the two girls in the shower with him. The girl that turned on the shower he hadn't met before, but Allie's memories told him her name was Amanda Garrison. She was a petite brunette with an athletic frame and an ass to die for. The other girl was none other than Rachel! David tried to keep his glee to himself, but it was hard to hold in his excitement as a plan started to form in his head. He knew that Amanda was always quick to shower and get out, wanting to stretch again after her shower which would leave David and Rachel alone in the stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shoot, I forgot my shampoo in my locker!\" David said to the two of them as he quickly went to retrieve Allie's shampoo bottle.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda was already rinsing her hair as David reentered the stall while Rachel was still trying to clean all of the sweat off of her body. David moved Allie's hot body under the hot water and proceeded to start washing himself. He saw this as an opportunity to grope his stolen assets without too much worry about anyone questioning him. David went about washing Allie's body excitedly, spending a lot of time groping himself under the pretense of \"washing\". Soon Amanda was done rinsing her hair and left the shower stall, leaving Rachel alone with a perverted horny boy wearing her friend's sexy skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had her back to David she washed her chest and moved down to her crotch and legs, bending over in the process. David now had the best view he could hope for of Rachel's beautiful behind directly in front of him. Allie's body was already starting to heat up and David was playing with his stolen pussy, stifling his moans with his other hand so as not to alert Rachel. Thankfully the showers were quite loud with the whole team using them. Allie's nipples were getting hard as he teased her clit and stared at Rachel's ass. Then Rachel returned to standing and turned towards David. He quickly pretended to be washing Allie's blond hair before she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Allie could wash my back and help me with my hair?\" the beautiful strawberry blond asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally, you'll have to help me with mine too\" David responded, hiding his huge smile as Rachel turned back around and presented her back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid grabbed Rachel's soap and began to lather her back, really taking his time and feeling her skin. David couldn't help but think about how erotic this scene must look. Allie's body was now very hot and excited, David was ready for more and he was ready to make a move on Rachel to see what would happen. He slowly moved one of his hands down to Rachel's lower back and started to massage her there, she stiffened slightly, but then relaxed again. Seeing her reaction, David slid his other hand down her back. Feeling little resistance, David made his move. Sliding his hands still lower, he began to grope Rachel's full ass cheeks. Rachel moaned slightly and then spun around, seemingly wanting to stop the erotic encounter there. As she spun to face her \"friend\" David stepped in and planted his stolen lips on Rachel's, effectively preventing her from exclaiming for anyone else to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel started to resist but as David slip Allie's tongue into her mouth, Rachel closed her eyes and all resistance disappeared. David's stolen body was on fire as he put his hands behind Rachel and groped her ass once again. As he did Rachel let out a moan and embraced him back. As the two of them started to grope each other, David moved one hand to Rachel's pussy and explored her outer lips. Rachel's body was getting excited and David knew she wouldn't stop now. As they began a passionate make out session, David had one hand in Rachel's mound and the other on his own. David brought Allie's body forward and felt Allie's nipples touching Rachel's ample chest, Rachel moaned as David moved lower and sucked her nipple on his way down to her clit. David moved his stolen flesh to its knees and proceeded to eat out Rachel's pussy. Rachel went to her knees from the pleasure and eventually sat in the corner of the stall, Allie's head between her legs. As David felt Rachel beginning to buck from pleasure, he reversed their positions, moving Rachel down toward his stolen pleasure center. As Rachel's tongue moved around Allie's clit, he could tell that she ad never done this before...but she was learning quickly. Waves of pleasure hit his stolen flesh as felt an orgasm building up inside him. He had to stifle a loud moan as he climaxed and coated Rachel in his stolen juices. The cum on her face quickly washed away in the shower's spray as Rachel moved her head back up to look at David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid kissed her quickly on the lips before standing up and reaching out of the stall. Never breaking eye contact, David grabbed the black pen and shot Rachel's naked body. Watching it deflate as he groped his stolen tits and sighed. Quickly peaking his head out of the stall, he could tell no one had heard their private encounter and a grin spread across Allie's cute face.</span></div></div>",

Nobody knew that inside the body of the charming female editor was a boy, and the thrill he got from the glances and stares turned him on almost as much as Ashley's body did. Though nothing spectacular, her body was certainly attractive and he had managed to find time during lessons to admire her body in the bathroom and enjoy himself for a little bit, without drawing the attention of anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the locker room, Jimmy opened the door speculatively and peeked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allie?\" Careful not to expose anyone, Jimmy decided to keep to the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a lone figure at the far end arranging her locker and walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Al-\" The locker closed just as the slender figure of Ashley White reached it, revealing not Allie Davidson, but the slightly shorter, though no less lithe figure of Rachel Donahue, her hair let down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Ashley, haven't seen you in a while.\" Rachel looked up from her locker and smiled. \"Looking for Allie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah. Gotta talk about the upcoming report in the press. She still here?\" Slightly surprised and flustered, Jimmy managed to blurt out a reply, adjusting his glasses in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's back there, should have come out by now.\" Rachel motioned to the showers as she stood up. \"I'll be going first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks!\" Jimmy set down Ashley's bag on one of the benches as she moved towards the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jimmy moved further back into the room, there was no sign of David anywhere. Looking closer, he saw a half-closed stall and grinned, his imagination running wild as he moved toward the stall. Guess 'Allie' wasn't done after all, or perhaps David was just waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jimmy gingerly pushed the stall open, his surprise at the empty store was quickly blotted out as he was pushed against the wall. \"Wha-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was drowned out as a slender, soft index finger was planted on Ashley's lips. Looking up, he saw not Allie, but Rachel giving him a wink as her other hand moved down Ashley's jeans. Suddenly, everything clicked. \"You son of a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...\" And with that Rachel laughed, a soft melodious tinkle. \"People might hear us if you're too loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ashley's jeans dropped as Rachel's clothes were tossed to the floor as the two began to make out in the stall, their lips locking as their hands moved all over each other's body. Feeling the inconvenience of Ashley's black glasses, Jimmy motioned to take them off, but as he put Ashley's hand to the side of his glasses Rachel's hand held his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way is better.\" Rachel's voice purred. As both tried to hold their moans back, their hands rubbed each others clits with increasing vigour. \"Ngh...Rachel...\" David got turned on by Ashley's voice calling out the track junior's name, and Jimmy enjoyed the smell and slightly sticky feeling Rachel's sweat, not fully washed off from her training. Both girls climaxed together as they tried to suppress the intensity of their orgasms, slowly sliding down to the floor against the back of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get enough of this.\" David panted. \"You got me good there, I'll admit.\" Jimmy laughed, and as both of them stood up they hurriedly picked up their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait up.\" As Jimmy was about to put his clothes on, David stopped him. \"Take this.\" He tossed something to Jimmy, who caught it. Straightening it out, Jimmy saw it to be Allie's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two track members coming out of the locker room after practice. Who would suspect anything? Besides, take it from me, this body is great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy smiled. \"You've really thought a lot through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beautiful, slender figure of Allie Davidson and the flowing hair of the shorter, but no less attractive Rachel Donahue walked out of the locker room together laughing and smiling, no one would have suspected anything other than two good friends having a conversation after a long day of school.</span></div></div>",

He sat through her classes and tried not to get caught groping Her supple flesh openly until the final bell rang. Getting up out of Allie's desk, David was looking forward to track practice next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way to Allie's locker to drop off her books, and grabbed the pens he had stashed there.  He was relieved nothing had happened to them while he was enjoying his female form throughout the day.  He thought back quickly to his masturbation session in the women's restroom and felt his pussy grow damp again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Ashley White approached him while he was still looking in Allie's locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it certainly looks like YOU had a good day 'Allie', anything interesting happen?\" Jimmy commented as he noticed your flushed face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing really, I just feel like I know myself so much better than I did this morning\" you respond, smiling back at the apparent girl beside you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Martinez is a real miracle worker\" you chuckle to Jimmy, and you covertly run a hand down your hot body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, but I'm feeling a little left out ya know?\" Jimmy smiled as he watched you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking the same thing\" you respond, \"maybe you should join the track team?\" you muse \"I'm sure Rachel would be happy to help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy's eyes light up as he catches the hidden meaning to your last comment.  He licks Ashley's lips and smiles while he covertly gropes his borrowed body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll see you in the locker room and we can discuss it\" You say to him, keeping up appearances as two girls just having a normal conversation.  Nobody had noticed anything strange about the two girls as of yet, and absolutely nobody suspected that the two were being worn like cheap suits by male students only trying to abuse their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close Allie's locker and take 'Ashley's' arm, steering her down the hallway towards the locker rooms.  You hoped to get there before anyone else so you could think of a plan with Jimmy.</span></div></div>",

When silence remains, you are satisfied that the two of you were alone.  That would make the plan you two have for Rachel much easier to complete.  Jimmy begins to remove the Ashley skin while you take out Allie's cell phone to call Rachel.  You see her name after scrolling Allie's contact list for a minute and hit the call button.  You hear Rachel's phone ringing on the other end and glance back towards Jimmy, he had already fully removed Ashley's skin and stored it in her bag for later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear Rachel answer her phone \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel! hey, I have a new stretch from coach that is absolutely fantastic and you neeeed to come try it out with me right now!\" you exclaim, using the same tone and expressions the real Allie would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? of course! where are you right now? I'll come right away\" she responds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the locker room, I figured I could change early before the rest of the girls so I could stretch for a longer time\" you lie through the phone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll head over there right now\" Rachel says, \"See you in 10 minutes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang up the phone, proud that your deception had worked out and Rachel would still be here before the other girls.  You turn back towards Jimmy and see that he staring at you with a full erection, you instantly feel Allie's crotch start to grow damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,,,we still have 10 minutes to kill\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you seductively remove Allie's top and skirt before pulling Jimmy into a shower stall.  His hands are instantly at your tits and while you have one hand stroking his cock and the other rubbing your clit.  Your lips meet his and the two of you are passionately kissing as he strips you of the bra and thong Allie had worn to school that day.  After another minute of foreplay and you're both already hot enough to move on to the main event.  This time, you push Jimmy down onto the shower seat and mount his fully erect cock.  You slowly ease Allie's quivering pussy down onto his shaft and begin riding him up and down, increasing your speed as you go.  After another few minutes you practically stabbing yourself on his cock as the two of you climax again.  This time, he releases while you are in the air above his cock and he sprays cum all over your ass cheeks.  You pause for a moment, not wanting to find out if you can get pregnant while wearing Allie's skin, so he can finish ejaculating and then you bring his face to Allie's pussy so he can finish your orgasm with his tongue.  You let out several loud moans and grope your tits before finally climaxing and cumming on your friends face.  You both sit there panting for a bit before you remember that Rachel could walk in at any second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shove Jimmy out of the shower stall and get him to hide behind a row of lockers, tossing him the pens from Allie's bag just the door to the locker room starts to open and Rachel walks in.  Rachel's expression was surprised at the state her apparent friend was in as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you just had sex\" she giggles as she moves further into the locker room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah haha...coach told me the stretch works best if you're naked\" you return weakly, hoping she buys it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever, if that's what coach says then fine\" Rachel says as she puts down her bag and begins to take off her shirt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jimmy shoots her with one of the pens from behind and watch as Rachel deflates into a pile of clothes and skin, just like the one you had put on to become the sexy sprinter you now appeared to be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, now THAT was a fucking rush!\" Jimmy exclaimed as he walked over to the pile that was Rachel Donahue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the entire pile and walked into another shower stall almost skipping in his excitement.  You just stood there for a minute, a smile on your borrowed face, and a hand inside your borrowed crotch.  Thinking about the numerous experiences you had already been through in the past couple hours. You could hear Jimmy putting on Rachel's skin, and you were bummed that you hadn't gotten the chance to see her strip naked before Jimmy had turned her into a skin.  Just then Jimmy walked out of the shower stall, wearing Rachel's skin with all of her clothes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you missed out on seeing this fine piece of ass strip down\" he said to you, an erotic and provocative edge in Rachel's voice, \"So I thought I would teat you to a show, ya know to thank you for helping me score this sexy body\" He said the last part while he caressed Rachel's tits and moved her hands down her body, exploring as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew there was a reason we're best friends\" you said to him, smiling as you watched the show beginning in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo anyone who might have walked in right at that moment, it would have appeared that hot red head was performing a strip tease for her friend and captain.  Who was now back in Allie's hot pink thong and masturbating as she watched.  David was groping one of Allie's tits and playing with her pussy while Jimmy slowly explored and stripped his new body.  He started with Rachel's white tank top, pulling it over his head and exposing the black wonder bra Rachel had on underneath it.  He then slowly brought his hands up to his new head of hair and felt every inch of nubile and supple flesh he now possessed on his way down to removing the tight gray yoga pants that Rachel had worn to show off her toned legs and perfect butt.  As he slid the pants down his legs, Jimmy spun so that the black lace thong riding up Rachel's ass was in full view for David to see.  David could feel yet another orgasm working within the body he wore, that of the sexy sprinting captain Allie.  Jimmy snapped the thong between his ass cheeks and let out a pleasant moan from Rachel's lips.  He was so turned on by his hot new body and the sight of what appeared to be Allie masturbating to him.  He stripped out of Rachel's bra and then approached David, accentuating the swing of Rachel's hips as he climbed on top of his friend.  The two apparent girls locked lips and began a passionate make out session, groping each other and writhing on the ground, grinding and thrusting their cunts towards each other.  It was the hottest scene either boy had ever dreamed of.  Two of the hottest girls in their school practically fucking in just their thongs.  After several minutes of moaning and giggling, both boys separated and began to prepare for the rest of the team to enter the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of girls entered the locker room chatting happily and began to undress from their school clothes, getting ready for track practice.  Everyone had barely noticed Allie and Rachel had already been in the locker room, and no one had noticed their flushed expressions or lack of clothing as anything beyond simple changing.  The two boys were ecstatic that their plan had gone so well, and they were now admiring the rest of the track team stripping down to nothing.  Both secretly agreed as they followed the rest of the team out of the locker room, it had been quite a great day at school so far.</span></div></div>",

The other girls seemed not to be paying any particular attention to the two of them, focusing on showering quickly before meeting later in the night.

Ms. Wilson's skin lay out flat across Jimmy's bed, her drooping, slack face with it's empty eyeholes and mouth stared up into the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, this shit is so cool!\" Heather shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've said that five times already!\" Jimmy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for Trish to stop being so lame..\" He grumbled, his mouse clicking away quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid got up, he had put back on his underwear and jeans, but left off his shirt for convenience sake incase they wanted to wear the skins again. Besides, the three of them have been friends since probably birth, it's not like they've never seen each other naked. David leaned over Jimmy's shoulder and inspected his browsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm researching this thing, trying to figure out where you got it from, what it even <b>is</b>.\" Jimmy explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me that you won't find it anytime soon.\" David replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, can I see it?\" Ms Wilson's voice suddenly asked from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked around to see Ms. Wilson standing there, looking around for the black pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, switched to my mother.\" Jimmy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" David said, exchanging the black pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it?\" Ms. Wilson said, rather disappointed. \"I expected it to look.. cooler.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, we expected it to not exist, but hey.\" Jimmy shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you guys had this?\" Trish asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was mailed to me today, actually. \" David replied. \"No sender's address.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird..\" Ms Wilson stated. \"So you guys zapped Jimmy's family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Jimmy grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty hardcore.\" Ms Wilson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Jimmy grunted, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were.. masturbating as your sister.\" Ms Wilson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" Jimmy retorted, once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys tried female bodies.. and you're guys..\" Ms Wilson wondered, \"Can I try one of you guys on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Jimmy whirled around, their eyes wide in both fear and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute now!\" Jimmy said, raising his hands as though he were held at gunpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wearing the least clothes Jimmy, it's your turn!\" Trish exclaimed, raising the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish wa-\" Jimmy crumpled into a skin, hanging over his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Wilson promptly ran towards Jimmy's skin and scooped it up, David staring at her incredulously. Then, standing in the middle of the bedroom, began stripping off Ms Wilson, revealing Heather underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can wear more than one at once..?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently.\" Heather replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her mother's skkin onto the bed, she then repeated the process with her own skin, until on Trish remained. Holding out Jimmy's skin, she climbed inside quickly.<br>\r\nDavid watched as one of his best friends became the other, Jimmy's pale, skinny form encaspulated Trish's olive toned, fit one. Pulling his head on, he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.. so this is what being a guy feels like.\" Jimmy said, staring at his palms, then his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Jimmy sprouted an erection. He began to laugh, seemingly excited and amused as his member grew. Taking it in one hand, he began to jerk it slowly, the sight awkward as Trish was rather unexperienced having never done it before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.. I'm <b>really</b> horny. Woah..\" Jimmy said, looking to David. \"Wanna' try something.. fun, David?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you implying that Jimmy and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you twit. Put on one of the other suits.\" Jimmy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, they're his relatives. That's not better at all.\" David replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? We'll do anal or something.\" Jimmy said, his cock throbbing with his treatment of it, \"Just look at this, David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what a boner looks like, Trish.\" David said lamely, \"No. I'm not fucking Jimmy in his sister or his mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a lame-o David. If you weren't you, I'd zap you and fuck Jimmy.\" He said, \"He'd probably be all for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God I'm me then..\" David said, both as a retort and a prayer. \"Can you take him off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill jerking his cock, Jimmy's eyes widened as he began to reach climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.. I'm cumming, oh G- Ughh..\" Jimmy sighed as he shot his sperm all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid stood there, clearly disturbed. Jimmy heaved another sigh and looked up, grinning an innocent Trish grin, which as a matter of fact looked horrible on Jimmy's face.</span></div></div>",

Putting the black pen down on his desk, the two of you watched as Jimmy reinflated.<br>\r\nHe slowly stirred, getting up, he groaned and opened his eyes, then suddenly snapped to alertness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what..?\" Jimmy said, \"Wait, you zapped me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she made quite the mess too.\" David chuckled, pointing to the pool of cum Trish made on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't nice Trish.. You could've atleast asked,\" Jimmy complained, \"Ah well, atleast a girl got me off, albeit from the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might be more inclined to get you off from the outside,\" Trish winked,\"Now that I know what you feel like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy blushed immediately, and Trish giggled, smiling. Jimmy's expression soon changed from embarassment to a sly one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Trish, I guess I'd better get to know you well too!\" Jimmy said as he grabbed the black pen from his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-!\" Trish exclaimed, before crumpling into a pile where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the two of you seem really into zapping people with the pen spontaneously.\" David remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I guess we do have that in common.\" Jimmy said as he walked over to her pile, \"Maybe it's true love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them snickered, and David watched as Trish's sexy athletic form came to life, Jimmy stuffing himself inside of her as she had just done to him.<br>\r\nHer strong thighs and curvacious torso formed as Jimmy pulled her skin up over himself, her modest breasts inflating on her chest. Pulling her shoulders on like a sweater, Jimmy threw her long blonde hair over his head as he ducked into her neck, fitting her face on. Trish gasped as her face came to life, Jimmy in control now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.. Trish. You made me cum, now it's your turn.\" Trish said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I could really see the two of you together,\" David said curiously, \"In a weird, sort of way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish blatently dropped herself onto the bed next to David and began to finger herself, tweaking her nipple with one hand, massaging her clit with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-\" Trish moaned softly, \"We're certainly together right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hurry it up, will you.\" David said, getting up and sitting down in the computer chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigning himself to browsing the internet as Trish's moaning only got louder. A long, shuddering sigh signalled her climax, and a sucking noise as Trish licked and sucked her juices from her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like that, David?\" Trish said as she pushed her breasts into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" David sighed, \"Take her off, Jimmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daviiiiiiiid, I'm still horny and I need a good dick..\" Trish whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, that's both incredibly weird coming from you, and also wrong in about ten different ways.\" David explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-.. But-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No means no, Jimmy.\" David said firmly, \"Take her off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish grabbed David's shoulder and spun him to face her as he sat in the computer chair. Standing infront of him, Trish was stark naked, her juices trickling down her thighs from her orgasm a few minutes ago. Suddenly, Trish mounted David and sat on his lap, her legs spread wide as she held his shoulder with one hand and rubbed his cunt with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David.. you've always wanted this. I've always wanted this.\" Trish moaned, staring into David's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha..?\" David stared back, dumbfounded. Something about the way trish was speaking made it seem as though Jimmy were really her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish leaned forward and whispered into David's ear, her delicate hands running up and down his bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you.. to fuck me..\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRearing up, she began to rub herself on David, gently rocking back and forth, her breasts pressing against David's chest. David felt his cock beginning to harden with the stimulation, and his conscience fought against his primal urge. David looked down to see that Trish was leaking pre-cum all over his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All this takes about two seconds before she then crumples to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there gasping and looking at Trish lying on the floor like a heap of clothing.<br>\r\n\"Hooly shit\" you stammer to yourself. \"It really worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly move towards Trish and poke her now lifeless skin with a finger. It feels just like a real skin, just without any bones or muscles pressing your finger back as you poke it.<br>\r\nYou feel a bit anxious about Trish's well being, but you know she wanted to try this out so you take a deep breath and pick the skin up. You pick up the skin and lay it on Trish's bed and start removing the clothes that hangs on it. When Trish's skin is completely nude you hold it up by it's shoulders to get a closer look. It was really weird looking at Trish like this, just a empty skin. Her head just dangling down in front of her chest lifelessly with her blonde hair doing the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how were you suppose to enter the skin you wondered. You couldn't see any openings in the front so you turned the skin around, you then see a slit that starts at the back of her head and stops right above her bum, ending with something that could remind of a nob. Carefully you reach your right hand inside the opening and work it inside trish's hand. As you got your hand well placed inside the \"skin's\" hand you noticed that your hand now looked exactly like Trish's. You looked at the hand in amazement as you moved your finger up and down. You moved your hand towards your face to have a closer look, it was just like seeing Trish's own! It was so weird watching the small feminine hand with manicured nails moving as it was your own... on the other side, it now was your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa..\" was all you got out of your mouth. You then quickly dragged your hand out of the suit, seeing that it now looked like your own, looking back at Trish's hand now lying there lifeless and empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the excitement inside you grow. This was really freaky but excitement as well, you just had to try it on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly undress yourself and start putting your right foot inside the skin, as you place your right foot into hers you feel the skin tighten again and the female leg you now looks and feel just like yours. Then you quickly put your other foot into the skins and feel the exact same feeling. You stand there watching your new small hairless legs for a second.<br>\r\nYou wasted no more time and start  working the rest of your body into the skin. You start maneuver both of your arms into the skin. Suddenly you are almost done, the only thing missing is the head which is now dangling on your chest. You reached for the empty head with your new hand and moves it towards your face, at the same time as you bend your own head down and start maneuvered into it. Working your eyes into Trish's now empty holes and fitting your lips inside hers. you then reach for the nob right above the bum with your right hand and seals the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the skin seals you feel a tingle run trough your body for about 2-3 seconds. Eagerly you walk towards the big mirror in Trish's room, you gasp at the sight that meets you. You see Trish looking back at you, naked.<br>\r\n \"Oh, my god! this is so fucking unbelievable!\" you think to yourself. You see Trish's cute face. You move your new hands to your cheeks and rubs them, then running them trough the long blonde hair. taking a step back so you can see the whole body, you cant help but getting a big grin on Trish's face. <br>\r\nYou just stand and admire the body in the mirror, moving your hands to Trish's cute face, watching the blue eyes the cute little nose and the long blond hair hanging loose. You move your hands down, cups her perky breasts and watches them rise and fall in amazement before moving down to her slender waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feeling aroused by seeing Trish's body mimicking your movements in the mirror. You waved at the mirror, tried out a few grimaces on your borrowed face and suddenly let out a giggle from her lips. \"Whoa, my voice\" you said to yourself, hearing Trish's higher pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so unbelievable cool\" you say out loud, giggling with your borrowed face and voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it's time to bring back Trish again\" You thought to yourself<br>\r\nYou decide to </span></div></div>",

You begin to moan uncontrollable as you speed up the process, suddenly you reach climax. Your body tightens up and you feel a powerful, immense sensation trough out your whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh goood\" you exclaim, breathing heavily. \"That was fucking awesome.\" <br>\r\nYou lay on her bed for a while catching your breath, it was the best feeling you ever had. You couldn't help but giggling to yourself as you think about what you just did... in your best friends body. It was so surreal, you actually were Trish down to her dna, nobody could ever think otherwise.\u00a8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather your thoughts and snap back to reality. \"Right, time to let Trish have her body back.\"<br>\r\nAs you are about to try to get out of the skin you see Trish's iphone laying in her bed. You pick up the phone and snap some pictures of yourself, doing different grimaces so Trish could see you in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter snapping some pictures you get up and as the note said, you start to focus on leaving the skin as you move your arms to the back of your head. <br>\r\nFocusing while looking for a opening with your hands you suddenly feel a little slit in the back of your head appear. As you stick your fingers inside it the slit widens downwards.<br>\r\nYou widen the hole big enough so you can press your head out of the suit. Turning to the mirror again you can see your head on Trish's female body and her head dangling down in front of your chest, like wearing a hoodie backwards. <br>\r\nYou continue widen the opening until it's as big as it was when you put it on. You work your arms out of the suit and then sits down on the bed and pull your feet out as well.<br>\r\nYou lay the lifeless skin of Thrish on the bed with her back facing you. <br>\r\n\"hmm what now?\" you think. You bend over the skin and grab the little nob that seems to have appeared at the end of the slit right over her bum and start moving in up towards her head, just like a zipper. When you finish zipping it all the way up to the back of the head the nob disappears and you notice the body starts to change, almost like pumping air into a air madras. Within about 5-6 seconds Trish's body seems to be normal again but she seems unconscious. You quickly grab her cloths and puts it on her body like she was when you zapped her with the device. You sit down on her chair looking at her and waiting for her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 minutes or so she starts to wake up. She rises up to a sitting position, clearly disoriented and confused. She shakes her head a bit before looking up at you. <br>\r\n\"Wha-what happened?\" She stammered looking at you for a second before you notice her eyes widen. \"It worked? didn't it?\" She asks with a shaken but excited voice.<br>\r\n\"Sure did\" you grin and toss her iphone on her lap. \"Take a look for yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up the phone and start scrolling on it with her finger. She looks at it with widen eyes and her mouth partly open before she looked up at you again.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! is that you? inside me? doing that?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure is\" you say still grinning. \"It really worked! It was so awesome, you turned into a costume in a second!\"<br>\r\nYou tell her all about how it worked with the opening in the back and the nob and how it felt like a real skin, how you actually became her fully.<br>\r\nTrish keeps asking questions about it, getting more and more excited for each answer she gets from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she looks at you thoughtfully.<br>\r\n\"Did you... did you explore me? you know downstairs?\" She asks with a more serious face and tone then before.<br>\r\nYou instantly start to blush as you hear the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah oh my god! You did! didn't you!?\" she exclaimed. \"You owe me big time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blushing you try to defend yourself but Trish keeps telling you how much you owe her for that. You are not sure if she is mad or just teasing you. Knowing Trish as well as you do she probably does a little of both, mostly teasing you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no more time wasting, I want to see this for myself!\" She says as she jumps up from her bed. \"And don't forget David, you owe me BIG time for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up the device and start fondling with it while she looks at you with a clever grin on her face.<br>\r\n\"Well david, are you ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not using that on me. No way!\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! I let you do it to me, not even knowing what it did in the first place!\" She says loud. \"You even had you way with me! It's time pay back what you owe me! I want to know how it feels like!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the pile are the skins of:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Jimmy (your best friend)<br>\r\n- Tina (your older sister)<br>\r\n- Katie (Jessica's younger sister); and <br>\r\n- Hannah (the bombshell brunette who lives next to Trish).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" asks Trish with a smug tone, \"Wanna try one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at her incredulously.

There's just too much leeway for abuse with these things.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're about to storm out with the skins, Trish sneaks up on you and grabs your wrist.  You're able to fling off her grasp but she pulls you around and kisses you passionately.  Your eyes widen as your best friend plants a big sopping wet one on you.  Trish and you have been friends for as long as you can remember but while you have had mostly platonic thoughts for her, you've never really thought of her as a romantic interest.  You push her away and oddly enough, she gives you a really big smile.

She finishes the ensemble with putting on Jessica's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how do I look?\" She asks you seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" You tell her looking down. She grabs your head. \"Look at me, you didn't have a lot of trouble when you were looking at mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Jessica's body and it makes you tingle. Trish got an eerie smile as her hand felt around your crotch. \"So you love the way I look?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod but try not to look too much at Jessica's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish then wants to do something with you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trish.. What!? Why didn't you..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're astounded, laying still as you stare at Jessica's now reddening cheeks. She smoothly bounces on your thighs, taking your member between her legs with every descent. Honestly, you can't even feel it, your mind is too sidetracked, filled with thoughts about this bizarre confession. Trish never showed any signs of interest in you, atleast, you'd never seen her show it.. you've known her all your life. Did it really take turning into your girlfriend for her to tell you this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you're snapped out of your thoughts when you feel breath on your cheeks, and suddenly, Jessica presses her lips to your own. Your eyes widen in surprise and you try your hardest to push her off of you, pulling your torso up, Jessica simply wraps her legs around your waist, securing herself on you. Finding it pointless, you pull your face away from Jessica's by leaning your head back, her eyes open and she hesitates. You're furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always been in love with me? WHAT THE FUCK TRISH?!\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shuts her eyes hard and looks down, away from your gaze. You notice tears run down her cheeks and instantly, you feel ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jessica.. I'm sorry, I- Wait.. this isn't Jessica, remember? It's Trish! Fucking Trish!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feelings of remorse instantly burn up in searing flame as you grab Jessica by the shoulders. Her head jolts up in surprise and she looks at you, tears pouring down her cheeks as she cries silently. You hesitate, unsure of what to say, and you two simply stare at each other. Moments pass, and your grip on her shoulders loosens, your hands sliding down her arms to her elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish.. why didn't you just tell me? Why did you turn my girlfriend into a fucking skin..? Did you expect me to love you after that?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuts her eyes, biting her bottom lip as she thinks for a moment, before she suddenly throws her arms around you and buries her head into your chest, her blonde locks cascading down her back. You exhale deeply and simply hug her, your initial feelings of anger and confusion subsiding. You can't stay mad at her for long, you've known her way too long and.. she's wearing Jessica's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                     ***********************************<br>\r\n\"Trish, why are you still wearing her?\" You ask, standing in Trish's room, she walks out of the bathroom after having cleaned up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David.. I can't face you as myself, not yet. I..\", she pauses for a moment, looking at the floor, \"I don't know what you'd do to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish had surrendered the pen over to you as a sign of penance, or at the very least, so that you could start to trust her again. But you and her both knew very well that you probably never would. After you'd gotten off of the floor, she'd slowly retreated to the bathroom to clean herself up. You'd heard loud crying coming from inside for a while, before it simply stopped.<br>\r\nLooking down at the black pen in your hand, you imagine in your head the scene of the crime. Trish using the pen to zap Jessica and put on her skin, turning into your very girlfriend, not even just a cheap imitation. It was traumatic and nightmarish when you thought about it. You tried not to imagine what would've happened if it wasn't Trish, however, instead some sick stranger wearing your girlfriend. <br>\r\nYour gaze falls on Jessica's pale skin, her crotch and thighs reddened still by your previous antics. Her cheeks the same, but you're uncertain if it was from the pain or the pleasure. You have no idea what to do know, and neither does she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't hate you.. Trish. I just don't understand why..\", you say, looking up,\"Why didn't you zap me with the black pen when I pushed you away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you, surprised, her eyes widening. Tears fall once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-David.. I.. I don't know, okay?! I don't know!\" she covers her face with her hands, you can barely see through her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you walk up to her and embrace her again, she leans her head against you. You wait until she calms down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish, just take her off. Please..\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't, David! I can't! Isn't it obvious?!\" She cries out, looking up into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not! I already said I wouldn't turn you into a skin.\" You pull some blonde hair from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I take off Jessica, you won't..\", she buries her face in your chest again and speaks, \"You won't love me anymore..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hits you hard, but she's right. You're lying to yourself, if she takes off Jessica's skin, you probably will zap her. There's just no telling how you'll feel once you see her real face, and she knows it. She's incredibly selfish though, scared of the repercussions of her own actions, scared of the fate of being zapped by the pen. The fate of Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ever going to take her off..?\" You whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't reply, and simply slides her arms around your waist, her fingers spread across your back. You frown, waiting for a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish.. when do you plan on taking off Jessica?\" You ask more sternly this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her from your body, you hold her by the arms and look into her eyes. She looks away from your gaze again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't ever plan on taking her off, do you?!\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I figured, that I could be Jessica for you! I want to be with you, David! Please!\" She cries out to you, her voice almost a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, astounded, all yours senses seem to blur as you think about what she just said. She wants to steal Jessica's body, her boyfriend, her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wants to be Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                ******************************************<br>\r\nYou huff and puff, dropping onto the side of Trish's bed as she lay there on the floor, a pile of pale, smooth skin, blonde hair sprawled in a mess across the carpet. Flying into a rage, you'd instantly zapped Jessica and tried everything you could think of to try to get Trish out of Jessica's body, but to your dismay, nothing worked. You'd checked the inside of the suit for anything strange, nothing there, the outside looked just like an ordinary Jessica skin. Ha, that's a bloody oxymoron, there's nothing ordinary about this. <br>\r\nLooking down at the skin, you sigh and get up, laying the skin on the bed, you zip it up. In a few seconds, you see that it starts to slowly fill out with mass again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David..\" You hear from your left, a minute or so later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish?\" You look over to her, \"Are you alright? I-I'm sorry..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David.. No..\" you feel Jessica's hand touch your leg as she finally focuses, her torso lifts up. \"I felt it.. the fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" You raise a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fear you feel when you're zapped by that pen, it's worse than what I feel when I make you angry, it's worse than.. death..\" her cheeks redden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Jessica raises her hands behind her head and peels her face off, revealing Trish's own face behind it. Your jaw simply drops, not in surprised, but at the sincerity of Trish's words. She was just so afraid to take off Jessica, and now she's doing it of her own free will. Jessica's head hangs from Trish's face as she looks at you, her own brown curls flow over her paler shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davi-\" she gasps, her voice comes out as Jessica's. Giggling, she grips the flappy skin around her neck and pulls down. \"David..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it's her voice, and it's that familiar tone of Trish, but it's not happy, it's not excited. It's sad. You've never heard Trish sound this way, she was always happy, especially when you were around. Especially.. god damn it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you'd known all along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish leans forward and starts to cry, this time, her own tears and with her own voice. You're overcome with so much shame that you shift yourself across to her torso and hug her. The crying stops, but you still hear her sniffle. Shutting your eyes, you inhale deeply, before moving your hand around Trish's neck, your arms over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.. David?\" She rubs her eyes with the her palms and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip the pale skin and pull it from Trish's back, peeling downwards, revealing Trish's tanned brown skin. You pull all the way down to just below her ribs, before you push her back onto the bed and kiss her lips. Blood rushes to both of your cheeks, and you hear Trish gasp as you take her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You start to walk towards the source of Jessica's voice, the light follows you, but you can't see more than a few feet ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica?! Jess, where are you?!\" You yell into the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away, I hate you David, I hate you!\" She screams at you, suddenly appearing out of the darkness, you run into her. Doing your best to halt to avoid slamming into her, you stumble forward and she disappears from her spot. You stop yourself from falling to the floor and you turn around, confused. Jessica stands there, halfway into the dark behind her. She's holding something brown in her hands, it looks like skin. She steps into the light again, her pale, naked skin contrasting with the one she holds in her hands. You look down, and see the screaming face of Trish, still alive, the rest of her body turned into a skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                          ***********************************<br>\r\n\"David? What's the matter?\" Trish says, her face an inch away from yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes slowly focus and you look into the large green circles infront. Trish's brow furrows, concerned. You're incredibly confused right now. <br>\r\nWas that a dream? A hallucination? <br>\r\nYou get off of Trish and stand up, folding your arms as you think to yourself, Trish instantly gets up with you, latching onto your right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David..? Talk to me, please.. What's wrong?\" Trish's voice vibrates your skin as she hugs your arm to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at her, the skin of Jessica's upper body dangles from her waist like a hoodie tied around her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God. Take it off, quickly.\" You say to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks once, and then slowly lets you go, unsure of what to say as she peels Jessica's hips down. A few seconds later, Trish throws Jessica's skin on her bed and looks at you, having lost about 2 inches in height, but restored her finely toned ass and legs. You hesitate for a moment as your eyes slowly scan Trish's body. For some reason, she is so much more attractive to you. You've always known she was athletic but, you never really <i>noticed</i> her. As you look up, you see her watching your eyes, and instantly you blush. She smiles, and you stare in wonder. Her smile is one of almost.. pride. She <i>wants</i> you to check her out, to admire her. You're starting to think this is going out of control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish.. why are you smiling at me like that..?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what, David?\" Her smile only grows bigger for a second, before she turns away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you look at Jessica's skin. Picking up the black pen, you lay the skin out flat length ways on the bed and zip it up, waiting for the re-inflation process to happen. You look back at Trish in the meantime, she's sitting in a very posh looking chair at the side of her dressing table, she folds one leg over the other and puts her hands on her thighs. Your eyes unwillingly pull your gaze down her body, and you look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, <i>Davie</i>,\" that's what Jess calls you.. \"I know you like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe speaks in an incredibly suggestive tone, looking back at her with an expression of irritation, you notice the lust in her eyes as she checks you out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have a girlfriend..\" You mutter lamely, looking at Jessica's now fully inflated body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish doesn't say anything, and you walk to Jessica's side. She groans, and you lean forward quickly, gently taking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, are you awake?\" You whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David..\" Her eyes open slightly, and she looks around, \"What..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.. you're back now.\" You hug her back as she embraces you, shutting her eyes in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, David, I had the worst nightmare ever..\" She whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really..?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. <b>It was Trish.</b>\" She says loudly, her voice dripping with malice. You feel her snatch the pen from your grasp and she pushes you away. Stumbling back, you see Trish bolt upright, before instantly halting. Jessica gets up, her arm extended, the black pen pointed right at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking cunt. How could you use me like that Trish?\" Jessica's voice drops, tears start to rise in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, I'm sorry! I don't know why I did it!\" Trish pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well me neither.\" She says, wiping a tear from her cheek with her free hand, a smile creeps across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Trish instantly falls to the floor, reduced to a heap of her own skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess!? What are you doing!?\" You rush forward and slam your weight into Jessica, throwing the pen from her grip. The you fall on top of Jess, the pen hits the wall and bounces away, rolling under the chair Trish was in previously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you breath heavily, and Jessica starts to cry. You're holding her arms under your body as she tries to wiggle them free, tears slowly drip down her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you helping her. David?! She used me somehow, I can feel it!\" Jessica cries out. \"The last thing I remember is that pen and..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, calm down, please. Everything's fine.\" You attempt to console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're helping her, you're in on this David... I can't believe it...\" She says in between sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stare at her as she cries, stumped. In a way, what she's saying is true. You didn't want her to suffer, but Trish forced you. You're so selfish.<br>\r\nJessica stops crying and opens her eyes, looking right at you. Her face is reddened and you frown as she gives you a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me.\" She demands, and you quickly get up. \"Why are all of us naked? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..\" You explain to Jessica what happened, and she simply stares at Trish's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, you.. I can't believe you'd do that to me. She's in love with you and you love her too?!\" Jessica says, tears streaming down her face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if these girls ever stop crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Jessica, it's just.. it's really complicated.\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMPLICATED?! DAVID, SHE FUCKED YOU IN MY BODY!\" She screams at you, turning her back on you as she holds her face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's horrible. But I didn't want to, Jessica, really. You're my girlfriend and I love you.\" You say, trying to remedy the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, fuck you, David. \" The words sting like mad, you're almost tearing up yourself, \"Fuck you, and fuck Trish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over to Trish's skin and grabs it, quickly pulling Trish's face over her own. You witness her face meld and sculpt into Trish's exact form in almost a seconds, she look at you, dangling the rest of Trish's body from her collarbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you love me now, David? Do you?!\" Trish's voice comes from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, stop it.\" You say, walking up to her. You grab her wrist and wrench her hand away, sending your other hand around her neck to pull Trish's skin off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, David stop! You're hurting me..\" You freeze as she cries out, blinking, you notice a smirk on her face. \"You're so predictable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, pain courses through your stomach as she punches you straight in the middle. You double over and she steps to the side, letting you fall. trish's skin sways in the movement and she pulls the rest of the attire over her body, instantly transforming into Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll both pay for this, David. You and Trish.\" Trish mutters to you coldly, she walks over to the chair by the table and reaches under it, brandishing the black pen in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering up, you stretch out your hand to try to block the pen from pointing at you. But suddenly you feel a jolt of power run through your body, and you feel yourself fall into darkness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It takes you a minute to focus, and Trish lets go of you as she sees that you're now awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish..?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish smiles and leans forward, you feel her body's warmth along your own as she lays on top of you. Her chest compressed against yours, she looks up and into your eyes as you strain your neck to look down at her. Then looking around at the room you're in, you recognize this as Jessica's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Trish.. in Jessica's house..? Wait..</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt rushes back to you as you snap out of your stupor, the last thing you remember is being turned into a skin. You push Trish off of you and she smirks, noticing your facial expression. The two of you are naked, it seems, and you're laying on Jessica's bed. You raise yourself up and look around, then you look back at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica..\" You say, \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish smiles widely, before bursting into laughter. You simply stare at her as her laughter fades, her facial expression quickly hardens into one of cold contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David.. I'm going to make you and Trish suffer.\" She says slowly, pouting her lips as she taunts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, what's your problem?\" You shout, \"Yeah, we're sorry, but this is going too far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know what's going too far David?!\" She promptly yells back at you, \"Leading me into a trap! Fucking someone wearing my skin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do it by choice, she forced me! How can you think that I'd willingly do that?\" You feel both ashamed and frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, David, you betrayed me. You and Trish both..\" She mutters. \"But first, I need to get off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and stare at her for a moment, and she smirks, her gaze alluringly wafts up and down your body. She slowly crawls forward, her arms gently push your back onto the bed and she kisses you. You shut your eyes before pushing her away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?! No, stop!\" You yell, feeling confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, I know you want me.. Don't be that way.\" She says, her hands groping her shapely breasts right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, you're sick. I didn't have sex with Trish willingly, she forced herself onto me.\" You say, enraged. \"Stop toying with her body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish stares at you in surprise as your lack of willingness to have some fun, before sighing. She looks down, and promptly starts to giggle.<br>\r\nYou frown, wondering what she's laughing at, watching her as she reaches down your stomach and grips your erect member. You jolt in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend here seems to disagree with you.. I think he says you did want to fuck her..\" Trish says, slowly massaging your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God.. f-fucking hell!\" You cringe as pleasure seethes through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Trish purrs as you see her lean forward, she puts the tip of your dick against her lips. You've had enough of this, raising yourself up, you push her away from you and get off the bed. Trish stares at you, before a look of hunger appears on her face. She grins as she gets off the bed, bouncing onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body wants you so much David, I want you..\" She quickly walks up to you, wrapping her arms around your waist, \"..inside of me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly have deja-vu, remembering a moment where Jessica said the same thing during a very passionate session. Looking down into Trish's eyes, she's looking up at you expectantly, as if awaiting your acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my girlfriend,\" you say firmly, pulling her arms from around you, \"You're twisted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish frowns, folding her arms under her bosom. The two of you stand there for a moment, you look around the room as she simply stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first time you've ever denied sex from me..\" she says, in Jessica's tone this time, before she chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwillingly, you chuckle to yourself, before the situation at hand snaps you back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jessica's not the same, she's dangerous. Don't trust her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of flesh tearing as you look back at Trish, seeing Jessica's head pop out of her neck. Raising your brows, she shakes her hair freely and looks at you. You notice her eyes have changed from Trish's green to her natural blue. Trish's face hanging loosely over her breasts, she steps forward and suddenly kisses you on the lips, you shut your eyes and hold your breath. Feeling her move away soon after, you frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about now..?\" Jessica's voice curls through the air, instantly, you feel yourself aroused by her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica chuckles as she peels Trish's skin from her body, letting it drop to the floor besides her. She's grown about 3 inches in height. Her pale skin glistening in the light from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why.. Jess? Why are you toying with me?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply shakes her head and walks backwards, sitting back on the bed, you watch as she spreads her legs. Sticking two fingers into her mouth, she licks them thoroughly before slowly tracing them down her stomach, then in between her hips as you watch her invite you. You sigh, looking down at your feet for a moment, an insatiable, animalistic lust bursts into flame inside of you, and you instinctively walk towards Jessica. She giggles as you push her back onto the bed, <br>\r\nusing your lips, you kiss her from her neck down to her hips, and then inbetween. As you proceed to eat her, you're blessed with the sounds of her moaning, she raises her legs and uncontrollably flexes them from the pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale deeply, looking at the dressing table opposite Jessica's bed. In the mirror, you see yourself lying against the headboard, pillows propping your back. Jessica's laying against your side, one leg holding fast your left, her arm wrapped around your chest. Wondering how you got from arguing with Trish to making love to your girlfriend, you shut your eyes. These pens are messing your life up, they were fun at first, but this is just.. It's too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica moans as she tightens her hold around your chest, snuggling her face against over your ribs. You hand lays around her shoulders, and you gently caress her cheek. Opening your eyes, you notice the clock above the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6:13</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawns on you in that moment, shouldn't Jessica's family be home right now? You haven't heard any noises since you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing Jessica gently off of you, she struggles to hold you in her gentle sleep, but you lead her limbs onto the bed as you get off. Searching around the room for your clothes, you find them stashed away in her closet, surprisingly, they're washed. You throw them on quickly and open the door, moving out into the upstairs hallway. You're familiar with this house, why wouldn't you be? Walking away from the bedroom as you shut the door quietly, Katie's room is only a few steps in front of you, whilst the hallway leads left into a separate passage, with the staircase leading down to the ground floor. You open Katie's door and peek inside, nobody's there. Shutting it, you walk to Jessica's parents' room. As you open the door, you're horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside across the floor lay the skins of Jessica's entire family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sweet fucking Christ, Jessica..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've found them.\" Jessica says from behind you. You jump and look around to see her leaning against the wall, wearing her panties and bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? What did they do to deserve this?!\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of funny really. I got into a fight with my mother and well.. I just lost it. Zapped her, Katie saw me, so I zapped her too.\" She explains,<br>\r\n\"I just zapped Dad to avoid trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the pile, you sift through until you find Katie's skin, you hold it in the air and look at Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your little sister, your little, fucking, sister, Jess. Do you think this is right?\" You're getting incredibly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica frowns, before grinning at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly David, I don't even care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply stare at her, letting your arm drop, the sound of skin flapping against itself starts the silent period to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this.\" You say, honestly, you're just astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, David.\" Jessica smirks, walking towards you, \"You're a good boy, but.. I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise Katie's skin and open her neck, stuffing your head inside. Jessica stares at you in shock as you don Katie's face. Feeling your flesh morph, your face quickly transforms and you exhale deeply. Jessica is extremely disturbed, she looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me Jessica, fucking look!\" You say, Katie's voice emitted from your throat, \"I'm your fucking sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it off, David..\" Jessica murmurs, you can see the shame across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull Katie's face off and drop her. Looking at Jessica, she's tearing up. You grip her chin and pull her to look at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is a motherfucking game, don't you?\" You say, \"Your own family, reduced to nothing but costumes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bursts into tears and hides her face, looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm.. I'm sorry..\" You hear her mumble in between sobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop deluding yourself, Jessica.\" You say, \"Give me the pen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, leading you into her room. She walks to the bedside table and pulls open a drawer, pulling out the two pens. Taking them from her quickly, you look down and them and feel them in your fingers, a feeling of power washes over you. Looking up at Jessica, her eyes are red, you can see lines glistening down her cheeks. Something tells you to the do it, right this instant. Zap her. But you don't know why.</span></div></div>",

It's as if the pen wants you to zap her, like it wants to control your mind. The temptation is so great to zap Jessica with the pen. She totally deserves it, zapping you, Trish and her family. Why should she be exempted from this torture you all had to endure? But when you look at Jessica, the lines of tears dripping down on the floor, you feel another thing besides the temptation: compassion. Jessica clearly regrets her actions, why should she be another victim in all of this? The circle has to begin somewhere and ends as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the greatest of will you lower the pen. Jessica looks surprised at this reaction. She wants to come closer to you, but you stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come closer Jessica. No, it's not like that.\" You tell her noticing her fearful expression. \"These pens are way to dangerous for anyone to handle. We need to find a way to get rid of them; to make sure nobody messes with these things anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I understand David. Thanks for not zapping me with them.\" Jessica tells you glad you didn't go through with your initial plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where to go with these things?\" You ask as you look at the innocent looking pens. \"Would they be like the one ring?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope not. I'm not sure I know any live volcanoes around here.\" Jessica says trying to cheer things up. \"Perhaps there is something written on them?\" Jessica suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look closely at the pens. Now that Jessica mentions it, there does seem to be something written on them. \"I can see something is written here, but it's way too small to read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you can use a magnifying glass. We have one downstairs.\" Jessica tells you. She comes closer to you, but automatically you take a step backward holding the pens behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax David. I just want to go downstairs to get the magnifying glass.\" Jessica tells you worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Jessica.\" You tell her holding the pens in front of you. \"It's just that these pens have some sort of power over you, like they command you to protect them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Jessica says softly. \"Come with me then.\" She says going down the stairs already. However out in the hallway you look at the door leading to the bedroom of Jessica's parents. Inside are the skins of the people Jessica zapped, except for Trish who is still lying in Jessica's room. Question is, do you restore them now or later?</span></div></div>",

Davie..\" Jessica purrs, and you frown. You can't let this happen, it's not Jessica! <br>\r\nYour hands grope around until you feel something hard against your fingers, it's the pen you discover as you look down at it.<br>\r\nShe must've dropped it when she went down on you, now's your chance! Your fingers curl around the pen and in a snap, you aim it at Jessica.<br>\r\nHer eyes widen as she sees this, and you feel her hands stop moving along your member, you're infuriated at her betrayal of your trust.<br>\r\n\"D-David, wait. Don't do anything stu-\" she crumples into a heap on top of your legs in a flash, her blonde hair spread messily about.<br>\r\nYou fall onto your back and lay still for a moment, huffing with your nerves firing madly. Now all you need to do if figure out how to fix this mess.<br>\r\nNever would've expected this to happen, especially from Trish, she was your best friend for so long.. you guess people change when they receive power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold Jessica's skin in your left hand by the hair, her face and body pulled down by gravity, stretching her features out. The sight is grotesque, yet arousing.<br>\r\nTrish was inside Jessica when you zapped her, how do you get her out? Upon further inspection you're unable to find any clues as to how to solve this without re-inflating the suit. Your hands search the inside of the suit and you feel nothi- Wait.. It feels thicker, you notice suddenly. You stretch Jessica's back open and notice that the material is thicker, like Trish and Jessica's skin fused on the inside when you zapped her. You try to slip a finger between the two skins but it's useless, you can't pry them apart. Looking at the pen, you doubt it would help at all, since this colour can only deflate or re-inflate suits. Sighing, you spread Jessica across Trish's bed, deciding to re-inflate her as you can't get Trish out any other way. You could try to force her out of it, but she'd just laugh at you, you can't hurt Jessica and she knows it. She'll just mock you every time. That's when the plan stirs in your mind, it's diabolical. You'll use Trish's mother to put her in a bad position, you wonder how Mrs. Oneil would react if she found Jessica naked in Trish's bedroom. A grin spread across your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds come from the living room, you hear a key enter a lock, the door opens and shuts. Footsteps, you lay in hiding nearby, waiting for Mrs. Oneil to turn the corner of the hall towards her bedroom. <br>\r\n\"Trish? I brought home dinner!\" she announces, \"Trish?\" <br>\r\nThis is your chance, you hear Mrs. Oneil's heels against the floor as she comes to investigate Trish's whereabouts.<br>\r\nReadying the pen, your thumb gently feels the button, and in a split second Mrs. Oneil round the corner and you zap her, she never even saw a thing.<br>\r\nYou recover Mrs. Oneil and her clothes and make your way to her bedroom, shutting the door behind you and closing the blinds on her windows.<br>\r\nGrinning madly, you have no idea what's come over you but you're excited, you want revenge on Trish for what she did to Jessica and you and this is perfect.<br>\r\nYour fingers unbutton Mrs. Oneil's dark blue coat and you gently pull it from her shriveled arms, doing the same for her blouse, revealing her lacy white bra.<br>\r\nAll the while smirking, you unbutton her skirt and pull it off her legs, slipping your fingers underneath the elastic of her white thong, you pull it from her legs also.<br>\r\nStripping yourself next, you look in the mirror and find that your face is maddened, you look somewhat like Trish did when she put on Jessica..<br>\r\nStanding still for a moment, you think to yourself. This is.. wrong.. No, what's wrong is what Trish did to Jessica. Your expression returns and you quickly grab the skin of Mrs. Oneil from her bed, spinning it around. Your fingers spread the back open as you lower it, sticking your legs in first, you fill the skin's long limbs, morphing quickly into her firm and dashing form. You follow /suit/ with your arms, as you fill her arms the skin's torso spreads over your and binds to you, you feel your spine stretching as you grow 2 inches taller. A warm feeling floods your chest and groin as your chest fills out with flesh, perky nipples with brown areola's top your new breasts, you're atleast C or D cup. You feel space between your legs as you look down, seeing the snug labia of Mrs. Oneil's pussy, you smile grimly.<br>\r\nAdjusting the suit over your back by rotating your shoulders, your slim, dainty fingers pull any slack up your thighs and ribs, you feel a strange sensation, as if the muscle in your legs and waist just tightened even more. You feel the warmth in the space between your back and the skin disappear as it fuses to you, your more masculine form replaced by Mrs. Oneil's as you feel muscle squirm and move about your back, your form elongating to display her poise and graceful stance.<br>\r\nThe only thing remaining is her face, Mrs. Oneil is a beautiful woman, no doubt where Trish got her looks. You grip the gap in her neck and squeeze your head through, your head bulges through the neck, you then pull her face over yours, you feel your neck constrict as if you just swallowed hard, then a release, the same strange feeling occurs in the back of your neck, your muscle lessening but tightening down your shoulders and nape. <br>\r\nYou bring your fingers to your face as you step towards the mirror, leaning forward you can see your skin underneath her eyelids and lips, and you adjust accordingly. Pressing the skin to your face, you massage your face as you push and pull the skin across it, it binds to you appropriately. <br>\r\nYou grip a lock of Mrs. Oneil's long dirty blonde hair, your other hand grips some slack in her cheek and you pull, you feel her skin better adjust on your face, and you feel an odd sensation as you fill out her shapely cheekbone and shin, your cheeks slightly puffing out where her dimples would form. Your forehead is tight and your eyes feel young, as you look in the mirror to inspect them, you notice that they are now a gentle blue, as opposed to your normal green.<br>\r\n\"Hello Mrs. Oneil..\" your attitude contorts her voice, making you sound very seductive. Her locks fall over her naked shoulders and into place perfectly.<br>\r\nLike you said, she's very beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over Jessica's skin, you flick the pen between your fingers in your right hand and smirk, you flip a lock of blonde hair behind your shoulder.<br>\r\nAiming the pen at Jessica, you press the button and <i>ZAP</i>, she begins to re-inflates. Her head fills out and her nose forms, the \"filling\" continues down her body, her neck gaining shape followed by her shoulders, running down her torso her breasts appear, as if filled by air, her waist formed and as if in a wave, the bulge of her mass flows down her hips and through her legs, down to her toes. You frown at this sight, re-inflation is very weird you discover.<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Jessica groans and you see her eyes flicker open. Time to play.<br>\r\nYou rush to Jessica's side, kneeling, you put your hand around her head and neck and pull her faze to face you.<br>\r\n\"Jessica?! Jessica, can you hear me?!\" you say frantically in Mrs. Oneil's voice.<br>\r\n\"M-Mom..? Wha..\" Jessica mumbles, disoriented.<br>\r\n\"Mom? I'm not your mother sweetie. This is terrible..\" you say, behind your facade you're giggling in excitement.<br>\r\n\"Ugh.. AGH! NO!\" Jessica bolts upright, her breasts jiggling with the sudden movement. She looks around madly, her head scanning the floor. <br>\r\nYou grin to yourself, she's looking for the pen. <br>\r\n\"Where is it?! Where is it..!?\" she gets up off the bed and starts to throw things aside, unable to find it. Meanwhile, you've tucked the pen away in your pocket.<br>\r\n\"Jessica, calm down!\" You rush to her, putting your hands on her shoulders to stop her erratic movement. Her arms fall limp as you hold her.<br>\r\nShe lowers her head as she turns around to you, tears run down her red cheeks. She sobs loudly and suddenly buries her face in your chest.<br>\r\nYou wrap your arms around her naked back and lower your head slightly, whispering words of comfort.<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Jessica, it's gonna' be alright..\"<br>\r\nJessica looks up at your face and shakes her head. \"I'm not Jessica mom, it's me, Trish..\" she mutters inbetween sobs.<br>\r\n\"What.. honey, what are you talking about? How can you be Trish?\" You raise one eyebrow.<br>\r\nJessica steps away from you and put hers hands behind her head, you grin to yourself, your hand moves to your pocket.<br>\r\nYou see Jessica's fair skin peels from Trish's back, as Jessica's face is ripped off you fake a surprised and horrified look. <br>\r\nTrish's darker tanned skin constrasting with Jessica's fair skin is arousing, and Trish quickly strips the rest of the skin off, her own tears dripping from her chin.<br>\r\nStepping out of Jessica's skin, she throws it on her bed away from her and hugs herself with her arms around her bust.<br>\r\n\"Trish, what the hell was that?! You were wearing Jessica?\" you act astounded.<br>\r\nTrish simply whimpers and looks at you, then look back at the ground. You're finished now.<br>\r\nYou cast aside the act and grin madly at Trish, she sees your expression and frowns, you quickly reach to your neck and peel her mother's face off.<br>\r\n\"N-No.. DAVID!\" She's furiously, and as she rushes towards you with her athletic body, you flip out the pen and jam it inbetween her ribs.<br>\r\nBracing your bodies together, you hold her with your other arm, her mother's body still in effect from the neck down.<br>\r\nYou still talk in Mrs. Oneil's voice and the sight is disturbing with your face emitting a womanly voice..<br>\r\n\"This is what happens when you fuck with me and my friends, Trish..\" you whisper in her ear, Trish trembles in your arms.<br>\r\nPressing the button, her skin falls dangling over the arm you used to grip her waist. You grin evilly.</span></div></div>",

It almost makes you sick, but then you shouldn't have done it to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Trish, please,\" you plead with Jessica's voice perfectly as she does when she doesn't want to do something. Hearing it yourself almost freaks you out. \"There has to be something else, I mean, ... I, ah, ... I-I'm sorry. Can't we ...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, dear Jessica. Of course, there is. I can use David's skin on you. That might,\" she starts smirking, \"Get a little kinky and rough, and you'd think it was David, not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that.\" You're definitely trapped, so you sigh, \"OK. Let me see. first I looked in the mirror.\" You walk in front of it just as before staring at the reflection up close. This time you see Jessica's sexy body. Her blond hair framing her pretty face. You naturally put Jessica's hands to her face and explain, \"Then I put my, er Trish's hands through her hair and ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to narrate,\" Trish whispers from the dark corner. \"Just act it out and voice what comes from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop talking and think back to being in Trish's skin and about what you were thinking. It was so amazing to actually look like her and to feel your hands - her hands touch her face and run them through her hair just as you're doing now. You then move back to see Jessica's whole body, her pretty face and those sparkling brown eyes. You really love her eyes so full of life. It makes you smile and those eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's her breasts that pull your attention. They're so perfectly round with her nipples pointing out staring at you. You cup them gently hefting them so slightly up and down before sliding your hands across Jessica's taut belly and onto her hips. You pose in different ways and make faces like Jessica when she pouts or is sad or upset or excited. You wave, then you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my voice. This is so cool,\" you giggle so naturally just like Jessica. In fact you are so enthralled that you have forgotten Trish is still there. Your expression turns curious as your hand traces Jessica's belly button before gliding down through her pubic hair to the lips they hide. Your body tingles with suspense and excitement. One finger pushes against them and you gasp, \"Nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Trish's bed, you lie down and start fondling yourself. It feels so good even better than before. It drives you on becoming increasing aroused as finding just the right spot to make you shiver with pleasure. A moan escapes as your ministrations quicken. Caught in the moment, you forget that you're doing this to your girlfriend. The sensations soon push Jessica's body to tense and breathing to be short. There's an immense wave like electricity pulse through you, and your whole body shutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh oh, oh, Yes,\" you shout, arching your back and trying to hold on to the feeling for as long as possible. Finally, you relax and breath, \"That was even better than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you several minutes to come down from the high and a giggle comes out before you realize what you had just done. You masturbated in your girlfriends body ... and enjoyed it, very much. You're almost sick with guilt. That's when you remember Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over in the corner to see ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although a pleasurable memory, you know you better not let this get out-of-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. You want to find out don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes the pen at you. Your Jessica hand slowly reaches out and takes it as you toss Jessica's undies onto the bed. Trish backs up and poses like you're taking her picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do. There's a flash of pale blue light, but nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem to work,\" you tell Trish in Jessica's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Trish looks a little funny, like she's in shock or something. Her face and skin have an odd sheen. She leans her head right, then left, before reaching to the back of her neck. Suddenly her face goes lifeless and falls away as she pulls her hair over her head. You jump back and almost scream seeing her skin herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Trish exclaims as she removes the rest of the skin from her body. \"It made a duplicate skin of me.\" With a smirk then a coy voice she adds, \"Now you can wear my body the way you like, without it being the real me, and I can watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Tha-that's OK, Trish. I don't, don't need to ...\" you sputter making her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Jess.

Again a pale blue light flashes, this time on you. A throbbing ache rapidly grows in your head until it's almost unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ow,\" you groan grabbing your head and squeezing your eyes shut. Thoughts and ideas and memories begin racing through your conscious for a couple seconds before the pain subsides. When you open your eyes, you see Trish in a whole different perspective. She's a friend still, but she's the best friend of your boyfriend, David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa. This is something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, are you OK?\" Trish asks so concerned that she uses your real name for the first time since you put on Jessica's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?\" you giggle then excitedly ramble on like Jessica does when she's thrilled about something. \"I'm Jessica. I've got all her memories and stuff like being David's girlfriend, and growing up with my sister, Katie, and family, and all my - Jessica's - relatives, and school activities, and friends like you, and ...\" You stop for a few moments and then smirk at Trish. \"And that sleepover a couple years ago when we ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica!\" Trish screeches in a panic. \"We promised we'd never tell. When did you tell David? I mean when did Jessica tell you, David, about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's laugh flows so easily now, and it's perfect her. You feel her personality in control as you reply. \"I've never told anyone, Trish. But you just gave David all my memories, so you're the one that blew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish looks worried for a few moments before shrugging it off. \"No problem. He's not about to tell and let <i>his</i> secret out.\" She contemplates the pens then ponders, \"I wonder if we should put that to a real test or make some more skins?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This would be better than the pictures to actually show her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an offer to not show Jessica any picture of you in her skin, you agree. Trish hands you her duplicate skin, and you put her on. Slide in the left foot and leg- stretch and pull up. Right leg - the same. Tuck in your bat and bag then push your left arm in, then right letting the waist and torso wrap around so you have a twin set of Trish's ass and boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we inflate her?\" Trish asks. She is laying Jessica's clothes beside her skin on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just zip her up. There's a little nob above her bum. Slide it up,\" you explain as you stretch the side of the head and put yours inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's shorts and a \"T\" on the chair you can wear. You can skip the undies unless you really want the full effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adjust the face a bit then answer, \"That's fine.\" The T goes on quickly, but the shorts are rather tight, and you struggle a bit to get them up and buttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long 'til she wakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning round, Jessica's body is quickly inflating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too long,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.

You don't argue since it feels right to get dressed as Jessica and go to your - her house. The David in you only makes a hint he would rather take off Jessica and restore her. He also thinks he'd like to know how good these pens are by impersonating Jessica. That just seems so strange because you just feel and think that you <i>are </i>Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom.

What do you expect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe discretely elbows you causing the Jessica in you to blurt with a smile, \"Crazy but cute,\" and shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you both leave in your - Jessica's - car. In a few minutes, you arrive to find no one home, so you just go up to your, Jessica's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is a bust. Might as well take her off now, <i>crazy-but-cute</i>\" Trish giggles and flops on Jessica's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer you're in the skin with these memories, the more you really feel that you are Jessica. Everything in this room seems  perfectly normal. You know where everything is, all of Jessica's clothes and even each of her special stuffed animals. It takes a moment to understand what Trish means by \"take her off\" and a few more to let the David that you really are get to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Then we'll get her back to normal. How we gonna explain all this to her?\" you ask while folding Jessica's clothes neatly on her dresser as her mind has you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Don't worry. Leave that to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the, ah, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, David. I'll cover for you. That was just between us. I'll only use it to blackmail you when I need to,\" she teases with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you pull Jessica's head-mask off, you turn to Trish to remind her of something that you got with Jessica's memories so you can tease her back, but you can't remember what it was. In fact, you realize that all Jessica's thoughts are now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's another mystery about the pens solved. I no longer have any of Jessica's memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish jerks up in surprise and asks, \"None?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only those when I was being her. Not anything that she's experienced as herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds very odd the way you're talking about her, and you still feel guilty about wearing her and doing what you did to make you feel so good. Having those memories was like gaining some insight into your girlfriend, so you hope whatever it was is still in your subconscious so you can be a better boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull off the rest of Jessica's skin, you turn away in modesty so as not to show your privates to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know,\" she says.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That helps calm you except for the arousal that has readied your rocket for launch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, David, and let me give you the real Trish experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do relax guessing that Jessica just wants to have some fun pretending to be your friend. She wiggles and jiggles over to the end of the bed and then begins to crawl slowly up over your feet and legs licking them and dragging her breasts against them. You can feel the hardness of her nipples, and it all makes you immediately spring up hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, Trish ...\" you gasp in mock surprise but don't try to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Big Boy. Just let Trish make everything right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes hold yours as you watch her head get closer and closer to the pillar between you. She stops and licks her lips never breaking eye contact. For several seconds there's no movement and the anticipation starts a throbbing of your cock like a metronome. Her mouth opens, and she waits while the pendulum swings about. When you cannot bear it any more, she grabs your head with her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gawd,\" you moan and fall back on the pillow to stare at the ceiling and let your mind focus solely on the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to work your prick tantalizing you into submission. When it seems to get too close, she backs off and pinches a spot that relaxes the involuntary instinct then goes at it again. She's never done this before, but you just relish in what she's doing without question. After several of these, she holds tight and moves up to straddle you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair and face above you pull your eyes from the ceiling to them. Her lips part just slightly as she positions you at the gateway. You try to raise your hips to enter her, but she rises staying just out of reach. Taking your wrists, she puts your palms to her breasts. This distracts you to lie still as your fingers start a gentle massage and her hard nipples push against your palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even know when it happens, but eventually you realize she has slid down on you and is gradually stroking your manhood inside her. Her rhythmic grind feels like heaven as the moist warmth engulfs you again and again. Her soft moans are erotic music that pulls a duet from you that you never knew you could. Shortly her opening begins to squeeze you, and you feel a tightening in your own groin as it prepares to climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her speed increases, each push becoming harder with forcing you deeper. Your hips get in sync, and the music gets louder. Your penis seems to be on fire with your groin swelling at its base. The heaving and crunching accelerates until you have no control. Screams fill your ears as you explode with grunts while your climaxes coincide. You push out everything you've got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicker than you want, the sensations fade away. The pulsing together slows then stops as she collapses on top of you, her nipples still hard against your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted you rest for several minutes and almost fall asleep, except she lifts her head and smirks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, was I as good as your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. That was definitely something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a yes or a no?\" Trish's voice asks more forcibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into her eyes - Trish's eyes. It's Trish's face and hair. Trish's body is resting on you. You're still slightly within her. You've always had a bit of a crush on Trish, but you were too good as friends to pursue it. Now you have to remind yourself that this is really Jessica in a Trish skin and try to figure out the best response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, David. There's no wrong answer. I promise,\" she purrs before giving you a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally break, you feel your member rising again. You don't know if it's because of Trish's body or the excitement of thinking Jessica is inside, but this has definitely been the best sex you've ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Jessica would say about us, or would she even stick with you after you cheated with me?\" she inquires slyly. \"Or do you care now that you've had the Trish experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't speak for her, David. But we can zip her up and ask her if you're willing to tell her to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart almost stops as you realize the possibility. This can't be Trish. She left an hour ago. This is her duplicate skin that Trish left here, right? Unless, ... Unless it was her duplicate that left and Trish was wearing Jessica then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic starts to flow through you. You would never cheat on Jessica. You love her. You thought this was her wearing the Trish duplicate skin. Of course, that is still sort of cheating on her, but she came at you and you didn't know and ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, Trish. Is that really you. Did you trick me? If I had known ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just raises up still straddling you and laughs. \"David, Davie, David. You want to have both of us, don't you?\" Then she leans down over you, her breasts swinging forward begging to be fondled, and whispers, \"And you can, anytime you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still hasn't confirmed who she really is. Maybe she isn't either. No, that's ridiculous. It's just Trish and Jessica playing games with you, right? Or, perhaps, it's a test. She said there was no wrong answer. With the pens, you can have or be anyone. She could really be anyone. You're too paralyzed with her still on top and grinding on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she purrs running her fingernail down your chest. \"Tell me who you prefer or if you want us both.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No matter what, you know that Jessica is the only girl you want. You pull all your strength, closing your eyes to concentrate, and try to squirm away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. Love. Jessica. \u00a0I love Jessica. I love Jessica.IloveJessica.IloveJes . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davie. Davie! Wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's voice calls, and your body seems to be floating away before you feel your shoulders being shaken by someone. Your eyelids are so heavy you can barely push them part way open. \"Hum a wha,\" is all you can softly mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Davie. That must have been some dream the way you were flailing and screaming,\" Jessica tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, oh, no. More like a nightmare,\" you offer as your eyes bring into focus Jessica. Her body, not Trish, is beside you on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a nightmare to call out in your sleep that you love me?\" she snaps and pushes herself away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. It was what saved me,\" you quickly explain, and her expression softens. \"It was ... It was ... Oh, gawd. It was Trish or you in her skin or ... Thank goodness it was just a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you have the hots for Trish, huh? Or was it so you could <i>wear</i> Trish?\" she teases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Jessica. I thought you were wearing her skin, the duplicate of her that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you a couple things about that that Trish and I discovered while you were being ... um, not conscious,\" she blushes and trails off at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O. K. \u00a0And what does that mean?\" you counter with your own teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just that if you zip up a duplicate skin that you get a clone. A living, breathing clone. And it will obey, well mostly,\" she interjects with a pause. \"Obey the original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how many Trishes and Jessicas did you two make and have wandering around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly,\" she says rolling her eyes. After a thought she adds, \"Although .... No. Anyway it doesn't exist any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You killed it?\" you gasp in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davie, no wonder your dreams are so weird. Your awake thoughts are perverted that we'd do something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, Trish wondered what would happen if you used the black pen while wearing a skin. Well I wouldn't let her try it wearing you, so ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two were testing me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. It was only fair after you wearing us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I can explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need. When Trish used the brown pen on me while I was wearing you, I got to see everything from your memory's side. Not that I'm happy about it, but I understand. I just wish you would have asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Trish. I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know remember. That girl's almost as crazy as Jimmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet he could ..., no <i>would</i> do some really wild things with these especially if he could get that duplicate of Trish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he won't and he can't.\" Jessica then explained, \"So Trish put on her duplicate, and I zapped her with the black pen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops, and you wait expectantly, but you have to ask for her to continue. \"So what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The skin merged back into her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good that she was wearing her own skin or she could have merged with you or me. Heavens know if you could get us back if that happened. You'd just have to be them. Can you imagine if I had been wearing Trish's duplicate when we tested that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole dream suddenly flashed back in your mind. Having Jessica with Trish's body and skills warmed your groin, and you have to force yourself to shake that off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah. Two Trishes would be terrifi-a-terrible,\" you correct yourself in time then try to cover it. \"Although you know I love you no matter what skin you might have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes Jessica smile. \"You're so sweet.\" She cuddles back, joining you in a passionate kiss before asking, \"So, Davie, what are we going to do with these pens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a good question. You have two pens with amazing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">The black pen turns a person into a skin suit, unless they are wearing a skin suit, then it makes that skin their permanent skin. </div><br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">The brown pen gives a person the memories in a skin suit that they are wearing, unless they aren't wearing a suit, then it creates a duplicate skin suit of them.</div><br>\r\n\"So Jess, do you think we should involve Jimmy, or what would you like to do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica grins at you and says, \"Trish left us with these nifty little pens and you are finally you again. We really should go out and have some fun with them. Let's just zip up some clones and go our merry way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected something like this out of Trish's devious mouth, but you can't deny that you, too, would like to see where your feet take you. There is one question remaining, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should I call Jimmy?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best not. You know what they say: Two is company, three is a crowd. He gets into enough trouble without us handing him a magical pen,\" Jessica explains. Her beautiful face turns into a frown. \"Besides, I don't trust him. Going on a party and having him embarrass us in front of everyone? Fine, I can take that. That's who Jimmy is, I get it. But do you really want to give him something like the pens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're worried he'll do something wrong? Like, I dunno, stealing other people's lives? Gee, that would be awful. Who would do something like this?\" You answer, quite put out that Jess is so against Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess shoots you a glare, but it quickly softens: \"I don't want to wake up in a week and hear that Jimmy has ruined our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you want to protest, you know that that's what separates Trish and Jimmy. Trish would make her jokes usually well out of sight of others, keeping most teasing and pranking securely between her friends. Hell, you have barely any embarrassing stories about Trish's other friends and you are fairly certain that they know not more about you. Jimmy, however, believes that without an audience there is no point in embarrassing others or at least he acts like that. Not to mention that his 'jokes' have a habit of taking on a life of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see where you are coming from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then let's get on our way!\" Jessica beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she grabs a pen and shoots at you. For an instant you expect the blackness again. Instead your skin starts to itch a bit and you realize that you've been hit with the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what are you waiting for? Get out of it!\" says Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her eager help you get out of your copy skin, interrupted only by a bit of kissing and groping. It seems that these pens have made you even more horn than your average teen already is, if your shared inability to keep your hands to you, is any indication. Only the fact that she wears actual clothing reminds you to focus on getting out of the skinsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you are done, you turn to Jess expectantly, only to be hit by another ray from the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why did you hit me twice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skips over to you, puts her index finger under your chin and says: \"Because I like it when more of you are around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are speechless for a moment, before she starts laughing and falls on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, of course I'll get all weird when you do something like that,\" you grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calms herself.\"Sorry, sweetie, I always wanted to try that one. Especially when it's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess gets back up again and pulls the second skinsuit's mask of your face, before she plants a long, deep kiss on your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the booboo gone now?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm all better.\" And you continue to get out of your next skinsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Jessica isn't helping you. Instead, she gets out of her clothes, what few she has on. Once done she hits herself with the brown pen and starts to get out of that one, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done here,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, zip both of them up, one can put on my other skin and we can get some clothes on. You got any idea who we could turn into?\" Jess wants to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the first one shut and answer: \"Dunno. How about Ms. Martinez? She's always got an open-door policy for students, is hot and has a date today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica seems to mull it over, while copy David inflates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I wonder. If we take over someones life for some time, wouldn't that be kind of noticeable.\" Jess finally asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well I know I've been zapped, but I at least don't really want to know what happened. Maybe there is some form of compulsion on it to make victims 'go-with-the-flow' or something?\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I wouldn't have asked Trish what I did at her place, if she hadn't explained by herself. Oh well, we can always try. Also, thanks to our clones we should have perfect alibis anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clone gets up looks around and shrugs, while you zip the other one shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ms. Martinez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, but I've heard that there is a party at Christina Ackerley's mansion,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, the cheerleaders have something to celebrate. They didn't invite because I brought Jimmy along last time. He really screwed up when he ruined the grandfather clock. Christi made it clear that her parents nearly didn't agree because of that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy didn't do it on purpose, nor was he some sort of angry drunk, but he ran straight into it after playing a prank on Christi's boyfriend Steven Gottwin. It fell over and down some stairs. Christi was devastated and that was the end of the party. You still have no idea how he got out of paying for that one, but Jimmy has always been good in not suffering the consequences of his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, they told me and Trish, too, except for the Jimmy part. Can't blame the poor girl. But now we can go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to add something, when you realize that the clone didn't speak. You turned to him, only to see a pile of his skin, while the other clone gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I know I zipped him shut!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gets completely out of her skinsuit and looks over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do and keep an eye on the other one. Just as the first one inflates again, the second one returns to being empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe only one clone can exist at the same time?\" You reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to find out,\" you hear Jessica say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turn to her, you see that she has her skinsuit zipped up already and it inflates. A quick glance to your clone confirms that it is still filled and starts to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems to that you can only make one clone per person.\" Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, seems like it. That makes me wonder what would happen if I use a skin of you and turn it into my real skin. Could we duplicate my old clone again? Could we then make more Jessica-clones? That's really strange.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can get us a guinea pig *cough* Trish *cough* and try that sometime else. You know she'd enjoy it, as long as we make sure that she can turn back into herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the clones are now up and about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now there is two of each of us. Did one of you have some pervy dreams or something?\" asks the Jessica clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, you two are going to fill in for us, until we say otherwise. Just behave like we would. Is that clear?\" You tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" your clone says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, as long as I'm not alone.\" the Jessica clone adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonono, you will pretend to be me, for as long as I'm gone. I know that you don't have to listen to David, but you have to listen to me.\" your girlfriend explains to her clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that I wouldn't have done something stupid!\" C-Jess complains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you just let a clone do what she wants?\" Jess asks and the look on her clone makes the answer clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so now that we can get a move on, where to, Jess? Christi's party or Ms. Martinez date?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A smile slowly spreads across your girlfriend's face. \"Hijacking Ms Martinez and her date means we can enjoy a <i>real</i> night in the town this Friday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no guilt at all for stealing the body and life of your favorite teacher?\" you tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, compared to stealing the body and life of an actual friend? No contest,\" Jess answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's decided then,\" you say and start dressing yourself. Luckily your girlfriend has a few of your clothes at hand, otherwise you or your clone would have to get creative with clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make sure that your clones have their orders straight. You don't want them to bore themselves - that might cause em to hate you - but you also can't have them blow your cover. Jessica thinks it's safe for them to tell Trish that you'll be borrow her 'favorite pens' for a bit, but not much more. Your clones practically guarantee that they will behave as long as they can keep dating, meet other people and spend your money. That's fine by you, though you think about adding a hint for Jimmy. Ultimately you decide against it, because Jessica doesn't seem frilled at all by the idea. She doesn't say much about it. Maybe something for later? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way you sneak out of Jessica's house and leave your real lives to your clones for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the bus to the home of your history teacher. Ms Martinez was well liked. She is smart, polite, witty and gorgeous. She always makes time for her students questions - which is how Jessica knows that their teacher was having a date this evening. One of your classmates was present during a phone-call and the school's rumour mill did the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, now already late afternoon, the two of you arrive. Jessica rings the bell and your teacher opens the door almost instantly. She isn't wearing anything special, sweatpants, a lose fitting shirt and the necklace she is never seen without. Still, you need to blink once she smiles that perfect smile of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God, she is so gorgeous she could be a movie star!' is the only thought crossing your mind. But she isn't waiting for your brain to restart itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jessica, David! Is this about the test last week? I hope you don't have too many questions, because I kinda need to get ready...\" she greets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't take up much of your time. We know that you got a daaate today,\" Jessica singsongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows that...\" you flatly add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Martinez rolls her eyes, \"I swear, your friend James is a worse gossip than any girl I ever met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, <i>Jimmy</i> is the one who overheard your conversation?\" you ask exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend elbows you playfully, \"This surprises you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in you two,\" your teacher says and winks you through. She closes the door behind you and walks you to the kitchen. \"So, what can I help you with? And do you want something to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she turns around and immediately Jessica has the pen out and zaps her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was easier than I thought,\" Jessica says, but you can see that she isn't too happy with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her and she just nods while starring at the pile of clothes and skin that was once your history teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better make this count,\" your girlfriend all but whispers and picks up the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of your eyes, she starts to undress and despite the somewhat tense atmosphere you really enjoy seeing Jessica naked. You separate the skin from the clothes and hand it to Jessica. She quickly spreads it and with a visible gulp lifts her left leg into the opening until her toes slip inside the. You help her inside and between the two of you, she is soon up to her neck covered by a tan body not her own. Ms Martinez has struck you as 'hot' but this is something else. Manicured fingers and toes, toned body, arms and belly and beautifully perky breasts, this woman has it all. And now it's adorning your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, David,\" she chirps, slowly getting over stealing your teacher's date, body and life. She grips the face hanging between her breasts and pulls the edge apart and over her own head. Almost magically her hair slithers inside the gap and it seals itself. There is no hint of Jessica left, only a naked Julia Martinez is in the room with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and says with a confident smirk, \"How do I look? You already hot for teacher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and try to match her confidence, only for the woman in front of you to step closer and gently stroke your cheek. Now it's your turn to audibly gulp causing your girlfriend's stolen face to light up even more. Ms Martinez had the face of an actress with her high cheekbones and perfect nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the reaction I've been looking for.\" Yes, it was definitely still Jessica in there. \"And I knew that she - well I now - was hot, but this is incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No argument from me. I think she is the most beautiful person I've ever seen. No offense to you, babe,\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken, especially since this is me for now. But let's stick to the plan. We wanted to hijack her date, so I need her mind, too,\" Jess points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second pen is in your pocket. You fish it out and zap the woman in front of you with it. While she struggles for a moment with the memories, you pocket both pens. Best not let these things lie around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a trip,\" your girlfriend says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Jess?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, everything worked fine, though right now I'm really more of a Julia or Juli to you,\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who is the lucky guy?\" you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Martinez - or rather Juli for now, picks up her clothes from the floor before she answers, slowly abandoning Jessica's mannerism,\"As far as I know nobody special. She doesn't much care for him. He is fit and handsome, but also bland. From my new memories this all about hurting Julia's ex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a bit superficial, to be honest,\" you sort of expected something a bit more romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get no argument from me. Frankly, I'm a bit boring. I'm hot and smart and everyone loves me, but I just want to teach kids and be a good role model,\" Jessica as Juli rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, however, sounds really admirable,\" you point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I wanted to find some dark secret or something. I guess Julia Martinez is as nice as she behaves. Oh well, I better get ready, my date and your body will arrive in just about an hour. Not a lot of time that,\" Juli says and disappears into the bathroom. As soon as the door to it closes it opens back up and you can nearly hear Jessica through the next few words. \"The other toilet is down the hall and to the right. And help yourself to the kitchen sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you are alone. You check out her home. It's a nice house, though not as big as yours, and you like the understated decorations. You fix yourself a sandwich and get yourself a coke from the fridge. The wait is a bit tedious, but there is nothing to be done about it. Your clone has your phone, for obvious reasons, so you can't distract yourself that way either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the time did pass and finally the door bell rings. Julia left the bathroom some fifteen minutes ago and is now searching for the perfect outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, would you please open the door?\" she shouts from her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you will. You've got the pens after all and still need to change into your 'outfit'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door, greet the guy there and let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, my name is Tony. I'm here for Julia,\" he says while walking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe description that Jessica-in-Julia gave you was apt. He is in good shape and showing it, with broad chest and toned abs, which shows slightly through his shirt. His face can also safely be called handsome. Strong Jaw, nice cheekbones, straight nose, piercing eyes, light stubble (that's clearly trimmed to make it more even), and an easy smile with perfect teeth. He might not be quite as hot as your teacher/girlfriend, but he is plenty good-looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye, I know,\" you answer lazily, not really wanting to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you some sort of flatmate or relative or something like that?\" he asks, still chipper, despite your apparent disinterest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" you say while you finally manage to close the door. You turn around and zip him before he can continue this one sided conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe collapses into a pile like any other person before him and you don't waste any time in separating the skin from his clothes. With a bit of effort you slip inside it and seal it shut. Once the change is done, you realize that he wasn't in 'good' shape. You feel really energized. Without thinking about it you smile and from the corner of your eye you see a reflection in a mirror. That was the face and body of a guy who had all the girls in High School and college. His clothes, shirt aside, are just loose enough to obscure that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately start to get dressed again. His boxer don't leave much to the imagination, but are very comfortable. Socks are standard, but the dress shoes are really nice and must be expensive. Same goes for the slacks and his jacket. It doesn't take long to get dressed and once done you aim the second pen at your new face and press the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new memories reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your eyes stray behind the food to the melons barely inside the loosely buttoned light-green print blouse. Jessica is right. She is an MILF - shoulder-length blond hair surrounding a pretty face almost identical to Jessica seeming to be just a shade older. She keeps in shape working out and could easily be seen as Jessica's older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Hunt,\" you politely say while forcing your eyes up to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brown eyes sparkle as you take the pie. \"Anything for you, David,\" her voice sings in that rich alto that seems so sexy with the simplest words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turns, you watch her rump sway with each step. It's just the right size, not those balloon butts that so many older women have. She's wearing shorts showing her toned legs from all that jogging. You lick your lips as she bends to put a bowl into a low cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is it David?\" she asks as she raises up and turns. \"Is something wrong? You haven't even cut into it yet. You're not too full from dinner to enjoy my juicy pie, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But you are</i>, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovering quickly, you tell her, \"I was just enjoying the, um ah, aroma.

You suck on a big piece of apple as you watch the entertainment. Her movements are graceful and seem to accentuate her assets.

Quickly she presses it into David's hands.  \"Here.  You wanted to spend some more time with her.  Now you can spend some time <b><i>as</i></b> her.  Go.  You know where her bedroom is.  I can't wait to see you as her.\" Jessica tells him.  \"Oh wait.  Here.\" she says as she picks up Michelle's shoes and places them on top of the skin suit piled in your arms.  \"The next time I see you, I want you to be dressed in the same outfit even.\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid for his part, just looked at Jess for a moment before dazedly walking up to the master bedroom.  Despite having worn both Trish and Jess, David was a little apprehensive about donning Mrs. Michelle Hunt.  This was his girlfriend's mother, and she was extremely hot.  David found himself in Michelle's bedroom starring into the mirror.  In a few short minutes, Michelle Hunt would be looking back at him instead of his own eighteen year old face.  Setting Michelle's skin suit and clothes on the bed, David quickly stripped his own clothes off.  He folded them neatly, looking for someplace out of the way to stash them.  He certainly wouldn't need them while he was wearing his own girlfriend's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking his clothes under the bed, David sat down on the end and began to dress.  Pulling the Michelle suit up his muscular legs was a trip.  Looking down he watched as they took on their new feminine shape.  He ran a hand over them loving how smooth his skin was now, Michelle must have shaved recently.  David them stands up, pulling Michelle's hips, ass, and groin up over his own.  The raging hard on he's had ever since the kitchen suddenly vanishes, only to be replaced by a warm wet slit.  Either Michelle had been a bit aroused already, or David's arousal transferred that quickly.  Either way, David could already feel the yearning between his nether lips.  After a quick slap of his gorgeous, round ass, he decided he needed to speed this up.  This soft flesh would feel even better to touch with soft feminine hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slid his arms in, admiring the fresh manicure, before slipping both shoulders up.  This caused the back of the suit to seal itself up, giving him Michelle's body from the neck down.  The melons he had been admiring downstairs now rested upon his own chest.  The new weight was a bit off putting to his male mind, the the soft firmness felt oh so right in his now female hands.  The only problem was Michelle's head hanging down over them.  It was time to remedy that.  David once again walked over to Michelle's vanity mirror.  \"Just a few more seconds now.\" he thought to himself.  He them pulled open the mask like head and slid his own inside.  A few seconds of adjustment and Michelle Hunt was looking at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current Michelle grinned.  Her shoulder length blonde hair perfectly framed her still young features.  Her toned body felt so tight in all the right places, and jiggly in the right places as well.  She started  running her hands all across her body when a noise broke her revere.  A car door slamming outside brought David back to reality.  He needed to get his new body dressed before Jessica came looking for him.  She'd said she wanted him to be dressed just like her mom had been before she got zapped.  David walked over to the pile of clothes on the bed and started searching through them.  First Michelle's panties, which felt good sliding up his smooth legs before settling against his flat crotch.  Next the bra.  Even though David had already worn both Trish and Jessica, he'd only gotten dressed as Jessica when he had her memories to guide him.  It was totally different trying to figure out Michelle's bra with out any female memories. After struggling for a few minutes he finally got it on and got his breasts resting comfortably in the cups.  David quickly slid Michelle's shorts up and over his motherly hips,  his firm thighs showing nicely.  After buttoning up Michelle's green floral print blouse, making sure to leave just enough cleavage showing, David was nearly finished.  He was just about to step into Michelle's flats when he noticed her wedding rings lying on the floor.  Picking them up, he slid them on his left ring finger.  \"Can't really be Michelle Hunt without these now can I?\" he thought to himself grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid slid Michelle's shoes onto her dainty feet  before walking back to the mirror for the third time.  This time the image that greeted him was perfect.  Michelle Hunt stood there just as she had the last time David had seen her down in the kitchen,  Her hair and make-up were still perfect, and her outfit screamed casual yet sexy.  He was about to feel up his breasts one more time when he heard the door open behind him.  Turing around David saw . . . . </span></div></div>",

Of course, that also means not letting your sister influence her too much with all your faults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her in, you walk across the room while she stops and closes her door. You look around and try to figure out what task she needs help with. Maybe moving the furniture or something in the top of her closet where she can't reach from her five foot four height.

That's not showing much passion and foreplay if you want to eventually go all the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie,\" you start to shout then pull back to a whisper since Jessica's room is right next door. \"Why are you acting like this? I should just toss you aside and . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And explain to everyone how you tried to rape me?\" She pauses as it sinks in that no one would believe that she attacked you. \"Go along and kiss me unless you want to never see Jessica again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, I can't just . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time her mouth comes down much slower giving you ample time to turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davie, I know you think I have a hot bod.

That hot sexy young . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sighs and falls back to the side. \"Oh, crap. I almost had you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess. Why are you using your sister's skin to seduce me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks at me with Katie's puppy dog eyes and asks, \"Why aren't you more interested in a hot young girl like this when you have the chance? And don't give me that 'never do sisters' rule. Besides, you know I have a serious crush on you.\" She adds the last with a sultry tone and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a point there. Katie would definitely be a great conquest. She's probably a virgin to boot. Katie does turn you on as you've admitted to Jessica - at her prodding. Better to be truthful, especially when she can see the tent in your pants after Katie flirted with you. In fact, you notice there's a definite tightness there now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do feel guilty because Jessica's probably using Katie's skin without her permission. You could limit this encounter so there's no residual damage. In other words, no sex. Then again, you and Jessica did plan on having fun with the pens. Maybe she could be Katie for a while and have a skin clone cover for Jessica. You could nab and be one of Katie's friends so you're together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You live <i>really</i> close, which was convenient until now. <br>\r\nYou're almost afraid of what Jessica might do with her new powers, given the circumstances already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Ms. Hunt.\" You hear Claire say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of thumping signals Katie's eager retreat to the bedroom up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Claire, you need to close your eyes for this.\" Katie says just outside the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. why?\" Claire asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it!\" Katie insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a tired scoff, and a few seconds later, a slump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door bursts open and Katie drags your sister's pale skin into the room, draped in cloth and red hair. The door gently shuts soon after, and Katie quietly turns the lock.<br>\r\nYou stare as Katie quickly hoists Claire into the air by the shoulders, displaying her deflated form to you, clothes barely holding on, her head hangs forward, long red hair cascading down over her torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't who I had in mind, Jess.\" You grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, you asked for it.\" Katie smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skin crumples onto the bedside and Katie opens the bathroom door just next to the exit. Gesturing with one arm to the skin, the other to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, no time to waste!\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, exhausted already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're halfway into your sister's long legs before you hear Jessica's comments just outside the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Katie, your boobs are cute..\" She mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking you head, you sigh. Pulling the stomach up, you feel a strict tightening around your groin and look down to see a rapidly vanishing lump. The taught skin seems to relax quickly as it scapes your body into that of your own sister. A pair of pink lips replace old reliable. You're surprised to see them completely shaven, not that you'd ever though about that really. Claire just didn't really seem the type..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the bathroom mirror, your normal body is mushroom capping over Claire's hips. Your eyebrows raise at the strange sight, before you turn away perturbed.<br>\r\nShaking out one of the noodly arms, you slide your own inside, tugging and adjusting as you gradually insert your fingers into the glove-like appendage. It's just as tight as the rest of the damn thing, but the feeling eventually fades. Repeating the process with the other, you feel something slim crawl up your back very quickly. Stretching and prodding your back, you realize that it's not a spider or anything of the sort, but the skin sealed its back up automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's gotten awfully quiet outside, you stop moving and listen for a bit, but you can't hear anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you feel a slight jiggle which catches you off guard, you look down to see a pair of large B cups hanging from your chest, topped with bright pink nipples.<br>\r\nCuriosity has you gently touch one with a fingertip, you bite your lip as you underestimate it's sensitivity. Clearing your mind, you refocus. You tug the mask slightly, stretching Claire's neck as the opening widens. Slipping your head in, you feel claustrophobic as you look out of the empty eyelids, turning back to the mirror.<br>\r\nGradually adjusting and fixing Claire's head, it suddenly constricts around your own, that strange sensation of something running up your spine occurring along your neck this time. Looking into the mirror, you see nobody but Claire staring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the bathroom door, you jump in surprise as you see Jessica's father completely naked, gripping his rather sizeable member. Katie's skin is in a pile on the floor, as is Jessica's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, princess?\"</span></div></div>",

Two eyes full, your cornflower blue Jessica eyes taking in your Jessica reflection. Jessica is stunningly pretty, and for now you're Jessica. In body, anyway.

Your entire self is Jessica's. You are Jessica. You look in the mirror and it's just your ordinary reflection. Your body language is purely your own but it's Trish who notices that it's changed from David's to yours: you just seem your normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're purely Jessica Hunt.

I'm Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. so that's what this does, huh?\" Trish ponders aloud twirling the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly you gasp in surprise. \"Oh, did you know David's had the hots for you since sixth grade but he gave up and started going for me when we reached high school.

Oh my god, yes!\" Trish yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly,you get up and run towards where her voice came from. Her mother's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!

Why would you use it on your own mom!?\" You say, snatching the pen from her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a look, and then glances back to the skin. She walks over and picks it up, giving a look of disgust as she feels it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so warm and.. fleshy..\" She sticks out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're intrigued and you walk over to her, looking at Alyson's deflated face in her hands. Her features are deformed as her face hangs loosely. <br>\r\nHer insides appear to have completely disappeared. Trish pokes her finger in one of the eye holes. You grab her wrist and yank it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, David, it's not like she can feel it..\" Trish pouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sick, Trish.\" You shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Let's try it!\" Trish says, her eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish shooed you out of the room. You'd refused to put on the skin, leaving it to Trish for her to try. Neither of you had any idea of what would happen, and it was minutes before you heard a voice again. Only this time, it was Trish's mother's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, you can come in now!\" You hear her shout in Trish's giddy mannerisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, you see Alyson in a casual t-shirt and sweatpants, of which the latter had belonged to Trish. You noticed the sweatpants being stretched more over Alyson's wider hips, and you find yourself slightly aroused when your eyes explore the rest of her.<br>\r\nTrish indiscriminately squishes her mother's larger breasts together, giggling childishly with a fire in her eye. Upon observing, you blush and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, young man?\" Trish teases you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up and take her off..\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha', you're such a buzzkill.\" Trish says. \"Watch this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to her again and see Trish reaching around her head, her face lips twist as she struggles with something. <br>\r\nBrown skin appears at the sides of Alyson's neck as Trish peels her skin off quite literally. The more she peeled, the more loose her face appeared to become as she moved upwards. Her face became completely flaccid as she pulls the skin down, long dirty blonde curls falling over her breasts as the mask hangs from Trish's neck. She flips her hair back, it rests behind her shoulders as she looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.. was fun..\" She says, smiling devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Jimmy might be rubbing off on you a little..\" You tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish looks up at you suddenly, and then blushes, looking at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't be stupid, that jerk could never..\" She says, failing to conceal her wavering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're the one who's stupid, you obviously like him.\" You say, smirking as you walk up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, what do you know anyway?\" She folds her mother's arms under her breasts and huffs, before she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we let him in on this? Knowing Jimmy, he'll probably find something fun to do.\" You suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's eyes light up, and she nods quickly, you notice her biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.. I gotta' get out of this, so shoo!\" She says, flicking her fingers at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, whatever..\" You say, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(POV Trish)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching David leave the room, you bite your lip again as you walk to the bathroom to your left. You see yourself in the mirror, a chimera of two people fused at the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool..\" You mumble to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've always envied your mom for having bigger boobs than you, and she's wasted no time at all in teasing you about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame you didn't inherit my good looks too!\" You quote her, ironically, you and your mother are incredibly similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping your breasts through the mess of your mother's hair that shrouds them, you toy with them in the mirror for a few seconds, before you take it a step further and unclip your bra. Letting it drop to the floor after slipping the straps from your shoulders, you quickly slide your panties down your thighs and flick them next to your bra. The fondling continues for a few more seconds, before you stroke your larger waist and make your way down, massaging your inner legs. Something heats up inside you, and your crotch moistens. You blush incredibly, looking up at yourself in the mirror like a little kid who broke a glass.<br>\r\nThe prospect of your mother being able to experience things like being horny is alien to you, probably to everyone. <br>\r\n<i>What'll it feel like if I..?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish! Hurry up already!\" David yells. \"You've been in there for almost 15 minutes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm almost finished!\" You yell back, quickly pulling the skin from around your body. It peels away as if it was lightly glued on to your own skin, with a wet but satisfying rip. You look down at your smaller, yet still just as shapely breasts and pout. Shrugging, you take your mother's skin back out into her bedroom and throw her on the bed, she'll stay like that until you know what to do with her. You pull your panties up your legs and strap your bra around your chest, then you tug on your tank top and your sweatpants. Rushing out to David, you huff as if you'd just run a lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're late, O'neil!\" David mimics your gym teacher, Mr. Royce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you laugh for a second and you drop the pen back in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid pulls out his phone, and you get nervous just thinking about Jimmy. There's something about that guy that just excites you, even though he's a huge jerkface all the time. Maybe it's because he's wild.. like you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Jimmy,\" David says suddenly, snapping you out of your thoughts, \"I'm with Trish, we've got something to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see David pass you a look, before he says, \"No Jimmy, it's not a new Ferrari.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head in sync with David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll swing by right now, that's cool?\" David asks, \"Sweet, see ya' mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ends the call and shoves his phone back into his pocket, then looks up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy's waiting for us, let's go.\" He says, grabbing the box of pens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for your sneakers and pull them on, then you and David lock the door as you leave, having forgotten all about your mother Alyson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Jimmy's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>David's bringing Trish over, damn. My room's a friggin' mess!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scramble to pick up bags of Doritos and bottles of Mountain Dew strewn about all over your floor, throwing them into the garbage bin besides your desk. <br>\r\nIn a few seconds, the poor thing's up to the brim in trash. You sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whatever..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop back into your computer chair and throw on your headphones, hitting play on your playlist, you click back to Facebook.<br>\r\nMinutes pass as you just browse, you browse 4chan for a few minutes when suddenly something yanks the headphones from your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head flicks around, you're annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, David you piece of-\" You stop as you see Trish standing there, David closing the door behind her. \"T-Trish..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish eyes your set-up slowly, and then gives you back your headphones, a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking the only piece of anything here would be your old toaster and that poor excuse for a rig.\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stunned for a moment, and Trish laughs, probably expecting your reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mate, I'm into computers too, don't get your boner in a twist.\" She says, folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boner is perfectly un-knotted, thank you very much..\" You reply, nonetheless actually being hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish smirks as she sits on your bed, and David sits next to her, holding a strange box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see David open the box and pull out a black pen shaped object, looks like a laser pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make me chase a red dot on the floor?\" You joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, are you a pussy?\" Trish replies snarkily, you give her a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up bro, this laser pen right here can turn anyone into a costume, and when you wear it, you turn into them!\" David says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at him for a moment, before you smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be an idiot, what is this, some kind of stupid fetish porn?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, \" Trish says, \"I tried it on my mom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink once, and then look at David, then back to Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna' be honest right now, \" You say your gaze still trading between the two,<br>\r\n\"Trish, you are the hottest thing I've ever seen since I accidentally burned my hand on an iron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish blushes, and David shakes his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true mate, we tried it, it works! It's so awesome. We brought it to you because you're creative, what can we do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. the first thing that comes to mind is fetish porn.. but I guess we can improvise.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish starts to laugh, and David frowns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seriously, what do we do? We ran out of ideas so we came to you..\" David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, I have an idea, but first I need to see if this really works.\" You say, snatching the box and pulling out the black pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the pen in your palm, it feels good. It tickles your skin with it's cold, hard texture, smooth and shiny like plastic. Upon further examination, you notice the head is like a crystal, and it looks more like glass than plastic, but it's probably the latter. You thumb runs over the moderately sized button on the shaft.<br>\r\nThe pen's uniform and elegant shape contrasts with the mess of burnt flesh across your hand, an ugly scar formed by an accident years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell people you burnt your hand on an iron, but in truth, it was your father. He came home drunk one night and.. got out of control. <br>\r\nDefending your sister from him, like a stoic and valiant tower, you were easily swept up and taken to the kitchen.<br>\r\nYour father decided he would \"teach you some respect\", heating up the stovetop, he marked you as a burden to him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he's sitting in jail for it, and you're staring at your two closest friends. Your eyes float to Trish, something inside you urges to zap her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, what the fuck!?\" David yells, as Trish's surprised expression quickly deflates into a flat sheet of her own skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and swipe the newly formed costume from the bed, it's warm. You're perturbed by it, it's unnatural.<br>\r\nIt's incredible..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jimmy! Jimmy!</i>\", David says, his voice getting blocked out as you're entranced. \"<i>Are you fucking serious right now?</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip Trish around and rip her shirt off, dropping it on the floor. Her white bra easily comes off, letting the flaccid folds of what would be her breasts flap against her ribs. You smile slowly as you uncover the helpless form of Trish, removing her sweatpants with a weak tug, and finally her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting Trish's neck to your face, you inhale deeply the scent of her hair. It's a strong, rich scent. Kind of reminds you of maple syrup.<br>\r\nHer tanned skin compliments her long dirty blonde hair, and you ball up a handful in your fingers, feeling it's soft yet coarse curls. <br>\r\nA seam runs down her back, and you open it curiosly with two fingers, pulling the sides, it stretches out, revealing a large cavity inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The ultimate disguise.. It's a.. skinsuit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop the suit against your computer chair and quickly strip down, letting your clothes drop to the floor as well.<br>\r\nPicking up the suit again, you pull open Trish' back and stick your arm into hers. <br>\r\nYou feel your bones crackle, your skin, fat and muscle worms about under your new skin. Becoming taughter, stronger. A new complexion now paints your arm a nice tanned brown, and you wiggle your new fingers. They're fair, skinny, with pink fingernails. You're utterly fascinated by these little things.<br>\r\nBut most of all, the ugly, huge burn on your hand is gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's gone!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, what's the matter with you?!\" You yell, getting up from his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing Jimmy's shoulders you shake him, and he stirs from his trance. For a moment, he stares at you almost clueless. His fingers still waving in the air, albeit slowly as if he was manipulating a marionette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gone David, my burn mark!\" Jimmy yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, you zapped Trish without her permission!\" You yell back, to sedate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I'm.. free..\" Jimmy replies, looking at his hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the..?\" You remark as Jimmy's grinning expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jimmy pushes you back with tremendous effort. You stumble backwards and hit the end of the bed, consequently falling onto it.<br>\r\nLooking back at him as you recover, you see Trish's body hideously contorted as Jimmy stretches her back out, stuffing the rest of himself inside.<br>\r\nThe more Jimmy moves and wriggles himself inside the suit, the more it shapes itself onto his form. You see Trish's firm, thick legs take shape over Jimmy's skinny ones, and a taught, toned stomach replaces Jimmy's unused abdominals. Trish's modest breasts almost expand as they cling to Jimmy, he pulls her head over his own, massaging and adjusting her features in like a halloween mask. A few seconds later, your friend Trish stands before you, pulling and tugging as the loose skin around her body. Jimmy's new fingers grip the folds of slack skin on his thighs and pulls them up, tightening her groin around his own. Then he grips her adam's apple and pulls, along with her cheeks. The final adjustments completed, Trish exhales and begins to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe at it, a high pitched, sadistic laugh warps the normally fun and carefree nature of Trish that you're so accustomed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes are lighting up in a way you've never seen, she continuously fondles her breasts and slumps against Jimmy's computer chair. Spreading her legs, she eagerly toys with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tri- Jimmy! Stop it!\" You yell, grabbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instantly wrends her arm away from you and hisses, returning your advance with the threat of her new weapon, the black pen.<br>\r\nPointing it at you, her face is contorted into an expression of passion mixed with primal frenzy. A strange sight, to see something so beautiful perverted into something so.. beastial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me David!\" Trish commands, and you back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have.. her voice..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her voice? No, David. It's my voice now.\" Trish says, smirking smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What the hell!?\" You protest quickly, but a wave of the black pen's head shuts you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so renewed in here, wearing Trish makes me feel.. amazing..\" Jimmy says, a fanatic laugh follows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this Jimmy, I didn't bring you the pen for this!\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\" Trish smirks, before licking her lips seductively, \"However.. I'm craving a little more than just this..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish suddenly bounds up and leaps onto you, pushing you against the bed once more. She slinks down to your legs and undoes your pants, with a quick tug, she soon reveals your member, currently hardening due to the attractive, naked female infront of you.<br>\r\nYou've always had fantasies about Trish, heck, you've had fantasies about most girls. But you'd never have thought it'd happen in real life, and not like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to protest when you feel a wet sucking occur around the tip of your member. Blood instantly rushes through your groin and you become excited, you hear a contented growl from below. Trish messily works her wet tongue around your member, bobbing her head up and down rapidly, she fervorously sucks you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy, what the f-fuck man?!\" You say, before a wave of pleasure silences you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself plunged into the back of Trish's throat and she gags on you, wrapping her tongue around your now sticky, slimy cock.<br>\r\nSlowly, Trish slides her head up, her lips wiping your skin clean and she finishes with a loud, satisfying smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\" Trish asks, raising one blonde brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Surprisingly good, actually.. But, why..?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this body.. wants it. I feel an urge, it's incredible!\" Trish explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawls up onto the bed and mounts you, licking her lips as she adjusts your cock to the lips of her cunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait waitwaitwa- Agh!\" You yell as she inserts you into her cunt, she tries to restrict her moaning for the fear of attracting anyone downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there in heaven as Trish rides you, she grips her breasts and squeezes them together, then she leans forward and puts her fingers on your chest, gently rubbing under your ribs as she leans in and plants her lips on yours. Confused, you \"accidentally\" shut your eyes for a split second, before she cuts it off and rears up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see a surprised, and grinning Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't expect you to succumb to me so easily.. David. I suppose anyone with their cock in this pussy would, though..\" Trish says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply groan and lay limp on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue for a few more minutes, before you feel something start to heat up, more than it already has. You bite you lip and play with your clit, serving to only hasten the feeling. In a few moments, you bubble up and burst into a plethora of sensations and buckle under their weight, collapsing onto a heap ontop of David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-God!\" You gasp repeatedly, you hand slithering down between your legs to the now sticky cocky still halfway inside your pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking it, you feel some of your cum remain on your fingers and you promptly suck it off after raising your arm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there for a moment, breasts squished against David's chest, you're satisfied for now. Getting up, you stand and look at yourself in the closet door mirror.<br>\r\nYour groin is shiny and sticky with your own juices, some trickling down your legs, sweat coats the rest of you. Flicking your long curls behind your shoulders, you walk to the closet and pull out one of your towels, wrapping it around yourself. Then you walk to the black pen and pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy.. you sick.. motherfucker..\" David groans, tired. \"What are you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the pen at him and smirk, holding your towel's edges against your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you anymore, but I can't let you go either. You'd probably tell Jessica and that's a no no..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's eyes widen and he flies up, but you extend your arm to stop him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with Jess?!\" David yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything..\" You say, curling your lips into a cruel grin before you burst out into laughter, your thumb silences David's ensuing scream of hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis form crumples to the ground in a heap, and you giggle. Holding the pen, you walk to the door and open it, then proceeding to leave the room to go meet the rest of your family. </span></div></div>",

You checked the caller ID and grinned mischievously with Trish's face. It was Jessica calling, and at what better timing. You put the phone down as it rang away, and as it did you lifted David's skin off the bed and began stripping him of his clothes. He won't be needing them anymore anyways you thought, giggling from it. After yanking the jeans off you pulled the shirt and boxers he had on as well, the boxers somewhat wet with cum from your wet pussy during the sex. You grinned and opened the gap in the back of the skin, and the thought passed your mind.. should I get out of Trish first? What happens if I put him on over myself right now..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You decided to..</span></div></div>",

Soon after adjusting the skin you pushed your other leg in, now grabbing the hips of his skin and sliding it up like it was a pair of tight skinny jeans. The warmth and thought caused your pussy to tingle and get wet, and as you pulled the hips over your own it was replaced with a hardening cock.. still covered in Trish's juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm god yesss.. * you moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to masturbate, now having Tits and and dick, you pressed onward thinking of your plan for Jessica.

Or rather, David's fingers.<br>\r\nWearing a male is much different than a female, male bodies are dramatically different and far sturdier and harder than females, obviously. <br>\r\nBut David is far larger and buffer than you, it's strange. You almost miss the tug of breasts on your chest, the soft, long hair down over your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding open the box's lid, you notice another pen inside. It shines a glossy brown against the evening sun, you glance up to make sure you're not walking into anything. The sidewalk's clear at this time, with the most disturbance being a leaf blowing across the ground. You feel a sensation of familiarity as you approach a house. Something in David's head rings a bell, it's Jessica's house. You'd already known where her house was, but you didn't know inhabiting someone's body also gave you their thought processes..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on Jessica's door, her mother answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey David, Jess is upstairs waiting for you.\" She says with a smile, obviously busy by her flustered appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I'll head up right now.\" You say as you step in, shutting the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking to yourself as you turn your back on her. You feel a hand on your shoulder as you take a step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's that in your hand?\" Jessica's mom says suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, this?\" You raise the C-Set box. \"N-Nothing, just a.. a gift for Jessica!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's mom frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift?\" She reads the top, \"C-Set..? What is that, some kind of costume jewellery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly.\" You say, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raises her brow amused, \"Alright sweetheart, on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and whirl around, strutting up the stairs quickly. You hear her mutter something to herself as you're out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Costume jewellery? Really, David?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, the upstairs hall is long, and you see a door on your left with light cascading across the floor. Walking up to it, you peek through and see your prize laying on the bed, next to a laptop computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jessica..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how you ended up here, but good God, you're not regretting it one bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind a locked door, Jessica eagerly sucks your cock, trying her best to silence her moans of pleasure, and you, your own. <br>\r\nYou wince every time you feel her tongue almost expertly wrap around your shaft and pump, almost as if she was jerking you with her tongue.<br>\r\nAs she bobs her head, her tongue slips from your shaft and leaves behind a wet, cool sensation, her lips massage your sensitive skin.<br>\r\nYou gently rest your hand on her head and pull her down onto you again, she growls deeply in her throat as she takes your head to the back of her mouth.<br>\r\nThe smack of her lips signifies the exit of your cock from her mouth, as she works you thoroughly, she talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.. mmphhmm <i>smack{/i, how was your day with Jimmy and Trish? Mmmphmm..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was.. a-amazing..\" You stammer as she relentlessly sucks, you feel yourself rising to orgasm soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>smack</i> Great, now I've got you all to myself..\" She says, eyeing your erect member as it glistens in the light of the ceiling lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls her blonde hair behind her head and gently takes your tip to her lips, licking, she sucks as she rests it there, stimulating you at the very top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>smack</i>Mmmm, you like that David?\" She purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very, very much.\" You say with a foolish grin across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica frowns, holding your cock in her mouth as she looks up at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dayphid? <i>smack</i> You sounded like Jimmy for a sec' there..\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit, I'm not good at acting at all..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, he must've gotten something stuck in my head when I was there, don't worry though..\" You lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grips your cock and pumps for a few seconds, flicking a bang to the side of her head. She looks up at you and winks, before almost swallowing your dick whole. You lurch forward and almost shout as she deepthroats you, and you can help but release. Jessica sputters and chokes as your cum splatters her throat, but she holds herself together and sucks your dick clean, ending the blow with a loud smack.<br>\r\nHer cheeks red, she looks up at you and opens her mouth to show your sperm on her tongue, before she swallows it and giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica unbuttons her light yellow blouse and reveals her pink bra, you marvel at the two globes of pure beauty of which the cups restrain.<br>\r\nWithout exchanging words, you get up and shake your jeans off, your boxers join the pile and so does your shirt. <br>\r\nJess pulls her shorts off, exposing her red panties, and she pushes you onto the bed. Crawling up onto you, you realise that this is exactly what you did to David as Trish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No wonder he was so surprised..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica quickly moves in and kisses you, you shut your eyes as you feel her soft, warm lips against yours, before she breaks it and moves down, her long blonde locks trailing down your chest. She gently plays with your cock before moving her fingers to her crotch. Her ass reared up on the air, she rests her face against your stomach as both of her hands move to her pussy, slipping under her panties, she fingers her clit for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to believe you're even doing this, but you are. The pen is so awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hook your hands under Jessica's arms and pull her up, flattening her out along your body. She gives a yelp of surprise before you roll ontop of her, your weight pressuring inbetween her thighs. You now erect member rubs against her pelvis and she stares at you with a lusty expression.<br>\r\nYou get off her and stand up, pulling her ankles beside you. Bracing her crotch against yours, you pull down her panties to reveal her shaven snatch, wet and ready. Fingers probing, she murmurs something as you spread her lips, showing her pink insides to you. Chuckling, you grin and lean forward, gripping your cock as you use it to penetrate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica whimpers, you feel her muscles tightening around your cock, providing friction as you fuck her.<br>\r\nShe wraps her legs around your waist as you proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BANG BANG BANG!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica' mother knocks on the door, clearly you've made too much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in there? Jessica? David?\" You hear her mother's voice, she sounds angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looks at you with wide eyes, and then begins to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing mom, me and David are just watching some videos! Sorry if we disturbed you!\" She lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you're watching porn for christ's sakes! Keep it down!\" She says. You hear her storm off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of your laugh it over, and then resume. Almost an hour later, Jessica climaxes, you hold your hand over her mouth to muffle her cries as she stuffs her fingers into her cunt alongside your member. You soon follow, Jessica takes the rest of your seed down her throat.<br>\r\nThe two of you cuddle for a while, sweaty, huffing and tired. You gently massage her bulbous breasts as you spoon, she simply chuckles.<br>\r\nGetting up, she turns around and looks down at you as you lay naked on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'mma go shower, clean up and stuff.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty,\" You nod, \"I'll get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she walks around the room, reaching into a closet to retrieve her towel, and opens a door to the left of the bed. Her own private bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and open the box, pulling out the black pen. Laying it on the bed, you hear the shower turn on.<br>\r\nReaching around your head, you peel David off and drop him next to his clothes. Your breasts almost pop out as David's chest peels down.<br>\r\nLifting Trish's breasts, you let them drop and bounce, before peeling her from around your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look like a pale, white cicada emerging from it's dead, brown husk. Peeling Trish's shapely, cute face off of your own, you sigh as your breasts instantly deflate into flappy skin, returning you to your dreaded, original form. An incredible feeling of release occurs when you peel your thighs down as your cock and balls re-materialize into existence. Pulling Trish's legs off like a pair of knee socks, you let her drop to the floor. Picking up the black pen, you walk around the room to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the knob, you open the door. You're nervous though you've got no reason to be.<br>\r\nEntering the bathroom, you see Jessica letting the water run down her chest, she doesn't bother looking. <br>\r\nRaising the pen at her, you smirk, leaving her with one last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a real <b>sucker</b>, Jess'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" She turns around, before you press the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up the pale, glowing skin. You wrap yourself in your latest victim's visage. Her large breasts pop into existence, pink areola and nipples reaching out into the air. You stuff your head into her neck and upwards, pulling down the skin over your face. A melding of the two bodies occurs, you feel skin fuse with your own to create a new body. Your jawline evens out and softens into a smooth curve, your cheeks puff out. You feel a new set of teeth appear, your long blond hair sticks to your back under the warm water. You run your hands down your long legs, and back up. Lifting your breasts, you squeeze them and laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're mine.</i></i></span></div></div>",

She's your girlfriend and while you haven't known her as long as Jimmy or Trish, she's truly your best friend and the one you trust the most.  After all, if the pens really do what they say, you wouldn't really trust Jimmy, the consummate prankster, to behave himself while using them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's the weekend so you turn up at Jess's place unannounced - Mrs Hunt lets you in and tells you that Jessica is in her room.  When you enter her room you find her sitting on her bed browsing the web on her Macbook.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" she smiles sweetly as she gets up and kisses you tenderly on the lips, \"So what cha wanna do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you explain, \"I found this box on my doorstep and inside were these things called 'Costume devices'.  Thought I'd bring them over and we could give them a try if you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you took out the box, Jessica looked at you with a strange gaze as if she were evaluating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd,\" she replies with a sly grin, \"I got a very similar box myself.  Wanna see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches under her bedsheets and pulls out an identical box.  When she opens it, you find that there are also two pens inside with the same faded note which fails to explain what the second pen does.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hold the second pen, which is coincidentally coloured brown, you wonder what it's purpose is.  More importantly though, you wonder if the pens actually work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those pens are actually quite amazing,\" you hear Jessica say, \"I've tried them out actually and I was doing some research on the net before you came in.  Nothing useful I'm afraid.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her in surprise as she says it and you query what the second pen does.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually quite simple really.  When you put on a skin and zap yourself with the brown pen, you get the person's mannerisms and personality and basic memory.  If you zap yourself a second time though, you get access to all their memories.  It's actually quite a thrill to see someone's whole life before you like an open book.  That said, it takes effort to immerse yourself into their psyche - it's not as easy as just zapping yourself and acting like that person perfectly.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiles at you sweetly and you get this sinking feeling in your stomach.  You hadn't noticed a single thing wrong with her but you just know what's about to come next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not actually Jessica are you?\" you ask suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica flicks her golden blonde hair over her shoulders as she shrugs noncommittally.  Her big blue eyes sparkle as they gaze at you and she walks slowly towards you.  She looks up at you and pouts cutely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know David, am I Jessica?  I sure look like Jessica and I'm doing exactly what Jessica would be doing right now so am I not Jessica?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presses her lips against yours and kisses you tenderly.  It feels just like Jessica, down to the minutia of how she kisses.  Your mind is buzzing, you can't figure out if it actually is your girlfriend in body and spirit or if someone has cooped her form using these apparently miraculous pens.  As she holds onto you tightly, your mind starts to blank - the whole situation being too much for you to handle and for the first time ever, you pass out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake, you're lying in Jessica's bed as she strokes your head gently.  Your head is throbbing - you obviously bumped it against something when you fainted and Jessica dragged you into the bed to recover.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gosh David,\" Jessica snorts uncharacteristically, \"If I'd known you'd faint, I wouldn't have toyed with you so much.  You're such a wuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tone sounds familiar.  It sounds just like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingoooo,\" Jessica replies in a sing song voice, one that sounds just like Jessica but with Trish's mannerisms, \"Blarghhh you had no idea it was me.\"  Trish contorts Jessica's face into a grotesque caricature of itself as she continues to pat you like a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth are you doing!?  That's my girlfriend you're wearing!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah duh, that's what the pens are for.  I only got here like an hour before you.  After someone dropped off the pens at my place I thought I'd try it on a fellow female and Jessica was the closest.  Besides, don't worry - I kinda asked her for permission before I zapped her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, by kinda I mean I told her about the pens and said it'd be cool to play a prank on you?  She didn't exactly say no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and shake your head.  This was classic Trish, always shooting first and asking for forgiveness later.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you think you can get outta Jess now?  I kinda came over here so we could try the pens ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo fun times eh?  Alright lover boy, I'll give you Jess back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch closely as Trish-in-Jessica climbs up and strips out of all her clothes and dumps them on the floor.  Jessica would not be happy - she liked to keep everything neat and tidy.  A look of concentration crosses Trish's face and she pulls at the back of her head.  She sweeps her hair forward and bends over as she pulls at her skin.  It stretches like elastic, the hair coming with it as you see another head come out of a slit on the back of Jessica's head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, feels good to hear my own voice again,\" says Trish as she drops Jessica's deflated skin onto her breasts.  Using her borrowed fingers, she continues to pull at her neck and she turns around so that you can see the slit extend its way down her neck and all the way to her buttocks.  As the slit opens up, you can see Trish's much more tanned skin inside and she maneuvers her way out of the tight skin that is Jessica's.  When she's done, she tosses it at you and pulls out her bag, which she had hidden in Jess's closet and starts putting on her own clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just zap her skin with the black pen and she'll change back in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she suggests and before long the Jessica skin reinflates into a complete Jessica once more.  As climbs up groggily, you drape the blankets over her naked form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God Trish, you did it didn't you?\" asks Jessica after she notices her nudity.  She pouts with annoyance at her friend, \"So how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David didn't have a clue,\" Trish replies happily, \"And he's a great kisser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!\" Jessica's face wrinkles up as she chastises her friend but she can't hide her glee at the fact that the pens worked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\" you ask, \"Shall we go out and try the pens out or just keep it between us for now\"</span></div></div>",

We've decided to include you on the pens Devid\" Trish says first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thats good to hear.. But where do you wanna go or do with them? I mean thoses pens are so unreal it's hard to believe\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well babe before we get too ahead of ourselves we have to take care of something first, or at least Trish and I do\" Jessica responds in a girlish manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. Well sure I guess, but what would that be?\" You asked feeling left out and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"just this\" Jessica grins sliding the pen from behind herself aimed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait wai..\" Your words are cut off as everything fades black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Jessica and Trish's POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that worked out just great!

And using it\" Jessica grinned with a wink at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well I'm not against it\" Trish winked back handing Jessica the skin of her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica started to slip her feet in, adjusting herself as she started fitting in both legs and sliding them up her thighs. She noted that it was a warm and arousing sensation as she did. She pulled the hips over her own and giggled seeing a limp 7 inches below. trish on the other hand was finding this quite erotic. She started to pull the skin of David further up Jessica's slim sexy figure, stretching and stuffing her DD boobs into the skin while Jessica slipped her arms in each side. A minute later Jessica was pushing her head into David's lifeless skin and felt it cling to her, all of the skin did in fact. She gasped feeling the warmth and growing sensation she was having as her new cock started growing suddenly. Trish was already stroking it to be erect and was just deviously smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so.. David.. How does that feel\" Trish asked in a suggestively playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm.. Really.. Really good\" The new David grinned mischieviously.</span></div></div>",

Walking more towards her you walk to the side of the couch and sit on the arm on the couch casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want David?\" she says impatiently as she\u2019s fixated 50/50 from her phone and to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too sis.....\" you reply sarcastically. \"Anyway, I found this cool pen looking device in the house today, and I just thought I'd share it with you.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of device is it?\" she quickly responds back, still not looking at you which slightly annoys you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got these instructions that say it's some sort of device that turns people into wearable disguises of some sort, or so it says..\" You explain to her as you open the small wooden box containing the device and the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops texting for a second only to glance at you holding the now opened small wooden box. She finishes her text, puts the TV on mute and stands up, walking towards you as you're still sitting on the arm of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, here\u2019s the instructions if you want to read them.\" you offer to her while extending your arm out with it in hand. Instead she grabs the pen from the box while your other hand was still holding the box \"Or not...\" you say in an annoyed tone,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. Well thank you for this David.\" you calmly says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for wha-..\" is that last thing you said before your vision goes to black. Little did you know while you were asking her that, while she was carrying the pen she pointed the pen upwards aiming at you while keeping her arm down so it didn't look like she was about to zap you. But she did, and you probably should have guessed it since you've always known Tina to be an opportunist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Tina Anderson's POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as your idiot brother freezes mid-sentence and begins to deflate into a pile of skin and clothes hanging from the arm of the couch. \"Whoa.....I didn't think he was serious, but I guess this things legit...\" you say clearly shocked and impressed at the same time. \"Well I guess I should thank my little brother Davie as he did deliver me this pen and even brought himself as my first test subject to wear hehe...\" you slyly say out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better take him into my room before Mom or Claire see this...\" you think to yourself. Quickly you grab David\u2019s skin and his barely attached clothes, while still carrying the pen tightly. Eventually you get to your room  shutting the door behind you. You throw the pen onto your table and then place David\u2019s deflated skin onto your bed \"Ok, time for the unknown.\" you murmur to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting by undressing David\u2019s skin, it doesn't take long as he's only wearing casual around the house clothes, throwing the clothes into a pile beside your bed you look at your brothers naked skin suit, admiring how toned he is but what really catches your eye is his deflated member, which causes you to blush and bite your lip thinking about how soon it'll be yours to do with whatever you want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndressing yourself out of your lounging around clothes which consist of ugg boots, black leggings, your old hoodie, a tank top and your panties. You weren't wearing a bra since you were wearing two layers over your body and you're at home so it didn't seem necessary. Eventually you're gloriously standing naked in your room, perky tits and ass of yours free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking David\u2019s skin you flip it around to find a thin slit spanning from the top of the neck to the bottom of where the tail bone is. You begin to wear him, starting with your right leg into his, you place it in slowly all while noticing how your smooth luscious leg morphs into his rougher toned male leg \"Whoa....\" you quietly say. Doing the same for the left leg you pull his hips and ass over your own feminine hips and you get a strangely aroused tingly feeling when you notice your smooth pussy gets replaced with David\u2019s flaccid dick \"No way....this is so awesome...\" you think while blushing. Continuing on you continue to work the skin on as you work both of your petite hands through the arms to watch them turn into David\u2019s bigger male hands, working the torso over yours you get a strange feeling as your ample breasts suddenly vanish and you feel a sense of freedom with no weight on your chest anymore. Zipping up the zipper to the bottom of the neck you finish donning David as you hold you deflated face and pull it over your own, making sure to stuff all of your long brown hair inside of his skin as you finish zipping up the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over in your new naked body towards a long full body mirror, you are in awe as you have fully physically transformed into your younger brother David Anderson \"Amazing...\" you say in your stolen voice \"Oh wow, I even have his voice too... this device will be making my day for sure...\" you murmur to yourself. Stroking your new member until it gets hard you then begin to slowly fap for a few seconds until you get rock hard, you stop and admire the size \"It's ok I guess...\" you lie to yourself as you are secretly impressed with David\u2019s size as it's pretty big. You blush and start to get horny with your new body \"Damn what to do now.....\" you think while grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually decide to... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't know why since she doesn't seem like she'd be interested, but with the off chance that she is, it's worth a try you figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to her room, you knock and then let yourself in. She's just on her laptop as usual, while watching TV, while texting on her iPhone..... While she also has her tablet open with candy crush.... watching that many electronic devices operate at the same time surrounded by just one person using them is a painfully strange sight to swallow, almost annoying. Even though you don\u2019t pay the electricity bill you can feel the price on the next bill ramping up just looking at her in her technology operating bubble. Eventually she gives you a quick glance and goes back to typing away,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey David, what\u2019s up?\" she asks you while texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just thought I'd pop by. I found something strange today in the house...\" you say to her hoping you'll get her full attention as you feel you deserve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" she replies back in a typical unimpressed teenage way, you expected this from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just any random old thing, from the looks of it it's a piece of new tech, apparently it can turn people into wearable disguises....\" you tell her, hoping to hook her attention to you. And with that her head shoots up like a grazing gazelle hearing a sharp sound in the wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New? Tech? Wearable disguises you say? Sounds cool! How does it work?\" she asks you. You've now got her attention, for how long is the question now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here, I'll show you the instructions that came with it.\" you open the wooden box you came in with and hand her the instructions, to which she skim reads it in about 10 seconds flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds cool!\" she says in a giddy way. You hand her the pen to look at as she promptly study\u2019s the device in her hands for a short time before giving it back to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooooo...... do you want to try this out then big bro?\" she asks you with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, but on who?\" you curiously reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellllll, us? I dunno.... I think we should try it on one of us. I don't know care, I just want to see if it's real or not!\" she hastily replies to you. \"But... like if you don't mind, I'd realllllly owe you one if you let me get first dibs on it and....well... let me use it on you....  <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">and like wear you</font>....\" she says in a cutesy but shy way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa? Me? Are you sure?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I don't care, I just want to see if it's real. Besides, this would be a way for us to get closer don't you think haha!\" she jokes with you.\u201d I mean, if you let me wear you now, I'd like totally let you wear me after I was done with you, for as long as you want too! Because I'm your favourite sister and an overall good person of course.\" she confidently says, even if she might have been bending the truth a little with what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, I dunno, I mean, I guess so.....\" you're not fully sure on what to do, but you then decide to...</span></div></div>",

But you owe me one, if this thing even works that is...\" you mumble contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yayyyyy! Thank youuuuu David!\" your sister replies cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You hand her the pen and take a step back. She frantically lifts up the pen and aims it at you, pressing it you hear a faint buzzing sound and a light glare out at you, that is the last thing you remember before everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Claire Andersons POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the pen actually works just like the instructions said and see your brother fold into himself drooping as he's reduced to a pile of skin and clothes. \"IT WORKED!\" You say out loud with joy. \"I can't believe that dufus actually let me use it on him.\" you scoff \"like I'd actually let him use it on me first, HA! He wishes he had my hot bod.\" you reaffirm to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the pen on your desk you eagerly walk up to your brothers skin suit begin to pick it up and start to inspect it. \"Cooool....\" you mumble to yourself. You then undress the skin pretty quickly and easily placing his clothes into a pile in the corner of your room, with his naked skin now in front of you you then lay it out on your bed to further look it over. Noticing your brothers deflated penis you blush thinking about how soon it'll be yours, this is a new experience for you after all, soon to experience what it's like to be a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to start undressing out of your lounge wear which consisted of a tank top, black leggings and some normal underwear. Now standing naked you grab the David skin and search for an opening, you find a thin slit at the back spanning from the top of the spine to the bottom of the tailbone. Stretching it slightly you begin to slide your small feminine leg into David\u2019s right leg, when your leg is fully into your brothers you feel it mould and become your new right leg \"Whoa....\" you stand in awe looking at your new manly hairy leg. Continuing you do the same from the left leg and then move onto the hips and crotch, pushing your crotch into his you pull his hips over your own petite girly ones and get a strange sudden feeling ripple through your body as you suddenly feel a strange weight in your crotch area, you quickly bend your head forward to see you now have your brothers genitalia hanging where your pussy use to be. It's a lot for you to process in a short amount of time but you're so cheekily curious to continue. You then push your thinner female arms into your brothers more thicker butch arms until you can control your new hands, you then proceed to pull his shoulders over your own, you note the strange feeling to have your modest breasts just disappear as you place David\u2019s chest over your own. Nearing the finish you zip up the zipper to the bottom of your his neck making sure your hair doesn't get snagged in the zipper \"Well, here I go..\" you think to yourself as you grab David\u2019s deflated head and pull it over your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAligning the eyes with the deflated head you close your eyes and notice you're no longer wearing anything.You walk over to your full body mirror to see your brother David Anderson in the reflection, you are now David Anderson in every way physically, but still mentally Claire Anderson. \"whoa...\" you say in your new male voice. \"Oh wow I even have his voice too, this is amazing!\" you proclaim out loud. Just the sight of seeing your new body naked has caused you to become slightly aroused so much so your member has started to get hard, you blush and place your stolen hand on it to feel it becoming slowly harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're distracted by your new body, suddenly.... </span></div></div>",

Stopping what you're doing you quickly glide over to your bedside cabinet where your phones placed and check to see whose calling, it's Katie. Your best friend picked a bad time to phone you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking you are about to answer the phone but then remember you're wearing your brothers skin and sound just like him. Quickly you reach at the back of your head and find the zipper, you then unzip the zipper to the bottom of your neck and then peel off your brother face to reveal your cute teenage girl face. Without another moment to lose you answer your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! Took you long enough Claire!\" Katie says impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry I was errr.. Just finishing a level on candy crush.\" you lie to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, anyway listen. I'm bored as fuck, do you want to hang out or something?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh err, yeah sure thing.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Just come around to mine ASAP! See you soon.\" she tell you. And with that she hangs up on you. Now faced with the task of going to your best friend\u2019s house you decide how to go about it now you have the pen and David\u2019s skin too. You thought up 2 options. First one you take off David and visit Katie as yourself with the pen and David\u2019s skin with you, show her the pen and your brothers skin suit, maybe even use the device on her. You wouldn\u2019t mind seeing what it's like to be your best friend. Or the second option, you visit Katie\u2019s house wearing David and visit his girlfriend Jessica instead, maybe turning her into a skin suit for Katie? So many possibilities.

You eagerly set his skin down on the bed and stripped from your clothes, sliding down your work skirt and unbuttoning your top to let your breasts hang more freely. You sighed as you cupped them in your hands, they were still quite big for your age of 42, it wasn't like you were out if shape, but you had acquired some curves through the years of raising your 3 kids.

Picking it up, it was warm to the touch and felt as if it were alive. You ran your fingers around his skin, admiring how soft it was for a young man. You also admired his package size, it was big for a teenager his age. You felt yourself blush and a sense of arousal course through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.. time to be David\" you said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Turning his skin around you found a long slit down the nape of the neck the traveled down to the ass crack barely. Opening him up you slowly slid one of your curvy legs down into his, noting how it was a warm wet feeling momentarily and then a tight feeling. As youfit yyour leg into your son's, you giggled happily seeing your leg had changed form and was now toned. You pressed onward, slipping your other leg in, enjoying the same sensations until it was time for the hips and groin. Yanking his skin up like it was a one piece lingerie, you felt the moist feeling of your pussy become replaced with the growing of what was to be your new dick. You gasped as it grew, taking in the sight of yourself with your son's lower half and cock as well as your motherly figure above. You resisted temptation to fap with your new toy and continued sliding his skin on. Your arms were a tight fit, but eventually you got them both in, finding your breasts being squished away inside the chest of David's skin as you pulled his shoulders on. Feeling a cooling sensation up your back you noticed the skin was sealing itself up to your neck, where only your son's face hung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hope you don't mind Davie.. mommy just needs some new ME time!\" You giggled to yourself as you pressed your head into his, completing the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was black for just a moment before you opened your eyes, seeing the room from David's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wow.. WOW my voice! I sound just like him! I can fool anybody\" you laughed very out of character.

I tried it on my own mum as a test dummy and wore her! It was pretty amazing you know, you should totally try it!\" You lie to her.

Why would you do that?\" she said feeling a little weird hearing what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? She's the perfect first test subject, all she does is stay at home anyway, might as well do something exciting with her.\" You tell her \"Besides, would you have me tried it on Claire or even Tina? It doesn't make real difference since I needed to try it on someone close to me without much effort being needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair dues David, it does make sense I guess. But who am I going to try it on? I mean I don't know if you'd be-..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\" you cut her off before she can finish in a slightly louder tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Ok... jeeze I was just pointing out that there\u2019s nobody in my house for me to try it on, unless you want to wait for my mom to get home?\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's always Jimmy...\" you snidely mention \"I mean, he's always pranking us right? And I bet you if I brought this pen to him that first thing he'd want to do is zap you or something.\" you tell her in an attempt coerce her into getting on track to what you want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... do you suggest we use it on Jimmy or something?\" she curiously asks, but you can see in her eyes your words have already convinced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I think we could use it on jimmy, or maybe even prank him by using it on his mom first, just in case you want to try it on a female first before trying it on a guy.\" You reason with her, but unbeknownst to her you didn't follow by that path and skipped straight into a guy\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes the pen that you left on the bed besides you as she sits on her bed with you now, slowly looking at it and the buttons. She looks up to you \"Ok David, I'm in, lets pay our pal Jimmy a visit and lets be the pranksters for once, maybe we can have a little fun from it don't you think!\" she says winking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh definitely Trish, definitely....\" you grin at her. \"Let's get going then. Also before we head out do you mind me holding onto the pens?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn..... Can\u2019t I just hold on to them till we get outside? I just want to get a feel for it in my hands you know, so when I zap Jimmy or his mum it feels more natural.\" she reasons<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok. Yeah sure Trish.\" You brush it off and let her hold on to it, hoping she won't do anything stupid with them, in the back of your head you hate it since you want full control over this all, but you need to win her trust and play it off cool. So you let her keep hold of them for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two both get up from her bed, walk out of her room, both get a drink from her kitchen and head to the door and ready to go outside. </span></div></div>",

You blush when you see David\u2019s deflated member thinking about how soon it'll be your dick to do with whatever you please, the very thought of this gets you slightly wet. Looking for a way into the skin you turn it backwards and see a slit spanning from the bottom of the spine to the top \"So this is how I get in then\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspect the skin further when you notice something strange about it, it feels like there\u2019s something else inside the skin of David, you put your hand inside and you can feel another layer inside David\u2019s skin, you begin to separate it from the David skin, seeing long brown hair start to stick out of the David suits back it gets you questioning \"Is...is this Tina inside here, or some other girl...?\" you think. Continuing to remove the skins you eventually pull out a larger female skin suit out of the David skin suit, you unfold it and throw it on the bed to where you can get a better look at who it is, to when you find out to your surprise it was David\u2019s mom \"MRS. ANDERSON!\" you shout out loud. \"Whoa...... what the...this is seriously freaky and unexpected....\" you say to yourself, why was David\u2019s mom wearing David? You thought to yourself. Maybe when David was doing whatever with his mom she must have gotten a hold of the pen, zapped him and wore him here. It's possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a mixture of disgust, confusion and even arousal you find yourself looking at the skins of your good friend David and his mom Mrs Anderson. \"Well, at least now I have a choice of who I can choose to wear...\" you say to yourself. And it's now even opened up many more things you can do, as David or As Mrs. Anderson. As David you could experience what it's like to be a guy for the first time, but as Mrs. Anderson you can live as an adult, access to spending money and your own household you're in charge of. And then there was still the possibility of including someone else in on this all, if that did happen you wouldn't make the mistake Mrs. Anderson made in giving someone else the pens so easily. \"So many possibilities.... so many options....\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one thing that got you curious, if you zapped a person wearing a skin and separated both, then is it possible to wear two skins at the same time? If there\u2019s one thing that you and David had on common is that you were both curious thinkers and like to learn about cool stuff, and this was exactly what you wanted to find out. Besides if you brought David or Mrs. Anderson back from being a skin it would just create problems for you, instead you theorised if it's possible to wear one skin over another, that way it saves you a bunch of work of figuring out what to do with either skin if you only have one on. That, and the thought of wearing David AND his mom at the same time made you strangely aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then I know what I'm going to do now...\" you say out loud. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And that involved putting the skins on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You grinned as you snatched David's skin first, admiring his hot body now that you could, you always wondered why he never went for a girl like yourself. Instead ge was with that bimbo Jessica, though credit was due to her because she was smart-ish, you guessed. You had already stripped your clothes off and proceeded by sliding your smaller body into David's, feeling his legs merge with yours as the moist sensation in your snatch turned to that of a growing hard on. You whimpered, not expecting it to feel so good. You bit your lip and stroked your new dick with your still petite hands before stopping with a devious smile. 'More time for that later' you thought asyou qquickly slipped in the rest of your slim athletic figure into his empty skin, feeling his skin and chest on his arms and legs fix to yours. You smiled and finished what you started, putting your head into David's and feeling his skin become one with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You opened your new eyes and eyed yourself, flexing and enjoying your new body only for the moment. You licked your lips and snagged Ms.Andersons skin now and repeated the process you had just done. You slipped your new David legs into what was now essentially 'your' mother since you were David. You noted the arousal and tight strain against your newest cock as you pushed it down into her skin, feeling the return of a moist pussy, but not your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You gasped and bounced in your current body giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Damn Ms.Anderson, with some workouts you are definitely a fine piece of ass for Davies.. oops.. I mean MY mom!\" You teased yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strutted to your mother's bedroom and borrowed some clothes that fit, your parents were almost identical in proportion but your own mother definitely wore more 'skimpy' clothing.

You shut your car door, starting it up and headed towards Jessica Hunts home. You'd been there once or twice to hang out so you remembered where she lived well enough. Again you ran the plan over in your head, to get in her home, feinting concern over 'Trish ' and 'David' and Jessica's well being, and then to simply zap her. You could then deceive Jess into thinking you're really David by stripping his mother off and pretending to ge her boyfriend. You bit your lip as you drove, the thought of fucking Jess with David's body got you wet. You were normally into men, but since you were IN a man you could make the exception. Besides Jessica was as you thought earlier; a sexy blonde bimbo type girl with some smarts. She was a cheerleader at the school you all attended and her cute face matched with her luscious body usually got her what she desired.. but not tonight you thought grinning. You slowly turned the street down her neighborhood and spotted her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You parked a few houses down the street to look unsuspecting and walked up the steps to her home, the clicking of heels the sound you emitted before gracefully knocking on her door. You heard faint noises inside and as the door opened, letting light on your stolen body you saw Jessica wearing some simple pj's and a black and pink U-scoop shirt. She was certainly looking cute for David tonight. 'Good for me' you thought inwardly grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh um.. Ms. Anderson.. I was expecting David, is he with you?\" She curiously asked folding her arms under her ample boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh no dear he'd left earlier before I came here. I actually wanted to chat with your mother if that's ok?\" You asked innocently. Maybe your choice in clothing wasn't as appealing you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh sure, come in. MOM! It's Ms. Anderson, David's mom, she wants to talk to you..\" Jess said as she startled heading upstairs as you entered the home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh sure, Marie! Hi! Don't you look.. festive tonight, come in to the kitchen and we'll chat\" she said smiling as she gestured you with her hand. You smiled and waved goodbye to Jessica and followed Ms. Hunt into her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok, time to start the show' you thought feeling rather excited and aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So.. what can I do you for dear? Please have a seat\" she spoke smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh no worries.. it will be quick. It's just about David and Jessica tis all\" you said holding a grin back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think they're.. well you know do you? I did talk to Jess about protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure they gave been like most teens do.. no I'm here to make sure they get some fun tonight!\" You spoke giggling as you pulled the pen from your small purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg your pardon.. what do you mean Marie?\" She asked dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Without pausing you turned smiling a kinky way and zapped Ms. Hunt in her chair without so much as a peep of struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm perfect!

Strong jawbone, green eyes, long brown hair. David got many of his features from her. You peel your neck apart and watch as her face slackens, before the world goes dark, only to reveal your face above a paler body.<br>\r\nYou breath deeply, shaking your hair out. Pulling Marie's face back on, you plan your next outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, sweetie?\" You call, opening the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's laying on her bed, scrolling through her phone, headphones plugged in.

David picks up the pen off the floor after you dropped it and stands above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish?!\" He exclaims at you, although hushed. He doesn't seem to want to alert anyone else in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-David please..\" You moan in pain, holding your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecollecting your wit, you rub your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, I can explain, just don't hit me again, please!\" You beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are these things?

Why would I want to wear my family like suits?\" he asks <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well because it's fun to experience what it's like as someone else, it's a rush and also opens up so many routes to you, plus you get to see what it's like being not only someone else but the opposite gender and older or even younger depending who you wear of course.\" you tell him. He lets go of you finally and you step back near to Claire\u2019s bed still naked  next to Claire\u2019s skin while David stands nearer to her door next to Marie\u2019s skin and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so huh..... tell me Trish how many people have you worn then? Since you were my mum and from the looks of it looking to be my little sister how do I know you haven't been everyone in my family...?\" he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I found the pen thing, I decided to try it on my mother Erna of course, then while I was her  decided to change to your mum Marie as she visited my mother while I was wearing her and, well I was curious and she's pretty hot you know David... and then that's it really... I guess you're right I wanted to change to your little sister Claire but that's only because I wanted to surprise you and let you in on this I swear!\" you lie to him. In fact it's been the complete opposite, it was Marie who originally had the pen while wearing her sons skin, to which it led to you zapping him since you wanted to wear him but upon discovering Marie inside of David you decided to wear them both to Jessica\u2019s house. After ditching Marie\u2019s skin you had your fun with Jess and David which led to sex to you wearing Jessica\u2019s skin, after all of that you restored jess and her mom, then you slipped back into 'ol Marie here and here you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hoped your lies could get you out of the danger you were in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, just as long as you didn't wear the likes of my girlfriend or me then I guess I can let it slide to see what this whole thing is about\" he says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to bring a smirk to your face after seeing David saying that while unaware that you've done both of those things you manage to keep it together \"Ok well test out one of the skin suits then David to see that I'm telling the truth, and think about all the fun we can have.\" you say to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll test out one of the skins, but this doesn't mean I'm properly into it like you are Trish.\" he sternly tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him you see him thinking about who to choose while still holding the pen, you want it back but can't do anything too hasty. Eventually he decides to wear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quickly you get up rather than sitting on the floor with Mrs. Anderson's cushiony ass and quickly catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.... that was close... guess I've got to deal with mom\u2019s skin now.\" you say out loud in your stolen voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully pick up your mothers skin and go upstairs to try and figure out what to do now. You decide to go inside your mother\u2019s bedroom since it's bigger and lay out her skin on her bed. \"Right, time to add mom to the stack.\" you thought to yourself. You began undressing her skin from her work clothes, starting with her blouse, then her work skirt, then you start working her black tights off until she\u2019s just in her underwear. \"Damn mom, I never noticed until now but you're pretty sexy. Heck I'd even call you a milf...\" you say in Marie\u2019s voice in an aroused tone. Finishing getting her underwear of her skin you now stare at the naked skin suit of your mother Erna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, how am I going to do this then...\" you think to yourself. Now that your moms a skin you wonder how you'll be dealing with her, you could always wear her skin over your already existing David and Mrs Anderson skins making you Erna O\u2019Neil, you could still technically continue with your plan since Erna does know Mrs Hunt too, so you could still continue with the first step of the plan as your mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have an idea what to do and how to still continue your sexy plan, you start undressing Mrs Andersons body creating a pile of the clothes you were wearing in her body on the bed next to your mothers skin. You pick up your mother\u2019s body \"It's still warm.....guess I'm going to be you now mommy..\" you think to yourself, the very thought of it makes you wet, you start to turn it around and begin to start putting it on over Mrs. Anderson body. \"Time for some milf on milf action!\" you cheekily say out loud as you begin to place your right leg into your mothers, same with the left leg pulling your motherly thick thighs over your own mothers thick thighs eventually pulling your mothers wide hips over your own milf tier hips. You notice your wet Mrs Anderson pussy being replaced with your own mothers much more dry but still mature pussy \"Looks like moms been keeping it all neat down here..\" you quietly say to yourself as you notice instead of the messy bush Mrs Anderson had you now have a nicely shaven bush in the shape of a rectangle. Continuing to put your mother on you work your arms into your mothers until you've got her set of manicured hands rather than Mrs Anderson\u2019s plain motherly hands. Pulling her shoulders over your own you begin to stuff you big but saggy Marie tits into where your mothers own big but saggy breasts would be as you felt no change when her torso became your own. \"Now just the head\" you said out loud as you then grab your mothers drooping face as it hangs off your neck like a backwards hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Placing your stolen face into the skin you begin to align the eyes with your own and quickly skip up the zipper making sure not to snag any of your long hair on the zipper \"Guess these are the problems of girls wearing other girls then hehe..\" you giggled to yourself in your new voice \"Whoa.... my voice.... it's my mom\u2019s now.... this is so fucking cool.\" you grinned as you were now fully Erna O\u2019Neil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, time to get back on track.\" you say to yourself with a smirk as you begin redressing in your mothers clothes that you were once wearing as David\u2019s mom.

Oh my god..... What in god\u2019s name just happened...\" you say as you hold your hand over your mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears that Marie has deflated into some sort of skin heap from the looks of it, it is quite a shock to you at first, but when you calm down you collect yourself and walk over to Marie's skin. Picking it up you pick it up in a manner to were the clothes don't fall off the skin as you notice they're barely hanging. You then grab your barrel bag as well as the strange pen thing Marie was holding before and slowly walk up the stairs as if you're carrying a bomb of some sort, being gentle with each step trying to make sure no clothes slip off, that and you're in heels since you've only just gotten back from work. You arrive in your bedroom and lay out the skin on your bed and place the bag on the bed too, but decide to place the pen on your drawer. Getting out of your heels you're still wearing your blouse and work skirt as well as your black tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let\u2019s start by taking MY clothes back shall we Marie?\" you annoyingly say to the empty skin. You easily work the clothes from her lifeless skin \"Damn, these were some of my best clothes too, bitch....\" you bitterly say knowing that the skin can't reply. You and Marie have been friends for a while so seeing her do such a thing has left you with a stinging feeling of betrayal. Once the skin if fully naked you place it back on the bed, put the clothes you took of it back and then curiously open up the barrel bag to see what was inside. To your confusion you see a touch screen phone with a cover as well as a full set of teenage boys clothes inside it \"What? What was she doing with these clothes in here...? I'm so confused...\" you say out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously you take the phone and open it up, looking to the flap of the phone cover you can see some cards slipped into the slits as well as a piece of paper. You begin to start investigating. Starting with the top card, it's a bank card in the name of David Anderson \"Marie\u2019s son.....? So that must mean these are his clothes. But why are they here?\" you think to yourself. Putting the bank card back you quickly flip through the other cards, student card, ID card and library card all in David\u2019s name \"Guess it's safe to assume this is his phone too\" you quietly say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Last but not least you find a piece of paper that\u2019s been folded quite compactly to fit inside the phone holder slit, you unfold the paper to find out it's an instruction sheet for some sort of device \"Are these instructions to that pen...? Is that how Marie turned into this empty skin? Seems like it.\" you think to yourself after reading them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's time to explore and figure out what\u2019s what.\" you say to yourself out loud confidently. You start by picking up the skin of Marie and inspecting it \"Huh, her bodies not too bad, but mines better.... she\u2019s also pretty heavy for a skin suit\" you dismiss to yourself. You look around for the skin for an opening, you find one at her back spanning from the top of her spine to the bottom of where the tailbone would be. \"Guess if I'm going to put a skin suit on it'd probably be better fully naked rather than fully clothed\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly stripping out of your work clothes and taking off your underwear you leave them in a pile beside your bed. Moving your hand inside of the skin suit of Marie you notice how it feels like there\u2019s something inside of it, maybe that's why it felt heavier than you thought it would? Tugging on this thing inside the skin suit you keep trying to separate it from Marie's skin until eventually you begin pulling out what looks like another skin \"Marie was being worn by someone else? Thank god that wasn't actually her wearing my clothes....\" you say in relief knowing that your good friend didn't do what you suspected her of doing. When you fully pull out the skin you notice at first it's a male of some sort not too sure who, so you lay it out on the bed next to Marie's skin suit. \"DAVID?! David Anderson!? Why?...\" You're shocked to say the least, David was wearing his own mother, and went inside YOUR house and wore YOUR clothes on her body. \"Guess that explains why his clothes and phone were in my bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you collect yourself after finding your daughters good friend was wearing his own mother in your house you decide to open up David\u2019s skin to see if there\u2019s anyone else in there in the off chance that there happens to be a person wearing a person wearing another person. You've had enough surprises for one day. So carefully inspecting David\u2019s skin to your surprise you found yet another skin inside it, this time you were sure you knew who it was, even though you hoped it wouldn't who that person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to your surprise you end up pulling out your own daughter\u2019s skin out of David Anderson\u2019s skin. \"TRISH? Jesus, why were you wearing two of the Andersons family?!\" You say out loud. After confirming that there were no other skins to be found you organized everything in your room. In front of you on your bed lay 3 skin suits. Marie Anderson, David Anderson and your daughter Trish O\u2019Neil. Knowing you can wear the skins and become that person through the information from the instructions and what you've seen already, you decide on what you think should now be done. You think about restoring one of the skins somehow, or maybe even taking a break from this craziness and trying out something new. Since you couldn't deny the idea of it did seem appealing and you now have 3 choices to pick from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Standing fully naked in your room you eventually decide to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So instead I'll just wear you to get close enough to her then I'll be able to wear her and have her as you called them 'MILF tits', heck man, you're not wrong they are pretty awesome, and soon they'll be mine to play with.\" he told you evilly \"Hey don't take this personally man, just think yourself as the middle man in all of this.\" he then raises the pen and fires it at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you could remember is Jimmy\u2019s evil little grin before everything goes to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Jimmy Wilsons POV* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha nice!\" you say out loud, closing the door in case your mother sees what you're getting up to. Quickly you scamper over to David\u2019s deflated skin and throw it on the bed \"Ok David lets make this quick!\" you murmur to yourself. Quickly you strip your best friend of his clothes until he's naked. You then start stripping yourself until you and your best friends skin are both naked \"It almost feels awkward what I'm doing, but the things I do for fun....\" you dismiss to yourself. Picking him up you prepare to enter into his skin when you notice what looks like another layer inside \"Well well, what\u2019s this now...?\" you think to yourself. Continuing to try and remove this second layer of skin you notice some long feminine brown hair fall out \"Tina? Or....wait no way...\" you said out loud contemplating who it could be that seems to have worn your best friend to your house and shown you this pen, you had an idea of who it could be and continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you pull out the skin suit of what looked like a larger older female, you lay it out on your bed and you look at who it is \"NO FREAKING WAY! MRS. ANDERSON?!\" There right in front of you was the deflated skin of David\u2019s milf mother Marie Anderson \"Damn, and I thought I was going to need Davie over here to get this fine piece of ass, turns out it came to me haha!\" you laughed heartily to yourself. \u201cOrganizing the skins on your bed laid your best friend David Anderson (who probably has no memory of coming here since his mother was wearing him the whole time) and his MILF of a mom Marie Anderson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, no time to waste, so many possibilities now. Heck I could just wear Mrs. A over here and not leave my room for the rest of the day\" You thought to yourself, the very thought of masturbating with her milf body has gotten you rock hard since you're still standing in your room naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could make a decision you hear your mother calling you \"Jimmy! Come and help me write up a shopping list so I don't forget your favourite snacks this time!\" she yelled from down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no! It's fine mom! Just write down whatever!\" you hastily replied since she caught you at a bad time, standing naked rock hard with two skin suits in your room and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking Mr.! Get down here now!\" she says impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"jeeze, she\u2019s going to be a problem, guess I'll need to sort this out.\" you say with a grin as you pick up the pen and run down stairs still butt naked with a hard on and pen in your hand. You eventually stand outside of the kitchen and your mother is writing something down while talking to you when she hears you are near by before she turns around and notices you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally Jimmy, you pried yourself from that game of yours, you can start by- WHAT THE HELL JIMMY! WHY ARE YOU NA-...\" is the last thing should could say before you zap her into a skin suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mommy, but Jimmy\u2019s being a very very naught boy at the minute and needs you not to hassle him.\" you say in a giddy manner to yourself as you pick up your mothers skin suit. Bringing your mothers skin suit upstairs you quickly strip her of her sundress and underwear and lay her out on the bed next to the other skin suits. \"Just like I said, her bod isn't near as good as 'ol Marie's over here..\" you quietly say to yourself while examining your mothers naked skin in front of you. It isn't often you see your own mom naked and you notice how much like yourself is pale, her thighs aren't as thick as most moms, her breasts aren't as big as Marie\u2019s and her ass isn't anything special either. But if need be you'd still wear her and see what fun you could get out of it, just as an experiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh peace and quiet finally\" you say as you place the pen on your gaming chair. \"Now I can figure out what to do...\" you ponder. You thought about what to do with the other 2 skin suits when you would be wearing one of them, sure you can masturbate with whatever skin in the pile you wanted to but if you wanted to keep one on and go out what would you do with the other two? Restoring them seemed like a decent idea but a selfish side of you didn't want that now you see them as merely skin suits that you now own and are yours.Is it possible to wear more than one skin at a time? As in one over another skin? It was definitely an idea you thought about testing, if true it could prove very convenient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet someone in on it maybe? Trish was still about and you're confidant if you brought David back he'd be thankful seeming as he mom turned him into a suit to start with. \"Choices and more choices...\" you mumbled to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually decide to...</span></div></div>",

You start to worry if he stupidly somehow got turned into a skin suit and Julia\u2019s putting him on now or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Jimmy...\" you quietly say out loud. You begin to slowly walk outside of Jimmy\u2019s room and then as you start going down the stairs, as you take the first step down you begin to hear what sounds like faint moaning noises in the background. \"They're definitely female....\" you think to yourself. As you make your way down stairs you slowly creep to the outside of the kitchen, being able to hear the moans more frequently and louder. Until you peer in to the sight of Julia Wilson stark naked sitting in the dinner table legs spread open and masturbating with what looks like to be a cucumber..? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is definitely a strange site, and even though you personally don't know Jimmy very well at all, you know that he is a perverted boy since every time he's been at your house to visit David he's always trying to sneak a look at your ass or is staring at your breasts when he thinks you're not looking, but you know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this, probably should have expected something like this to happen, he didn't even call you to let you know he'd suited her or anything, he just skips straight to masturbating in his new body. And pretty quickly from the looks of it, you can see Julia\u2019s blue and white sundress and underwear in all different directions of the kitchen messily, and judging from the pace at which Jimmy\u2019s thrusting in that cucumber he's nearly done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-OH! Oh hey dude!\" He says in his horny breathless mother\u2019s voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey man, I errrr, I see you've already gotten acquainted with your new body then? Also see! I was right about the pen after all.\" you tell him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy takes the cucumber out of his new soaked pussy and starts playing with his new mediocre sized breasts \"Yeah dude, I just couldn't help myself you know.... I mean my mom\u2019s body isn't too bad so what the heck right\" he tells you in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Julia naked pleasuring herself has caused a tent in your pants, Jimmy notices \"Ohhhh, getting excited there Mr.?\" he cheekily says. You blush and then decide to.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You and Julia have been friends personally for as long as David and Jimmy have been friends, and you pondered on the idea of bringing Julia in on this idea, and possibly even getting her to wear her son, just like you did with David. If there\u2019s something you two have in common is that you are both stuck in repetitive cycles in your lives, work and home, more so work for her as it's only her that supports Jimmy and pays for the bills etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's give this a shot...\" you quietly say out loud to yourself in your male voice. If worst came to worst you'd have to just quickly zap her before she could do anything that'd blow it for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back down the stairs you calmly stroll into the kitchen expecting Julia to be reading a book with a tea or coffee, as you arrive you are not wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey David. Why aren't you up stairs with Jimmy?...\" she curiously asks you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Julia, I'm not actually David, I'm Marie. I know you're going to be very confused with what I'm telling you right now, but I found a device which lets you turn people into skin suits that you can then wear and become them.\" you explain to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha oh dearie, has Jimmy been filling your head with his sci-fi nonsense again?\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't believe me Julia, so to show you I'm telling the truth I'll need to show you myself..\" you sternly tell her. You begin to get both of your hands and start digging them into the back of your head until you can find the zipper burrowed from under your David skin, pulling it out with ease you bring the zipper down to the bottom of your neck, you then begin to pull your real face out of David\u2019s by holding the skin at the back firmly and moving your real neck and face backwards, also letting your long brown hair flow from the skin suit as you do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia is speechless as she witnesses Marie Anderson's son David Anderson open up his neck to reveal the head of Marie Anderson your close friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I told you it's real Julia...\" you said collectively in your real voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia finds this to be.... <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

This causes him to jump up from his chair and gets him shocked until he turns around to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus mum you scared me! What the hell is wrong with you? And why are you pointing some sort of board pointer at me?\" He frantically replies to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy needs to have some fun now Jimmy, and for that she needs her little man...\" you devilishly say to him before you fire the black pen at him reducing him to little more than a pile of skin and clothes. \"Perfect, now to try him on..\" you think to yourself. Throwing the pen on his bed you also turn off his PS4 so you can calmly wear him without hearing annoying video game sounds in the background. You then pick up your sons deflated skin and lay it on his bed so you can begin to strip him of his clothes. Marie already told you about the little details you need to know from how to get in and the fact that you need to be naked to wear the skin. After you finish taking off his boxers you're met by the site of your own sons deflated dick \"Mmmmm\" you quietly say out loud as you bite your lip thinking about how soon that penis will be your own to do with whatever you feel like, the very thought of this made you slightly horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on you begin to strip yourself of your own clothes, which was just a plain light blue and white sundress, you quickly get out of it and then unclasp your bra to let out your mediocre sized breasts \"Ugh...\" you said at a low tone, you hated your body almost, since it wasn't what most boys would class as when thinking about MILF's. No matter, you were about to gain a new body and experience with it. Throwing down your panties you quickly grab your sons deflated skin, flip it around and begin to place your right leg into your sons. You noticed how your legs didn't struggle as much as most women your age would when putting on people younger than them since you didn't really have thick thighs, placing in your left leg you notice how your motherly legs have now become slightly toned male legs. As you pull Jimmy\u2019s skin over your hips you notice how strange the feeling is of having your pussy suddenly disappear and now feeling a penis in your crotch area just hanging about \"Whoa.... it's all gone, and now I have my young man\u2019s package...amazing...\" you say to yourself. Continuing on you begin to place your pale feminine arms into your sons much stronger arms, seeing his fingers wiggle when you have slotted them fully in, you do the same for the other arm and then begin to place his chest over your own, noticing how much of a strange feeling it is to feel your breast one moment and then see them squeezed out of existence and replaced by a male chest. You quickly zip up Jimmy\u2019s skin until it gets to his neck before you complete the process \"Good buy Julia! Hello Jimmy!\" you say out loud as you don your sons face over your own and finish zipping up the zipper. After a few seconds you open up your eyes to see the process has been completed, you are now your son Jimmy Wilson. \"Amazing!\" you say in his voice \"Whoa, I have his voice, this is going to take some getting used to hehe\" you giggle in a girly manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I'm ready now Marie!\" you call out to your friend wearing her son <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Marie Anderson POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Jimmy call out loud and using you first name, indicating to you that it worked and she has successfully donned her own son\u2019s skin, just like you did. Walking into the room you see your 'friend' Jimmy getting dressed into some clothes that are more suitable for going outside. \"So Julia, or should I now say Jimmy.... how do you like your new male form...?\" you ask her as she\u2019s begins to stroke her new member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm I love it, I feel like just playing with my new toy right here right now.\" she tells you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice seeing that has caused a tent in your pants, you blush \"Now Julia, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves now, there\u2019s still more we need to do before the real fun can begin\" you reason with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I'll leave it for now, but I\u2019m just dying to try this dick out\" she excitedly replies to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finishes getting dressed and hands you the pens, you two head down stairs, get something to drink and then prepare to head out next, there were two houses left to visit. \"Jessica\u2019s house and Erna\u2019s house next Jimmy, so be on your best behaviour ok.\" you wink at your friend inside her son\u2019s skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open the front door, pen your pocket you decide the first house you two visit would be.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her body then begins to deflate and fold in on its self until the only thing left you can see is a pile of your mother\u2019s clothes and skin all messily sitting on her bed next to her still open laptop and the black pen that did it all. You stand there obviously shocked as you've just witnessed your mother being turned into just skin from a pen, you close the door behind you in case one of your sisters sees what\u2019s going in, since you can hear noise coming from one of their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the skin pile and pick it up by her shoulders, the clothes she is wearing are barely hanging on to the skin, her deflated head hanging behind her body. You have an urge to see more of this newly created skin suit, you take off all the clothes your mothers skin still had on her was little ease and then you hold her naked skin in front of you, you blush as you see her deflated breasts. Looking for an opening into the skin you flip it backwards to notice an opening in the back, a thin slit spanning from the top of the tailbone to the back of the head where the top of the spine would be. Opening the slit you then decide to test whether it's real by putting your arm into your mothers right arm. You roll up the sleeve of your denim shirt (since it'd be pretty uncomfortable to try and wear it while still clothed) you then slowly start putting your hand and eventually your arm into the still warm skin, it feels strange at first, but the more you put it in the more it fits and moulds to fit perfectly. You were strangely surprised how well it was fitting until you eventually slid you hand into her hand, it then occurs to you that not only is it some sort of other layer but it actually has become your own arm, you can't feel your original right arm but instead can feel your mothers one, it feels softer since it's hairless and the lack of muscle in it instead it's been replaced by a doughy motherly flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.....\" you quietly say to yourself as you place your left hand and new right hand together and notice the difference between them. Your right arm has become your mother\u2019s right arm. \"So it's really real then\" You think to yourself. You then quickly slid your right arm out of your mothers skin and notice how quickly it turned back to your own. With excitement you then quickly begin to strip your clothes off and throw them into a pile just besides your mother\u2019s bed next to the pile of her clothes. You then pick up her skin and open it up, you confidently slip your right leg into hers, noticing how your leg starts to take shape into your mothers thick thighs and eventually your feet turn into her smaller but older feet with painted toe nails. \"This is so cool....\" you whisper to yourself as you continue. Slipping your left leg into her left leg and eventually pulling up her ass and hips over your own, you feel a strange feeling happen in your lower region, a type of feeling that feels like somethings now gone. And with a quick look you notice your package is now gone and replace by your mothers pussy, which has a slight bush above it. \"Oh god....this is freaky...\" you say feeling nervous but at the same time slightly thrilled. You also notice your ass has now been replaced by your mothers mature bubble butt, you give it a quick feel and begin to get slightly aroused. Wasting no more time you pick up your mothers torso which has been drooping in front of you and place your right arm into her own and then getting her shoulder and throwing it over your own, the same for the left arm. When the arms are in you notice the torso automatically sticks to your chest inflating your mothers breasts back to their big but slightly saggy size. With only the head left dangling on your chest, the brown hair messily covering your new breasts you zip up the zipper until it stops just below your neck. \"Well, time to finish what I started\" you confidently say. Taking your mothers face in front of you begin to place it over your own, you match up your own eyes with the empty eye sockets and zip up the rest of the zipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a strange tingle and then open your eyes to notice it doesn't feel like you've got your mothers skin over your face anymore. \"It worked!\" you say out loud in your new mothers voice \"I even have her voice too... this is so cool!\" Physically you are now Marie Anderson, but you're still yourself mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the pen for the bed you look at it with amazement \"Looks like I'm going to have a ton of fun with this.\" you said mischievously with your mother\u2019s voice.

Starting with her black matching underwear you slip on her panties and then put on her lace bra, which proved difficult since your new breasts where quite big and slightly saggy, not to mention you've never put on a bra before, eventually you put it on.

You still have a nice view of your impressive mature cleavage thanks to the tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip your mothers flats on and think about what to do now with your new body \"Ok I think I'll......\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trish\u2019s text reads \"Cool! Can't wait haha! :D\". Trish has always been a close friend to you, and you know it'd be interested to let a female friend in on this pen as it'd be interesting to see what a girl would suggest doing with it since you know what most guys would do. And lastly the text from Jessica reading \"You free today? Got some money to spend, we can go grab lunch if you want? x\". You haven't seen her in 2 days and just remembered you did promise to get lunch with her when she gets some money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of the possible ways to go about this you decide to text....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mother was walking around the house doing different chores like she normally does. After several minutes you suddenly hear your mother calling Tina from upstairs. <br>\r\n\"Tina! Could you come here for a second, I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina rolls her eyes in annoyance and slowly gets up from the chair and starts walking up the stairs. \"What is it now..?\" She mumbles to herself. <br>\r\nYou let her walk upstairs before you decide to follow her. As you walk up the stairs you hear your mother's voice coming from Tina's bedroom which has the door standing ajar. Quickly you move to the wall and lean your head towards the door crack and peer inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Tina is standing bent over one of her drawers and seems to be looking for something.<br>\r\n \"I'm pretty sure it's not here mom... I swear I haven't...\" Is all she manages to say before you see your mother take the mysterious pen from her pocket and aims it at her.<br>\r\nYou hear a weak buzzing sound coming from the pen as she presses the button on it. The next second is the most unreal moment in your life, as you see your sister suddenly freeze before she falls crumpled to the ground, like all the bones in her body disappeared. You sister lays on the floor, looking more like a deflated blow-up doll with clothes or a.... costume!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Holy shit! It's real!</span> You think to yourself as you see your mother quickly picks up Tina's now deflated body and lays it on the bed. She turns her head, quickly looking around in the room and then to the door. You quickly take a step back and pull your head from the door crack, praying she didn't see you. Standing like glued to the wall closing your eyes you suddenly hear the door closes next to you. \"Phew\" You say in relief, as it doesn't seem she noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and slowly move towards the door again and try to peek trough the keyhole.Your vision isn't perfect but you manage to see whats going on.<br>\r\nYou see your mother holds up your Tina's deflated body, now without any clothes. Her face is expression less and her eye sockets and mouth is completely empty and hollow. Suddenly you see your mother lays Tina's skin back in the bed and eagerly undress herself, not keeping her eyes away from the skin for a second. You remove yourself from the keyhole for a second, not really interested in seeing your mother undress herself but your curiosity makes you peek inside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your now completely nude mother standing over the skin smiling as she studies it up and down. She reach down for the skin and turns it around so the back faces her. You notice a big opening on Tina's back, starting in the back of her head and all the way down to her butt. Your mother widens the opening on the skin's back with her hands and puts her feet into it. She now stands with both feet inside the skin and pulls the skin further up to her hips, just like putting on a pair of jeans. The weird thing is that her legs now looks just like Tina's, the shape and length hasn't changed even though your mother is shorter and is slightly wider built. She continues to drag the skin up her body and then puts her hands inside as well. You can see she struggles a bit with placing the fingers correctly into your sister's deflated ones, but within seconds she manage to get them in place. She then starts to study her new hands in amazement by wiggling her new young fingers in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but be amazed yourself by the sight that meets you. Your mother is standing on the floor with her face on top of your sister Tina's well trained body and with her face dangling lifeless over the chest. She feels her new body up and down, clearly enjoying every second of it. Suddenly she grabs your sisters face and pulls it over her own like a mask. She continues to work hes hands around the face trying to fit it right. You can't help but gasp as you see Tina's face shapes perfectly over your mother's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly turns to face the mirror in the room and forms a wide smile on her new face as she sees the reflection. \"Perfect..\" She says and strokes her cheeks. She turns around again and grabs a black dress from Tina's closet. She waste no time an quickly puts in on, she runs her hands down her new curves to make the dress fit perfectly. She admires herself a last time in the mirror before she picks up the pen. She looks around in the room before she opens one of the drawers and hides the pen underneath some clothes inside, she then close the drawers and heads your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly get to your feet and are about to head down the hallway when the door suddenly opens and you stand face to face with Tina's body. <br>\r\n\"Oh... Hi David.\" She says. Unsure about what to say and a little shocked you just stare at her in silence. <br>\r\nYour mother frowns at you with Tina's face. \"If anyone asks i'm heading outside.\" She says and walks downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she planning? And what the fuck did just happend? You think to yourself as you find yourself standing alone in the hallway. A lot of questions was running trough your head when you suddenly remembered the pen in Tina's drawer. You run into her room and pick up the pen from the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....</span></div></div>",

David!\" Your mom calls your name on the phone. \"Look David, I'm sorry, I'm almost home, we'll talk about this later.\"<br>\r\n\"Mom, where's Nick?\" You asked, suddenly realising that your older brother hasn't been home this whole time.<br>\r\n\"We'll talk about this later.\" She repeats, and hangs up the phone.<br>\r\nOnly this time the voice is Tina's.<br>\r\nThe shower sprays warm water over you, your slim fingers rub around Claire's eyes slowly as you feel yourself relax.<br>\r\nYour fingers run through your long red hair, and you stare at the holder that contains all the soap and shampoo in Claire's bathroom.<br>\r\nYou slowly fall to the floor, your back sliding against the wet shower wall, your hands cover your face.<br>\r\nYour lips quivering, your mind flashes through thoughts of what you saw and did, and the possibilities.<br>\r\nYou run a hand over Claire's stomach, her female hormones affecting you, and you never even noticed.<br>\r\n\"C-Claire, I'm so sorry..\" You almost beg Claire to forgive you, you don't know if she can hear you or not.<br>\r\nYou feel rage burn through you, and you dig your nails into Claire's cheek.<br>\r\nTrying to pull her skin off, you succeed, loosening areas and tearing large pieces out of her face, however there is no blood.<br>\r\nIt's like she's made of rubber, and that rubber is like skin.<br>\r\nYou feel strange sticky liquid ooze down your face, from the places you've torn Claire's face from yours.<br>\r\nYou look at your hands, and see the pieces of flesh, you begin to scream.<br>\r\nClaire's voice garbled with your David voice, the mixture sounds inhumane and almost demonic.<br>\r\nYour hand reaches around as Claire's back bursts open, and you rend her skin from yours, it peels off your flesh slowly.<br>\r\nYou scramble to tear her skin from your lower body, and when you do, you pelt the entire heap at the opposite end of her shower, scrambling to get away.<br>\r\nThe skin fills with water and you can see water dripping from her eyes like tears.<br>\r\nYou open your eyes after a few minutes, and the water covering the shower floor is tainted with a green ooze.<br>\r\nAfter rubbing your face, you realize you're also covered in the ooze, and it's leaking from Claire's skin.<br>\r\nYou scream loudly, trying to scrub the ooze off and wash it down the drain.<br>\r\nSucceeding, the green ooze is only present from Claire's skin, as you look down you see a small stream coming from under her legs.<br>\r\nYou stare at the skin, wiping your face.</span></div></div>",

It keeps springing out as if it knows what you have planned. With a grunt you finally manage to yank the suit over your crotch and gasp as your junk instantly vanishes.

You can hear the rumbling of the washing machine, the sound is deafening as it bounces off the walls, you squeeze through the door your fat belly fighting you, as if it knows that soon it will be disappearing, for a short time anyway. Over the sound of the vibrating machines you hear the sound of the ricked stairs struggling to support your weight, as you descend you spot your lovely wife with her back turned to you. You don't want to zap her yet, you wouldn't want to miss so you step on to the cool concrete and approach her. You can smell the washing power and Marie's perfume but some thing else lingers in the air, it doesn't smell like damp but what would you know you've not been down here in years. Your wife is folding clothes, her focus set entirely on the task, it's hot outside but the heat of the summer hasn't reached the basement yet so why is a bead of sweat running down your wife's neck. As you watch it slid down you realize that her face is very red and that out of the corner of her eyes she must be able to see you but she is pretending not to see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused by this behaviour, does she hate the way you look so much that she doesn't want to look at you until she has too? You knew you'd gotten fatter over the years without noticing, until someone at the office party refused to believe that a smoking hot milf like Marie would be marriage to a fatso like you, it was then you really saw in the mirror what you'd become, what everyone else saw. You'd started to work really hard to lose weight but you'd also notice the gap that'd grow over the years between you and Marie, a gap that'd grown not just because of the weight gain but something else. You'd searched online for something that could help you understand what Marie felt, what could help close that gap, something that could fix your sex life, that answer came in the two pens now in your sweaty fingers. You reached out to touch her face, an angelic face, you loved her so much but as you did you saw her shudder like she was repulsed by your slovenly form. You almost cried, it was to late, she already hated you, you hung you head in shame although your double chins stopped you hanging your face to low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to leave when you caught that smell again, it was some how familiar, it was a smell you hadn't smelt in a long time but now you recognised you could not get it out of your nose. It was the smell of a sex goddesses pussy in heat, you turned back around and saw you wife shudder, a shudder that seemed to originate from her crotch, you lifted the black pen and zapped her. Marie's body crumbled and fell to the floor a second behind the dildo that had been vibrating away in her tight love hole. You picked up Marie's skin and shook the clothes that still hung to her deflated skin off, her blank eyeless face looked back at you, as you stood their you began to realize why Marie spent so much time down here. No one came down here, the noise, the vibrating machines, the ease of cleaning any clothes that got sweaty, being able to see anyone open the door before they could see in this was the perfect secret masturbating room. Now all You had to do was wear your wife's skin, zap your self with the brown pen giving you all her memories and bingo your marriage was fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into your wife was easier said that done, the large hole in the back of her skin allowed you to pull your legs down into hers, helped by the fact that Marie's toned legs were quite large due to all the exercise but the hard bit came after you tugged her hips on. Again her lovely large ass helped fit your much larger behind in but then you had to say goodbye to your prick, when you'd been young in had been the biggest in the locker room now it'd been swallowed by the layers of fat that rolled from your body in every direction. You thought about for another second before heaving Marie's scrunched up skin in below your belly, you immediately felt what Marie felt just before you zapped her. It was like nothing you'd ever felt before, it was like a need to be filled, to be touched, to sink into pleasures like no other, you tried to bend down to pick up the dildo still vibrating no the floor but your fat belly stopped you and then the feeling was gone. It was replaced by a dull tingling, you wiped the sweat running from your face, you now understood why Marie hadn't remove the dildo from her needy pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long fight to get you belly into Marie, at least over half an hour that meant no quick suiting up for you if you needed to get into a skin, not that you would be doing it again this was a one time thing then the pens get put in a safe place. It involved a lot of swearing, shouting, pulling, heaving, squashing, forcing but eventually your fat belly was gone, it'd hurt a lot and for a few moments you thought Marie might rip but she didn't, you hoped you'd be better at it next time, not that there would be a next time but if there was you thought you might be able to do it a bit quicker now you knew the skin was tight but didn't seem able to rip. Marie's tits came next and you were surprised to see that your man boobs were bigger than hers impressive knockers. You were so excited about how different your body now felt you didn't pause before you pulled on Marie's face and hair, it was dark for a few second before you realized you had your eyes closed. You opened them to a whole new you, you felt the neediness of your pussy increase and your nipples stand on end, you really did want that dildo inside of you but should you first zap yourself with the brown memory pen?                                                                    </span></div></div>",

Your vision dims and just as you think you are about to pass out the pain abruptly stops. You take a deep shuddering breath and gasp again as you feel heavy weights shifting on your chest.

The heavy weight moving on your chest, the way your hips sway with each step.  You can't wait to explore all these new sensations in more detail.  But right now, its time to act like Lilly.  Time to act like this is all normal.  As you approach Claire's open door, you put on Lilly's best smile.  \"Hey girlfriend.  You about ready to go?\" you call out.

Is that your beach bag over there?\" you ask pointing behind her.  \"Yep.\" she responds as she turns to grab it.  Now is the time you decide, and quickly aim the pen at her.  Pressing the button you watch as once again a sixteen year old girl turns into a pile of clothes and skin, just waiting to be worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door quietly, you knock, once, loudly.

Walking in right behind him is your wife, Marie, and she looks pissed.  \"Sorry dad.\" David says, eyes down, \"She walked up behind me while I was watching the video.\"  Marie, still wearing her disapproving glare, looks over at Claire's deflated skin, then back to you.  Normally you would be slightly taller than your wife, but in Lilly's sixteen year old body, you are forced to look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paul, my God, what were you thinking?  How could you do something so stupid?  Don't you think about consequences at all?  Now we have to bring David into this as well.\" she almost shouts.  \"Honest dear,\" you begin, still marveling at using Lilly's body and voice, \"I'm so sorry I didn't come to you first.  I was just so excited to try them out.\"  David has been staring at Marie for a few seconds before he interjects, \"Mom!  You already knew about it?\"  Marie turns back to him explaining, \"Of course I did.  I was the first one your father told when he found the Costume Set online.  And I thought I was the ONLY on who was going to know.\" she said glaring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually you're not this timid in front of your wife, but from this lower perspective, she almost seems more like a mother than a wife.  And an upset mother at that.  \"So fill me in.  What was your plan once David tried blackmailing you?\" Marie asks.  \"Well David said he'd delete the video if I zapped Claire so we could hang out at the beach together.  I was actually going to ask to delete it myself, but not before sending it to you.  I didn't expect you to catch him watching it, but I'm glad you did.  Now maybe we can have some fun with this situation.\" you answer.  Marie turns to your son and asks, \"You were really planning on wearing your own sister's body to the beach?\"  David just looks at him feet and mutters \"Yes ma'am.\"  \"Well you better hop to it.  We're wasting beach time as it is.\" she says, a mischievous grin creeping across her face.  \"You mean right here, with you two watching?\" he asked.  \"Of course I mean right here.  You're going to be Claire soon.  This is Claire's room.  That means this will be your room shortly.  And if you're going to be using these pens and having fun with us, you need to get over that shyness pronto.\" Marie informs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs David begins to disrobe, Marie turns to you pulling the brown pen out and showing it to you.  \"Just so you know, I've done a little experimenting with the other half of the set.  We are going to have just so much fun with these.  But first, I need you to give me the black pen.  If I'm going to come along on this little beach trip I'm going to need a skin of my own.  Mom may be okay for getting a ride to the beach, but even a sixteen year old doesn't want her hanging around all day.\" she says grinning.  \"You want me to come with while you get someone?\" you ask.  \"Nope.  I got this.\" she responds, her hand still outstretched.  You reluctantly hand over the black pen, hoping its the right choice.  Marie takes it and with a small flourish heads to the door.  Turning back into the room she says, \"You two finish getting ready.  I'll be back in a few with a pretty awesome surprise.\"  By this time David is pulling Claire's face on over his own.  Soon its just you and your son turned daughter slash best friend.  \"So how's it feel Claire?\" you ask.  \"Whoa.  This is pretty weird.  I mean look at me.  I'm a sixteen year old girl now.  My own sister.  I even sound just like her.\" he says staring into Claire's mirror.  \"Well get your clothes on girl, your mom will be back any second and I just know she'll want to head on out.\" you tell him, even as you see him feeling up his new breasts.  Just then there is a knock upon the door.  Who steps in this time?</span></div></div>",

And if you were here age, looking at sixteen year olds would only be normal. With that, you put a hand on Lilly's shoulder and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I need Claire for a moment, why don't you go and grab yourself a drink first.\" You say to Lilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, okay.\" Lilly replied, going back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went back down the stairs, you quickly get to Claire's room. The door was open and inside Claire was busy packing some stuff in a bag. As she was unaware, you quickly zapped her with the pen, closing the door behind you as you do. Her form deflates right in front of you and crumples into a pile of skin and clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up your daughter's skin, you felt that it was still warm to the touch. This was exciting, knowing that the black pen actually worked. Remembering that the girls were going to go soon, you quickly strip off your clothes and looked at the hole that was on the skin's back. This should not be physically possible to fit you into her 16 year old body, but you put your leg in anyways. In amazement, you found the skinsuit fit simply tightly over your leg, though it looked just like Claire's in every way. You ran your hand over the smooth skin, feeling it the smoothness of the skin as well as if being more sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited, you continue. You put your other leg in and began to pull the suit up like it was a pair of pants. Looking at the mirror, you laugh at the sight of you with your daughter's legs. Pulling it further up, you found your dick making a lump on the skin. It however quickly smooths out leaving a smooth teenage pussy where it once was.  You put your hand there, gasping in how different if felt. Deciding not to do anything pervy with your hands on your daughter's parts, you put your arms in the arms of the skin suit. When you finish inserting in your arms, your torso was now basically all the way in as well. You felt yourself shrink down, with Claire's breasts inflating back up as the skin suit fitted snugly to your body. Last piece was the head, and you put your head in, feeling Claire's long brown hair drape over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the skinsuit on, you admire your reflection. You definitely look exactly like Claire had. And she had definitely grown well, even if she wasn't as developed as Lilly was. Giving your new body a quick feel down, marveling at how nothing felt sore and how smooth and sensitive your body is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to keep Lilly waiting, you quickly dress up in what Claire was wearing, pocketing the pens in her shorts. Grabbing the the bag Claire had, you leave the room and headed down stairs.</span></div></div>",

The woman who had so caught his attention was a pretty thing, probably early 30's, she had short, stylish blonde hair, a curvy figure and was dressed in a tight pink top that emphasized her C-cup breasts, a white pvc belt, a black pencil skirt and a pair of open-toe, slingback pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he doing?\" you asked yourself, as you kept watching, partly hidden behind the curtains as the guy reached into his pocket.

But she'll understand when you explain it to her, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call her up on your cell, her number's on speed-dial as usual. Holding your phone in one hand, the other grasps the pen, glistening in the afternoon sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, babe, I've got something really cool to show you.\" You say, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, tiger, slow it down! What is it?\" Jessica replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a.. surprise! You'll find out if you come over here right now.\" You coax Jessica into your little trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright..

What is it?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me.\" You usher, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her to your bedroom, you close the door behind her as she enters. Locking it as it shuts, your hand reaches into your pocket to grasp the pen.<br>\r\nJessica is sitting on your bed and looks at you reach into your pocket, eyeing your hand. As you pull out the pen, she frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? My surprise?\" She almost sounds disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" You say in a bemused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing it at her, you press the button on the shaft at the same instant and you watch as she seems to freeze, before falling limp on the bed, her body quickly deflating. Gasping, you throw the pen onto the bed besides her and stand over the newly formed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess?\" You ask the lifeless suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures.\" You say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up Jessica's skin as carefully as possible, you don't want to damage anything. Her long blonde hair cascades over your hands as you grip her flappy shoulders. The skin's head hangs forward limply, any movement sways the flaccid limbs noticeably. You grip a handful of Jess' hair and raise her head up to see her face, revealing the slackened expression in her hollow visage. Her eyes, nose and lips are empty, pinkish on the inside. The sight is disturbing to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's not waste any time..</i> you think to yourself. Stripping Jess' skin of it's clothing, you're used to seeing her naked as you've made love several times.<br>\r\nBut seeing her naked deflated form is incredibly awkward, her breasts are like drooping flat sacs, nipples pointing to the floor. Her arms are long noodles which flay and flap with any movement. Undoing the clasp of her bra, you pride yourself as one of the few members of the male gender who can easily get it undone. Quickly followed by her panties, you throw her stuff on your bed and examine her fully naked skin. Her skin is pale, you've always seen it as a kind of purity. In between her thighs, on her palms and her nipples are pink, but the colour seems drained in this state. You turn the skin around and discover a long seam down her back, cleaving it open. Cautiously, you pry at it, discovering that the skin seems to be very slightly elastic. Pulling the seam open, it very tightly expands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your shirt sleeve up, you stick your hand into Jess' and gaze in wonder at your slim, pale hand. Wiggling your fingers in the air as if you were wearing a glove. Suddenly, a knock on your bedroom door sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David?\" Your mother calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you forgot to tell anyone that Jess was coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you throw Jess under your mattress and hide her things, then you unlock your bedroom door and open it a crack. Your mother stands in the hallway with a clothes-bin in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need your help with some chores, honey. Mind helping me out?\" She smiles at you, asking nicely. \"I'm really tired from work, come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you return to your bedroom, exhausted. Your mother had you doing all kinds of things. It went from doing the laundry, to the dishes, to painting the fence, to mowing the lawn. You're grubby and decide to take a shower. Minutes later, you're infront of the mirror shaving, and you remember Jess' tucked under your mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishing her out, you put her on the bed when suddenly your cell rings. Answering it, it's Jess' mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi David, is Jess' over by you still?\" She sounds worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yeah, she was about to head back home.\" You lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, phew, I was worried that she might be in some kind of trouble. She hasn't been answering her phone.\" Jessica's mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jess' handbag on your floor, her phone must've been off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you put her on the phone for me, David dear?\" Her mom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze in shock, then glance down at Jessica's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uhm, okay.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the phone, you drop the towel around your waist and pick up Jess' skin. Hurriedly, you stuff yourself into it, and after a few seconds of pinching and pulling, you've assumed her form. Her firm breasts hand from your chest and her shapely thighs mould your figure. Grabbing your phone, you pull your annoying hair from your face before putting the device to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi, mom!\" You try to talk like Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, why haven't you answered your phone all day? Jesus Christ, we thought you were dead.\" She says angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom! I was busy. My phone must've been off.\" You make up lies on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just see to it that you get back home asap.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.. see you..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone blips off and you drop it, sighing in relief. You sigh, wrapping your towel around your waist, you go back into the bathroom to shave.<br>\r\nOnly when you see yourself in the mirror do you realize that you're Jessica. And when you do, you almost scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan in pleasure as you finally achieve your first female climax, pulling your fingers from your crotch. You bring your legs down from their awkward stance as you sat on the toilet. Sticky fluid covers your crotch and your hand. Turning on the shower, you step in, your cheeks blushing with embarrassment.<br>\r\nYou watched Jess masturbate whilst sitting on the toilet with her legs in the air, and now you're bathing her body.<br>\r\nIn wonder, you watch the water trickles over the curvature of your new chest, it flows over them, tickling your pink nipples.<br>\r\nAfter fooling around in the shower, you get a fresh towel from your closet and wrap yourself in it. You realize that you've only wrapped your waist and laugh, pulling the towel up over your chest. Standing around in your room, you enjoy yourself as you slowly dry off. Wrapping the towel around your head to dry your hair, you giggle as you've always seen your sisters do it, but you've never found the need for it yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got no idea how to explain anything to Jess yet, and her parents are pissed. It's Friday night, you figure.. maybe you can go back AS Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping your towel, you reach around to your back where the seam was on the skin before and feel around for it, eventually finding it, you peel the skin off of your neck. Pulling up and over your head, it easily unsticks from you as if pasted on with craft glue. Throwing her skin on the bed, you feel the familiar sensation of having manhood once more and it's reassuring. You're back to normal. Putting on some clothes, you walk out of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mom, can I sleep by Jess' tonight?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She seems busy, her attention focused on her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. alright, thanks.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, have fun.\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run back to your room, back your bag with clothes, stuffing Jessica, the pen, and her stuff inside aswell. Grabbing your car keys, you head out. Managing to avoid your mother's suspicion as she's focused on her work. You're almost into your car before you realize that Jess' car is parked right next to it. <br>\r\nThat means that her parents will expect her to arrive home. You also realize that you didn't think this through.<br>\r\nFishing through her handbag for her car keys, you get into her car and drive out. Halfway down the road to her house, you pull into an alley to change.<br>\r\nStripping your clothes off, you pull Jess out of your bag and awkwardly try to put her on whilst sitting. Arching your beg and fumbling your limbs to try to fit yourself in. Eventually, you manage to stretch her onto you. Your years of car sex with Jess' have finally paid off. You manage to slip her bra and underwear on, then her jeans and her tank top. All set, you start the car up again and drive to her house.<br>\r\nPulling into the driveway, you shut off the engine and grab your stuff. Walking up to the door, it opens and you see Jess' mom standing in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home.\" She says facetiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. I'm back.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in here.\" She says. \"And shut the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks into the living room and you enter, closing the door behind her. Quickly you run up to your room before she can say anything and lock the door, putting your stuff on Jess' familiar bed. You pull out the pen and sigh to yourself. What's the plan?</span></div></div>",

You begin to to shadow Laura down the street and into her back garden. 'This place is good enough, no prying eyes here' you think. She was about to get out her keys from her purse when you swiftly opened the back gardens gate to get her before she enters the home. She turns in your general direction but luckily you are quick on the draw and shoot her before she could do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura began to deflate like a balloon. Some of her more loose clothing fell of while others stayed. After a 3 to 4 seconded process the teenager was now a skin suit. Now you need a place to put her on! You know her house is empty since the place is locked up. You grab the suit and her handbag and turn the key to the door which Laura was in the midst of using before you zapped her. After entering your neighbors home you look around, just as empty as you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best place to put Laura on would be her room , all her clothes are there and it's very private. You eventually find her room and let yourself in. The room had purple wallpaper and a large mirror dead center on the wall in the room. Large dressers dominated most of the room with her bed squashed in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now for the main event'. You have to take of Laura halter top and bra to get to the zipper revealing Her deflated breasts on her chest. You too undress leaving your cloths on Laura's bed. You slowly pull down the zip on the suit. Careful not to pull or rip anything.you slip on leg into the suits leg. At first it feels tight but an odd static feeling radiates your leg and all feeling of discomfort is gone. You can see that Laura's hairless leg has been filled looking completely normal. You soon pull both legs in the holes. You wiggle your girly painted toes to test the suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull up the suit eventually the gentians of the two intercept. The feeling was similar to the legs only it felt more pleasant more sensual. You stroke a finger on the vagina feeling an foreign pleasurable tingle and heat pass by your whole body. You then do the same for the arms. As the suit touches your chest the two breast began to inflate back into the two perky b-cup breast your neighbors normally had. Once again you test this by stroking the nipples with your new delicate fingers. A similar feelings to the is had. You examine your lower body. It now had ever curve Laura had, you were a full women! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your hand trace down your side , following the curve of tight ass which you a little grab before returning your hand to your melons which you gently cup your breasts stroking your thumbs on the nipples. You glance at the mirror ; it's an odd sight with your male head sticking out of a woman body who's natural head was now opened up and hanging off you're neck. The the warm feeling in your sex makes you not care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull the mask down wanting to explore this body as soon as possible. The world goes dark for a moment but as your (new) eyes open you see an exact copy of Laura standing in the mirror.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The evening passed in a series of sweaty, satisfying orgasms. The hours flew by as David used Laura's body to masturbate non-stop since he'd reduced the girl to a skin and worn her. Laying on her back, Laura huffed, her chest rising and falling in heavy breaths after her latest orgasm. Staring blankly into the window for a moment, David realized how long he'd spent, the darkness of the room and the dusky evening blue coming through the window threatened the sky with night. Slewing his female body off of the bedside, he stood Laura up and walked over to the window. Opening into the backyard where he and Laura entered, David noticed the antiquity of the window sill and frame. Prying at it, he realized it slid rather easily up, opening the large window irregardless of whether or not it was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sound of life in Laura's house startled David as Laura's fellow housemates returned home. David picked out the voice of an elderly woman speaking to a younger female, and assumed it was Laura's mother Mrs. Lashley, and her little sister, a 15 year old Patricia. A shock ran through David's cranium as he realized he didn't have any way to leave. He couldn't take off Laura's skin inside, and he couldn't take her off outside either because then he'd have to figure out a way to quickly return Laura while evading detection. As a matter of fact he didn't even know if he could turn her back to normal, the old man only used it to turn Ashley into a skin before tossing the pen away. David calmed himself as panic set in, and he set his priorities in order mentally. First, he needed to find a way out before he could consider escaping in the first place. Remembering the window, he walked up to it, still wearing Laura's naked skin. Peering through, David noticed how low the window was and it occurred to him that he might be able to climb out, and the Lashley's backyard was secluded, it was how he turned Laura into a skinsuit without anyone noticing after all.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Now that he'd found an escape route, he needed to take her off and figure out how to turn her back. David remembered the suit's entry seam running along it's spine and picked around the back of his neck. The skin under his female fingertips seemed to harden slightly and suddenly erupted a long split down his spine. He eagerly peeled it away, sloughing off Laura's face as it wrinkled and sagged lifelessly once her scalp detached. Quickly removing her shoulders, David's larger frame exploded from inside of her. He finished undressing and set Laura's emptied skin on her own bed, and searched around for his own clothes. Finding them on the floor haphazardly tossed, he put them on and then moved to the bedside to figure out what next to do. Experimenting to figure out a way to turn Laura back, first he tried to seal the split in her back, but nothing happened as he closed it by pinching it with his fingers. His eyes caught sight of the pen in his peripherals, and he picked it up. If the pen caused her to become this, it might be able to turn her back he reasoned. There was nothing to lose by trying, if the pen didn't work then she'd just remain a skin, he thought. Pointing down at Laura's flesh, he pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Instantaneously the girl's body began to re-fill with her own mass, and David sighed in relief. Turning to the window, he wanted to be out of here before she woke up, lest she wake up to see herself naked and her neighbour in her bedroom for an unexplainable reason. Climbing through the window wasn't hard, and David dropped down onto his feet in the grass before quickly scampering on out of the backyard, ducking under the side windows of the house so the Lashley family didn't spot his head moving across. Looking down at his hand holding the black pen, David concentrated on controlling his breathing as he walked down the sidewalk towards his own house. His curiosity and wonder filling his mind, he anticipated his next round using the pen to be coming very soon.</span></div></div>",

You feel like you'd be betraying her trust if you were to just take her life without permission. You might decide to ask her later and let her join in on the fun, but, for now, you want to test it out yourself. The few times you've met Charlotte, you've been able to tell exactly what kind of person she is, and you feel no remorse for shooting the pen at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you see Charlotte collapse and seemingly deflate. You quickly approach her, making sure no one is watching. You see a plastic skin suit that resembles the girl that had just been standing there covered with her clothes. You gather everything up and rush to your room, locking the door behind you to ensure you are not interrupted as you strip down an remove the clothes from the skin. You notice the suit has a zipper on the back slightly opened. You open it wider and see the parts that you apparently put yourself in. You start by getting your legs in and move the zipper up a bit. Already a tingling sensation develops around your legs, and you notice that, instead of your hairy, muscular legs, you have the toned, smooth legs of a woman. Intrigued, you move the zipper up more past your crotch. The tingling sensation follows your movement, and you can feel the boner you've had disappearing. You instinctively reach down to look for it, but you're met with a slightly moist vagina. Surprised by this, you move the zipper back down, and your manhood instantly reappears. Satisfied that you can regain your penis with ease, you again bring the zipper back up, feeling change course through your lower and middle body. You put your arms inside the plastic arms of the suit, and you feel them become Charlotte's smooth, toned arms. You cover your shoulders with the suit and move the zipper up further. As you do so, the plastic breasts of the suit fill up and become full breasts that you instantly grope, creating quite a sensual feeling all over your body. You take a deep breath as you put the skinned version of Charlotte's face over your own and bring the zipper completely up. The tingling sensation envelops your entire body, and you feel quite the sense of euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush for the bathroom, noting the movement of your breasts. When you look in the mirror, you are met by the reflection of Charlotte's naked body. You move your hands over the dark brown hair and feel miles of silky smooth hair. You give those breasts another shake as you're filled with the glee of having boobs to play with whenever you please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you mutter. You note that your voice has been completely replaced with Charlotte's. \"I can't believe it! I'm actually a girl!\" You can now understand the thrill that the man had expressed when he had become Ashley. The momentary thought makes you realize you should do something about him, but what's the harm of enjoying this body a bit longer? Part of you feels like you're no better than that creep because you've hijacked this girl's body without a second thought. The greater part of you is fine with borrowing a bitch's body. Who knows? You could probably be a better girl than her if you wanted to take her life for good, but you recognize that you'll have to become yourself again. For now, you want to enjoy this as much as possible, but who says you can't also go after that guy at the same time?</span></div></div>",

You thought about testing it on Claire but then decided against it, she's too young anyway. Tina, however, had these amazing C cups that make anything she wears look amazing. You start to worry about how you're admiring Tina considering.. she's your sister. Ironic, yes, you're about to turn her into a skin and wear her. You honestly just think that you should stop thinking so hard about it because you're starting to creep yourself out. Gripping the doorknob you open the door and a blast of air conditioning blows over your body, making you shiver.<br>\r\nClosing the door behind you, Tina's sitting as her desk with big pink Skull Candy headphones on, bobbing her head rhythmically to what you assume is music coming from her direction. It's probably incredibly loud in her ears since she didn't hear you enter. Sitting on her bed, she pays you no mind at all. You glance at the computer screen to see her playing League of Legends, she grumbles in frustration. Probably died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHah. Nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off your shoes after putting the pen on the bed besides you. It feels good to get out of your clothes after school, and the AC makes it even better.<br>\r\nStripping off your shirt quickly you throw everything on the floor ontop of your shoes. Stretching your shoulders, your hands shake with anticipation.<br>\r\nSlowly you pick up the pen and eye it one last time, standing up, you turn to Tina. You aim at her back, your thumb on the small button below the pen's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God fucking damn it, this scrub team won't stop fee-..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit! You're startled as she instantly deflates in her chair, the headphones fall to the floor and clatter loudly. You're looking at the deflated form of your sisterr with her.. \"skin-hands\" still on the mouse and keyboard, her deflated head hangs backwards over the chair looking at you. Her character on the screen runs into a group of enemy players and promptly gets killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably gonna' be more pissed about the game than me zapping her..\" You mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the skin, you grasp two handfuls of skin and hold her up in front of you. Her head flops down forward, her bun comprised of dirty blonde hair with red streaks flops lazily forward aswell. With no shape, her head looks horribly.. wrong. You stop yourself from throwing up and pull off her clothes rather easily.<br>\r\nShe was wearing what she calls \"gaming attire\", which is pretty much just a big white t-shirt and her panties. She doesn't care at all and happily walks around the house in her underwear with her nipples printing. If anyone asks, she'll probably say \"What? Do you like them?\"<br>\r\nTurning her skin around, you find a thin slit running down her back from her neck to above her ass, or what's left of it.<br>\r\nYou put her down over the chair and strip out of your clothes, then you pick her up and pull open the slit. It seems to be.. elastic? Isn't this human skin?<br>\r\nPushing your legs into her own provided a rather new experience, your legs thicken instantly and you're faced with Tina's apparently bombshell legs, smooth as a result of her shaving. Running your hand over one, you feel as if the leg is yours naturally. No wonder that stalker guy was so fanatic about this, it's amazing!<br>\r\nYou pull it up and feel an instantly tightness over your groin and torso, biting your lip to stop from screaming in surprise, your genitals have literally been squeezed out of existence. You bend forward and inspect as you frantically feel around your groin.  Oh dear God. You never knew this day would come. The day when everything that makes you a man disappears! You pull the skin down and it tears from your own like it was stuck with a really thin layer of glue.<br>\r\nAnd you experience a swelling sensation. Voila! They're back. You sigh almost in relief. Now that you know your manhood hasn't been teleported to another dimension forever, you pull the suit on properly. You almost fall forward as you feel Tina's tits form on your chest. Like an idiot, it takes you a few seconds to stop bending forward and groaning in pain, and a few more to get the hang of it. Your tits literally fill your hand and you bite your lip again, it's almost euphoric. Your nipples are super sensitive as you soon discover, cringing in pain as you accidentally squeeze one. Pulling the rest of the suit on, your face literally molds like clay into Tina's and you flex your jaw a few times, moving to a mirror. The tightness of the bun on your head eventually fades as you lean forward into the dressing room table's mirror, correcting Tina's face over yours. You close your eyes for a second and absorb all this new information, wearing the skin feels like you just added another layer of feeling on top of yours, but your \"old feeling\" gradually fades away, like a numbness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is gonna' be good..\" You smirk using Tina's pretty face, her voice warped with your boyish expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in Tina's computer chair, you look at the screen and see a huge \"Defeat\" sign across the middle. Oh dear. Clicking OK you navigate to a menu where you've got a few messages from  \"T3hSk4ll\" flashing in the bottom corner. You click it and a small page opens up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4:12 <i>tina wtf did you dc?</i><br>\r\n4:12 <i>tina???? omg we were winning and you threw it</i><br>\r\n4:12 <i>you better respond or im gonna call you in 10</i><br>\r\n4:16 <i>oh my godddd tina that was a qualifier how could you throw it, we're gonna get placed in gold or some skrub league come onnnnn</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and try to interpret what \"skrub\" means when suddenly your cellphone.. Tina's cellphone rings on the desk right next to you.<br>\r\n<b>Shit shit shit shit.</b> You pick up Tina's iphone and hit the green button on the touch screen, putting it to your ear.<br>\r\n\"Hello..?\" You say, trying your best to not sound incredibly nervous.<br>\r\n\"Tina? Are you ok? What the hell happened?\" You hear the deep voice of Tina's bodybuilder boyfriend Andrew. T3hSk4ll must be his username or something.<br>\r\n\"Uh, my internet cut out, sorry.\" You lie.<br>\r\n\"I saw Twitch run into Caitlyn and Braum and I thought you'd just rageqq'd. Those guys were pretty bad.\" He says.<br>\r\n\"Uh y-yeah.. Really bad. Really. Bad. Uh..\" You don't know what Twitch is, or who Caitlyn is, but you're playing along.<br>\r\n\"Listen, why don't you get ready for the party and we'll head there now? To get this all off your mind.\" You suddenly hear him say.<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. yeah.. I'm not- I'm not too sure about that toni- I mean today. Can I call you back later, Andrew?\" You say, trying to get him to leave you alone.<br>\r\n\"Andrew? Tina, you alright?\" He asks, obviously I said something wrong.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Isn't your name Andrew?\" You impulsively say, but then curse silently, you're way out of character.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you usually call me Drew.. Is everything alright over there?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Drew, gotta go bye.\" You hit the red button and end the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fucked that up so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, it's about 9 o'clock and you are with Andrew at the previously mentioned party. It's your friend Nikita's birthday and your whole gang is here to chill.<br>\r\nYou asked Claire for some help picking out what to wear, to Claire's own confusion. The two of you picked out a casual look, plait shirt with a red jacket and jeans.<br>\r\nIt's been a few hours since you arrived and after a game of beer pong and a few confused attempted make out session with Andrew, you're in the bathroom trying to figure out if someone put something in your drink. You're looking at yourself in the mirror after washing your face and your \"friend\" Nikita opens the door and walks up to you. In your slight drunken haze, you admire Nikita's curvacious form in her corset outfit and fedora. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not lookin' so good, Tina.\" She smiles and pat you on the back.<br>\r\nAfter trying not to throw up, you look at her and smile back. She's got a glint in her eye of something evil.<br>\r\n\"You've got a nice piece of meat there, Andrew, right? Real cutie T.\" She says. You raise one eyebrow, looking at the sink.<br>\r\n\"You guys together for a while?\" <br>\r\n\"Uh.. I think so.\" You don't know if Tina's been with him for a while, and you're kinda wasted. It's hard to think of good lies much less coherent responces.<br>\r\n\"You think so? I guess you won't mind if I spend some time with him tonight.\" She says with a smirk, patting you on the back again.<br>\r\nSomething boils up in you, a mixture of disturbance and anger. You look at Nikita and grimace, she's obviously interested in Andrew.<br>\r\nNikita's got a nice complexion, she's a mix, her father is white, her mother black, as a result, she has long curly hair that hangs down to her shoulders and lovely pink lips with a hazel skin tone. You look into her brown eyes, something tells you to zap her. You realize you brought the pen with you, it's stuffed into your side pocket. This sound like a great idea in your head, and there's no reason not to go along with it, right?<br>\r\nSticking a hand into your pocket, your other hand loops around Nikita's neck and you pull her into a kiss. She doesn't resist and you thrust the pen into her ribs and press the button. You feel her jolt once and then deflate against your body. Laughing, you  put her skin on the towel rack bunched up and lock the door.<br>\r\nLooking at the black pen, you smile. That kiss felt pretty good and you're starting to want more. In fact, you think you need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shaking her head, she makes up her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to rescue Ashley somehow.\" Claire says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is that pen he had..\" You say as you bend over, picking up the black pen front the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, we've gotta' hurry now!\" Claire urges you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you continue running towards Ashley's house, as you saw the stranger who is currently wearing her walk that way. Reaching the front door, you look at Claire nervously, and she nods at you. Knocking on the door, you hear Ashley call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooooming!\" Ashley said loudly, in a strange, perverted tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Claire and the two of you exchange perturbed expressions. Suddenly, the door opens, swinging inwards rather quickly. The two of you are greeted by Ashley's disheveled appearance, her shirt ruffled and her hair a mess, she's wearing an excited, ecstatic expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you fucking creep!\" Claire suddenly shouts, pushing Ashley back as she barges inside. \"We saw you, what you did to Ashley!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter behind and look out the door to see if anyone is watching, there's nobody around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What ever do you mean?\" Ashley tries to feign ignorance, rather horribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you fucking serious?\" Claire asks, deliriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, damn it, I'm no good.\" Ashley sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh..?\" You and Claire exclaim in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley suddenly smiles a long, evil smile. Suddenly, she grabs Claire and wraps her arms around her neck, holding her head stiff in place against Ashley's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move or I'll snap her neck!\" She yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\" You exclaim in shock, then you grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were rash in coming, the guy wearing Ashley looked like a criminal of sorts, and you swear you overheard him say he was a sex offender. There's no wonder he'd try something else. You stand still with your hands at your sides, then you remember the pen. The same pen he used to turn Ashley into a suit, you feel it in your left pocket, and begin to take it out, trying to avoid Ashley's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's..\" Ashley suddenly chokes Claire tightly, \"Drop it! On the floor!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing yourself for your failed attempt, you drop the pen on the floor and look at Ashley, Claire struggling to even breathe in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now kick it to me.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply, the pen skates across the wooden floor of Ashley's home. Ashley throws Claire away and quickly scoops up the pen, then aims it at you.<br>\r\nClaire spits and chokes, gasping for air, her face red. You look at Claire as she stands up straight, breathing heavily still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You.. You sick cunt!\" Claire screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you two had to see that.\" Ashley's eyes light up and she grins widely, \"And sorry for this too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the pen fires a beam straight into your sister's stomach, and with a soft thud, she crumples to the floor instantly. Looking back up to Ashley, a frightened expression across your face. Ashley laughs loudly, and it's the last thing you hear before you find yourself falling.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, your vision returns to normal from the messy blur you'd been greeted with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Claire..\" You groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, big brother?\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire?\" You look up, seeing your little sister standing before the end of the bed you're laying on. \"Claire! Are you alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get up, but find that your wrists and ankles are tied to the frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, untie me quickly!\" You ask urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stares at you, and a sly grin spreads across her lips. You look at her and slowly frown in realization, it's the same expression that Ashley made. <br>\r\nSpeaking of Ashley, you look to your right and see the naked, deflated skin of the woman spread across the vacant space besides you, her blonde hair messily strewn over the pillow her head rests on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire runs a finger through her pussy and groans, then licking her fingers, purring with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've spent the entire afternoon masturbating in these two lovely ladies. Believe me buddy, it was quite.. the experience.\" Claire says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're..\" Your eyes widen in fury as you begin, \"Get the fuck out of my sister, right now! You fucking bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big brother, that's no way to talk to me, is it?\" Claire mocks, exaggerated her stolen tone. \"You know how much I love you, brother..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire slowly walks over to the bedside and leans over you, beginning to undo your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been so horny all day and.. Well I've raped a few girls before.\" Claire mumbles, \"I've always wondered what it was like on the receiving end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- No, no no no!\" You say as you realize what's about to happen. \"You fucking sick cunt! Get out of my sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Claire's pale, small fingers grip your flaccid cock as she begins to stroke it. Quickly, your member grows into it's hardened form, satisfying Claire by the long smirk on her lips. You shake your head in disbelief, struggling against your binds. <br>\r\nClaire mounts you, and strokes her cleanly shaven cunt with her free hand, you see her juices trickling down her thigh and you try to shout for help.<br>\r\nClaire slams her hand onto your mouth and muffles your screams, a wild laugh emanating from her mouth as she lowers herself onto your cock.<br>\r\nYour little sister bleeds as you slide inside of her, you begin to cry in both pain and disbelief. Her hot, crimson blood trickling down your shaft and onto your balls.<br>\r\nClaire moans as her riding increases in pace and force, forcing her cunt onto your hard cock faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-God, brother, you're sooooo thick..\" Claire moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears trickle down your cheeks as you're raped by a man wearing your little sister, having taken her virginity as well. Pulling at your binds, your wrists are tied to the headboard by badly tied cloths. You feel one of them slackening as you pull at it, and a glimmer of hope sparks in you. Tugging harder and harder, your arm snaps downwards as it unravels. Instantly, you shove Claire off of you and untie your other hand. Claire gasps in surprise, your cock sliding out of her as she falls onto your legs.<br>\r\nYou lunge forward and grab Claire by the neck, choking her. She stares into your eyes, gasping and sputtering, a tear streams down her cheek. You feel yourself hesitate, but the image of her riding her own older brother flashes through your mind and you tighten your grip once more. Claire's eyes roll to the back of her head as she passes out, and you let her drop ontop of Ashley's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and puffing, you stare in shock as what's happened. Your crotch is literally a bloody mess, and your unconscious younger sister lays next to you, worn by a convicted rapist. You quickly untie your ankles after a while, getting up. Looking around, you find a box of wet wipes Ashley's kept on her dressing table. You clean your crotch in the bathroom before buttoning your pants back up. Washing your face, you try to make yourself feel better, atleast by a little bit. <br>\r\nGoing back into the bedroom, you find the black pen laying on the bedside table where Claire had put it. Walking to the bedside, you zap Claire as watch her deflate, her skin laying ontop of Ashley's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're bewildered, you've never imagined that you'd be in this current situation, and you're scared for what Claire might do once you find a way to get her back to normal. <br>\r\nYour parents must be wondering where the two of you are. Collecting your wits once more and approaching Claire's skin, you pick her up and notice a seam along her spine. You open it carefully, and find the skin of another inside. Peeling the two apart, you realize that this is the rapist's skin. Throwing it to the floor, you put Claire on the part of the bed you were lying in and zap her. She quickly reinflates, and you wait a minute for her to re-gain consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-David..?\" Claire groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, oh my god, you're awake.\" You say, relieved that she can even talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this pain in my..\" Claire gets up and looks at her crotch, you see her eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, what the fuck?!\" She screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, it was the guy,\" You explain as you point to his skin on the floor. \"He.. he wore you and..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wore me..?\" Claire stares in shock, \"Just like he did to Ashley..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just like Ashley.\" You say, \"He tied me to the bed and turned me back, probably to toy with me or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is there blood everywhere..?\" Claire groans, sickened, \"My crotch is killing me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He..\" You gulp, about to deliver the news. \"He fucked me whilst I was tied up, in your body..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looks up at you in complete surprise, you witness her entire face tremble with all kinds of emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT?!\" She screams, tears beginning to stream down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bedroom door bursts open, and a number of familiar faces including your father rush into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god!\" Your father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, he shouts to the people outside. \"We found them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women approach Claire, paramedics you conclude by looking at their uniforms. She gets up and they wrap her in a blanket, taking her outside to the ambulance.<br>\r\nYour father looks at you, and you return the glance. He walks up to you and hugs you firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son.. it's been days.\" Your father whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Days..?\" You ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been searching for you and your sister all this time, you disappeared last week.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But..\" You mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go home.\" He says, arm around your shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly you hear a ripping like sound from the back of your mother's head. Your eyes widens as you see her face start to twitch and deform. She bends her head forwards and you see her hands rips up some kind of opening in the back of her head. Her hands widens the opening more and more. You see she takes a good grip at both sides of the opening and with a last big pull you see her whole face is coming off, just like a mask, revealing your friend Jimmy's face underneath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Jimmy!\" You exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you dude! How fucking cool is this?\" He replies with is own voice, still wearing the body of your mother with her head hanging lifeless over the still exposed tits. The sight were truly weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there speechless eyeing your friend up and down and pinch your arm to make sure a last time that this isn't a dream. <br>\r\n\"Is.. is that really mom?\" You stammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally is!\" he says and cups his borrowed boobs again. \"And don't worry, as a person turns into a skin they don't remember anything about it, it's just like they are a sleep or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... that's unreal...\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it!\" He says with a extremely excited face. \"Dude you got to try it out!

He takes of your mother's blouse and slowly start to drag his arms out of your mother's skin. He then continues to take of the whole skin just like some kind of one-piece. <br>\r\nYou just stand and watch as Jimmy completely  gets out of the skin and lays it down on your bed. You walk towards the skin and study it with amazement, Even though the skin is empty you can still see who it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...\" You say quiet. Looking back and forwards between the skin and the pen you hold in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS pen does that?\" You say as you turn to Jimmy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally does\" He winks. \"You just put it on like a piece of clothing and zip up the zipper that appears... now come on man! Try it on! He says eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.. It's my own mother!\" You say, weirded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but.. it's not like she will know or anything!

In the end you just have to give in, the thought of impersonating your mother amuses you. You should at least try it on though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now put it on!\" Jimmy says inpatient.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Might as well...\" You mumble a bit shaken. You hand Jimmy the pen and carefully pick up the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to borrow the bathroom, be right back!\" Jimmy says and heads out of the room. <br>\r\nSuddenly you are alone in the room with your mother's skin.<br>\r\nYou undress yourself and then slowly start to put your right foot inside the skin, as you place your right foot into hers you feel the skin tighten and the female leg of your mother now looks and feels just like yours. You quickly put your other foot into the skin and feel the exact same feeling. You stand there watching your new feminine hairless legs for a second, amazed about how nice your borrowed legs feels.<br>\r\nYou wasted no more time and works the rest of your body into the skin. You start maneuver both of your arms into the skin. Suddenly you are almost done, the only thing missing is the head which is now dangling on your chest. You reach for the empty head with your new hands and moves it towards your face, at the same time as you bend your own head down and start pulling  it over yours. You work your eyes the empty holes and fit your lips inside hers. As the head is in place you reach for a nob that is placed right above the bum with your right hand and seal up the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the skin seals you feel a tingle run trough your body for about 2-3 seconds. Eagerly you walk towards the mirror in your room, you gasp at the sight that meets you. You see your own mother looking back at you...naked!<br>\r\n\"Oh, my god! this is so fucking unbelievable!\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\nYou watch your mother's shocked face in the mirror, her brown hair hangs loose over the shoulders and you notice her make up still sits perfect on her face. <br>\r\nYou move your new hands to the face beginning to rub it and pinch it a bit, before you move your hands down her body, over the full and wide hips, around the bubble butt and hourglass waist. As you cup her boobs and watch them rise and fall you can't help but be impressed of how young and fit your mother's body is the more you study it.  <br>\r\nIt could belong to a woman in her twenties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate to admit it but you can't help but feeling a bit aroused by seeing your mother's body mimicking your movements in the mirror. You waved at the mirror, tried out a few grimaces on your borrowed face and suddenly let out a giggle from her lips.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, my voice\" you said to yourself,  as you hear your mother's pitched voice coming from your lips.<br>\r\nSuddenly your eye's start to focus on the crotch. \"I wonder how it feels down there....\" You think to yourself and slowly move your hand down to the vagina.<br>\r\nA tingle run trough your body and you can't help to let out a moan as your hand start to massage the clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand there exploring and moaning to yourself....</span></div></div>",

In which Jimmy would obviously reply \"Si!\" just so the new prank goes smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Martinez park the car in front of Trish house, they all get off the car as they reach their destination, Miss Martinez carries her books and notes from the trunk and politely ask you both to help her carry them.

You then zip up the small opening from the back of her curly blonde hair to complete the transformation, \"All right I'm now Trish\" you giggly declare with her voice \"Heh heh dude this is so weird\" you look at Trish's body and feel her sporty body is fitter than yours, you feel you could run a hundred miles.

You toss your clothes on the floor as Trish would nonchalantly would, \"Hey could you please be neater?\" Jimmy scold you, \"Hey is that you talking or Mizz Martinez?\" you smirkly diverting his scolding. Jimmy pause and grinned as he let his inner Martinez took over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou softly plumed on Trish's bed and sit with your thighs \"So show me what you guys we're doing with my sisters\" you commanded.

Like the one that involved the washing up bowl. You have found, unfortunately that these ideas of his almost always ends up with him in hot water, and more often than not, you too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disheveled Ms. Martinez quickly put her clothes back on and try to present herself as best as she could, whilst you are startled by her action, you too follow suit, picking up Trish' discarded clothes from the floor and putting them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh? Ms. Martinez?,'' Erna O'Neill suddenly appears and caught by surprise, you try to hide under the bed cover, ''I didn't expect you to be here so late. Is everything okay with the lesson?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, si.'', Ms. Martinez replies with a smile, ''She learns quick. But we need to spend some more time today.'' Much to your surprise, she holds the pen and zaps it at Trish's mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude?!'', you exclaim as Erna crumples to the floor as a bag of skin, just like you saw happened to earlier victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ms. Martinez can't stay for longer, but Erna can.'', Ms. Martinez shakes the skin that was once Erna and brandishes it to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, are you-?'', you begin to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nope.'' Ms. Martinez tosses the skin to you, ''We had a deal. You got the first chance with Trish,'' she says pointing at you, ''Now it's my turn.'' she continues as she pulls off her face to reveal Jimmy's face underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you've witnessed the transformation and even experienced it first hand, it was still weird to see. Jimmy's features gradually disappears as he dons Trish skin, before long she stands in all her naked glory in front of you. The fit and slender body that you just wore minutes now gropes herself brazenly, before her gaze settles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude,'' Trish motions to the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though broken from a spell, you scrambled to reach the brown pen and zaps her with it. She looks a bit woozy and uncertain on her feet for a second or two before steadying herself and a Jimmy-esque grin appears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, I wish these were bigger,'' Trish pouts as her hands wraps around her bosom. ''Just like yours, <i>mom</i>,'' She grabs the brown pen from you and zaps you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you are hit with waves and waves of memories. Erna O'Neill's memories. They don't hit you like a barrage, but rather like a flow of river stream, quiet and smooth, but constant and persistent. It takes you a few seconds to recover. You look down to your bosom and grins, ''Of course dear, maybe if you let me suck on them..., ''you let your sentence trail. You grab Erna's bra and lift your boobs inside the cups. Whilst Erna's pair of boobs aren't as perky as Trish's and have rather sagged from aging gracefully, they are a handful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and gather the rest of Erna's article of clothing from the floor, meanwhile, you see Trish from the corner of your eyes doing a split. Jimmy is having fun in your mutual best friend's body. ''Whoa, she's so awesome.'', Trish gets up from the floor and effortlessly does a standing front split in one go, making sure you watch her as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Trish notices the Ms. Martinez's skin, still deflated but now dressed in her attire, ''Almost forgot,'' she says with a grin.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bye, Ms.'', Trish says from beside you as she waves at Ms. Martinez. The Spanish teacher was confused when she woke up in the living room, but you persistently thanked her for staying very late to teach Trish. She was still rather unsure of what had happened as you walked her out at the door, but she thanked you for your concern and said that she would definitely get some sleep when she arrives at home. Just before she went out, Trish bounded from her room to send her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What took you so long dude?'', you turn to Trish as you close the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nick called,'' she skips, making her way to the living room, before crashing on a sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And?'', <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''And, he said he has nothing to do tonight, so he wants to have some fun. With us. The Three Musketeers.'', Trish grandly says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What did you say then?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're going to love this,'' Trish straightens up. ''Sleepover. We decided to have a sleepover right here.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sleepover?'', you ask rather incredulously. Between the three of you, there is a black pen that could turn anyone into a skin and a brown pen that would enable you to pull off any impersonation, but all your brother and Jimmy came up with is a sleepover? ''And you decided this without me? What if I don't want to take part?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Your loss dude,'' Jimmy shrugs, ''But listen, seriously, you're going to like this, that's why I feel I don't need to ask. We're best buds right?'', there it is again, Jimmy's pitch to get you to follow his shenanigans. It worked every time, got you hook, line and sinker. ''So, Claire and Katie, they're having sleepover in your house and Nick's been complaining that their giggling is driving him mad, so he thought, you know...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's... sick.'', you struggle to find the right word. Your choice of vocabulary has been far more tame than what you would usually say, but then again anything you say against the idea will make you a hypocrite. ''Couldn't we get, someone else? Anyone else for that matter?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Claire and Katie are just right there.'', Trish gets up. ''This is the perfect place too, only we live here, <i>mom</i>.'', she says with a solemn serenity. Trish's parents have split up years ago, but last time Trish was willing to speak of anything about it, her father was rumoured to have ran away to another state. As Erna, of course you know better. The guy was a bastard. He wasn't when she started going out with him, but he showed his true colour when Erna delivered the revelation that she was pregnant with Trish. He didn't take it well, but he promised he would try to support the family. It took him just over two years before he ran away, never to return, leaving a note and a stack of 10 dollar bills worth 500 dollars. Erna burnt the note, but used the money to support her life. She can't afford to let her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Mom?'', Trish shakes you, ''Are you okay?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh?'', you look at her, there is fondness in your heart, not of the luscious kind, but the nurturing one. ''Yeah.'', Just like from your experience being in your mom's body, it seems that if you indulge in the memories of the people you're wearing, there would be some sort of feedback.''Her memories comes strong.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish chuckles, ''Got to keep them in rein dude, though it'll be a good time for a change. Katie or Claire?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Katie or Claire? Before Nick call dibs.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know,'' you say in exasperation, you'll prefer neither, but you don't have the privilege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fine, but make up your mind when we get there.'', Trish puts on her sports jacket and ties her hair into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are you doing?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm going there right now, it's not that far and I don't think I'll even break a sweat.'', Trish smirks, ''You can use the car'' and with that she zooms out the front door, leaving you dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take you long to get to your house in Erna's car, but when you do, you see Trish and Nick coming out from the house. Trish sees you and flashes a knowing smile. Trish turns around and gets back into the house, within seconds, you see Claire and Katie coming out too in their onesies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, you drive back, constantly checking the rear mirror, just in case one of your passenger crumples into a skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, here we are.'' you say as you stop the car in the O'Neill's driveway. Relieved that you still have the same number of passenger as when you set out from your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lead them inside the house, however, you know that you have to make a decision. You don't feel like staying in Erna's skin, and if you don't pick any, then Jimmy and Nick would be Claire and Katie and you'd have to be Trish. You're not sure that you'll be able to look at your younger sister the same way ever again, the same too with Katie, you'll never see her the same way again when you visit Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow in your head, it's better if you choose one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Have you decided yet?'', Trish asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would say things or act mysteriously, as if she knows something was up. That appearing trick she pulled earlier definitely caught you off-guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Erm,'' you clear your throat, ''Trish likes them too.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Still,'' Claire mumbles, ''I'm not Trish, though.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes you wonder how Katie and Claire are friends, considering their sometimes opposing personality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to say something else, you are surprised by the sight of Trish and Katie entering the kitchen. Katie in a pair of matching bra and panties and Trish swapping her sports jacket for a matching tight nightwear top and matching short bottom. Trish whips out the black pen and zaps Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aww, my little bro is now a sis.'', Trish says with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, '' you stutter, adjusting to hearing a different voice coming out from your throat, ''Is that Nick in there?'', you point at Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yep,'' comes the reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Watch out!'' you hear Katie exclaims as she zaps Trish with the brown pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish swoons for a bit, but when she steadies herself, a half smile curls on her face, ''But it's better if you call me Trish.'' in a smooth motion she takes off her top, letting you and Katie takes in the sight of her perky breasts. ''They're so firm,'' her attention is diverted to her bosom as she cups both of them in their hand, then one of her hand snakes down her body, before disappearing underneath the short bottom that she wears. Moments later a small moan escapes from her lips, followed by another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, wow.'' Trish looks up at you, her face flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''David.'', you hear a familiar voice shouts before waves and waves of memories. Claire's. You realise that Katie just zapped you with the brown pen. When your senses return to you, you see Katie zaps herself with the brown pen too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They're so round,'' Trish whispers and you shudder as suddenly you feel hands cupping your breasts and the feeling of two fleshy mounds pressed against your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's our sister!'', you struggle to break away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But I don't have a sister, remember?'', Trish speaks, you feel one of her hand moving south and you know you've got to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fuck off, it's our sis','' somehow, you get your elbow between your back and her stomach and pushes her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, I don't hear you complaining when you were in <i>mom</i>, and I certainly don't need you to ruin this by giving me guilt trips.'', Trish raises her voice at you, ''If you don't want to join us, then you're free to go home, right?'', she looks at Katie, as if looking for her support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Now, now.'', Katie stands between you and Trish, ''I'm sure David's just a bit uncomfortable,'' she turns to you, ''Do you want to swap? You can be Katie or Trish again if you want to.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's just... too weird.'', your breath is ragged. You try not to stare at Katie too much as she steps closer to you. From the three borrowed bodies, probably she had the best of all. She matured quickly with a visibly curvy figure and just a bit of baby fat around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, do you want her?'', Katie motions at Trish, ''or these?'', she grabs your hands and rest them on her bosom, reiterating her question earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yeah, fine.

You suppress a cringe as you see him beginning to don your sister's skin. So, instead of watching, you content yourself with your new skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie Hunt. Your girlfriend's younger sister and perhaps, your sister's best friend, or BFFs in their lingo. You've seen her of course. Many times. Usually when you visit your girlfriend in the Hunt's household. Sometimes, she tags along when Jessica goes over to yours. But more often, she's with Claire, doing some girly stuff. Just like her sister, she's a sweet girl, though she seems to be more well developed than her elder sister. Of course you've had numerous fantasies involving her. Often, your girlfriend's in it too. But of course, nothing close to reducing her into a pile of skins which you're about to wear and become her. Your fantasies merely extend to doing different things <i>to </i>her, sometimes <i>with</i> her, but not <i>as </i> her. Sometimes, by the way she acts, you thought that she had a crush on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thoughts is derailed by a low buzzing sound. Looking up, you see Claire, with the brown pen on her hand, where Jimmy stood just minutes ago. It is rather bizarre to see Claire in all her naked glory, especially when she begins to explore her body. That snaps you back to the skin of Katie Hunt you are holding. You should get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the previous skins you have worn, Katie's is yielding and accommodating as you insert your legs inside. As Katie is considerably shorter than you (though actually a tiny bit taller than Claire), you immediately notice the difference in height and perspective as the skin's abilities takes effect. You then proceed with the arms, inserting your arms to the places where they are intended to be. Pausing for a moment, you glance at Trish and Claire's faces, before putting Katie's face over yours. </span></div></div>",

A brief moment of dizziness follows, but when you fully regain your senses, your new body doesn't feel too alien. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you see Claire. As soon as your eyes set on her body, you immediately noticed how alluring she looks. Smooth white skin that's neither too pale nor tanned. You feel something warm rising from within you. Unable to pry your eyes away, you take in the sight of your sister's bare body in its entirety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey,'' Claire says softly, breaking you from your reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she doesn't give you a chance to respond. Swiftly closing the distance between the two of you, she looks at you straight in the eyes and a beguiling smile that you've never seen Claire pulls before, forms on her face. The next thing you know,  you found her kissing you forcefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop yourself, every fiber of your conscious minds tells you to push her away. But somehow, you're unable to. Instead, you feel the urge to kiss her back, to grab her boobs and suck on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realize, Katie doesn't have the hots for you. It's for Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night is a blur for you. Somehow, the three of you manage to haul yourself upstairs. Back to Trish's room, where earlier, Nick and Trish had dumped the girls' belongings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one says anything. There is only kissing, fondling, groping and touching between the three of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pushes you on to the bed and in turn, pushes herself on you. <i>She's so beautiful</i> , you find yourself thinking as pleasure starts building up within you. Much to your surprise, you see Claire getting off you and buries her face in your crotch. As she works you into a frenzied state, immediately you feel the electric sensation up your spine, building and building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you remember is an exploding sensation from your inside, before a warm, pleasurable feeling wash your every being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awake to an ensemble of soft grunting noises and moans. Locks of curly brunette hair covers your sight partially and you brush them away. You turn on your side and you see Trish laying on the bed, whilst Erna sits atop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Already awake?'' Trish says without even looking at your direction. The two of them are joined in the nether region by what looked like a strap on. All of a sudden, Erna begins to gyrate her hips in vertically in a more energetic fashion, taking in the whole length of the shaft in every time she goes down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Give us a minute to finish up.'' Trish says breathlessly and grits her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute is a serious understatement, by the time they join you downstairs, you've been waiting for at least twenty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Dude, you were, like, passed out not long after we started.'' Erna says - Jimmy really, wearing Trish's mother like a cheap suit- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''A tad too much huh?'' Trish smirks as she passes by you and help herself to some juice from the fridge, ''Got us worried for no reason. Maybe I should take her for a spin.'', she motions to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you are sitting down in the O'Neill's dining area. Thankfully, everyone is dressed, though it was mostly due to the chilly air. Erna has helped herself to Trish's bathrobe, though she lets it drapes on her untied, letting her cleavage and a section of her torso in full view. Her lower body is covered by Trish's panties which she helped herself to as well. Trish is wearing a random t-shirt that she can find and Nick's boxer. She gave you a spare shirt which you are now wearing, combined with Katie's panties which you found lying on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Where did you find that,'' you pause a second as you try to get the word out of your mouth, ''Strap on?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh? This?'', Erna holds the thing up for you to see. It is a double ended one. ''I found it in Trish's room. Hidden beneath her bed.'' She examines the object, turning it around ,''Neat huh, never knew Trish likes these sorts of things.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The fuck?'', you blurt out, which sounds rather bizarre coming from Katie's mouth. You were wearing Trish's skin, but you don't remember recalling anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Of course not.'' Erna looks at you sheepishly, ''We nip down to that shady sex shop in town, when you passed out. Got it from that place.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh yeah, '' Trish chuckles ,''You did get a discount right?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Only after I flashed these tits to the cashier.'', Erna says bemused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, so you left me alone, while I was out cold?'', you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, you ain't going anywhere dude.'',  Erna retorts. ''Still asleep. Was I that good? Or was it Claire?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your cheeks flush at that comment. ''Did you know, '' you gestures at the Claire's skin draped over a chair and yourself, ''About this? This relationship?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''About how Katie want to jump your sister's bone so bad?'', Erna chuckles. ''Sort of, I wore her for some time after all.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Holy crap'', Trish mutters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But Claire herself,'' Erna stands up from her seat and grabs Claire's skin, ''I don't think so, at least as far as I could remember. Not without a push anyway.'' She ends the sentence with Jimmy's characteristic smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well then,'' Trish gets up from her seat. ''Enough talk. We should get going. Things to see, people to become.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We'll have to do it without Erna. She's about to have a busy day.'' Erna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, you're working again mom?'', Trish says with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sorry, darling. I'll be back before dinner. Just keep your fit ass ready for me.'' Erna says with a straight face as she places her hand on her daughter's ass. You groan at the tacky attempt of a role play by your brother and best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter discarding Erna's skin and re-inflating her, Jimmy decides that he wants to put on Trish's skin and let Nick uses Claire's. The three of you then make it back to your house without a hitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your phone rings. You glance at the caller's ID which read 'Jessica' and without thinking you pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Jess.'' you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey,'' comes the reply. ''Katie? What are you doing with David's phone?'', she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realize your mistake. <i>Fuck</i>, you curse inwardly at your stupidity. Of course, you had forgotten that you're wearing Katie's skin the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''David's uh, downstairs. I saw your name on the screen, so I picked it up.'' you manage to mumble out a response. You just hope that when you let go of Katie's skin, Jessica wouldn't be asking her little sister any question about this mishap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Get him on for me, will you?'' Jessica says. ''So, how's Claire?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Claire?'', you stutter at that name, ''What about her?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Right, we'll talk later.'' Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she says that you put the phone down and see Trish and Claire trying their best to contain their giggling. However, you decide to ignore them for the time being and concentrated to take Katie's face off your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey baby'' you say hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's Saturday, aren't you going to take me out somewhere? I'm bored stiff here.'', Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze. You wanted to follow Jimmy and Nick, partly to have fun with the pen and partly to keep an eye for them, but this means that you have to choose between the two options.</span></div></div>",

''Spill it.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped halfway of putting fries into your mouth as your brain tried unsuccessfully to string a bunch of words in response. ''It's nothing,'' you manage to mumble some words out. There was no way you would be able to let your girlfriend know about the existence of the pens that Jimmy found and definitely not what you, Nick and Jimmy had done with those pens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's not nothing,'' Jessica pursued the matter doggedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly, you sigh. Your girlfriend can be very perceptive and persistent, despite her good intentions. Thankfully though, you've learned how to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jimmy's gotten into trouble <i>again</i>.'', you said in an attempt to fob off Jessica's interrogation. It wasn't a lie either, your best friend's inclinations for pranks and dark humour had often landed the pair of you into hot water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh no,'' Jessica groaned, ''Pranks went too far again?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou merely nodded. It seemed that your answer had sated Jessica to some extent and you intend to keep it that way. So you steered the conversation into some of the worst things that Jimmy had done in the past. Both of you had a good laugh at the things Jimmy had done and a few cringes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seemed normal after you arrived home from dropping Jessica back to her house. Your parents were both in and having dinner. Your mother offered you something to eat, but you politely declined. Instead, you asked your parents if they had seen Jimmy or Nick or Tina but your mother shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounded upstairs to Claire's room.Knocking twice, you jerked the handle and swung the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What is it?'', Claire looked annoyed as she saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh.'' you mumbled. In your haste, you didn't wait for a reply and entered the room to see Claire and Katie. Both of them were dressed in their onesies, and there was no sign of anything out of the ordinary happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hi David,'' Katie greeted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, hi.'' you smiled at her. Katie looked great as usual, but after spending some time inside her skin and knowing that she had the hots for Claire, you suddenly became very self conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly averting your gaze away from her, you returned to Claire. ''Have you see Jimmy? Or Nick?'', you asked her of the whereabouts of your two co-conspirators. Unfortunately there was no luck either, as you saw their blank gazes. Abruptly you exited Claire's room and scampered off to the next place where you'd be most likely to find Jimmy and Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You guys are fucking unbelievable.'' you berated Trish and Tina, really Nick and Jimmy when you saw them in Trish's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some skins lying around the bedroom floor. One of them you recognized as Erna. Her deflated and lifeless skin still wore her work uniform, your guess was that as soon as she got home, either Nick or Jimmy zapped her straightaway. There were four other female skins on the floor, but none which you recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''This is Kelly,'' Trish picked up a skin with blonde hair that would normally extend to just below her shoulders and tossed it to you. ''Samantha,'' Trish threw another skin at you, this time, it was one with dark hair, albeit the skin was of olive complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Meet Tara and Shauna,'' with a wide grin on her face, Tina handed you two more skins, both of them shared a common trait of long brunette hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You can't just turn people into skins left, right and centre,'' you said with your hand full of skins. ''They might have things to do, or people looking for them.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Relax bro,'' Tina said nonchalantly, ''Those two were <i>my</i> friends or Tina's friends.'' She said, motioning to the skins of Tara and Shauna.'' I asked them if they wanted to come out for a drink and they agreed to. It's not unusual for people not to remember things after a wild night out right?'' she said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It was the same case with those two'', Trish pointed to the skins of Kelly and Samantha. ''I reckon we should just stay here and have our own fun. We could always stock the bar downstairs.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted at the turn of events, but more on how well Jimmy and Nick were actually getting on despite the small disagreement. The two of them generally avoided each other when Jimmy came over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It seemed that we have reached an impasse.'', Tina crossed her legs and Trish followed suit. The negotiation had been intense and neither one of them backed down. Both of them were equally adamant on what they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why don't we let David decide?'' Trish suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wha-?'', you raised an eyebrow at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What do you say, <i>bro</i>?'' a half smile formed on Tina's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt their gazes fixated onto you and made a decision...</span></div></div>",

Tina's tits bouncing with her shoulders due to the intensity of her outburst. Her eyes turn red as she wipes them with her collar, muttering something underneath her gasping and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you serious? HA! You two..\" she promptly returns to laughing, slumping into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jimmy simply stare at her and each other, you deeply frown in embarassment. Jimmy simply flashes Trish's smile and winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you look at your available options, of which are crumpled in a heap at your feet. You sort the pile, looking through one by one. Holding up the blonde one, Kelly, she reminds you too much of Jessica and you toss her to the side. Picking up Samantha, you're slightly intrigued by her nice skin colour, you've always had a thing for more tanned girls, but you settle for what you get. Jimmy and Nick don't really care about changing next to you or each other, but you've always been erked by the thought of another guy looking at you naked, much less putting on someone else's skin. You simply just strip out of your clothes and stand in your boxers, looking at Tina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can you guys.. get out?\" You request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Afraid we'll see your pecker, David?\" Tina remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy instantly bursts out into laughter, Trish's hair hanging forward as she leans forward, her hands over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' Ace, Nick.\" The two of them high-five each other as they get up. However, they comply and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assholes.\" You mumble, spreading open Samantha's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing into the insides of the skin, it's dark and warm you, not unlike any other skin. But something is strange, and you don't know what.<br>\r\nYou quickly don the skin, after a few seconds of pulling, pushing and stretching, you've wrapped yourself up in the comfortable body of Samantha.<br>\r\nMoving to Trish's mirror, you adjust your face. This girl has an incredibly natural feel about her. Her green eyes compliment her skin and glow, she's got thick dark lashes to frame their appearance. Her stomach is firm, she must exercise often. Tracing the edges of toned abdominal muscles with your fingers, she's got thin white french tips. You're starting to think she tries her best to be girly, but it just doesn't happen very often. Throwing your long curls behind your head, you sigh. Flexing your arms, they're toned, yeah, but she's clearly focus more on her lower body. Probably a Track athlete. Your legs are very firm and you've got the most amazing thighs you've ever seen on a girl. Completing the objectification of this poor girl as nothing but a suit, you squish your arms together playfully, squeezing her nice C cups together, topped with brown areola's and perky nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, hurry the f- Woah..\" Trish opens the door and loudly demands, before he stops abruptly. \"Wow, you look amazing in that, I mean, her, I mean..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Jimmy.\" Your words come out with an exquisite curl, a smooth low voice, strong and confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, definitely European, maybe Italian?\" Jimmy states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it's not like I have her memories.\" Your arms drop to your sides, letting your bosom hang.. naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, about that.\" Jimmy fishes out the brown pen and promptly zaps you, as per usual. \"There you go, miss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand still for a moment as you feel a personality hit you like a truck and promptly send you skating across the floor of your mind.<br>\r\nStanding firmly in your former place, you frown and gasp back in reality. Leaning forward, you support yourself against Trish's bed.<br>\r\nYour vision's blurry for a moment, but then you focus as you feel Trish help you up, you're taller than her by about 5 inches, looking down at Trish's smaller form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright pal? Lookin' kinda' pale there. And you're not pale, if you know what I mean.\" He stupidly jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You..\" Suddenly, you're filled with a fiery anger, \"What did you do to me?!\"<br>\r\nYour hand dashes up and you grip Trish by the neck, your eye catches her pulling the black pen from somewhere. Instantly, you force her back whilst grabbing her hand. As she swings back from your push, you pry the pen from her hand and let her fall against the mattress. Spinning it almost expertly in your fingers, you point the pen at Trish in a confident stance, you feel amazing right now. Trish on the other hand looks terrified and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, calm down! Don't do anything stupid, give me the pen..\" She pleads in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin widely, but you're trying to fight whatever's compelling you to do this, but it's overwhelming. All you can do is watch from inside your own head as you body moves itself. Something was strange about that skin after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina! Tina he-..!\" Trish instantly deflates. You move forward and grab the brown pen from her pocket and back off, aiming the pen to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?!\" Tina arrives, \"David?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thumb lightly presses the pen's trigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find out what you assholes did to me and Kelly, and then I'm going to make you pay.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of horror flashes across Tina's face, and she turns to run, but it's too late. She simply drops against the stairs, deflated. You move to the stairs and gather Tina up, throwing her next to Trish's skin on the bed. You find yourself looking around the room uncomfortably, like you have no idea where you are.<br>\r\nPicking up Kelly's skin, you lay it out on the bed and aim the black pen at it. Pressing the button, the skin slowly re-inflates. You sit in a chair at the side of the dressing table as you wait, putting your hand over your face, you sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on..\" You hear yourself mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear someone gasping for air. Instantly you stand up and look over to Kelly, her eyes are open, staring at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly? Are you alright?\" You walk over to her side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you, then she lurches up and looks around frantically, eventually noticing the two skins besides her and the one skin on the floor. <br>\r\nPausing for a moment, she slowly looks up at your face, and starts to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly! Kelly, it's alright!\" You hold Kelly as she wails, burying her face in your chest, trying to comfort her despite the fact that you're naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy are you naked anyway? What were you doing before? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam! Sam, where the fuck are we?! What is going on?!\" Kelly starts to shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! Stop shouting, Kelly!\" She instantly stops shouting and stares at you, almost ashamed, \"I don't know where we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these.. skins..?\" She inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, what was the last thing you remember? We were going out with Tina, right?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah that's right. What happened then? I don't remember.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina.. pulled a pen out or something, and that's where it ends. That's what this is...\" You show her the pens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks one up and examines it, and then promptly starts hyperventilating. A few seconds later you've calmed her down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you stop freaking out? It's not helping!\" You insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright I'm better now. Who are these people?\" She looks around her again, \"Wait.. is that Tina?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you lays Tina's skin, still where you threw it, and you pull it over your lap. Tina's deflated face simply looks at you. It's incredibly eery, her face is deflated, no eyes, nothing inside of her lips. But it feels like there's a presence. She's just <i>looking</i> at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to put on some clothes, Sam.\" Kelly suddenly states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear God, she's right. You're stark naked. Searching around the room, you find your outfit from a few hours ago and put it on.<br>\r\nA  pair of black denim jeans with a green tank top, your orange vest is still on the floor, however. You sit with Kelly again and you both stare at each other in shock, trying to think, to figure out just what's going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just.. came to.. just like that.. I was talking to someone, this girl, and I realized that I was back. So I grabbed the weird pen from our memories and zapped, she shouted for Tina, so I zapped her too. I'm thinking this poor girl and Tina were zapped as well and are being worn..\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.. maybe we should talk to Tina, find out what's going on.\" Kelly suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. let's find something to restrain her with though, search her clothes for anything that looks like this, or anything sharp.\" You show her the pens again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go downstairs and eventually find your way to a toolbox underneath the bathroom sink, inside are a bunch of tools, screws and zipties.<br>\r\nGathering the ties, you smile.</span></div></div>",

Untie me!\" Tina yells, restrained against a dining room table chair, taken up to Trish's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell would we do that?\", You say, \"You'd just try to turn us back into skins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I would.\" Tina replies angrily, and then stares blankly for a moment, realizing her slimming chances of freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Kelly says, hands on her hips. \"So, why are you and your friend wearing Tina and that other girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling you anything.\" Tina says, huffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply grin, you and Kelly knew Tina for years, but you knew her better. The two of you shared some rather inebriated moments of intimacy.<br>\r\n\"Playtime\" is what she called it. You don't know if the person wearing her knew about that, but you're guessing she does. A look of worry plasters itself across Tina's face, she's trying her hardest to hide it, looking at her lap. You walk up to her against the chair and grip her chin, forcing her to look into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes..\" Tina replies, \"You're Samantha, duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm your mistress.\" You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forcibly come onto Tina, one hand gripping one of her sizeable tits as the chair tips backwards, slamming Tina against the floor. Your other hand finds its way into her crotch and you start to tease her. Tina's into the whole dominatrix thing and you have no qualms about fulfilling it, it's rather fun you've found.<br>\r\nMoving your hand from her bosom to her neck, you choke her gently and force her head against the ground. Kelly simply stands by, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh.. I-I.. Stop!\" Tina starts to plead, pathetically whimpering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You demand, dipping your head down to her neck, you start sucking her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick! I'm her brother! Stop, please!\" You feel Tina's arms struggle to move at all against the ties, shaking the wooden frame of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her brother? Wow.\" You start laughing, \"Isn't that a little weird for you? How sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina frowns at your condescending statements as you get off her, dusting off your hands. Kelly's staring at you surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two had this thing goin' on, eh?\" Kelly says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less.\" You reply, and the two of you start giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you say, looking back at Tina, \"You're going to take off Tina's skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" Tina smugly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't, you'll have to deal with me.\" You smirk, waving your fingers at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looks horrified and nods quickly. \"Alright, untie me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly pulls Tina's chair back up and cuts the ties. After rubbing her wrists, she gets up and looks at you and Kelly for a moment.<br>\r\nYou see her hand reach into her pocket for what would be the black pen, if only you hadn't given it to Kelly.<br>\r\nKelly pulls said pen from her pocket and aims, whilst you sigh in annoyance and step forward, throwing a balled fist into Tina's face.<br>\r\nA surprised look flashes across her face before she stumbles backwards, leaning against the bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh, what the fuck!\" She shouts, looking at her palm to see if there was any blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like I play games? Take off the fucking skin or I'll beat the shit out of you.\" You say, sarcastically smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, jesus..\" Tina's hands move behind her head, soon after she starts to pull and you see Nick's head appear, Tina's flesh peeling from his own like it was glued on. He lets her face hang from his neck after pulling it down further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your brow, he has a smug look on his face, as if he's expecting us to be impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ladies?\" Nick says in his own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step forward and punch him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" He yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina's skin lays across Trish's bed next to Trish herself, you and Kelly forced Nick back into the chair and re-tied him, much to his dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how are we gonna' get that girl back to normal?\" Kelly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, we can try doing what be did before, but there's an easier way. The girl, Trish, was it? She shouted for Tina before you zapped her. The two of them are probably accomplices. You can use Tina's skin to trick her into taking her's off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beckon to Nick with your hand, looking at Kelly. \"Zap him and hide the skin. I'm going to put on Tina and re-inflate the girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Alright.. Be careful.\" Kelly says, not even bothering to question your planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way up the stairs as you hear Nick yell. \"Wait, wait do-..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the two pens you have out of your pocket, you examine them thoroughly. The black one turns people into skins, you know that, but the brown one.. what does it do? How did Tina know exactly how to act like.. herself? She'd fooled you and Kelly into going out with her, only to lead us into an ambush. Nick must've used this pen to get her memories or personality or something. That's it! We don't need to use Tina when we can use Nick. You make your way downstairs again to retrieve Nick's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, get me Nick's skin. I'll use him instead.\" You request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Kelly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why wouldn't I be sure?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. he's a guy. If you wear him, you'll become one.\" Kelly seems nervous just talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll grow a dick. Is there a problem?\" You simply state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" She throws the skin to you, you see red marks around his wrists from the ties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to her, you promptly turn around and head back to Trish's room yet again. A few seconds later you've stripped down and are holding Nick's skin before you, you're curious as to how this'll feel. Turning him around, you feel a sense of vengeance lingering in the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Payback, you motherfucker.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull Nick's skin on rather quickly, the sensation of your flesh growing and contorting make you feel sick and you try your hardest not to vomit.<br>\r\nHolding Nick's head infront of you, you bundle your hair up and pull the skin over your head, you feel your face morphing, becoming harder, more pronounced in your jaw and cheeks. You look down and see the body of a weight lifter, Nick's got well used muscles just about everywhere. Time to stop gawking, there's work to be done. You take the black pen from the dressing table and zap Trish's body. A few seconds later she re-inflates and awakens, looking about confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she's dazed and doesn't remember much, but then springs to life, looking around for the girl that zapped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd that bitch go?! She fucking zapped me man!\" Trish yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, man, we gotta' go now, get changed into someone else and let's skitch.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why? What's going on?\" Trish says, obviously confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain, hurry up.\" You say, throwing the skin of another girl at him, of which you found on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish catches the skin and puts it on the bed, nodding, quickly, she peels Trish's face from what's underneath, you stare for a moment as you see the head of Jimmy emerge from this girl's body. You wait before doing anything, but your grip around the black pen tightens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you alright?\" Jimmy says, his stupid tone of speaking makes you even more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine, hurry up.\" You urge him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, jeez, what's the rush?\" He says, peeling Trish's torso from his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room for a second, and hear the sound of Trish's skin hitting the bed. Looking back to Jimmy, you see him walking towards a girl's skin nearby. Whipping your arm up, you aim the black pen at him, he instantly freezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what the fuck man? Don't point that at me.\" He yells, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking for the bitch that zapped you? I'm right here.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy hesitates for a moment, his arms dropping to his sides as he almost accepts his fate. \"Oh.. shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crumples to the floor quickly, and you feel a sense of righteousness bloom in you, like you're doing the world a favor by punishing these sick fuckers.<br>\r\nMoving to his skin, you throw it on the bed and peel Nick's head from yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, it's over! You can come up now!\" You call to Kelly downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" You hear thudding against the stairs and she promptly appears. \"So, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish peeling Nick off and you simply discard it to the side like trash, pulling your panties up your thighs afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna' restore everyone here one by one and explain what happened.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that gonna' be a little.. y'know, hard?\" Kelly replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Tina might have trouble coping with the fact that she was turned into a skin and worn by her own brother.\" Kelly facetiously says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah..\" You say, smirking as you wrap your bra around your bosom, fastening it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull on the rest of your clothes quickly and gather Trish and Tina's skins, putting them on Trish's bed. <br>\r\nBoth pens in hand, you look at Kelly and she nods at you. Raising your arm, you aim to Tina first, pressing the button. <br>\r\nOnce you see Tina's body start to rise, kind of like bread in an oven, you switch to Trish and zap her too. Not much later the same thing occurs.<br>\r\nYou wait a few minutes, and Trish bolts upright and starts crying, holding her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..? I zapped her second.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Trish's voice inbetween her sobbing, \"I.. I remember everything..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looks at you with a look of disdain and worry, and you return it.</span></div></div>",

You shuddered to think that there might be people looking for those pens out there. Judging from the capabilities of those pens, it was obvious that the technology the three of you were meddling with were very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just get on with it,'' Tina whines.

You didn't want to admit it, but you were looking forward to another session similar to last night. The corner of your eyes caught Tina's movement.

In the elevator Jimmy press the 6th floor button as if he knew where Ms.Lin lived and he should since Ms.Martinez and another teacher had to drag Ms.Lin back to her room when she pass out from Ms.Martinez welcome party at the fore mention bar, as told by Jimmy during the car ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ms.Lin apartment you could tell its chinese as she is the smell of incense linger together with Ms.Lin perfume that you totally didn't try to get a whiff off before cramming her into her own handbag.

Putting on a new skin is always a fresh experience as your mother you could feel her stress joints as age is catching up to her, as Trish you feel energetic and peppy now as Ms.Lin you could feel her tense muscle especially around the face as you touch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel a jolt of electricity coursing to your mind, \"<i>it can't be...</i>\" you thought.

You them feel the side of her body to see if her slim figure matches what you see. Working down her crotch you feel slight difference between hers and the ones you worn before as her's hymen according to memory is broken despite being a virgin. You shudder the thought of female and male intercourse as your experience with Jessica for the first time wasn't so pleasant for both of you.

Ms.Lin hand move back and grope Ms.Martinez sweet bountiful bottom as she was leaning on your back grouping your D size cups in response to Jimmy's request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine just make sure you don't use the brown pen\" you made an early protest \"I don't wanna adept to her personality too its mind draining\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe..come on dude that makes it more fun\" Jimmy whines<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well as Trish it was but that's because me and her alike but Ms.Lin just different it takes out the fun of being a new person let alone gender\" you giving Jimmy your perspective on the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude didn't you get that like with your mom?\" as Jimmy pull off Ms.Martinez head revealing his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complained it was too short of an experience and the only interaction you had while being her is with your sister.

You scan her tummy to see something wrong but to no result until you rubs her legs you feel something slimy in between her crotch. Her vagina seems to be wet as you touch it, you can't but look at Jimmy giving him a grumpy look to which he notice and respond with his trademark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know dude you could hold it in\" you complain Ms.Martinez's body condition as you finish zipping her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it dude I just can't\" Jimmy grinned as he finish zipping Ms.Lin's back \"I mean Ms.Martinez is super sensitive she just can't handle the ol'Jim-ster\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs.Martinez gave a big sigh as you gave one \"Well its time for round 2 I'm sorry if you didn't get to feel as Trish\" as you hold Jimmy's shoulders giving him a very lecherous smile. Jimmy tires to respond but you kiss him feeling Ms.Lin mouth from an outside perspective, Jimmy's leg weaken by your tongue kissing expertise. You unclip Ms.Lin's black clip that holds her bun resulting her hair to flow down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay dude I like older woman anyways\" Jimmy weakly response as you both dive onto Ms.Lin's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to be forcefully as you usually would in bed with Jessica, kissing an older woman was very different than your girl it was rougher and wider. Jimmy took advantage of the high and starts to fingering you as he wiggle his fingers in your already moist vagina. Moaning from the pleasure you can't help but get into the sexual high. You return the favor by suckling his breast resulting a moan from Jimmy in which intensify Jimmy's fingering skills. After awhile you ejaculate on Jimmy covering him in Ms.Martinez juices you pant out of the experience, clearly Jimmy ready her for you. You then pull Jimmy so you could both sit in front of each other and asked him to fondle your chest while you please his crotch.

Alarm clocks are no stranger to you but this morning they have became the worst of invention mankind have created. As the clock rings its electronic alarm you notice Jimmy still asleep and drooling from Ms.Lin mouth with a contempt face.

He answer was that once you took off completely the skin you're wearing the memory and personality is gone from his experience.

I ate Mrs.Hunt share for her I'm still hungry\" he replied with a mouthful of pancakes in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, what's your end game here boys?\" Jess ask your intentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly strip Katie as you prepare to move out of her \"Well I just wanted to surprise you what we find\". As you pull out the rest of your body you notice the size shift as it was like standing with one leg on a high platform, you carefully balance yourself but fell down anyways on your side. Looking up you see Jess grinning, apparently she wasn't too keen on you donning and for kissing her as her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well David what is next in your master plan huh?\" Jess ask \"I have always wanted to know how a dick works\" she smiled wily.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

The ones you worn before have been virgins at best as you recall but oddly enough you can remember anything else about the woman you've been wearing even Katie aside from your own memories while wearing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose your train of thought as you notice Jessica pulling out her father skin from his clothes \"So you're going to try out your dad regardless what I say?\" it was too obvious as you know Jess too well that she is a very perky and curious girl that would try anything once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess replied gleefully with a grin \"Oh! Jimmy\" changing her attention to your bestest buddy \"You can get out of my mom now and let David take over\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine\"Jimmy take a gulp out of a glass of orange juice that 'Mrs.Hunt' left on the kitchen counter \"After you're done how about me and you have some father and daughter action huh?\" Jimmy trying his dumb luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude!\" you responded Jimmy's perversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess flares up \"Are you an idiot or are just into incest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you're not related to me so it doesn't count as one\" Jimmy gave his signature grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you and Jess can only response with a facepalm \"Look Dude it's one thing for girls on girls action but taking Katie first time is not okay...EVER!!!\" you defending Jess sister purity as best you can but knowing Jimmy he won't back down until you gave him a knuckle sandwich on the head. In which you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some struggle with Jimmy you manage to strip him out from Mrs.Hunt \"Owwy that hurt be gentle please\" Jimmy jest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica insisted that you wore her mother first as a reference on how she would proceed, you proceeded as usual with inserting your legs into Mrs.Hunt. Your legs tighten to shape to how Mrs.Hunt's then proceed with the rest of her hips \"See you just wear them like a jumpsuit and\" you continue to proceed to wear her upper body \"the skin itself merge (is the word I suppose) with your own\" you explain to Jess as her mother's body take full shape excluding the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica awed to your (and mostly Jimmy) mysterious discovery, you smirk as you enjoy Jess interest peak. \"Well finally you finish it of by wearing the face\" you do so and now you are a hundred percent Mrs.Hunt physically anyways. Mrs.Hunt spin and twirls to show off your total take over her body \"Tada!\" you posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So totally unreal\" Jess's mind exploded \"So I just put my leg in...\" as she anxiously tries. \"You have to strip out your clothes first babe\" you warned Jess. She asked the reason for it and you answer her properly as you tried with your shirt on before and it didn't merge properly. Jess invite you to her parents room as nobody is occupying it at the moment obviously, like that you excitedly follow her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head after closing the door only to be rewarded with Jess stripping her short top and short pants showing off her beautiful slim body, Mrs.Hunt nipples harden in response to your interest <i>\"she as hot as ever!\"</i> you thought. She then insert her legs into her fathers and drags his hips over hers, in which the skin responds and inflate to normal as Mr.Hunt's would. Jess yip and rest her left leg on the bed to see her new hairy appendage, she grind and quickly wears the rest. Her bulbous breast poking her father's from the inside broaden, her slim abdomen inflates, her smooth silky hand buffed as her father would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Jess react to her new form \"So creepy my voice is same as daddy's\" she smirks. Jess then touch her chest and arms to check the change then stops as she reach her \"It's so wibbly\" penis. She twirls and jumps as if she controls her father's body as it were her own then halts when she sees you standing, smiling to her excitement. A pulsing sensation strike her as her wood stiffens \"So this why guys are embarrassed all the time\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an intriguing sex session you discovered the joy of the female side of intercourse, laying next on your husband or rather girlfriend chest you look at her giving her a gentle smile \"So that how girls felt on the other side\". Jessica takes hard breath from the intimacy as you listen her father's heart beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah....that was something Davie...\" she whisper to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap out of the bed and search for Jessica's parents robes, then leave the room while Jess trying to process the experience she had. You peak down the stairs only to see Jimmy eating some cereal and watching tv in the Hunt's living room. On the sofa you notice Katie's skin is left intact, you figured Jimmy would masturbate as her while you had sex \"Hey dude\" you greeted Jimmy. He only response with a huff, obviously he's angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There I didn't touch your stupid sister-in-law or whatever\" he pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look dude I know you wanna screw around but we a lot of it yesterday\" you try to reason with him \"It's not like this funny to me or I can't get it, I do but not to someone I dearly know\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy sigh \"Yeah whatever dude..\" Jimmy turn away from the tv and pull out the brown pen \"With this we can be anybody we want and hang when ever we want dude\" he suggested \"Heck! I could be the Mayor and control the town make everybody follow my wicked rules when ever I want\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you know how bills work dude\" you chuckled at Jimmy's idiotic ideas \"I don't believe the brown pen have that amount of power\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? with? the works now?\" Jessica in her father robes walking down towards the living asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should.....  </span></div></div>",

Driving along the campus roads you see college students walking, gossiping and having a grand time on the side walks and open fields. \"Oh boy! Tons of choices!\" Jimmy silently cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick drove through the main gate area to his fraternity housing area heading toward his free meals, Cuffward J. Willards. \"Cuffy\" as Nick called him is a young inheritor of his family fortunes and despite his upper bringing you would think he didn't belong with the jocks whom work hard to get the endorsement of the university but yet Cuffy is actually a fit athlete with a modest body size and a good football player to boot as Nick explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you....man crushing, bro?\" you assume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I hate the snooty douche!\" Nick angrily replies \"Just wanna use his wallet to grab some good shit\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil there is Cuffy with three of the college least studious female cheerleaders Alia, Bella and Cammie, flirting under an Oak tree. Nick parked his car in an open parking space near the tree. You four start scheming to fully enjoy the last weekend before summer starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile under oak tree, Cuffy smiled wily \"Girls, listen, I would like to bring you all to my personal villa during the break but alas I can only bring one of you\" he offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I was looking forward to it!\" Cammie, the disappointed bright blonde squirmy lifting her breast with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like it's a competition girls!\" Alia, the competitive dark brunet puff her chest in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course it is, I'm always game\" Bella, the equally competitive curly black crossing her arms and sway her hips in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoiled inheritor sigh with open palms \"That how it goes girls now excuse me. Oh! be sure to tell me when things sorted out, hmm okay.\" as he leaves the shade of the oak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cheerleaders tries to stop him Nick calls Cuffy toward the opposite side of tree. Surely enough Cuffy walk towards his teammate while holding his hair with his fingers. Nick endures Cuff's snobbishness and ask about plans about the summer in a forced manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other side of the tree, Jess walk towards the cheerleaders in argument \"Hey can I ask where is the nearest restroom?\". Alia pointed and instruct the way but Jess play off as clueless and helpless. Cammie offered to show the way but Jess plays coy and desperately ask they all to join her. At first Bella was suspicious but only to be over take by Alia whom assume her leader status of the tree and took them all to the restrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Jess and the targets moving out of sight you slowly followed them discreetly toward the restrooms from the parking space. Cuffy noticed the both you and Jimmy heading towards the direction the girls are heading to, he excuses himself from Nick only to stalled aggressively. This raises his suspicion and force his way slowly through Nick toward the direction the two suspicious boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the mirror Alia fixing her make-up diligently and the two stooges followed her as per ritual of their group. She notices Jess scrumming through her bag shifting her hands in search of something, \"What, you need a cup to pee?\" Alia smirk followed by malicious giggles from her posse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess points the black pen toward Alia \"Nah! you'll probably will\" as she zaps her and quickly zapping the cronies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jimmy walk-in after seeing the flashes only to find three skins laying on the floor, you praised Jess of her accomplishment. She poses with the pen to celebrate her victory only to be interrupted by Jimmy sequels. As Jimmy strips his shirt off you could hear Nick desperately trying to stall Cuffy, you'd surprise that Nick didn't just punch out they guy already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See hear Nickolas! I'm not sure what are you planning with those two hooligans but I assure it isn't pleasant\" Cuffy pouted as he stop a few steps away from the restrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out of the girls restroom \"There! What were you doing in there sir!\" Cuffy interrogates you. You decided that instead of catchy one lines like what Jessica did you zap Cuffy just like that, luckily no ones around to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shall we guys\" you confidently pick up the rich kid skin and clothes off the ground.    </span></div></div>",

Compare to the trio she's the shortest but most rounded with a perfect hourglass curve figure, truly she's the stereotypical definition of an airhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess walks behind you and grabs your breast, pushing with Cuffy well toned body against your back\"Oh babe, don't temp me\" she whispered while Cuffy's face hanging lifeless under her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww your head and his body.....that's hot\" you joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then lets go of her hold after a few sensual rubs with Cuffy's broad hands and proceed to wear his face over hers. Cuffy's sleek blonde hair came back to life as well his charming rich boy face, Jess hums and coughed to test out her new pristine vocals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Alia confused looking down at her body \"Something wrong Nick?\" you asked while stretching Bella's right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia's body is really should be proud of, her silky straight long hair reaching half of her back, doll like face with perfect size lips and razor like eyes, her skinny and tall model-like body and legs also B size breast are all wanted traits for a professional cheerleader. You wonder how she did all those flips and routine without breaking like a twig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick explains that he's not that hungry anymore but he was before, you explained that Alia's body is feeling not his. You suggested that he should probably eat something without her skin on. Nick theorize that maybe if he took off her face he might get back his hunger \"Huh?! I guess that works\" his theory proven correctly. The sight of Nick bulk head on Alia is nauseatingly weird that or its Bella's anorexia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay bozos, lets get dress and get something fancy to eat courtesy of mister money banks there\" as Nick points at Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you head out from the restroom in cheerleaders outfits that the previous wearer wore except of one Mr. Willards he came with his own Italian suit. The passersby didn't bet an eye as a man and three ladies just walk out the woman's bathroom just to show how Cuffy can get away with these kind of behavior. Nick immediately reach out to his car trunk and dump the group clothes inside his empty sports bag then proceed to the driver seat while the rest of you took your previous seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Wait how am I gonna drive?\" Nick finally noticed his different point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um can't she drive?\" you asked Nick \"How the heck should I know, I never seen her drive anywhere\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that all the cheerleaders didn't have their credentials or purses with them you turned to Jess hoping Cuffy brings his wallet everywhere. As luck would have he does have it with his driver license \"But I can't drive guys\" she responded sticking out her tongue. Everybody sighed except for Jimmy fondling his new boobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remember the brown pen abilities to give perfect memories and personalities of the skin, you search Jess purse that you holding on as it would look weird if Cuffy was holding it on earlier. You explain the pen double-edge properties only to be insulted by Jimmy how much a wuss you are. He suggested that everyone should get zap by it so that they are comfortable with their new bodies, surely enough caution is thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gurl! this pen will never be aite with me\" you express your dissatisfaction on using the brown pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so skanky\" Alia shivers with her own disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please girls, nothing is more arousing than being me\" Cuffy snorted \"Is it strange that now I have the urge to sleep with you all tonight?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammie suddenly hugs him \"Well it wouldn't be the first time\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it would be hard to be yourself while under the effect of the brown pen but its easier to do this time around, Jimmy jokingly theorize that since the girls weren't the strongest personalities to begin with. Although it having an opposite effect on Jess, she assured you that she can handle mister money bags.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Urgh! Okay now everybody is the person they should be\" you demanded attention from the confuse group \"Bro can you now drive us outta here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess so Bel....but the seat a bit far for me\" she confides to you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"......Adjust your seat please\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuffy clear his throat \"Or I could drive, and I just know where to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she's offering or you could trust your brother to do this.</span></div></div>",

You also notice the large and erect nipples. You then finish the process but pulling over her face. You feel mature, sexy, womanly, and in control. You feel like confident. You feel like the sexist person in the room. You feel like Julia Martinez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jez, man I thought I would have time to run to grab food in Julia's car and get back and you'd still be feeling your skin.\" \"Shut it\" Julia says, or wait...you said. You nipples that lost their hardness momentarily became erect again out of pure arousal from the accent you never had. That voice. That damn voice that had yelled, complimented, scolded, taught, and aroused you...is now yours. 'Trish just laughs and hands you Ms. Martinez's panties and skirt. \"C'mon Julia, I've got all the tutoring I need for today. I always respected you and wanted to hang out with you.\" You give a smirk and pull up the black panties up your shapely, smooth legs. You feel the pull and constraint on your very large butt. You turn around to see a large hump on your back side. Sitting will be interesting...and fun. You grab her black bra and attempt to put it on. Jimmy takes out Trish's phone and starts to record you. \"Dude, stop that. Seriously.\" \"Relax Bruh, I'm sending it to me and then deleting it.\" After 2 minutes more of frustration, Jimmy takes out a white pen and shoots you. You have pain you've never experienced before. Your head feels like it's been studying for finals for 2423 weeks straight. Then...you relax and remember your childhood in La Ciudad de Mexico y sus padres. Necesito ir a la supermercado para obtener papas y maiz. Su hermanita pido si puedo ir a la gym. Wait...you what the fuck. \"Dios mio.....Jimmy...I'm Julia...realmente.\" Trish chuckles and explains how the white pen gives your her memories and personality. You then go back to putting on the bra with ease. You then button up her white shirt. You are still extremely aroused so your large nipples are showing through your bra and shirt. \"Jez Dav don't stab me\" Trish comments, enjoying the view. You nod and then leave and head to Ms. Martinez's car. You sit in the car.....oh man...sitting...with that ass...oh my...it's like having a pillow... \"DAVID, please drive.\" \"Lo siento...jajaja\" You are going to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both decide to go work out...mostly to see the other women...in the locker room. Trish had brought her workout gear and you luckily Julia was planning on going to the gym post tutoring. You park and enter the gym without problem. You see a classmate who looks a Jimmy/Trish oddly noting she is working out with her Spanish teacher. You hold back some laugher. You enter the changing rooms and take out her outfit. Some yoga paints and a sports bra. You see a tank top also in the bag but you ignore it. You feel like the king/queen of the world. You also notice that other women who were attractive in their own right...don't even compare to Julia. Trish seems to ignore this and just appreciate the multiple views. Trish brought spandex and a tight t shirt. You slip out of your skirt and pull up the yoga pants. Boy...do they feel great. They are just so comfortable... Not to mention they make your lower body look like a Greek Goddess. Your butt is so fucking big. It shows in the pants. You give it a feel and also slide your hand inside the pants and just squeeze. Trish is too busy being Jimmy. You then slip out of her shirt and bra revealing those massive nipples and boobs. You squeeze. You can't help it. Some older women next to you gives you a weird look and switches her locker. You smile and push back your long, black hair. You didn't notice it almost touches your large ass. You find a sometime to tie it into a ponytail and then leave the room with Trish. You feel so weird and comfortable at the same time. You feel really odd showing this much skin. This can't be normal, but it is. You get more looks from both girls and guys. For very different reasons of course. You smile with your pearly white teeth, mutter something in spanish, and head to your workout. Trish follows admiring your ass. You also like the feeling of your breasts moving within your bra and your ass moving with your hips. The sway makes your nipples hard...again...and this time they are clearly on display since you are only wearing a black sports bra. You tap both of them with your painted and manicured nails. In the words of Ice Cube, Today was a good day. You take out your headphones and Ms. Martinez's phone. You're not really a huge fan of the songs. You pull up your soundcloud and start listening to \"Know yourself\" by Drake. Ironic right? Hearing Ms. Martinez sing your favorite songs lyrics all why break a sweat...and wear yoga pants...and sit. God, sitting is fantastic. </span></div></div>",

Now with the pen in your possession, you were able to scrutinize the item. It was black, with a dark blue-ish gem on its 'clicker' side. Golden engraving decorated the length of its body. However, there was a small button just below the 'clicker' made from a black gem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes, you point that side and press the black button.'', your mother instructed you, referring to the clicker side. ''Whoa, don't point it at me dude!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed it against the door, suddenly a small whirring sound emanated from the ballpoint pen. You half-expected a red laser dot to appear, but there was nothing on the door. ''You need a target dude.'', your mom's face sported another silly grin.

You proceeded to watch in shock and Jimmy (in your mom's skin) with delight as Claire's body began to fold in on itself, collapsing like a deflated blow-up doll. There was no comical hissing sound like you were expecting, but she did just collapse in on herself as her body hollowed out.. \"Holy shit!\" you blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See!! I told ya, that shit is wicked!\" Jimmy exclaimed in your mother Marie's voice, slapping your back and making his tits jiggle a little. He then jumped to his feet and walked over to Claire's empty skin, seperating it from her clothes and flats. \"Here, try it on.\" he said, throwing your sister's skin to you. You weren't sure what to think as Claire landed on your lap. Her skin was still warm to the touch and had a slight rubbery texture to it, at least for now. There was a hole in the nape of her neck that was stretchable. As Jimmy pointed out, that was the entry point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is my sister! And you want me to wear her?\" you grumbled, looking up into your mother's grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not. I wore my mom earlier, and my aunt.\" Jimmy shrugged, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a horny little shit, that's why.\" you informed Jimmy, who couldn't very well deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, put her on, and you can take her off straight away if you want.\" Jimmy explained, goading you to do it. Eventually you relented and began stripping out of your clothes, which you felt nervous doing given your 'mother's' presence. Even if it was just Jimmy wearing her skin. When you were ready you then stretched the hole in Claire's deflated skin and began stepping into it, one leg at a time. As each part of your body entered your sister's empty, corresponding parts, you felt a tingling sensation, and the 'melting away' of your manhood was by far the weirdest experience, though the moment when your sister's tit sacks inflated on your chest was strange too... yet exciting too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my daughter.\" Jimmy joked, once you had fuly donned your sister's skin. \"How's she feel?\" he then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared down in amazement at your naked, female body and then grabbed your boobs in your manicured hands. \"Wow! This feels awesome!\" you admitted, peering down at your 'mons veneris'... and further to your moistening, pink pussy. You reached around to the back of your neck and was somewhat scared to realize that the hole had disappeared once you had 'become one' with your sister's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you just have to zap yourself again to take the skin off.\" Jimmy reassured you. \"Here, get dressed, don't want you catching cold dude.\" Jimmy then said, throwing you Claire's clothes and shoes before buttoning his own blouse back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not believe what you were doing, wearing your younger sister's skin, while conspiring with your friend Jimmy... in your mother's skin. \"Time for a mother/daughter shopping spree I think.\" Jimmy laughed. \"Lets hit up the mall.\" he said. It was still weird hearing your mother's voice talking like your best friend always did.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She noticed your mom, ''What Mo...'', she never finished her sentence as your reflex made you click the button involuntarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few seconds were the most unreal moments in your life yet, as you saw your elder sister's face contorted, folding on itself and the rest of her body followed, before what seemed like her skin and her clothes crumpled to the floor. Everyone froze, but Jimmy must've heard Claire also bounding upstairs, your mom retrieved the crumpled heap and threw it at you, before she gave a wink and went out to greet Claire, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately threw the heap away from yourself, onto your bed. The more you looked at the grotesque skin-like object, you felt more faint and knowing that the skin used to be your elder sister was even more nauseating.

Eventually you choose to just sit on your office chair and stay on your desktop for a while till Jimmy comes home. Searching for anything online that could help you better understand that pen device of Jimmy\u2019s. Speaking of which, you wondered where it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of your room and into your mother\u2019s room you search around for the pen device only to realize it's not there. You spend another 5 minutes looking around your house wondering if you misplaced it somewhere somehow \"dammit where the hell is it?...\" you say out loud with a panicked tone. Eventually you come to the conclusion that Jimmy must have the pen, there\u2019s no other explanation as to where it could be. With a small sense of disappointment and anxiety about what will happen in the next few hours you sit back down to your computer and aimlessly surf the internet with the skin suit of your older sister a few feet away from you on your bed, which did slightly creep you out since it felt like another person\u2019s in the room with you but there isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you hear the sound of your front door opening and closing as your mother\u2019s high heels could be heard down stairs against the wooden floor. You open your door slightly and pop your head out of it watching the top of the stairs waiting for Jimmy wearing your mom\u2019s skin to come up stairs so you two can figure out what\u2019s going on and what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange.....\" you mumble to yourself. Your kid sister Claire is usually the first to race up the stairs to get back to her room but for some reason you can't hear her down stairs at all. \"Jimmy, you better not have done anything to her.\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to make your way down stairs to your mother who you can still hear walking around downstairs in heels, which is strange since you don't remember your mom wearing them when Jimmy left with Clair. \"Has he been clothes shopping?\" you thought. When you're downstairs you see your mother in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo dude, about time you're back from the mall. I got your text and no, I didn't try it yet. The skins still upstairs by the way.\" you told her. \"Also where the heck is Claire? Please don't tell me you've lost her, or worse...\" you say worried. You also notice your mother or Jimmy inside of her, has bought new clothes that he's now wearing on her. Which consists of new black heels, black tights and a charcoal coloured casual dress. Which in all honesty makes her kinda look quite hot in a milf type of way, as strange as it is for you thinking this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother looks at you and smiles in a strange way \"Well, dude.... Claire\u2019s safe and sound if you must know, and she's doing better than ever. I think she'll be having a very good day today.\" She says to you in a childish giddy tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean man? Where is she?\" you ask slightly frantically<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, at that moment you see your mothers manicured hands reach the back of her head and grip what you assume is the zipper for the suit and you hear it zip down to what looks like the bottom of the neck. Still with a grin on her face you witness the strange sight as your mothers face begins to slacken as her two hands begin to pull her face forward as it loses all facial expressions and now looks like a mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your mothers face is off you stand in absolute shock as you now see the head of your younger sister Claire on top of your mother\u2019s body with her face dangling on her chest letting her long brown hair messily sway with the littlest movement. \"CLAIRE!? Wh-what the fuck?! How did you-.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get inside of moms skin? Well, it's a funny little story of how I've become mom and how I've come across this gem.\" she says to you as she reaches into her bosom working past moms deflated head and hair and pulls out the pen device. \"Oh and I also decided to get out of moms casual clothes as they're not really my taste and wear something a little more sexier. I mean might as well look good if you're going to wear someone right?\" she tells you. \"And besides, moms got a really nice body for her age, might as well make it look sexy. I mean look at these breasts, feels so good to have these baby\u2019s rather than my small ones that\u2019s for sure!\" she says as she uses her stolen hands to give them a little squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where\u2019s Jimmy at Claire?\" you ask puzzled to this all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your creepy friend? Yeah, he's in there.\" she tells you pointing at a big clothes shop bag, then picking it up, opening it pointing it towards you she shows you your deflated friends skin bundled in a messy pile slightly buried under your mothers old clothes she was wearing when Jimmy was wearing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Claire... I mean... I err... I don't really know what to say right now.\" You tell her dumbfounded. \u201cI really never expected this to tell you the truth, and I'm even impressed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks big bro, I was tempted to zap you but I think I won't, for now....\" she says winking in a cheeky way \"I'm guessing Tina is up stairs as a skin suit right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jimmy pretty much made me zap her in the heat of the moment, I swear I never wore her though!\" you tell her. \"How did pull this all off anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it started when I was leaving with 'Mom' to go to the mall and ......\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Erm, Sweetie! Quick let's go to the mall, my treat!\" she tells you. Which sounds too good to be true, but if it's free then you want it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way downstairs you and your mom quickly close the front door and make your way to her car. It feels good getting to ride in the front with Mom for a change. Once you're both in you notice Mom's hesitant to start the vehicle and is looking at all the parts like she\u2019s never been in the car before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr mom, are you ok?\" you ask her concerned about this strange behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er yeah I'm fine Clair bear! err yeah everything\u2019s coooool...\" She strangely replies back, which is pretty odd for Mom. For starters she never calls you Clair bear, which sounds like something a creepy guy would say to you to try and be cute. And the way she replied was pretty odd since it almost didn't sound like that was her that's saying that.<br>\r\nEventually she starts the car and with some fumbling she manages to get the car on the road and on the way to the mall, her driving reminds you like someone who has a provisional and is still taking lessons or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the mall and the car is parked. You two quickly make your way into the mall for a shopping spree hopefully, if not then you'll be happy with just light shopping session, you also hope moms going to buy you some lunch at the food court too. \"Where to first Mom?\" you ask excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go clothes shopping first!\" she says back. You two move into a major clothes retailer store and walk to the escalators when your mother keeps on walking to the downstairs elevator for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, where are you going? It's upstairs to the women\u2019s section, downstairs takes you to men\u2019s section.\" you tell her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah right of course! How silly of me sweetie, just me, your mom being a klutz I guess haha\" she says laughing it off. She's been acting really weird today you've noticed, probably best to keep an eye on her today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you two find clothes you want to try on and you both go into separate changing rooms that are 2 rooms away from each other, the store is relatively quiet but there\u2019s a decent amount of people in the store and a few in the changing rooms around you, you and your mother are in the 2 at the end of the corridor of changing rooms. When you're inside your room you quickly change out of your skinny jeans and try on the black coloured pair of skinny jeans you got, they look good, and of course they show off your ass nicely, even though you're only 16 you have somewhat of an ass for your age, but nothing much in terms of breast size. But hopefully age can change that, besides in terms of raw looks and style you biasedly rank yourself high for your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're undressing the skinny jeans and putting your own back on you stop to focus on hearing what sounds like a zipping sound, which didn't seem to bother you until you heard a flurry of other sounds, you can't seem to make out what they are at the moment, it seemed to be coming from the changing room nearest to yours which is your mothers. Leaving your shoes off you stay in your socks so you don't make any noise while moving, you sneakily move outside of your changing room since they're only separated by a heavy thick curtain you make sure not to move it much trying not to make any sounds from the rings scrapping against the pole like they usually do when people move the curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but  steadily walking to your mothers changing room you can hear mumblings that sound like a teenage guy from what you can tell, as well as fleshy skin sounds. Curious to learn what\u2019s making them you angle your head to the open slit in the curtain while keeping a death grip on the wooden parts that separate each curtain. Once you get a good look you see what can only be described as the freakiest thing you've ever saw in the 16 years you've been on this planet, your mothers naked lower body is standing in the middle of the changing room with what looks like a male teenagers upper body attached to the lower body. You feel sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome creeper is actually wearing your mom, this is actually making you want to faint. Like your mother, is actually some sort of skin like suit. You painfully keep watching until you notice who it is wearing her, its Jimmy. The little freak is actually behind it all. \"Fucking Jimmy, why does David have to make friends with absolute creeps and idiots.....\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the floor littered with your mothers discarded clothing and the skirt left on the bench inside the changing room next to your mother\u2019s bag, clearly she hasn't tried it out yet. Painfully and curiously you continue to watch as you might be about to discover the next amazing thing of century if people are able to wear each other\u2019s skin. Jimmy then continues to work off the lower half of your mother\u2019s body off as the front half is naked and dangling in front of the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Here we go, gotcha off eventually...</font>\"  he whispers to himself. He has the complete skin suit of your mother off and turns to her bag, he rummages through it and picks out what looks like some sort of pen device.<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"> \"Damn, hard to believe this beauty did this all... can't wait to get back to David... I better text him after I'm done babysitting his brat sister clothes shopping and crap. Jeeze the things I do for David.... he better have worn Tina already. Maybe I'll ask him if... no, I'll demand that we have lesbian sex as daughter and mother.... ohhh yeah that's gonna be sooooo hot...\"</font> He whispers to himself and has even from the looks of it gotten a boner from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, the little creep hasn't even got a decent sized dick, and no wonder he's single.\" You think to yourself while smirking.  Whatever that pen is it's what made Mom into a skin suit you assume. You need it. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only do you want to enact revenge on Jimmy for wearing your mother.... but a more selfish and sexual side of you wants it just....because. You're 16 and you will admit you are a little spoilt at times, wanting things your way, and wanting the latest tech let it be i-phone or tablet. But you know in your heart right now, that you want that piece of tech, it's too good to be in the greasy hands of that naked little creep, and it needs to be owned by someone with a little class at least. And that person should be you, you mentally self-elect to yourself. Now that the need and passion for wanting it is ingrained in you, you need to obtain it without becoming whatever mom became by the hands of Jimmy of all people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he tosses the pen back onto the bench and luckily for you manages to slide across the smooth bench nearer to the entrance of the changing room. You watch as he's checking your moms phone for Texts you assume, while he's flicking through her phone you decide now is the best chance you'll ever have to get the pen. Quietly you change sides till you\u2019re at the other end by the slit in the heavy curtain. Gently moving it enough not to make any sounds through the scraping of the curtain rings but enough to squeeze your thankfully 16 year old female body through till you're in the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jimmy put your moms phone back into her bag he stops for a second to quickly turn around towards you and looks at you dead on in shock while he's still naked, which is extremely awkward for you both. There is an awkward 5 seconds of silence before you quickly snatch up the pen off the bench and aim it at Jimmy before he can make any major movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP! don't you dear make a move Jimmy!\" You say to him in a slightly elevated tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok jeeze calm down Claire. Ok you got me haha.\" he strangely says with a smile, while he's still naked and has an erection, it isn't a particularly big dick while hard so it's nothing to stare at or even consider decent. If anything you'd imagine it's below average. \"Ok, look I know this might seem all strange but you gotta calm down Clair, it's me Katie!\" He says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Katie? How..?\" you suspiciously say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I found this pen device thing and errrm, I was like totally on my way to your place when this creeper I'm wearing right now like totally tried to hit on me. So I was like 'ew, gross, get away from me' so I like totally zapped him and thought like, why not wear him now that he's like a skin suit right? So I errrr, I got to your house and was like totally gonna surprise you, but decided to do it twice as good so I like totally wore your mom to like surprise you twice as good and stuff, you know?\" Jimmy or apparently Katie pleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then 'Katie', then why did I just watch and hear you talk about how you're going to have incest sex with David while in my mom? Sounds like something Jimmy would say.\" You bring up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well that's like totally.....errrn... fuck this...just give me that pen you little bitch!\" Jimmy lunges at you but you reduce him into a pile of flesh on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coooooool. This thing is pretty neat.\" you say to yourself. Now that Jimmy\u2019s been taken care of, where do you go from here you wondered? Picking up your mother\u2019s skin suit from the floor you examined it. \"Hmmm, looks just like her too, amazing....\" you say dumbfounded.  Placing it on the bench next to her bag you get her clothes and neatly place them on the bench and hangers in the changing room. Picking up Jimmy\u2019s skin, you examine his too, although you're really not impressed with it at all. It has got you a little curious what it would be like to be a guy, have a penis, and what it feels like for them.... you're a naturally curious girl, not to mention a surprisingly Horney one too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Curiosity getting the better of you, you quickly strip out of your clothes, place them in a neat pile on the floor. Now standing in the room naked with Jimmy\u2019s skin in your hands you bite your lip and you venture fourth into he unknown. Noticing a thin slit spanning the top of the neck to the bottom of the back you open it up and begin to don the creeper that is Jimmy Wilson. Starting with your right leg you slip your smooth hairless feminine leg into Jimmy\u2019s pale hairy legs, noticing how warm the skin still is and how the more you move your body into the skin how your body becomes his, you eventually slot your whole leg into his and wiggle your new toes. \"No wayyyyy, this is fucking awesome! I can see now why he was loving it.\" Continuing on you do the same for your left leg until you have two male legs now, you begin to pull his hips over your own curvy soft hips and push your crotch into his own, pushing your smooth pussy into his crotch you feel a strange ripple of change go through your body as you now feel something between your legs as well as not feeling your peachy ass anymore as it's been replaced by a flatter male one. \"Oh god... it's gone... and I-I have a penis now... this is so crazy!\" you whisper to yourself. Looking at yourself in the mirror you can still see your upper half of your naked body sitting on top of a pale male teenage lower half, you can't see your new package as the dangling upper half of Jimmy is covering it. Continuing on you grab Jimmy\u2019s torso and begin to slot your thin delicate right arm into Jimmy\u2019s pale one until it becomes yours, doing the same for the left one you throw his shoulders over your own and push your chest into his, there strangely isn't a huge change in feeling with your new torso as you only had petite breasts. Zipping up the zipper from the bottom of your back to the bottom of your neck making sure not to snag any of your long soft brown hair on it you begin to finish the transformation into Jimmy, you take a deep breath before taking Jimmy\u2019s head and placing it over your own, it's dark for a second and you align your eyes with his, then you vision changes to normal, only it's not your version of normal. Since you're now fully Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing... oh wow, I even have his voice!\" you say gazing at your new male body \"Heck I am Jimmy now.\" you smile in the mirror but stop since it turned out to be the same creepy smile you've seen him do countless times. Although his body isn't anything impressive and in your books it'd be counted as below average everything, you still wore him for the simple reason that you're curious to see what it's like to be a guy and you want to masturbate as one, even if you have to do it as the slimy creep that was wearing your mother. It's all the same to you, just as long as he has a dick that\u2019s all you care about. It's surprising you how Horney you're being over it, but you don't care at the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, let\u2019s get started.\" you say in your new lower male voice. Moving to your mother\u2019s bag you search for two things, and find them, hand moisturiser and a pack of tissues. This is exactly what you need, you also grab your mother\u2019s cardigan also. Placing the cardigan on the floor in front of the mirror you sit down on it so theres a warm seat for you on the floor,  you whip out the hand moisturiser and squirt some into your pale hands, rubbing them together you then grab hold of your floppy member and begin to rub on it. \"I hope I'm doing it right.\" you think to yourself. After some time of rubbing and lubricating your now hardened penis you then begin to build up a pace as you begin to pump your new moistened member.<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"> \"oh, oh ooh, this feels nice, and it's so easy too.\"</font> you say to yourself quietly. Wanting to reach a climax quicker you look into the mirror while doing so, it kind of creeps you out still having to look back and see the pale visage which is Jimmy, you've never been fond of him but you\u2019re sure as hell enjoying masturbating with his mediocre sized member, eventually you feel yourself ready to cum and you whip out several tissues in your hand, when you do begin to cum you release it all into the tissue bundle you're holding. \"Oh, ohhhh... oh yeahh... oh.. Wow...\" you bask in the amazing feeling of Cumming as a guy for the first time, though short it was an amazing new experience. \"Totally... worth it...\" you say between breathes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've cleaned up all the bodily fluids, you bundle them and throw them in the corner of the room. You're just about done as Jimmy.  And just like the wrapping to a chocolate bar, after you've gotten what you wanted from inside it, it's now useless to you. Stripping yourself out of Jimmy\u2019s skin you put it on a hanger like a coat and now decide what to do next. Since your mothers skin is still besides you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real choice was to become your mother, and its choice you actually were looking forward to. Becoming your mother not only do you become much older but you gain access to spending money, you're in charge of the household but you also get an amazing set of breasts. You are slightly envious of your mother\u2019s breasts, although slightly saggy they're still big and eye catching for men you'd assume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up your mothers skin you being to don it, this time not that crazy of a change since shes the same gender as you but when you place her head over your own you notice how you've grown taller by a decent amount and the new overall weight you carry. Your new motherly body is chubby in areas, but you like that. \"Hello, I'm Marie Anderson, and Claire Anderson is my favourite child out of all my kids. Wow, this is actually pretty surreal...\" you say in your mother voice. Giving your new breasts a quick play with you begin to get dressed in her clothes. When you're dressed fully you grab your old clothes and jimmy\u2019s skin and place it in a shopping bag from another store you bought something from before reaching this store and then you grab you mothers bag most of all the pen and place it in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this has been a really interesting mall shopping experience.\" you say to yourself in the mirror with as your mom. \"I got some new clothes and stuff you know, the usual. Oh and I got a pen device that turns people into skin suits you can wear, got to experience what it's like to jack off as a guy for the first time and now I\u2019m wearing the skin of my mother. The very person I came out of and I'm back into her.\" you chuckle to yourself. You still can't believe that this has happened to you, but it has, and now it's opened a ton of avenues for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you walk out of the changing rooms you paid for the skinny jeans you wanted as well as some other clothes you decided to snag for yourself and your new body that you're wearing you make a quick outfit change in the ladies bathroom. Walking back to your car you now have a smile plastered across your face. New clothes to add to the wardrobe and two skin suits you own in your possession, as well as the pen that makes it all happen. Maybe you can grow your collection of skin suits like your wardrobe? It's a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving up to your house, you park your car in your drive way and then get out carrying a few bags. Walking towards the front door, the click sounds from your new heels you've bought for your mother\u2019s body while you're wearing her, you feel amazingly sexy and powerful. You open the door to a quiet house. \"Big bro's gonna be shocked when he finds out....or should I so my sons going to be shocked when he finds out.\" you chirp to yourself with a cheeky grin on your face. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*David\u2019s POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's basically how it all happened.\" Claire tells you, finishing her story of how she ended up with the pen in her possession as well as mom\u2019s body and Jimmy\u2019s skin suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow....\" you're nearly speechless. \u201cSo like, what are you going to do now then Claire?\" you ask, with a hint of nervousness in your voice, you hope you doesn't zap you. You don't want to end up in the bottom of a bag all crumpled into a ball like dirty laundry. You ultimately don't want to end up in Jimmy\u2019s position, although he is your friend and you'd like to help him, you can't right at the moment since the balance of power isn't in your favour. You're just thinking about your own safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't quite figured that out yet but...\" she stops talking to pick up your mothers head and place it over her own until she is fully Marie Anderson again. \"I think I'll be staying in mom\u2019s body for a while longer.\" She places her mature hands on the top of her thick silky thighs and slowly moves them up her body sensually feeling it up until you gets to her big breasts to which you try not to directly look at as she starts squeezing them for a few seconds. \"Yeah, I think I'll be Mom for a while longer.\" she smiles devilishly looking back up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh ok, yeah sure Claire, wear Mom as long as you like, keep Jimmy too if you want, god only knows you'll be keeping him out of trouble this way right haha\" you joke with her. You feel horrible selling out on Jimmy like this but you know it's right to an extent, and you needed to suck up to Claire right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina's skin? Where is it?\" she asks you in her stolen voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tina? Yeah she\u2019s upstairs, I can go get her if you'd like?\" you offer your services to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, be a good boy and do that for mommy Davie.\" she jokingly says to you slyly playing into her new role as mom. It makes you cringe slightly knowing that it's actually Claire saying that. But with haste you dash up stairs and quickly scoop up your big sisters skin suit making sure no clothes fall off the skin. When you get downstairs you see your mom unpacking her older clothes and putting them into the washing basket, noticing she\u2019s taken off her new heels and is now bare footed with tights on. You also notice she\u2019s taken jimmy\u2019s skin out of the bag and placed it on the breakfast bar hanging half way off, his lifeless drooping face and deflated genitals in plain sight, not a pretty one that\u2019s for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Claire, here\u2019s Tina\u2019s skin.\" you say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks Davie!\" she says happy to see it. You hand her the skin suit and watch as she quickly takes the clothes off it and throws them on the couch besides you and just begins to examine the naked skin suit of your older sister with a glare in her eye. You awkwardly stand beside her just watching your mother doing this like some sort of aide, totally afraid if you show any sort of free will or desire to escape or even fear you'll be the next skin in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she finishes and throws the skin on the couch with the rest of the clothes and turns to you with a stern look, which on your mothers face has always since childhood slightly intimidated you. \"Look David, this is how it's going to work now. This pens mine now, not Jimmy\u2019s, not yours or anyone else\u2019s, but mine. You got that?\" she coldly says to you not breaking eye contact while you can barely maintain it, but you have to be strong right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah sure Claire, w-whatever you want, it's all cool...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks a little closer to you closing the distance till you're nearly face to face with her. \"Good.\" she smiles, then continues \"Also, I'm going to go straight out and say this now David, this pen has a lot of potential for all sorts of experiences and feelings to be felt. So I'm going to be having a lot of sex as a result of this pen. It could be as Dad, Mom, Tina, Jimmy, Jessica, your friend Tina, Katie, any random guy or any random girl. It could even be you if I wanted to fuck someone using your dick. So don't be surprised if I do something spontaneous.\" Just as she says that she quickly grabs your hand and places it on her left tit. You freeze up immediately, not wanting to resist since you didn't want to anger her but not wanting to get into it because well... that\u2019s your mom\u2019s breast your hand is on. And you're just not comfortable doing such a thing, not yet anyway, if she keeps doing things like this and stays in your moms skin you probably will have to get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire still having a tight grip on your wrist she maneuvers your hand in a circular motion caressing her breast for about 5 seconds until she stops and let\u2019s go. <br>\r\n\"See what I mean, stuff like that, if I want to do it it'll happen.\" she says to you, also she quickly notices your boner you got from that but says nothing but smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Claire, maybe a little warning next time. Don't you find what you're doing to be a little strange? You know, like wearing mom as a suit and stuff?\" you ask her, trying to appeal to a side of her that could possibly reason with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did at first when I saw your slimy little friend in this nice bod. But now I'm wearing her myself and have the pen for my own. I kind of understand why he did it.\" she replies to you, clearly not having any of your emotional reasoning. \"Now listen up David, what your role is going to be in all of this is my aide, my side kick, my right hand man.\" she giggles \"You're going to be aiding me in expanding my skin suit wardrobe, that's right, I want to collect as many skins as I can get away with, and you're going to help me like the good son you are.\" she smirks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh ok, so then, what happens after you've gotten a ton of skin suits?\" you curiously ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we experiment, do all sorts. Sex as different people, different genders, the amount possibilities and different sexual scenarios we can make from this David are numerous. And I'm a Horney girl you know David.\" she chirps at you \"So, you better believe I'm going to fuck like there\u2019s no tomorrow, as all sorts of people to all sorts of people. That's why you're going to be doing it with me David. If I want you to wear Tina and let me fuck you as Jimmy, you'll do that, and you'll most likely enjoy it regardless if you're repulsed by the idea. Otherwise you'll be just another skin to the collection. Do you understand, David?\" you tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I understand Claire. So basically we're turning our house into a 2 man orgy house where our family and friends being worn by us fuck each other senseless just for the experience and feeling. Sounds, just peachy.\" you say with a plain unimpressed face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it won't just be us two, hopefully if she\u2019s on bored my bff Katie is going to get in on it, so we can have some pretty sexy three-ways.\" she says noticing your lack of enthusiasm \u201cOh cheer up David, you'll be having fun and you know, at least now you'll be able to feel like what it's like to put your dick into something that isn't Jessica.\" she says to you. \"Oh, and don't you dare text anyone what\u2019s going on or try and ruin this now David, be lucky I spared you and let you in on this.\" she says to you more seriously \"I'll wear you and be sure to ruin your social life if you dare fuck with me on this, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever I guess.\" you say back to her.  After that discussion and now that you know your where you stand with Claire and what\u2019s going to unfold, you just brace yourself for the worst and best and go back into your room and lay on your bed, you can tell your day is just getting started now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a knock on your door half an hour later after hearing the sound of Claire moving from room to room for the past 20 minutes. You go towards the door to answer it. Opening the door you're surprised to see Claire in her normal form at the door, dressed very lightly with only pyjama shorts on and a tank top, you can see her nipples outlined by the tank top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, good to see you still up and ready, I've sorted this all out and would like you to see.\" she shows you going to her parents room \"Mom and dad\u2019s room will be my new room as I'm head of the house hold now, everyone else besides you and me are just skins to be worn.\" she says with little remorse for Tina and Mom which shocks you. \"In the clothes wardrobe I\u2019ve moved a lot of dads and moms clothes to make space to hang up my new collection of skins, as you can see the current ones.\" There in front of you the skin suits of your mother, older sister and good friend Jimmy hung up with pants hangers, it almost shocked you to see this sight, but you assume it's Claire\u2019s new vision for it all. Best just to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've converted all the other rooms besides yours to fuck pads, also, you're not to take any skin without my permission David, I do have the pen with me at all times also, so don't get any ideas of me misplacing it.\" she tells you as a warning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, very errr... interesting Claire.\" you reply, not too sure how to respond as your kid sister has basically turned your house hold into a sort of strange skin suits orgy house that you, her and probably her best friend are going to be using for all of the weekend until Claire figures out what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok good. Also don't go in my new room without my permission either.\" she tells you while closing the door, you both go down stairs and sit in the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Claire, what do you want to do now?\" you curiously ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could either go out now with bags and collect more skin suits, or have fun now with the skins we have already.\" she tells you, thinking for a second Claire opens her mouth and replies that you two should.....  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Claire\u2019s is like an amplified version of it, you never knew your kid sister was so perverted, sex crazed and Horney. You always knew that teenagers have the feeling of wanting to fuck a lot while growing up past that phase but it seems like the pen is the key to a dungeon inside of Claire that seemed like it's been able to really shine now. It almost intimidated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, I guess if that\u2019s what you want to.\" you reply <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here David. I'm going to go get us some bags to store the skins in, we'll be hauling at least 4 or 5 skins back from this journey.\" she tells you then quickly goes up stairs to get two bags leaving you alone down stairs in the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently sitting on the couch near to the front door, you look at it and think. You could do it. You could just run now and she wouldn't be able to catch you or find you if you really wanted to be gone, since you do have your phone and wallet on you now, you have more than enough money in the bank to get a motel room somewhere and just.... hide from your sexual deviant of a sister. But you know that she'd fuck with you in spite, because she doesn't like to lose and if she can't have her own way she, like a typical spoilt teenage girl will try and fuck with you as much as she can. Thinking about the possible things she could do, she could ruin your two best friends lives by wearing them and fucking with their social lives, or even worse she could get a hold of Jessica and do the same.... you didn't think the repercussions outweighed the positives. The only way you'd do it is if you're going to go about it totally selfishly and just think about your own survival, but alas you're not at that point, not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she comes down stairs with two duffle bags, one of them Nick's, your older brother who is currently at college and the other one your mother uses when she occasionally goes to the gym.  \"Ok Davie, here.\" she throws you Nick's duffle bag, you also notice she\u2019s changed out of her clothes she had before and now has some more casual clothes on, but still comfortable clothes, she\u2019s not dressing to impress at the minute since she knows it'll be a quick in and out thing. She's now wearing some black leggings, a tank top with a hoodie over it and some grey flats too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both go out the front door and she locks up. \"Ok where to first then Claire?\" you ask her with a constant tone of a unimpressed attitude in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I say we go to Jimmy\u2019s house first, I thought this out strategically, since I've already got Jimmy\u2019s skin, we might as well get his mother and older sister if she\u2019s in the house too. Since they'll be worried about him if he doesn't come back home to them, basically getting the loot and taking the alarm too, if there\u2019s no one to raise any major alarms them I can get away with it all for longer. Basically, you take one, you have to take the whole set.\" she explains to you. You're actually really impressed, she really has thought about how she\u2019s going to go about it decently well, you doubt you would of have figured that out yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, that's actually pretty smart sis.\" you say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro.\" she proudly says with a grin. \"Oh if you're also wondering about our family since not everyone is a skin suit yet, well I'll be sure to zap dad when he gets back from work tonight since it's a Friday, and we don't have to worry about Nick since he's at college now. And you, you're part of this all now David, so you'll be sure to stick around right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah of course, for sure.\" you say with a feeling of uncertainty in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the relatively short walk to Jimmy\u2019s house she makes you knock on the door, while she hides to the side of the front door. After half a minute you're greeted by Mrs Wilson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hello David! If you're looking for Jimmy I'm afraid he's still out, he said he was going to your house if I remembered correctly?\" she tells you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh errm, oh no I'm actually here to pick up something I left here if that\u2019s ok?\" you ask her hoping she'll let you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sweetie! Just have to warn you Jimmy\u2019s bedroom is a bit of a jungle at the minute so good luck finding it. I mean I was in the middle of cleaning his room when I think I must have blacked out or something because everything went dark for a second then I just remembered waking up in my room and... Well I probably shouldn't go on about it.... Anyway go right up ahead I'll just be in the kitchen reading David!\" she tells you, and from the sounds of it your mom wasn't Jimmy\u2019s first skin he wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside the house she shuts the door and you walk half way up the stairs before stopping, slowly you creep back down the stairs and quietly open the door for Claire who\u2019s been patiently waiting besides the house near a bush. She quickly scurries in when you open the door half way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time David, ok let\u2019s get to work. You call her out of the kitchen and I'll wait behind this sofa chair, then I'll zap her and you scoop her up into your bag. Ok?\" she instructs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood Claire.\" Again not liking being a servant but hopefully some good can come out of this for you. When Claire is hidden and you're both ready you shout for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY MRS. WILSON!\" you say in your pitched voice. Immediately she comes out of the kitchen and walks to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it David? Got everything you need? Or do you need help finding whatever it is you're looking for?\" she says to you. Just at that moment, Claire aims the pen and zaps Mrs. Wilson into a skin suit, it's the second time this day for her, and you almost feel bad for her. Quickly you unzip your duffle bag and scoop her skin suit with her clothes and flats into the duffle bag. Making it the first skin for your outing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you're zipping the duffle bag back up you notice Claire rummaging through Mrs Wilsons handbag. \"Claire, what are you doing?\" you ask her but she ignores you. Continuing she finds Mrs Wilsons purse and unzips it, she then begins to take out all the notes from it and put them into her hoodie pocket like some sort of thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Claire! What the fuck?! Why are you stealing from Mrs Wilson like some sort of Drug addict that needs money?\" you angrily say to her, disappointed as to what you've just saw from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not? She's going to be a skin suit for the rest of the weekend until I say can figure out what to do come Monday, so she won't be needing this money anyway. Besides, it'll be money for cabs or lunch should we feel the need to use it. It's not like I've robbed from her bank account, just picking up some cash for today.\" she explains to you but she still notices your disapproval of it. \"Oh come on David! It's only $80, not her life savings, besides, I'm feelings powerful and rightly so, I'll take it if I want to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see she\u2019s clearly getting a rush from it, not only is she bingeing on sexual stuff, but also crime like any rebellious teenager, this is her way of rebelling perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both leave the house and watch as she takes Mrs Wilsons house keys also, locking up she also left a  note in the house saying her and Jimmy have went on a short holiday should Heather her daughter come around to the empty house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, were to now?\" you ask with a feeling of annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to ......\"</span></div></div>",

It was weird, holding the Tina skin again, knowing that this time it was Claire who was coercing you to put it on... and that she would be wearing Jimmy. A weird reversal, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hurry up!\" Claire mutters impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly pull Tina's clothes off her limp skin - which is easier than keeping them on, since there's no substance to her body. Her jeans slip off with barely a tug, as does her shirt and bra. Opening the slit at the back of her neck all the way down her back, you unfold the Tina skinsuit and slowly step inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels weird as your feet, larger than hers by at least a few sizes, melt into hers. A slight tingling sensation accompanies it as you slide your second foot in, and pull her torso up - much like she probably pulled her jeans on earlier today, you thought. You continue pulling, and the suit snugly sits on your waist. You were still tingling in that general area, but you felt that something had changed... a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were your arms. Sliding them in all the way pulled Tina's chest right up to yours, along with her boobs. Boobs that quickly inflated as they touched your own chest. The tingling feeling had subsided from your crotch, and you felt a breeze across your nethers - and right in between your thighs, where your dick was only moments earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you pulled Tina's face on over yours, feeling the tingling envelop your head as her hair and everything else became yours. Seconds later the tingling everywhere subsided, leaving you now 100% as your older sister Tina. Very female, very naked, and rather scared about what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, that took you long enough!\" Claire exclaimed. \"Now I need to put on mine. Go away, shoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step away as she walks to the closet, grinning like a maniac as she pulled out Jimmy's skin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or maybe it actually just had to with the fact \"she\" had more than enough fingers up her nether-regions and didn't want to stop. It felt awful, but you couldn't let the thought slip past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down on the pen in your grasp again, you spun it around your fingers before looking up at your mom/Jimmy. Well, if Jimmy didn't want to help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a couple of seconds, you aimed the pen at Jimmy, and pressed the very conspicuous button on it. You could hear but a faint buzzing sound as Jimmy/your mom turned into a pile of loose skin and clothing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus christ!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought the effects wouldn't catch you off-guard, but they did.

The evidence pointed to that he had, but you wanted to see for yourself. Looking around for something like an opening, you noticed a slit on the back, which could be stretched out. You gulped, and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed your clothes (which proved to be incredibly hard while shaking like a leaf in the wind), and picked up the suit. Starting with your foot, you started getting the suit of your own mother on. The more of the suit you put on, the more of your body changed to your mother's. At last, you put your mothers head over your own. After aligning the eyes, you looked around for the mirror your bedroom had been blessed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Woah.\" you weakly whispered with your mother's voice. You <i>were</i> your mom. At in terms of your body. No, this couldn't have been a trick. Everything felt incredibly real, and as you touched your new skin, it felt incredibly real, exactly like it was your own. Bringing attention to your new body, you could see why Jimmy happened to like it so much. But, you felt like jumping to pleasuring yourself felt wrong. It was your mom's body, after all. Besides, you didn't want to see your own mom be naked and pleasuring herself. But maybe it was just a chance too good to pass up?</span></div></div>",

His prison, although he didn't know it, was across town from the domestic drama at the Andersons. He had been kept several hours already. This was illegal detention, and the company knew it; he doubted they had informed the police, and he suspected he'd never see a trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultinational corporations policed themselves. They were going to deal with him in private, he knew; maybe they'd kill him, maybe they wouldn't. It was a risk of his business; what you got for being caught dressed as an air force colonel on the sub-levels of a military contractor, attempting to walk out the door with their latest technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a private interview suite.\u201d She was sat opposite, a perfect femme fatale, not a hair out of place, lipstick and blush measured to accentuate her magnificent cheekbones and lips, eyebrows plucked to precise lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready he was analysing her.  She understood her beauty, used it as a weapon in boardroom politics. She knew it was important to dress well, too. Her suit was tailor made, her shoes Italian, her blouse an expensive cut. She had pale skin and lethal black hair, and spoke with a precise diction that suggested private schooling. She looked as thought she were in her early 30s but looked after herself \u2013 she was probably older. Without question she was an executive \u2013 a powerful one, with a million-dollar paycheck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what this is? A private interview?\u201d He kept his voice measured, listening instead to her register. If he wanted, he was sure he could copy it. That's what he did; mimic anyone, to perfection. Man or woman, changing his voice was just a matter of control. Appearance was harder, but he'd slipped across too many borders, as too many people, to consider it a major problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf sorts,\u201d she said. \u201cA job interview, to be accurate.\u201d Icy, all business. In thirteen words he knew her personality, her psychological profile, the way she carried herself. Her body shape was entirely different to his of course, a perfect hourglass he could never replicate. But as an academic exercise, he found it interesting to map her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you're keeping me here against the law?\u201d he asked, a measured taunt. \u201cGenerally a job interview doesn't involve illegal detention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIllegal? Come now. So is breaking into a restricted access area, impersonating a military officer, corporate espionage, and attempting to steal a prototype guidance chip. Who put you up to it? Hmm?\u201d She tilted her head, like an apex predator sizing up its next meal. \u201cHmm? No answer? No matter. We are far more interested in you than who your current employer happens to be. We know exactly who you are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias smiled passively. Of course they did. He'd been caught through the worst possible luck imaginable; their servers had been reset and passwords altered. Otherwise he'd have been in and out without a moment's thought. He'd done it a thousand times before, to hundreds of companies across the world. That's why he'd attracted that stupid name in some circles. Chameleon? Lizards that changed colour? It didn't even scratch the surface of his talents. Psychology, profiling, misdirection, acting and makeup. He made his money on elaborate cons and daring thefts \u2013 if he said so himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA corporate spy for hire, known for extensive use of disguise and impersonation. No job too big or small, as long as you get your rather exorbitant fee. Suspected in countless acts of theft, espionage, sudden changes of corporate policy, embarrassing incidents that harm reputations... and that doesn't even go into the long list of international incidents you are believed to have perpetrated. You tend to use non-lethal means; assuming a fitting identity through extensive use of prosthetics or character acting. You even use non-lethal means when cornered, too, it seems. What did we find on you when we caught you in the labs?\u201d she paused as she looked at her file. \u201cGas and flashbangs, unlikely to cause any permanent damage. How touching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are rules,\u201d Elias said calmly. \u201cBusiness is business. But when it comes to people, I like to exercise a little respect for life. Call me old fashioned, but not enough people play the game properly anymore, miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Bell. Veronica Bell. I'm the vice-president of corporate intelligence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, pencil-thin, and leaned forward. Her fingers slid over the desk, her body revealing just enough cleavage. She was using seduction as a weapon; that meant she wanted something. He knew it was coming, knew every step in her repertoire already. Seduce, entice, an offer, then an ultimatum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are quite a talent, Elias. Which is why we want you to work for us. Exclusively. We need an infiltrator, someone who can be anybody we want them to be. Sometimes your job might be to replace someone for a few days, sign a document, grant us a contract. At other times it will be to obtain our rivals' information. Standard corporate espionage. We could get someone second-rate, but we want you and your rather unique talents; we only take the best. I'm to make you an offer you will not refuse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it all made sense. An unfortunate server outage? The disinterest in his employer? It had been a set-up. They just wanted him here, now, to join them. He felt like an idiot. \u201cJoin, or I'll disappear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that. But I think you will appreciate the job. The pay is outstanding, the benefits... exceptional. We will even offer you an upgrade to your equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like I don't have a choice.\u201d He was playing along now; at least until they let him out. The upgrade was something else he hadn't seen coming. Usually corporations couldn't dream to match his own tools. This one seemed confident they had something he'd never seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingernails traced the top of his hands. Then, without warning, something penetrated his skin. It still burned as he recoiled in agony. Blood oozed from a tiny, precise wound. She smiled, pulling back her hand to reveal a micro-injector in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was insurance. I just implanted a chip, no larger than a grain of sand, allowing us to track you. We couldn't exactly let you go without it. As I told you, this is an interview, and we require a demonstration of your skill to make sure we have the right man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias nursed his hand, glaring angrily across the table. \u201cThanks for the warning. No what do I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple: walk out the front door. What you do then is up to you, but we want you to report back here, to my office on the 7th floor, at 11am tomorrow morning. That's it: leave now, then slip back in undetected. All staff have been given your description, and are to shoot on sight, or alert a guard to shoot you on sight, if you are seen out of custody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the upgrade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, and pulled out a pen from her inside pocket. It was black, unremarkable, save for a little button and a strange symbol. Elias looked at it with confusion. It didn't look like any technology he was familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ultimate disguise kit. Point and fire. The subject will be unharmed, as long as you shoot them again once you're finished with the disguise. That's all there is to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias' confusion continued. What the hell was she talking about? \u201cThat thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis thing. Oh, it's quite a surprising tool. We obtained it from... well, that doesn't matter. There are some unique applications. I'll let you see for yourself. To describe its effects would be an injustice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Tomorrow, 11am, with just a pen to escape. I can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutstanding. Now, listen carefully. The next person to come into this room will be one of our nursing staff, who will treat that little injury. I will leave the nurse's personnel file on the desk. You may consider that an opportunity to brush up on some key details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does the pen do?\u201d Elias asked, picking it up curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, icy-calm, as only someone who held all the cards could be. \u201cI suggest you use it to find out. Remember though; this freedom is an act of faith on my part. If you are not in my office for 11am tomorrow, the chip I implanted will allow our agents to find you. And they will kill you without hesitation; no second chances. Now, either use the pen at your medical, or take it back to your cell with my compliments. I'm sure curiosity, survival instinct, or sheer inevitability will get the better of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias shrugged, looking at the pen. A strange feeling passed over him, as if someone had just handed him a gun. He glanced back at his captor. Veronica was too arrogant and confident. She thought he was still going to be thinking about the pen by the time she left the room. What would happen, he wondered, if he just used it now?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stand up and begin walking around the room slowly and cautiously. Veronica notices this as well. \"Just what are you doing?\" she snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just walking around a bit.\" you state as you continue to walk around the room, \"It helps me think. This is some pretty heavy stuff you've laid on me. Some weird stuff too. Gimme a minute to make up my mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica sniffs dismissively but doesn't seem to say or do anything to stop you. The truth of the matter is that you're casing the room, looking for any signs that there might be hidden cameras. There's always little signs to these things, you've learned, and to your surprise there doesn't seem to be any. Perhaps that's a sign of arrogance of how unbreachable they are that they wouldn't need to worry about anything going on in this room. That's good. That should make things much easier. But two people came in, others outside the room saw that, so when one comes out you'll need an excuse... and you find it in the form of an air vent up in the corner. You size it up... just low enough to reach via chair and large enough for someone to fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the pen and notice three buttons: black, blue and white. You wonder what this all means, what it does. Absentmindedly you point it at Veronica without thinking and hit the blue button and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInformation comes flooding in. Veronica Bell, age thirty-eight, vice president not just of corporate intelligence but of the entire company. And more than that... so that's what these buttons do! Veronica doesn't seem to have noticed anything so you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Ms. Bell, you're not gonna have to wait until tomorrow for my answer.\" you say, \"I'll give it to you right now, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you aim the pen at her and hit the black button. She can barely muster a look of shock before she suddenly deflates, a pile of loose skin in a pantsuit. Quickly you get to work moving the chair over to the vent, you look and see a small latch and pressing it causes the the vent cover to come off and you place it on the ground. You then look in your jacket and are thankful when you find some of the smaller pellets that they seemed to miss when bringing you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place it on the table and then head over to the skin that was Veronica Bell. Thanks to that blue button you know exactly what to do and finding the opening you slip into it effortlessly as it conforms and reshapes your body. Once you've got her clothes back on you smile: you're Veronica Bell now. You then reach onto the table and grab the pellet. You brace yourself and toss it onto the ground. There's a loud bang and smoke instantly fills the room. It won't be long before the guards come but that's the time you'd need if you were actually pulling off the excuse you'll give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens no more than 60 seconds later and two guards come rushing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Bell, what's going on?!\" one of them shouts as he fights through the smoke. \"We heard a loud bang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough and push away the smoke. \"What's going on is that one of your idiot co-workers missed a small pellet he had on him!\" you scream, \"What's going on is that you're too slow! Because of that he was able to get away through the vent <i>with</i> the pen! Do you know what your screw ups have done to us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-ma'am, we're sorry we'll find him.\" The other apologizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right you'll find him or you'll be finding new jobs!\" you growl as you march out of the room, \"I'm leaving for the day. We're in potential shit and I need to get my lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head out to the parking lot and as you arrive at Veronica's, now your, Bentley you smile as you pull the pen out of your suit pocket. These pens truly are the perfect disguise. The blue button \"downloads\" all of the information related to the target, including memories, personality and everything required to impersonate them mentally, directly into your mind. The black button turns someone into a wearable skin. The white opens the skin back up allowing you to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive to the law offices of Janet Wong, a high-powered corporate attorney who works mainly for Veronica and her company; partly because of the money, partly because Janet and Veronica were part of the same sorority at Harvard. You demand to see her but are told she's out and should be back in a few moments. A few moments pass and while Janet doesn't immediately show up, someone else does: Connie Wong. Connie is Janet's 16-year-old niece, a cute girl and overachiever interning both at her aunt's law office as well as Veronica's company with a job waiting at either one in a few years when she graduates college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had come to switch into Janet; being so close to Veronica you could take her and her company down quite easily and you're worried that the guards might quickly assume that you've actually switched into Veronica. But Connie being involved in both is also less assuming as she's still just a girl. They captured you, threatened you and you want revenge and she'd be the perfect place from which to sabotage things. Or maybe Veronica would. They might not suspect anything leaving you free to slowly chip away at her company helping competitors... or maybe enjoy the luxuries and perks associated with being her. Take a small break from the corporate espionage game before dumping Veronica and going back into spying with your new perfect disguise kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe information from the blue button revealed one more piece of information: there was never a chip. It was a bluff meant to scare you into cooperating. They'll be on a wild goose chase while you'll be right under their noses. But will it be as Janet, Connie or Veronica?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Switching to 2nd Person POV.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you realized that they were probably expecting you to use it on her. Besides, the chip was still embedded in your body, they would still find you.<br>\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation, a smile spread itself across Veronica's face, confirming your suspicions, they definitely wanted you to use it on her.<br>\r\nBut, using it at the medical might not be a bad idea. Somehow, you thought you could remove the chip, one way or another. You needed the advantage if you were going to play this kind of game, especially with an organization that was able to set you up so easily. You needed to learn, and what better way is there to learn than to experiment? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mister... Elias? I'm going to have to ask you to remove your clothes.\" A young lady with bright red hair said, looking at a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplying, you removed your jacket and placed it on a metal table in front, doing the same for your shirt. Your build was relatively modest, not too stocky, not too slim, just about in the middle. Of course, it needed to be that way, impersonations aren't all about your face and your voice. Body shape was incredibly important as well.<br>\r\nSpinning the black pen you'd been gifted in between his fingers, it was similar to an expensive pen you'd once been gifted by your wife. <br>\r\nYour real wife, Annabelle.<br>\r\nThe plan starts now, you glanced at his hand, where Veronica had injected your hand with the chip. You have to get it out, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please lay down here.\" The nurse said, snapping him out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry.\" You reply, moving to the elevated examination table next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up, you quickly lay down, concealing the pen under his waist. The nurse set her clipboard down. You knew there were guards still outside from when they'd \"escorted\" you here, and you'd need to get on with it discreetly, so as not to alert the rest of the bloody building. Luckily, you'd just been given the \"ultimate disguise kit\", according to the lovely Ms. Bell. In all honesty, you doubted disguise kits could get any more \"ultimate\" than what you'd worked with previously. There's a reason you were so renowned among the rich and powerful. When in your sights, their money couldn't help them very much.<br>\r\nOr so you thought. These people seem to know very much about you, and you don't know very much about them. What are they playing at?<br>\r\nClearly, they value you, and they're trying to test you in more ways than one. They want to verify if you're as good as they say, but they also want to know if you're obedient. They'll soon find that the only thing you obey is the money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a cold hard object press against your chest, a stethoscope. The nurse began her examination and was listening to your heart and breathing.<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, she removed it and checked something off on her clipboard, then proceeding to wrap the plastic of a sphygmometer around your arm, slightly raising it. Grabbing the plastic handle, she pumped air until ti was tight around your arm, you felt your own blood coursing through your veins.<br>\r\nLooking up and over, you saw the needle rising on the dial, everything seemed alright. Another check.<br>\r\nAn eye exam was next, then an ear exam, then she examined the inside of your mouth. Jesus, this woman loves to examine things.<br>\r\nEverything seemed finished a few moments later, and you swung your legs off the table, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, one more thing.\" The nurse said, retrieving a needle from a plastic casing inside a refrigerator, along with a bottle containing some yellow liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that..?\" If there's one thing you hate more than failing, it's needles. A bit unprofessional but you try your best to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little something to keep you healthy.\" The nurse smiled, before testing the needle and moving towards you quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grips your arm, but you're faster, you slap the needle out of her hand before she injects you. It hits the floor, sending little splotches of yellow liquid about.<br>\r\nLooking back up to you in surprise, you grip her neck and press your thumb against her larynx, stopping her from breathing, and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably know what's next, don't you sweetheart?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pistol appears from underneath the nurse's uniform, and she smiles. You return the smile, grabbing your pen before she can shoot you and plunging it into her ribs, hitting the button as fast as possible. Instantly her entire body seems to just drop, the pistol clattering loudly on the floor. You hold her skin loosely by the neck and it's a few moment before you've realized what's happened. This pen.. That's what they meant by perfect disguise. It turned the woman INTO a disguise! <br>\r\nIt's almost genius, and kind of twisted, but you're getting past that quickly. You're wondering to what extent does this \"disguise\" work? If it turned her into a disguise, it'll probably work damn well. You're running out of time, you soon discover, the guards heard the struggle and are knocking on the door. <br>\r\nYou jump off the table and grab the skin quickly, noticing a long, thin slit running down the nurse's neck. The texture of this woman's skin is strange, similar to real skin, but like it was a mix between human flesh and.. bubblegum. No time for thinking, just act. You've got to stop the guards. Ripping open the slit, you shove your head through the opening and up the nurse's neck, quickly stretching her head over your own. Much like wearing a mask you discover, and you quickly get acquainted. Then the sensations start and you're taking over by a completely foreign feeling of melting and hardening. Your very flesh it melding itself into something new, you get up, the entire body of the nurse hanging from your neck. A nearby mirror hangs near a medicine cabinet and you move to inspect yourself. You tug downwards to adjust the mask as you inspect yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hello?! Is everything alright in there?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" you whisper. Wait a minute, your voice.. It's the nurse's. This is fucking amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea bubbles up to the surface in your head and you grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a moment! Don't come in yet!\" You yell to them, your voice is completely the same as hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rip the mask from your head and fish off the woman's clothes. You don't know whether to be turned on by the skin of an adequately attractive woman or incredibly disturbed by it. Needlessly, you dismiss the thought and focus on putting it on. The slit runs down her entire back, down to her ass, you discover. Pulling it open, you step inside and quickly pull it over yourself. Your entire body melts and hardens, filling and tightening in places, dissolving and loosening in others. As you open your eyes, you're astounded by a new feeling. Inspecting yourself, you're shorter now, the nurse was about 3 inches or so shorter than you. But you've got a full pair of breasts, and they're full. Gripping them, they fill your fingers and you bite your lips, trying not to make noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Open the door now! Nurse! Open the goddamn door!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit. You hurry to pull on the nurse's undergarments as well as her uniform, running to the door, you unlock it. Your appearance is as you want it to be, confused, surprised, and rushed. The soldiers storm in past you and search for well, you. You're obviously not there, to their dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not here.\" One of them says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd he go?\" Asks the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He got out through one of the air vents.\" You lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, tell Security, we need to find this fucker and fast.\" Says the one looking down an air duct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself, concealing it as you look at your shoes. A guard turns back to you and says something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright? Did he hurt you in any way?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choked me, I pulled my gun on him but he still got away.\" You say, at least now it's the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, get checked out. We're having this room sectioned off for inspection.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you promptly grab your pistol, her pistol, and leave, already having concealed your lovely new pen in your shirt pocket. <br>\r\nHeading to the women's bathroom, you figure it'd be a good place to get some solace before your next move. You pass by a few friendly nurses on the way, you don't know them but they obviously know you. A couple friendly greetings and you arrive at the bathroom. Opening the door, you shut it behind you and walk to a stall. Looking around, the place is well kept and sparkling. There's nobody else in here, you discover, after inspecting each stall discreetly. You lock the bathroom door and move to a mirror. There are probably hidden cameras for all you know, so you won't \"undress\" here. You need to get out of the building. <br>\r\nGotta' ditch the old job, you can't recover the chip anyway, that section's being cut off. But wait.. you can impersonate anyone down to their DNA. What's stopping you? All you need is a way in.  </span></div></div>",

Especially when you've just acquired the greatest tool of your career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore importantly, you've just worked out exactly what you were stealing to begin with. A guidance chip? Sure, your army officer disguise was perfect for that, but what if it wasn't a guidance chip at all? These pens are incredible, and something tells you that you're only seeing the first signs of what they can do. This is nanotechnology at its finest. Didn't they say they'd implanted a chip in you? Again, nanotechnology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chip isn't a guidance chip for a missile. It's for whatever this pen is called. Guidance... it could mean anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou compose yourself, and rise up again, walking out to the mirror. The nurse's face greets you: her eyes, her cheeks, her smile. You flick a strand of your bright red hair out of your face, and take a deep breath with your borrowed lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you say, the nurse's voice echoing as you adjust your new cleavage. \"Time to get back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get that chip, and the nurse identity isn't going to pass. You walk through the corridors, again half-smiling to co-workers you don't recognise. This isn't helpful. You need to get out of medical and in to the real action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Anna.\" You give a non-committal half-turn as the voice calls you from behind. It's one of the soldiers from earlier. He comes up right to you, and you change your expression to one of expectation. Evidently, you are Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yourself, Jones,\" you say, noting the man's name emblazoned on his duty shirt. He gives you a smile. It's strange; Anna's body is a full three inches shorter than yours, and so you find yourself in the unnatural position of looking up at the military man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've made a sweep. No sign of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best to look disappointed. \"Great. So I got choked and you didn't even catch him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the one with the slow reactions,\" he observes. \"How'd you even let him get the drop on you, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was giving him an injection,\" you respond. The solider just rolls his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. So you're telling me we didn't even get the tracer into him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Ms Bell injected...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't inject shit,\" the soldier sighs. \"You know as well as I do that tracker chip is worthless without the nanite protocols. You really fucked up this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and act as you imagine Anna would: not upset, but defiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe if you guys had something beyond a delayed reaction, it wouldn't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. You need to report to Colonel Branner. This is a joint military-civilian contractor operation. I'll tell Bell what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it, I'll do that,\" you say, hoping it will delay the search. \"Might as well take responsibility. Where's Branner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Industrial labs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and walk off down the corridor. That's exactly the answer you wanted, you think, as you smooth Anna's hair back and saunter along in your nurse's uniform, confident in your disguise. The Industrial Labs is where you'll find the chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in with a minimum of delay, and it quickly becomes apparent just how good this disguise truly is. As Anna, you're expected to give a retinal scan just to get in to the secure area, and you pass without incident. This is where they caught you before; your schematics of the building and its secretive corporate research/defense contracts wing had said nothing about a retinal scan, and those were too complex for you to mimic. Now, though, you don't even hesitate as the doors swing open to let you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess Branner will be in the executive chambers, but that's not something you're going to worry about now. As Anna, you make a sharp turn to the right, side-stepping in to the women's changing rooms. Another employee is there, towel around her waist, about to step inside a shower. The tech doesn't pay you a second glance, though you afford her a longer look. She's African-American, with shoulder-length hair and an attractive shape with athletic curves. She's got an attractive face too, with dreamy eyes and a slight pout. You offer a half-smile again as you step toward a locker, and she returns to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for you to find the static-proof overalls, or to don them. Anna's flame-red hair takes a little effort to collect in the hair net, but then you've never had to do that before: it's always been a wig or your own, much shorter locks. Eventually you're in the protective equipment, and ready to step in to the lab itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole place is white. Polished tile floors, sterile benches, computers neatly pushed up against the wall. Entering gives you a blast of frigid, stuffy air - it's a climate controlled environment. That much you expected: this is a specialized weapons lab, after all. The men's entrance is on the other side of the lab, and the other two sides are dominated by a long window of tinted glass. Obviously some people like to watch the experiments here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest, you already know: it was part of your preparation. Two cameras, each with a 90 degree pan. You look up and catch one in your peripheral vision. You'll have 15 seconds once the camera pans away. The pass code is - unless they changed it - 8467. The rest of the lab is empty. Steadying your breathing, you wait for the camera to pan away, and step forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you're out of camera view. Immediately you burst in to action. You tap the code furiously, and the lock springs open. The chip - there's only one in the secure vault - sits, paraded for you to see within two pincers. Immediately you grab it, and close the vault behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive seconds left. You takes three steps back and stop, standing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera pan continues, catching your form stood exactly where you were a moment ago. You smile, turning back to the changing room. The other tech is still in the shower, but you now have the chip. You pause for a moment as you strip out of the static-proof clothing, discarding the overalls in the bin provided, to look at it. It's small, and almost insignificant - a piece of plastic and metal. But it's also strangely twisted; almost cylindrical. Almost as if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the bench, and take a seat, pulling the pen out of your top pocket. You look at it, and twist heavily, much as you would with any other pen. In a moment it gives way, pulling apart to reveal an inner compartment. It looks much like any other electronic device, but there's a slot where... you grab the chip and set it in. With a tiny click, it slots in to place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's neatly manicured brow curves in curiosity. You wonder if it really is a guidance chip after all. What if this doesn't just turn your target into a disguise; what if it somehow could store memories, or mannerisms? What if it gives you guidance on your impersonation? There's only one way to find out, you figure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opens. Quickly you hide the pen again, and look up. It's a young woman in soldier's uniform, an athletic figure hidden under military fatigues. Three stripes on her arm says she's a sergeant, and Rourke on her breast suggests she's of Irish descent. Her hair is blonde, though her skin has the healthy glow of someone who spends most of her time outdoors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lowry?\" she asks. \"Anna Lowry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was asked to come find you. Colonel's wondering if you got lost on your way to his office or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,\" you pause, thinking of something convincing. \"I just needed to take a break, for a moment. Collect my thoughts. The attack was stressful, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nods. \"You got to toughen up. Colonel says he wants to see you right now. We thought we had the Chameleon today, he wants to know what happened, and SNAFU isn't gonna cut it. Anyway, my job was just to find you, then I'm done for the day. No reason I didn't find you in,\" she glances at her watch, \"say, five minutes? Army grunts ain't all heartless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, and wonder what you should do next. You could, of course, play Anna and go and see this colonel. You don't have any of her memories, though at least you have a full name now: Anna Lowry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you're eager to test out your new toy. Sgt Rourke here, or the tech currently in the shower, could be a good test - and a quick way out of the building. Rourke will know more about what the military is actually doing here. And the tech may know a lot more about the pen itself, and what Ms Bell's plans for you are.</span></div></div>",

O'Rouke nods though, and leaves. Instead you take out the pen. The sound of a hair dryer starts up, and you notice the other technician has towelled off and is preparing to get dressed. That should make your job easier, if this pen works anything like you think it will. You wait a moment, turning it over in your hands, wondering just what this corporation, and the military, has been up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job was a farce - you can see that now. But this pen is something else; something incredible. It seems to transform people at a molecular level, and it's technology that should never fall into the wrong hands (such as your own). One thing's for certain: if you decide to run with the pen, you can't go home to your wife. They know too much about you. Borrowing people's lives like this has always been fine on an ethical level, but actually...wearing them? It's a hideous thought, like some kind of sci-fi project gone wrong. And yet, if you don't, you wonder just what this sinister civilian-military project would do. This is too much power for any one to have. But another device like this? Mass produced? It would change the world. They could replace anyone, do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't let that happen. You make your mind up. And, as Anna, you stand up and head back into the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, ain't you forgetting something?\" The woman asks, turning off her dryer, speaking with a thick Southern US accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" you respond, smiling. She means the static overalls. You don't. You point the pen and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Michelle Jackson... who does that bitch think she is? I ain't ever even seen her before... man, I'll be glad to end the day...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's thoughts, name, very being fill your mind, taking you aback even as she collapses into an empty shell opposite. Holy shit. Guidance was the right word after all: guidance on how to be someone. With the knowledge you have, you could impersonate Michelle Jackson perfectly. Mannerisms, account details, relationship with her husband... it's all there. So that's what the chip is! And that's why what you're about to do is so important...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the lab, now free from interruption. The camera pan only gives you a few seconds, but you're sure it's not being monitored automatically, and by the time they realize what's happened, you're going to be long-gone. You walk in to the lab, flipping out the controlled gas tubes and flooding the room. Then, taking out the magazine from Anna's gun, you clip some bullets onto a hot plate and turn it on. In about three minutes the primer will ignite. You turn and hurry out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes later, the room explodes with a fury. Smoke, flash fires and sprinklers going off, klaxons blaring with a repetitive whine. Chaos erupts in the complex, everyone wondering what the hell is happening. You follow the crowd, a scared, panicked look on your face as you evacuate the building, a precious cargo in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make way! Got a casualty here!\" You get through immediately, everyone giving you space and help as you carry out the slumped, unconscious body of Anna Lowry, fully restored from her ordeal. Michelle Jackson, married laboratory technician, is being a hero - saving a work colleague from certain death. As you set the slumped body you carry down at the rally point, a crowd gathers. Anna is regaining consciousness, but seems confused. You smile a very un-Michelle smile as you turn your attention to your handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole building is in flames. The laboratory must have had more stuff involved, though you hope that everything to do with the pen has been destroyed. That means your prototype - and chip - are the only ones in the world. Away, on the other side of the complex, you can see Veronica Bell berate and point at a large, well-built man in military fatigues, with pepper-grey hair and a stern expression. Michelle's mind tells you that's Brenner. As she begins to piece together what happened, Bell turns and begins to scan the scene. She's looking for someone out of place. She's looking for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's recently-damped hair is indistinguishable from the other soaked members of the laboratory staff, but you've got charcoal smears on your lab clothes. It's only a matter of time before someone tells Ms Bell about how Michelle Jackson pulled Anna Lowry from the building. It's time to get a new disguise. As chaos continues to erupt from the building, you slip away, across the street, and into a nearby burger joint. Nobody seems to notice outside, although a few patrons and staff look up at the soot-stained woman who enters. You feign shock, walking loosely with Michelle's body as if you're in a daze, and stumble in to the bathroom. With any luck they'll decide you're just stunned by what's happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your current face in a mirror. Michelle is a mess; her hair is wild and the expression you've plastered on her face is one of scared confusion. Still, you're pro enough to sense you're not alone in the bathroom. There's a flush, and a woman in a yellow sun dress exits a cubicle. She's got quite a large figure, definitely overweight, with wavy, parted blonde hair and a fresh face with large cheeks. She's in her late 20s you would guess. She's also perfect. Without a moment's thought you turn and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, hun,\" you say with your thick accent. \"But I need to be you for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, you're adjusting your new, large breasts into your bra, and fitting your new, larger face over your own, contorting its muscles and flicking your hair back. Your name is Melinda Curtis, and you're in town shopping for the day. Your car is parked a little down the street. You're conscious of your weight, but you intend to slim down before your holiday. And... oh. You'd better put your dress back on, hadn't you? You grab the fabric and pull it over your head, stretching the light yellow fabric out over your curves, before bending down to pick up your clutch, and slipping the pen inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" you say in Melinda's perfect voice as you straighten your flabby jawline in the mirror. \"My name's Mel. Yeah, I heard all about that fire... I was on the street opposite. What happened? A woman was found unconscious in the restaurant opposite? How did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn, and point the pen at Michelle, returning her to normal as you walk out of the door. \"Oh, right,\" you think. \"That's how it happened.\" You unlock the bathroom door and step out of the restaurant, out into the street, where your (now blue) eyes are just another set staring across at the flames and smoke opposite. It's with a satisfied smile that you turn, and saunter away in the flats you wear in your new, plus-size form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get away from here and decide what to do. With Melinda's phone you could probably call up your handler and get a new contract, but this mission will go down as a failure and you could be drawing unwanted attention to your whereabouts. Alternatively, Mel's knowledge tells you she's got a nice rented apartment where you're unlikely to be disturbed. You could always lie low as her for a while - or find a better life to borrow while you work out what to do with this incredible invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChameleon is no more. Now you can't just look like anyone you want. You can be anyone you want.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You arrive at Mel's apartment in the posh downtown section of the city and flop down onto the couch with a groan. Yeah, you'll definitely need to look into finding someone better: Mel could stand to lose quite a bit of weight and while you could do that yourself, she's only a means to an end. You think about her neighbors: who would be the best to be, who would be the easiest to get. For the next hour as you fix a snack and watch a bit of television you run through the possibilities before finally settling on the best possible one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor above Mel is a couple: the Chans. Ronald Chan holds a nice VP position at a large bank while Janice, his wife, works as a secretary for Veronica Bell herself. As a bonus both are fairly young, in maybe their mid thirties, and good looking. Plus Janice would undoubtedly be home due to the incident at Veronica's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that you aim the pen at yourself and fire opening up Mel's skin and stepping out. You want a little bit of a clean break before switching after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then step out into the hall and take the elevator up to the next floor. You walk down the hall before finally finding what you were looking for almost directly above Mel's apartment. You then knock on the door and wait. It's about a minute or so and you're ready to knock again before the door opens. An Asian woman answers, fair-skinned, slightly curvy and chipmunk cheeked. Her hair, while a bit frazzled, is pulled back in a bun and glasses cover her slanted eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you,\" she asks though with a bit of a tired, distracted tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, hi my name's... Andrew. Andrew Lowe,\" you state with a charming smile. \"My car broke down right in front of here and I just need to use the phone to call a tow truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyes you oddly, \"You don't have a cell phone,\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It, ah, died,\" you reply sheepishly, \"I'm really bad at keeping track of the battery life. Happens quite a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The third floor's kind of out of the way too,\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sheepish grin, \"Yeah, I tried a bunch of other places. Either nobody answered or I got the door shut on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice again eyes you but finally, possibly due to being worn down by the events of the day, she relents and opens the door wider to let you in.  \"The phone's in the kitchen,\" she calls out as she closes the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll definitely know where it is,\" you state to yourself. Once her back is turned you pull out the pen and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later you're in the bathroom, dressed in a loose fitting shirt and yoga pants, your hair loosely tied up. \"I don't know why I think I need to lose weight,\" you state as you run your hands over your thighs, \"I'm better off than Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next little bit lounging around before shrugging and hitting the liquor cabinet pulling out a bottle of nice wine. You're about to pour a glass when the doorbell rings. You head over to the door and look out the peep hole to see another Asian woman standing there. Janice's memories tell you that this is Tina, Ronald's sister. Tina and Janice have been best friends since college and she's the one who introduced Janice and Ronald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door and greet the taller, slimmer, short-haired and pants-suit wearing woman. \"Tina, hi! What brings you around,\" you ask her as she steps into your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw what happened on the news and figured I would come by to check on you, see how you're doing,\" She then notices the wine bottle and glass on the counter. \"That rough,\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh heavily, \"You have no idea. There was just an explosion, a fire and then it was pure chaos. Nobody knows if it was just some kind of industrial accident, some kind of sabotage or terrorism or what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Janice I'm so sorry,\" Tina replies and pulls you into a friendly hug. \"Was anybody seriously hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"Not that we know of so far, thank god, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause as you hear a bunch of doors closing outside and check out the window that overlooks the parking lot. A lot of black SUVs and guys in suits are entering the building. Bell's security? Why would they be here though? Well, Janice <i>works</i> for Bell so maybe they're just checking up on employees... especially someone who works so close to Veronica herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another thought strikes you: Michelle Jackson went in one bathroom, Melinda Curtis came walking out of the same one a short time later. Did they find Michelle in a daze in there? Did other witnesses somehow allow them connect Melinda to Michelle? Could they connect Melinda to Janice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be best to stay calm, stop being paranoid and lay low as Janice. Plus as Janice you'd have unfiltered access to Veronica and her company and after catching you and developing this pen you're interested in keeping a close eye on things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if they have made a connection... you look at Tina. She's the mayor of the next town over. Young, pretty, amiable and popular to boot. She'd have nice security too, a great safety net and would be hard to touch even if a connection was made from Melinda to Janice and then Janice to Tina. It might be a good idea to stay as you are for the moment but then it might also be a good idea to switch over to Tina Chan.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right now you need to keep cool. Looking through your glasses at your 'sister-in-law', it's clear that the smart play is to keep calm and act confident. For the years you've played the spy game without this incredible gadget, that simple mantra seen you through more tight spots than you can recall. Janice doesn't know anything about the pens, but you have a golden opportunity to find out everything you want. You flick back a loose strand of hair that has escaped your precise bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Ron back yet?\" Tina asks. You blow out those chipmunk cheeks and shake your head, raising a quizzical eyebrow. It's a strange question, your Janice mind hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he be? He's on the other coast, remember? Bank business.\" You tease the stranger, but something makes you wonder why she'd ask such a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Tina says, rolling her eyes and reaching down to her phone. \"I totally forgot. He hasn't texted me all week, I lost track.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bullshit.</i> You can tell a lie at a distance, and Tina Chan, consummate politician she may be, just told her sister-in-law a complete falsehood. You turn to conceal any sign of understanding betraying your disguise and pour the wine, adjusting the frame of your glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you a glass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, got to drive back. I just wanted to come over and make sure you were OK.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and smile, seizing the glass in your fingers and twisting it gently to release the aroma. You take a long draught. \"I appreciate it,\" you say, as Janice would. \"I know how busy you are. Being a mayor isn't easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know it. Although today it sounds like you're the one with the stressful job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide there isn't anything else to do but sink into the role. You nod, collapsing in your yoga pants and sinking into the nearest sofa, kicking your legs up and letting the wine do its work. Below you can hear the heavy sound of a door banging, and frown apologetically. \"No idea what's gotten in to her,\" you say. \"Usually she's pretty quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the way. The moment you want quiet, you get noise.\" Tina's easy philosophy is a little too forced, you think. There's a strain on her painted lips, a tension in the corner of her mouth. You only notice it because you've spent so long studying faces and their interesting muscles. \"Did she say she was having a party or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it all clicks in to place. Your heart thuds fast for a moment. Tina <i>knows.</i> Knows <i>what</i>, you have no idea. But suddenly you begin to doubt that her arrival was purely to look after her sister-in-law. What if she's checking, trying to see if the jump between Mel and Janice has taken place? Is she looking for you, or are you just paranoid? The easy way would just be to zap her here, but that's also the move that Bell would expect. Your gut tells you that the safest thing to do at this moment is to keep calm and be Janice. Tina could have a microphone or camera on her person. Perhaps in that flower on her jacket breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you shrug, taking off your glasses to pinch the end of your nose, before polishing off the wine. \"She's just a neighbor. Besides, with the chaos today I feel like I could nap through anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't slept yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a wink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, then, I should leave you to it?\" Tina rises, smiling once more. You look up, a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mayor's life is never done. You've got my cell if you do need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. I'll give that husband of mine a ring later. Then I'd better get some sleep. My boss has something going on, so work's going to be cray-zee tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile that adorable chipmunk grin of yours as Tina leaves, before shifting your curvy form up and out of the sofa to pour another glass. The banging noise downstairs has stopped, and a quick glance out of the window confirms the SUVs are leaving, along with what looks like an ambulance. Obviously that 'tracker' Bell hinted it hasn't activated. But the involvement of Tina Chan is troubling. The mayor knew far too much. Could it be this company has already got one or more of these devices in circulation? That Chan's town is being used as some kind of test? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's far-fetched, but then if you'd said eight hours ago you would be wearing another person's body, with partial access to their memories and mannerisms, you'd have laughed. And yet here you are. You are Janice Chan. You have her body, with all its imperfections. You have her personality and knowledge. You're in her apartment, drinking her wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could stay as Janice, head in to work tomorrow and find out exactly what Bell is doing. This even complete's Bell's 'assignment' - you can be in her office as requested, and claim that you were simply testing out your abilities. Or you can make another move, this time without a trace. It should be easy enough to leave Janice to her exhausted sleep and find a new identity to take you the next town over. From there, you're sure you could probe whatever spider's web has been created with these pens, and find out how deep this plot goes.</span></div></div>",

Janice is useful, but heading straight back into the lion's den is only going to cause problems in the long run. Still, while you're her... you walk over to her laptop, opening it up while you sip her wine. A few clicks later and you've accessed the remote connection to her work account, and are glancing over her emails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them are no use. A few queries that she'll need to deal with for Ms Bell, a work schedule, nothing unusual. Ms Bell prefers for Janice to screen and send her emails, and most of the time it's just tedious day-to-day stuff; anything secret she handles on a separate account. There's also the company-wide emails about the evacuation, and updates for employees on whether they are working tomorrow (they are). But among it all is an email that catches your eye. It's from the post room, of all places, short and to the point, and hasn't been sent to Ms Bell's private secure account, but rather to her work account. Obviously someone doesn't know the right protocols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Subject: Fire malfunction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Bell,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe have a situation. The office fire triggered an emergency protocol hidden in the system. Did you know about this? The system automails something marked \"CS\" to a secure location by courier. But the fire caused a malfunction. It was supposed to go to the following zip, but the fire caused a glitch that autogenerated part of the address. We have no idea <u>where</u> in the zip the package was sent.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou double-check the email again. This is major. CS could be anything, but part of you wonders if it isn't another one of these pen devices. And the zip code... that's Tina Chan's small town. Tomorrow - or maybe even tonight if the couriers have acted fast - some entirely unsuspecting person is going to have military secrets land on their doorstep. And almost immediately after, you imagine, the company heavies. Janice would, of course, immediately contact Ms Bell on her private number. But you... you're not Janice. And, quietly marking the email as unread, you close the laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Analytical Engine.</i> What the hell kind of band name is that? You don't even want to know what kind of music the kids are listening to these days. You look at the poster on the wall of the coffee house, three angry looking young women staring back at you from behind their instruments, plus a guy who looks as though he doesn't want to be there. Probably the biggest band to play this town in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a typical small town. Across the street there's an Italian restaurant that seems about the only decent place to eat. The bus passed a large shopping mall just out of town, and there's a small hospital, a college campus, even an art museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, and finish your coffee. You left Janice collapsed on her bed with a glass of half-drunk wine before catching a bus. You haven't used the pens again, and your natural hair is tussled and unkempt, as if you're trying to give off a drifter vibe. It allows you to take a few moments to gather your bearings and get the lay of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, it seems a perfectly normal town. A bunch of high school kids were in earlier, with a 'Jimmy' being told to shut up repeatedly by the other two, a 'David' and a 'Trish'. You guess the last pair are an item, given the way Trish was looking at David the whole time. They left a while ago, and now the only customer is a pretty red-head police officer, a look of bored stupor on her face as she sips her coffee and watches the street outside. Name tag reads O'Sullivan, and the barista called her Molly. As the local cop you'd be in a much better place to search for this 'CS'. Whatever it is must be important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are other alternatives, though. A quick walk around the town led you to an alley, and you saw a pale woman, hair cut in a luminous red bob, too much makeup on her face and nails, and dressed in a skin-tight, revealing black number. Red light district. Easy to make a switch to a new identity there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are other options, though. The mall looked like it didn't close until late and would give you options. And you could of course continue up that road and pay Mayor Chan a visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you choose though, you have no idea how you're going to locate this 'CS'. It's getting late. The only thing you can do is find the right person to replace, wait until morning and see what happens.</span></div></div>",

She walks up to your and takes your hand, before turning and leading you behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me tiger,\" She purrs, \"I've got just the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimmy!\" Your mother shouts from the kitchen, your head perks up as you hear her shrill pitch. \"Can you get the door please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, you hit start on your controller and drop it on the sofa besides you. Leaning forward, you stand and quickly walk to the front door, peering through the peephole, you see someone you assume is a delivery man. He's got a small brown package in one hand and a clipboard in the other and seems anxious. Unlocking the door, you swing it open and he instantly looks up at you, stretching his arm out to hand you the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Package for this address, sir.\" He says plainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum!\" You call out to your mother in the back, \"Did you order a package?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" She shouts back, \"It's probably for Heather if at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" You say to the delivery man, taking it from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign here, sir.\" He hands you the clipboard, a pen dangling from the top lets you write your signature quickly and hand it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day.\" He says, turning and walking back to his delivery truck. You notice UPS painted over the side, and huff before shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the living room, you sit down on the sofa again and rip open the package. The paper tears open to reveal a box with a crude CS labelled on the top in black lettering, you frown as you unseal the lid and take the cover off. A foam padding protects a single black pen shaped object. Picking it out of the box, you notice a single button near the top of the pen, holding it in your hand, you aim it at your wall and press the button. A red beam shoots out of the pen, similar to a Star Wars blaster, and upon hitting the wall completely disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jimbo, what's that you've got there?\" Heather suddenly says as she walks into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her, you point and press the button intending to blast her like a Storm Trooper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out!\" You warn, the laser shoots from the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting her in the chest, Heather's body freezes and she looks at you with a very confused expression. You see her eyes roll into her head before seemingly sinking, her cheeks start to sag as her shoulders drop, her body quickly deflating and falling into a heap. You jump up from the sofa in surprise, and run around to the newly formed pile of skin and clothing, Heather's long brown hair sticking out from under heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" You start to panic, \"Heather!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the skin and drop it right after, it's warm, almost hot. Cringing, you slowly kneel down against and pick it up, standing straight you hold Heather by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in he- Jimmy!\" Your mother walks in, and shrieks. \"What the fuck is that!?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh Pollak slouched through the store. He felt defeated. Michelle Francis was the girl of his dreams: honey-blonde hair and curves in all the right places. He'd met her in the second year of university, at a party where their limited social circles had come together. She was part of the popular crowd, from a wealthy family, who seemed to know everyone on campus. He was a loser whose only friends were lab rats and slackers. They'd struck up a friendship, which had blossomed into something more pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen fate \u2013 or rather her friends \u2013 had intervened. None of them liked him at all. Dawn, all fake tan, fake nails and hair extensions, didn't find him cool enough; anyone less than a jock wasn't worth her time. She was rich, spoiled, and constantly inferred Michelle was too good for him. Maya was just as bad; a beautiful mixed-race girl with a distinct punk vibe, he got the feeling that she wouldn't have approved of anyone dating her friend - let alone him. Then there was her roommate and best friend, Charlotte: a slight, short, shy redhead covered in freckles. Charlotte was too close to her; he suspected she probably loved Michelle herself, and saw Josh as a threat. Michelle was blind to it all, but listened to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that would have been bad enough, but then he'd faced the worst part of all: Chloe Francis, her mother. Mrs Francis was in her 40s, but had retained an incredible figure and knew it: every time they'd met her appearance had been immaculate. She worked for some major corporation, and evidently had already mapped out her daughter's future. She'd insisted Michelle go to university in her hometown, although her daughter had rebelled enough to live on campus rather than at home. Michelle's sisters were already doctors and lawyers, and Mrs Francis had made it clear she saw Josh as a distraction her daughter did not need. Their two meetings had been frosty and uncomfortable; Michelle visited home every Sunday, and had mentioned that her mother often spoke of him in disapproving terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here he was, late on a Saturday, walking around some second rate collectibles store, looking for something weird to cheer him up. Two days ago Michelle had told him they needed to stop seeing each other. It wasn't him, she insisted, it was her. He knew what that meant: the months of whispers had finally got to her. If only there was a way to convince her friends to say something good about him, get off his back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to his shopping. The store was full of old costumes, used models of the <i>Enterprise</i>, half-complete card sets and old Magic cards. He was about to give up when he noticed a small box, almost forgotten, on a dusty shelf in the back. It looked old and out of place - just his kind of thing. He couldn't resist the opportunity to walk over and take a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small box, wooden, with letters neatly engraved on the top: \u201cCostume set\u201d , followed by some worn, unrecognizable initials. <i>Weird</i>, he thought.<i> This is too small for a costume. </i>Carefully, his fingers lifted the latch and brought up the lid. Inside were two pens, sat in a neat lining. One black, one brown. Both had a button on them, both a strange symbol. <i>Weird...but awesome.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are these things?\u201d he said, calling out to the shop assistant. \u201cThese pens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me,\u201d the assistant said. She was cute, about 20 years old, bright pink hair pushed out in pigtails like some anime character, wearing a <i>Firefly</i> T-shirt and jeans. \u201cThe manager said he picked 'em up at a garage sale. Some kind of TV prop. The previous owner said the idea is you point the black pen at someone and 'pow' \u2013 turns them into an instant costume. Like a disguise you wear, or something. Pretty creepy, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it work?\u201d Josh asked. The assistant scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right! A pen that turns someone into a costume. What kind of planet are you from? It's a novelty, it's not real. Do you think those sonic screwdrivers we've got from Dr Who fans are real? Or that Darth Vader helmet? It's just a prop... no idea what show it's from, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled bashfully. Yeah, of course he was being stupid. The idea though... to be able to turn someone else into a disguise? Just point, click, and you were someone else? His thoughts turned to Michelle again. With such a power, he'd easily correct everything her friends and family had said about him. Or maybe he'd just get some payback on them, see how they liked it to have someone mess with their life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much?\u201d he said, closing the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwenty bucks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh scooped up the box and handed over the cash. Of course it wasn't real \u2013 it was just pretend. But what if... what if it actually did work?</span></div></div>",

Now here's your chance to become one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go behind the counter and see the pile of girl suit and girl clothes on the clean-looking floor. You touch the hollow skin: still warm, but cooling to room temperature. It feels purely like human skin except it seems more elastic.

The edges of the opening have zipper teeth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that although the zipper section seems to end where the zipper pull is, you can zip the girl suit open further. When you go in the other direction, the opening gets shorter and leaves flawless skin on the zipped-up section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour instinct is that zipping up this girl suit completely will turn it back into the girl.

You admire her body. She's not as pretty as your not-really-girlfriend Michelle, but her face is droll and kissable and intelligent, her small breasts are firm and high and beautifully shaped, her waist trim and her buttocks excellent. Her pubic hair is the same pink as the hair on her head and it's neatly trimmed but remarkably thick. \"You're adorable,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adorkable, more like,\" she says. \"Best way to adore me is to be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your voice,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use it well,\" she says. You hold her and kiss her on the mouth, then you two separate and you zap her again with the black \"pen\" that had made her into a girl suit. In a moment the half-open eyeholes of a new girl suit are staring up at you from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn under ten minutes you have the shop open again. Only you're not you. Josh is little more than a set of memories in your pink-haired head. Unless you remind yourself that you're not the real Melissa Kowalski, invariably called Lissa by everyone who knows her, it doesn't occur to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lissa suit had slipped onto your body as if it wanted to take it over, your feet shrinking to fit the moment each was inside a hollow Lissa foot, and the rest of the transformation had gone just as well. One zap with the brown \"pen\" (brief green ray) had put those Josh memories and that Josh personality in the background so they could be used if necessary but never by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCustomers start coming in again. You would have known only one of them were you still Josh, but being Lissa you know all but one as regulars. You flirt brilliantly and appropriately with everyone, entirely you and not Josh at all. A few times, knowledge you have from having been Josh comes in handy, but you've become almost purely Lissa. The shop's owner drops by around closing time and seems entirely unaware that you're a nerdy guy named Josh disguised perfectly as his employee, and he lets you leave twenty minutes early, pleased that you got anything for that set of pen-shaped gadgets.  You force yourself not to go into one of your sweet little fits of giggles that your friends find so cute, and think, <i>If he only knew!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually you, Lissa, take the bus home, but you're out earlier than you expected and you want time to think. You start walking towards the house you share with five other people, mostly students, near campus. Over one arm you carry your Hello Kitty purse, now also holding Josh's wallet and keys, and the set of magical devices he used to make the original you into a girl suit with her permission. Over the other is a bag mostly with Josh's clothes.  As you walk home you try to think like Josh rather than Lissa, try to examine your Lissa self objectively from his point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the good and the bad of your Lissa self. There's no opinion, no taste, no quirk hidden from the Josh inside you. That Josh self is amazed at how right you seem to be for him -- but then starts to fear that you're really too good for him.  Typical of the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso you start to wonder what you could learn becoming Josh again and wearing Melissa instead. Would living a few hours in Melissa's body thinking her thoughts make Melissa seem right for you, or make you realize that you really shouldn't be with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder whether to skin yourself when you're home and locked in your room, or spend another day being your superb Lissa Kowalski self. It's good in this body, this self, but you shouldn't be greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get home, help make some dishes for dinner, eat. It's not until seven-thirty that you're alone in your room with the door locked. You strip, put some clothes in your laundry hamper and hang others up. You debate whether to put on casual clothes or even a robe, or take off yourself and be Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt strikes you that you have no idea of how to remove the suit that was once the real Lissa.  Maybe there's a hidden catch under your chin. Maybe you just have to concentrate on your skin separating from you.</span></div></div>",

There's no sign of the nerdy guy who paid twenty dollars for the pen-like gadgets that supposedly can turn someone into a people suit and provide the wearer with his or her memories and personality. Everything seems normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you're wearing the girl, and her clothes, thinking her thoughts and feeling her feelings and acting utterly indistinguishable from her. Your Josh Pollak clothes are in a shopping bag behind the counter, and your Josh wallet and keys, and the box with those magic pens, are in your new self's purse. As Josh you'd left your phone at home: one less thing to dispose of should you decide to give up being Josh permanently and stay the cute pink-haired Melissa Kowalski, invariably known as Lissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there's no need to stay Lissa, but so far you're totally in love with your ebullient, feminine new self. Finding a sodden tampon at the crotch of the Lissa suit nearly kept you from going through with your takeover of her entire identity, but you put the Lissa suit on, became her, and put in a fresh tampon from your purse. Being sweet Lissa on the rag beats the crap out of being Josh on a good day. You remember that before you took Lissa over she'd found your Josh self kind of cute, but you'll take the certainty of having Lissa by being her over some remote chance of having her as a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCustomers. As Lissa you know them all, like them, flirt with anyone from gay guys to straight chicks to people who are actually interested in your feminine self. Actually you're a straight chick now and stingy with sexual favors, but friendly and helpful and well-liked. It's worlds better than being Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little before six the owner shows up to take over running the shop until it closes at nine. He lets you leave early and you let him give your cute-chick body a bear hug. You hop a bus and soon you're home, a house shared with five other people on the other side of campus from where Josh lived. You've taken along the Josh clothes; you're not sure why.  You help your housemates fix dinner, you eat, you go to your room.  Your housemates adore you. You love being adorable and adored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd gotten only a quick look at your new body when you became you, so you undress at the full-length mirror on your closet door. You pinch your cute cheeks with your dainty hands, heft your hard little pink nippled breasts. Your pink pubic hair needs a touch-up although it would look just fine if its natural brown. Your thighs and what you can see of your rear look excellent. Your contentment as Lissa with your body is spiced considerably by the Josh self hiding deep inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've gone from miserable nerdy guy to happy little hot chick in minutes. Life is good now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, you've thrown out the Josh clothes and cut up and disposed of Josh's ID cards and credit cards and all. The only apparent connection between you and Josh Pollak are the pen-shaped things that made you the girl you are, nobody but you know about them, and he's become you, the girl who sold them to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks after that, you're:</span></div></div>",

And some scary thoughts of his enter your mind that up until six weeks ago you would never really think about doing... Thoughts of zapping people, especially young women, without their permission and putting them on and reading their thoughts, seemed very very...rapey. These intrusive thoughts send a shiver down your spine after all you, Lissa, are a pretty staunch feminist and advocate for a safe campus against sexual assault at your university.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the blonde haired girl who you now know as a Michelle comes to the counter and places a large item on the table. You quickly start ringing up the purchase fully aware that just a few feet away in your purse are a pair of pens that could instantly fry her into a wearable skin. You start to sweat as you make your usual bubbly small talk with her, \"Oh cool never met another girl who was also into Star Trek!\" you say with a grin. \"Oh no, its not for me. Just a little present I got for my boyfriend,\" she casual says handing you her credit card while looking at her phone. You clench your fist under the counter hearing that, but you hold yourself back from doing anything rash. You bag up her purchase and watch her shake her firm ass as she walks out the door, \"Bitch\" you breathlessly whisper as the door slams upon her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks out of sight of the window you huff and throw yourself into the chair behind the counter and think out loud: \"Come on Lissa! Just because you have the power to mess with other people's lives doesn't give you the right to\"...... But then you look down at your body, and peer down your t-shirt's open area to the C-cupped breasts lying in a pink polkadot bra, which only until six weeks ago were not really yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you truly say you are a good person Lissa if you really are not her?\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then torn with another dilemma: Whether you are ever going to go back to your normal Josh Pollak self. Just the idea of going back to the nerdy form of Josh kinda terrifies you, not just because being a boy seems so gross now, but Josh's life was so much different than your current life which you absolutely love. Also even if you did decide to go back to that life you would basically have to answer for the fact that you disappeared for a whole six weeks, just that alone almost seems worse than the fact that you basically murdered the original you.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Half an hour later, Josh was on campus. Somehow he'd summoned up enough courage for a confrontation. The device in his pocket... sure, it probably wasn't real. But it was the last push he needed to face one of Michelle's friends and demand some answers. Dawn was the easiest to find: she had a job as a barista. Her social calendar was also widely advertised; she was going to some costume party tonight with Michelle. If he had to guess, she'd be going either as a sexy cop, or a sexy nurse, or a sexy devil or a sexy nun \u2013 she always did something like that. That meant she would be leaving early. If he was going to confront anyone, it had to be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found her quickly enough. She worked at a cafe in the main building, and he spotted as she left, wearing expensive jeans and a jacket over her uniform shirt that probably cost more than his tuition. He headed up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDawn,\u201d he said. She kept walking, pretending to ignore him. \u201cHey! Dawn!\u201d Still she kept walking, this time faster. She was behind the break-up, at least in part. He just knew it.  He began to jog. Still she kept walking, turning down the economics hall corridor. There weren't any classes on a Saturday, there was nobody down there. She was just trying to shake him. He wasn't going to let her. Already his hand was gripped around the pen. \u201cDawn! We need to talk about Michelle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, and turned to face him. The look of contempt was undeniable. \u201cShe's over you, loser,\u201d she spat. \u201cNow why don't you go and crawl back into whatever lab you escaped from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh didn't respond. He just pointed the pen and fired. In front of his eyes, to his complete amazement, Dawn's body seemed to turn hollow; it became an empty shell, suspended in midair. Then it fell down, a pile of hair, skin and clothing, on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit...\u201d he muttered, looking around. The corridor was empty. Without thinking, he rushed forward, grabbed the pile, and burst into the nearest room, closing the door behind him. In his hands was... Dawn. Dawn's skin, her perfect features still prominent, like a mask. A body suit. The pen worked... how could the pen work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what else to do. A rush of excitement came over him as he stripped out of his own clothes and pulled her skin free, slipping a leg inside. Immediately he saw Dawn's leg reappear \u2013 a smooth, shapely, tanned limb of feminine perfection. There was no sign of his own leg, no bulge where his own muscle should be. It was as if the leg had turned into Dawn's. He put the next leg in, and began the process of pulling the body up. His own shape vanished, replaced by her toned curves, flat stomach, bugling breasts. He gave them a squeeze, almost surprised at their firmness. He was now in Dawn's 21-year-old body! And there was only one part to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down, gripped the hair, and pulled her face over his own. At once the world went dark, his vision lost in the shell, until he began to align her features with his own. He felt the pinch of her cheeks, then felt the gentle breeze in the room upon them. He pressed the forehead into place, felt the shape of her eyebrows where his own once were. His lips and teeth felt different, and his head heavier from her mop of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he said, eyes widening as Dawn's voice came out of her lips. \u201cI'm Dawn. I'm Dawn! Hey, Michelle, why is Josh such a loser?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to Dawn's clothes, bent over in her body, searched her bag for her pocket mirror. The reflected image was Dawn. A beautiful, naked, perfect image of Dawn. Her hair was a mess, her expression uncharacteristic, but there was no escaping it was Dawn. The reflection smiled evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well,\u201d Dawn's voice said, an evil current flowing through her seductive tone. \u201cI'd better get dressed and get back to my dorm. I've got a party to attend.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her lips are stained pink, pouted in you imagine some minor surgical procedure. She doesn't have a full range of facial motions either; her forehead is smooth, and you suspect she's had a botox injection. Certainly you're now wearing hair extensions, with wavy, black hair bouncing around your nude shoulders. Your whole body is coated in a fake tan, too. You reach down and begin to don her undergarments, pausing when you reach the bra. How the hell do you put one of these things on? You try cupping it under your generous chest, lifting up Dawn's impressive cleavage, but you can't quite get the clasp behind your back. Dawn's fingers don't make it any easier: you've currently got elaborate fake nails attached, which just end up digging in and scratching your false back. Every time you feel you're getting somewhere, another problem occurs: you slip, or her extensions get caught in the clasp, pulling your false scalp back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and are about to give up when another idea hits you. What does the brown pen do? If it's a costume set, it would make sense if it also helped you impersonate someone. You cross the floor, the tiles cold against your bare feet, and return to your discarded clothes. Picking up the pen, you direct it at your claimed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing,\" Dawn's girly voice chirps. You fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation is instantly overwhelming, like a white-hot lightning that flashes to blind you. You blink furiously, shaking your head and moaning a little. Your vision begins to return, blotches of bold color being replaced by the interior of the bathroom. And, as the spots and shapes fade, you find they've left something behind. You remember everything about Dawn's life. Her likes, her dislikes. Every conversation she can recall. Select memories, like broken home movies, drifting in her psyche. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fu...\" Dawn exclaims, catching herself from swearing. Dawn never swears. Even about Josh. Gosh, he's so creepy. You're glad you told Michelle about what Terri and Hannah had told you about what Gary and Otis said about what happened in... you shake your head again. This is unbelievable. You know everything Dawn does, from the best foundation of her to use, to private details such as her passwords and history. You're still in the driving seat, but you can instantly call on anything about Dawn, her personality to her memories, as you require. You haven't just stolen her body, you've stolen her life, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh, crazed and delirious, as you return to the bra, slipping it on with ease. You cup your breasts with her hands, making an appreciative \"hmm\" as she marvels at her own body. She has had beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery, it transpires. This image she's created is fake, as fake and as shallow as her personality. Michelle isn't a friend, as far as Dawn sees her. She's an opportunity, a gateway to a wealthy, select group she hopes to join in later life. Michelle is just a stepping stone. But that's how Dawn views most people. Her dislike for you is utterly genuine, stemming from the fact she saw you pick your nose once. You don't even remember that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide into her jeans, then pull her work top over her hair, before straightening it and checking her makeup with the compact. \"Perfection as always\" you state, as she always does, although her tone doesn't usually drip with such enthusiasm. You stuff your discarded clothes into one of the toilet cisterns, pull on her jacket, slip the pens inside, and head for 'home'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as you scroll through Dawn's Facebook contacts, reading all the gossip of the day, curled up on her bed in her room. She always keeps in the loop, knowing who's seeing who - and doing whom - on campus. On the back of the door hangs your costume for tonight. Tonight's costume party (hosted by Luke Howard, the college's football star) has a sci-fi/fantasy theme, so the usual choices of costume are out. Dawn, it turns out, is an enthusiastic roleplayer in the bedroom; the sexy nurse and nun outfits are her own. However, not really knowing anything about sci-fi (when she saw the party tag 'get your geek on', she thought it was meant to be Greek and be a toga party), she is planning to head to the local costume store to pick something up. As her, you could certainly use your own knowledge to select something that would play to her stunning figure: a Miranda Lawson costume, for example. Or even some elegant dress from one of the countless medieval fantasy settings. Dawn Cloverdale could be the envy of every girl on campus. Not that you want to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, you could forget the party. As Dawn, you could approach any of the others. Maya, Charlotte - even Mrs Francis - and become them instead. They're all closer to Michelle than Dawn, and she's more likely to listen to them. Alternatively, you could get some payback in your current form. Dawn could use being taken down a peg, and as her you could all too easily do something that would land her in serious trouble. Perhaps a little shoplifting, speeding, or even drunk driving is in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp,\" you say, Dawn's bizarre choice of words spilling out on instinct. \"I can't sit around here all day, being some kind of stay-at-home loser, can I?\"</span></div></div>",

It looks like the same type of wood as the rest of the case, but it's slightly paler and the pattern of the grain doesn't quite match the rest of the lid.  You hadn't noticed that before!  Being Dawn seems to have changed the way you observe things, and, much as you'd hate to admit it, in this case for the better.  That lid isn't solid wood.  You tap it with a fake fingernail and, sure enough, the tap seems muffled.  With the too-long fingernail of your right pinky finger, you deftly pry up the edge of the veneer that lines the box lid.

But that would make Josh and Dawn both vanish, and with the duplicating abilities of the pens that isn't necessary.

Sure she is fake in every way and more than a little bit ruthless but she is also filled to the brim with an assertiveness that you just can not and frankly do not want to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the desire to be Charlotte came over you it was clearly not Josh but Dawn who wanted to become the redhead. Knowing you won't need your old, boring self all that often anymore, you grip the brown pen and zap yourself. There is a short tightening in your stomach and you feel stuffed. Your memories of being Josh are still there but you are now for all intents and purposes Dawn. You can't wait to be Charlotte. You are, of course, only interested in her looks and opportunities and hope to god that you won't become the mousy little shadow of a person, that would defeat he purpose of becoming Dawn after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which: The feeling of being full seemed to wander down into your crotch. You sit down and start to involuntarily press. Within a minute a lump of skin leaves your vagina. You grab it and can instantly see its folded. It is not exactly rocket science to figure out what it would be should you unfold it. Sighing you take the Josh-skin and hide it away. Who knows? Maybe you will need it one day. Hopefully not<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after the five longest minutes of your life, you start to strip Charlotte's skin off her clothes. It being nothing but a bodysuit made it easy. You inspect it one last time before starting to put it on. Within minutes you can feel her smooth pale skin be yours and all that's left is her head. You pull it other your somewhat stiff face. The transformation does not take long to be completed and soon you can see your new Charlotte-body in your full length mirror. And how you love it. You have now the beautiful redhead's body. Slim and quite a bit shorter than before but that is what you wanted. Her body is well proportioned and feels far more real than your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" is the only word that escapes your cute lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you pick up the brown pen and zap yourself. The same feeling of vertigo and short-time blindness envelopes you as memories, feelings and habits pour inside your pretty head. So far so good. You check your watch. Still a few hours before the party, enough time to get a costume if you still want to go. The real question is: Will your new Charlotte personality proof as comfortable and, well, overwhelming as your first? Hopefully not but only time would tell, it went fast the first time though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your clothes and take your things and head to the costume shop.</span></div></div>",

It has quite a collection of elaborate costumes to pick from and it was far away enough that you would feel whether you can keep you Dawn-personality from being pushed to far into the background or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt works like a charm. You meet some friends of Charlotte, well of you now, and it is just as easy to be the new-you as it was to be Dawn. What surprises you is how easy it seems to still remember that you are Dawn and nip some of Charli's habits in the bud. Well you are not really Dawn, or Charlotte for that matter, but you are the only part of Dawn that is still around and are her in every part that matters. A little treacherous voice reminds you that you once were Josh but you shrug it off and revel how much better it feels to leave free reign to your Dawn-self. How downright wrong your action's as Dawn were and still are does not even occur to you. What you want (or rather that the Dawn-you wants) goes other people be damned. Your time as Josh seems more and more as nothing but a bad dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you part ways with your acquaintances you are completely confident that you can not only live Charlotte rather enviable life but live it much better than her. That thought makes you giddy and it is hard not cackle a bit in glee. Slowly you start to stamp out some of your more annoying traits. No more self-deprecating remarks that were meant, rather frighteningly come to think of it, completely serious. Likewise you plan to stand out, no more stunningly beautiful shrinking violet act for Charlotte. Of course you will need to take it slow, as grating as it may prove to be. After all you do NOT want the wrong kind of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing, though, is not quite as clear cut. It is how you will act towards Michelle. Charlotte followed her around like a lost puppy at times and nursed a big crush on her. Michelle greatly appreciated her in turn though it is not clear to you whether she knows about Charlotte's feelings or not. You quickly discard the idea that Michelle may be faking ignorance, she is just too nice a girl to do so. Those feelings are hard to control as they are very important to Charli. On top of that what bit of Josh that remains inside you is still quite infatuated with Michelle. All things considered you still want to close to her but how close you don't know yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the shop in the distance brings you back to the here and now. </span></div></div>",

You try to concentrate on imagining your Dawn skin coming off.

You double-check the setting and then zap yourself right in your Dawn face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt works, but you feel as if the real you has just died, as big a phony as Dawn was. It's another few minutes before you can remove the Dawn suit completely.  After that it's no big deal to zap your Josh body a few times so that you have three empty Josh skins. An obscure setting of the brown pen zaps an empty people suit into what looks like a micro-SD card and back, so that storing extra Josh suits is easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seal up a Josh suit and watch it become your clone.

Well maybe that is too strong a word. You know him in passing, Peter something-or-other. Seems to have perfected the art of being totally ambiguous. Regardless what you talked to him about or even heard him talk for that matter he never seems to have an opinion one way the other. Okay you only talked once to him and maybe you glared at him a lot, but so what? He isn't winning any awards in this conversation either. For some reason he thinks asking you out on the day of a really cool party seems like a good idea and once you mention that he, again, is more slippery and spineless than a slug. Now that you think of it he kind of reminds you of one, too. A comment later, a bit scathing but not directly insulting, you leave him standing and continue on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after a short walk a realization hits you: You did not even know the guy, Josh never met him.It was all Dawn! You acted nearly completely like Dawn! And you liked it. Not just the comfortable feeling of doing what came natural but your inner-self seemed to relish being bitchy when you can get away with it. It excites you and frightens you at the same time. What if you will actually be worse than before? You certainly have far better means than her, with the pens and all. Just as you start to think about that you arrive at the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push these thoughts back for now and go inside to take a look at the costumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout trouble you find a Miranda Lawson outfit. Well without having been Josh you would have trouble knowing what it is but that is neither here nor there. There are in fact two different kinds. One white and black rather tight looking formfitting overall made of some synthetic materials and a bit of leather around the arms. The other was more or less identical but completely out of black leather with orange highlights. Both outfits came with matching over-knee boots though, you are convinced the heels are a bit higher and thinner than in the game proper. You pick one in the right size and go to a booth to try it on. You haven't got a leather costume at home yet so you decide to take the black one to try on. Stripping down to your underwear you slide on the overall. It sits tight but comfortable all around. You are a bit surprised that the gloves are worked into the sleeves but since they also fit you nicely you don't complain. Not all is perfect though as it seems that you panties seem to roll up inside the thin leather suit. Well you can always wear a simple thong or even go commando. Your black hair really compliments the look, as does your smooth skin. Your face is, of course, very different from the video game character but that does not matter in the least, you like the way you look after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite satisfied you put the costume back and think about simply buying it or its black and white counterpart and bringing it home. Not one thought is spared that Dawn's home is not actually your home.</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be inappropriate to not bother finding a costume, after all, you were already currently in a costume. Dawn's dainty hands traveled to her bosom and gave them an appreciative squeeze, sending a wave of pleasure to your brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the prospect of turning up to the party <i>in</i> Dawn was enticing, you decided against it. Instead, you stripped your Dawn body to her undergarments. Briefly, you stopped to check yourself out and gave an appreciative whistle before you continued. For all her bitchiness as well as complete and utter moral deficiency as a human being, Dawn had a body to die for. However, you decided to try to swap to someone closer to Michelle's inner circle, perhaps you could use them to convince your ex that the break up was a bad decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of touching and feeling yourself, you felt your heart pounding inside your chest cavity. There were no sign of the slit on your back where you had originally used to slide inside Dawn's skin. The look on your face turned into one of pure terror as you imagined being Dawn forever. In your panic, the corner of your eyes were drawn to Dawn's jacket.Hurriedly, you rushed to it and extracted the two pens. Remembering the black one was the one responsible of turning Dawn into a piece of wearable skin, you pointed it to yourself, but stopped short before zapping yourself with it. Would the black pen turn you into a skin too? You didn't relish the thought of being Dawn forever, but the thought of becoming a skin for others to wear left yourself squirming in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: The chapter is written in past tense due to personal preference and will continue in past tense<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gently and carefully, you felt the area around the nape of the neck and was surprised at the small opening. You tugged at a piece of skin slowly, and felt the slit expanding as it opened and traveled down the length of your back until you felt it stopped yielding just above where your tailbone would be. That was when you tugged Dawn's face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent several minutes catching your breath whilst the discarded skin sprawled on the floor.

Soon, the skin ceased to inflate and you were greeted with the sight Dawn sprawled on the floor. Cautiously you examined the body, aside from the gentle up and down movement of her two breasts, there was no other sign that Dawn was aware of her surrounding. Immediately, you zapped Dawn again with the black pen, returning the girl into a wearable skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for you to move to someone closer to Michelle.</span></div></div>",

But what about.. her mother?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you think of Mrs. Francis, a you feel familiar, as if you've met her before. But of course, because Dawn frequently visits Michelle's house for things like sleepovers, or to pick her up to go clubbing. As Josh, you already knew where Michelle's mother lived, and that's where you were headed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, you park you car in the driver of Mrs. Francis' home. Getting out, you walk up to the door and knock, yelling out for anyone. You'd seen a car parked in the garage just in front of your car, which would be Mrs. Francis'. The door opens suddenly as you look back, Mrs. Francis gives a complacent look, as if she was surprised to see you, before warmly smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn! Honey, how've you been?\" She says, letting you in through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you exchange fake greetings, hugging and kissing each other's cheek. The familiar feeling you felt, it was one of animosity. For some reason, you feel disgusted by Michelle's mother. The two of you walk into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To what do I owe the pleasure, Dawn?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to ask you favour, Mrs. Francis.\" You say, grabbing the pen from your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" She notices you fiddling with your pocket and frowns, \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out.\" You say, crooked smirking as you zap her in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing her crumpled form on the floor, you scoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking her up, you proceed to walk up the stairs into a nearby bedroom. The room you enter is large but seems still. You recognize this from Dawn as Michelle's old room, the one she had before moving on campus. Draping Mrs. Francis' over one of the bedknobs, you strip down. Quickly pulling her skin over your own, your body assumes her shorter stature and you feel your body age. Mrs. Francis is older than Dawn, but still relatively young as she had Michelle at an early age. You feel your breasts become more loose and your legs slightly flabbier, not as well-maintained as your own. Zapping yourself with the brown pen, a shiver runs down your spine as you feel Mrs. Francis' personality flow through you. Patricia Francis is your name, you're 41, single mom. Shaking your head, you dispel the entranced feeling and walk out of the room, looking for your new body's phone. Finding it in another bedroom down the hall, you pick it up and dial your daughter's cellphone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? What's up?\" Michelle's voice comes through the phone, and you hesitate for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, how are you? I'm calling to tell you that your Uncle Jake is coming into town and I want you to come back home to see him whilst he's here.\" You lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Jake? Wow, haven't seen him in a while. Sure, I'll be home on Sunday.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely, see you sweetheart!\" You say in her mother's high tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, bye.\" The phone beeps as the call ends. You pull the mask of Mrs. Francis face from Dawn's, you feel relieved as your cheeks tighten up with youth.<br>\r\nNow that all that's over with, all I need to do is wait for Michelle to come over. Glancing at your phone's display, it's currently Friday.<br>\r\nThat's two days, you look around the room and shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not a bad place to crash.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling Mrs. Francis from your body, you let her fall into a heap on the floor as you let your skin get some fresh air. Climbing into Mrs. Francis' bed, you grab a nearby TV remote and turn on the TV on the other side of the room, mounted on a chest of drawers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having picked up Dawn's skin from the floor, the same amazement you felt when you first discovered the capabilities of the pens washed over you again. A devious smirk appeared on your face as you donned on Dawn's face over yours and slipped your entire body snugly inside her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Maya, help me pick out my outfit?'', you said as you heard a voice on the other end of phone line. ''Pretty please?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation lasted a few minutes, often veering off on a tangent across a wide spectrum of topics. But when the conversation finally ended you were pleased to have secured Maya's commitment to help Dawn Cloverdale pick out an outfit for the party. You uncrossed Dawn's shapely legs and let out a shrill laugh after you tossed the phone away. You played the part of Dawn Cloverdale perfectly well, even her friends. You were even aware of Dawn's thought, and how she inwardly sneered that Maya wasn't invited to the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who wouldn't think otherwise?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if you were on auto pilot for the whole conversation. Dawn Cloverdale's mannerism flowed smoothly across. She said the things that she'd normally say and reacted the way she normally would. You got up from the bed and looked at Dawn's reflection in the mirror, fake tanned to perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your eyes feast on the sight, from her sizable bosom down to the shapely legs. You traced Dawn's legs, pausing momentarily to feel a well trimmed tuft around her cunny. You then continued your exploration further, finally your hands rest on Dawn's bosom. You smiled and Dawn's reflection smiled too as you firm up those delicate fingers around her breasts and copped a good feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could reach for the vibrator hidden inside one of the numerous drawers in the room that had been begging to be noticed, but you were more enthralled of the prospect of finding Dawn's stash of make believe uniform. Feeling flushed and out of breath again, you sauntered to a cupboard and fling the doors open to reveal a number of make-believe uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nurse, nuns, pirates, sexy santas, school uniforms</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but to chuckle as you rifled through the different articles of role play apparels. For a moment you thought that you and Dawn might not be so different after all. You did a fair share of roleplaying, although mainly limited to Halloween or conventions. Your Doctor Who three piece tailor made suit was particularly smashing as you recalled winning a local convention and you were able to use it outside convention too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perked up as you heard the front door's bell buzzing. Hastily, you pulled on a loose fitting loungewear and rushed down to meet your guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I can't believe you still haven't got anything to wear,'' the exasperated tone in Maya's voice delighted you greatly as you thought of how wrong she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I don't know,'' you pretended to feel the same way, ''Should I ditch the party?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No!'', Maya exclaimed, ''What about Michelle? She'll be by herself there.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Maybe you can go with her.'', you suggested innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya threw you a dark look, just like you knew she would. After the end of her turbulent relationship with Luke Howard, Maya wasn't exactly in speaking terms with the college's football star and the incidental host of the party. Dawn's mind were just too happy at the chance to rub it in Maya's face and you were only too happy to do just that. There were no doubt that Luke would be flaunting his new catch in the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''If we hurry, maybe we could get you something in the department store down town.'', the dark look in Maya's face subsided, she glanced at her designer watch and at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're a good friend, Maya.'' you hugged the girl and felt the two pairs of boobs pressed against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Come on then, ''Maya turned businesslike after breaking the hugs. She then turned her back to you and you took the opportunity to zap her into a wearable skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe act of self gratification wasn't exactly your most admirable trait, although you have been long familiar with the practice. A smirk appeared on your face as you grabbed the shaft of your semi flaccid member and stroked it until it was hard. You looked in the mirror to see Maya sporting the same smirk on her face. Her hand was stroking your erect member in the same way that you were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maya's jacking me off!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's face was over your own and you after a bit of experiment, you managed to fit only your arms and your upper torso inside her skin. The lower half of Maya's skin remained floppy. Whilst Dawn's skin was discarded around your legs as you continued to stroke your member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation soon overwhelmed you, Maya's soft hands and the moans that came out from her mouth being the main perpetrator as you ejaculated all over the floor. ''Fucckkkk,'' you groaned. Then, robbed of your strength, you laid there on Dawn's bed, staring at the ceiling and marveled at how your life had turned out to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That should be everything,'' you looked at your handiwork. Instead of cleaning after the mess, you merely let your cum seeped into the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your legs inside Maya's, before slipping your arms inside hers. You admired her beautiful complexion before you slipped inside Maya's face as if wearing a mask. The otherworldly sensation came back to you, the exact same thing you felt when you put on Dawn's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wow,'' you mouthed as the transformation is completed. You scoured the bed for the brown pen that you knew were there somewhere and zapped yourself with it. A white hot sensation seared through your mind as if your mind was a computer, downloading information at the speed of light. Information about Maya, her memories, her life and everything she ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh shit,'' Maya mouthed. She remembered that she was supposed to be helping Dawn pick an outfit. Dawn the ingrate, purposefully rubbing the break up in her face. If it wasn't for Michelle, you wouldn't be friend with the bitch. You blinked twice and the world returned to you as the blotches of bright colours dissipated from your field of view. You can't help but to laugh that Maya wasn't too keen on Dawn herself. Female friendship remained a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up Maya's clothes that was scattered around the room and donned them in a workwomanlike fashion. There would be time for exploration later on, you thought as you ruffled Maya's hair. It was originally black, but Maya had it dyed to brunette, with highlights of different eye catching hues, mainly green and purple that captured people's attention whilst not being too out of contrast with the rest of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpishly, you looked at Dawn on the floor, still a lifeless skin. You zapped her with the black pen and left the room after witnessing the transformation with a spring on your step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in Maya's car, and adjusted the rear view mirror. It had been a thrilling time for you, but maybe you could do more. Luke had been cheating on his new babe, Maya's mind told you. Terri and Hannah passed this bit of information to Maya after the break up, including the name of the girl that he was cheating with and some incriminating shots the two had managed to capture. Maya herself didn't want to say anything to Luke's new beau, but it was mostly due to the fact that she wanted to see the bitch suffer after taking Luke away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But I'm different</i>, you thought to yourself as you admired Maya's manicured fingers. There's always a possibility of Maya to make a grand entrance to the party and cause a scene or use a more discreet way, wearing the skin of Luke's new beau yourself and humiliate Luke in front of the influential people on campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped yourself as you realized you were indulging too much on Maya's personal strife and troubles which had nothing to do whatsoever with your predicament. After you had thought about it, maybe it would be better for you to return to Maya's house and started on your plan to get Michelle back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation to let all hell break loose however, still lingered in the back of your mind.</span></div></div>",

As you know that if you want to get close to Michelle, you first have to get to someone closer to her and the first person that come to your mind was Mrs.Chloe Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs.francis is type of person who is very strict and loving mother. and Michelle had already declared to her mother that she will become a model designer and Mrs Francis also supported her decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to be honest, she was a bitch when it comes to other people's other than her daughter's .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had meet her at parents meeting and when you were trying to talk to Michelle she interfere and started saying to not get close to her daughter and many bad things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking and dazing off you had already reached at your destination, you paid the money to the driver and than you see a big house like mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow, what a big house she must be super rich\". You said as you look at the big house. Then you look at the pen, if it worked than this house can be yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you see a luxurious car coming from ahead of road. Then you see as that car coming in your direction and than stops right in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door of the car open and you see a beautiful woman coming out. She has beautiful blonde hair and she is wearing your typical high class office dress, and suddenly she started talking to you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey u, aren't you the boy from Michelle college. What are you doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....ee no it's not like that \" you said while panicking. Then you realize that the woman in front of you is Mrs. Francis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me that you are stalking my girl \"<br>\r\nShe looks at you suspiciously and was also holding her mobile tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her then you look at the pen in your hands \"OHHH...fuck it \" you scream while saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the pen at her and before she could do anything she crumbled to the ground nothing more than a pile of skin <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her surprised, you can't believe it that it actually worked. Then you look at the pile of skin, sensing no one is around you. You take the skin and take it inside the car which door was open, you close the door and look at the skin. You see a hole in the back of her head and you knew now where to start wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't that this device actually worked you thought it was cool that's why you buy it, you Didn't think it really worked it was just your instincts that you buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do i do \" you said signing, your feelings were conflicted now that you know that you just made a living human into skinsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you also didn't feel bad  for doing this to her, Why you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world around you is still crackling with energy as you get up. Wow; you knew it would be intense, but you never appreciated just how strange it would feel \u2013 like a thousand electric shocks at once - until you did it. You've just traveled back in time, back 500 years. The temporal eddies dissipate like lightning into the ground, and you take stock of your surroundings. In one hand you hold the device that just let you defy physics: the brown pen. In the other, your only hope of completing your mission in this foreign land: the black pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a cold morning; you're in England during the summer of 1535. King Henry VIII is on the throne, his wife Anne Boleyn \u2013 Queen Anne \u2013 sits beside him. This is the time when history as you know it will unravel; it's up to you to find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backtrack, thinking about past events in your own timeline: events that take place in the future. In 2027 the pens were developed. One was a time-travel device, the other a molecular compressor. Every atom in the world can be screwed up into a tennis ball if compressed; and once you can reorganize atomic structure, disguise becomes easy. The pens are top secret prototypes; only the upper echelons of your organization know about them. And only a handful of people \u2013 you included \u2013 know about the symbols. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, the reason for your visit to this time: the symbols on the pens. Symbols that have appeared in artifacts and archaeological digs from multiple time periods, from the ancient world to the Wild West. Nobody knows what the symbols represent, or who left them throughout time. The creator of the pens was a mad scientist in every sense of the phrase, and killed himself shortly after making his creations; he never explained how he did it, or what the symbols he added to the pens mean. You have been sent to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your present. You look about you; you're in a large garden of some kind. On instinct, you hurry behind the nearest hedge row. This is Hampton Court Palace, Henry VIII's seat of power. In two days' time, during a feast, someone will scratch the symbols on the back of the throne of England; it's a documented event, part of the evidence later used to send Anne Boleyn to the headsman's block as a witch, though at the time it was largely ignored as petty vandalism. You need to be there to see who does it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black pen is your weapon; find someone, use the compressor to create a wearable skinsuit, slip into their identity and wait. You've studied enough to recognize key figures, and an expert has taught you how to act. Once done, the brown pen will let you jump to another time when the symbols appeared, until you've solved all parts of this temporal the riddle. That's not your immediate concern, though. You're currently wearing a 21st century jumpsuit; you'll stand out if you don't find someone to impersonate quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe garden you're hiding in is to the back of the palace. The grass is covered in dew and a thin mist hangs over the whole of the palace. It's early morning, there isn't much activity, but you can spy a couple of candidates for your first disguise. A guard is patrolling the grounds, a regular stomp of boots not far away; you could take his place, and use his access to find another person to become. Alternatively, through the bush you can see a maid carrying a bucket of water. She's care-worn, probably in her mid-thirties, reed-thin and wearing work clothes. She would give you access to everywhere, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you hear laughter, and two soft voices chatting to each other above the clatter of hooves. You scramble along the bush to look out. Two ladies-in-waiting, both aged in their early 20s, are just finishing a morning ride. One, a pale girl with ginger locks tied back in an ornate ponytail, seems to be hanging back to pick some flowers. She could be an ideal choice too; as her, you could easily slip into court unnoticed. Given the way she is dressed, she could even be one of the Queen's maids. You could even use her as a stepping stone to become, at least for a few days, the Queen of England herself; who better to see who etches the symbols onto the throne?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's a funny thing, smell. The human body adapts to its environment, blocking out ever-present odors. The Tudor period isn't famous for its body hygiene, which is probably why you can smell the guard as he approaches. That makes it all the easier to step outside and shoot him with the black pen. The suit collapses, as do his clothes, armor and halberd. You grab them all and drag them into the bushes, stripping out of your modern apparel and burying it. The fabric, you know, will disintegrate rapidly; it's designed to leave no trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard was the obvious choice: male, and, despite his armor, the easiest to slip on unnoticed. The maid could be missed, and ladies in waiting have several layers of robe to don. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you need to replace the guard. You grab the suit and begin to slip it on, frowning at the general level of dirt and sweat: this is a working man's body. You pull up the hair-covered chest, slip your hands into the half-bitten nails, and finally pull the matted, unwashed hair over your own head. Moments later you're adjusting to your new face, with its great, bushy beard. Then it's a matter of putting on his hosiery, then breastplate, and finally his helmet. You pick up the heavy shaft of the halberd, slot it on your shoulder, and resume your patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep patrolling for a few minutes only: the guard's body is only a stop-gap, and you have no information about him at all. One of the greatest elements of future tech is your nanocomputer, constantly giving you information as you think of it. It even has a live translate function, turning the speech of others into a modern vernacular for you, and your speech the same. It's a relief: talking like Shakespeare for the next few days would be nigh-on impossible \u2013 it's all Greek to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer is drawing a blank on your current body; evidently the guard is a historical nobody. So instead you work your way into the palace. You know every stair and passage already from intense studying, but the computer still pulls up relevant information. You pass by maids polishing the tables and serving boys finishing their early morning chores. The King is out, you know \u2013 his party were out on a hunt. No....<i>are out</i>. You have to remember that you're now living this particular moment in time. It's not the past any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride up the stairs, and walk down a corridor draped in tapestries. Nobody pays you much heed, just as you expected. But now you have to make a choice for your next 'costume'. Staying as a guard is pointless, and you want to find and impersonate someone the computer knows and has details on. As the prominent men of court are out hunting at the moment, that leaves you with little option but to select the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left, you know, is the Queen's apartments. The lady in waiting you saw earlier is still outside. If she keeps to the schedule, at the moment Queen Anne will be alone, reading from her Book of Hours \u2013 private religious worship. You're confident you could slip in and make the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, across the hall is that of Lady Margaret Clare. The computer records state her as a court beauty of some note, although not to the king's tastes \u2013 he preferred small and skinny women, and Margaret's figure is described with language you suppose to mean 'curvy'. She is a widow at 30, previously married to Sir Henry Clare, one of the most powerful men in the kingdom before he died of the bloody flux. There's a lot of information on her, and you're confident you could pose as her too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your beard and ponder which way to go.</span></div></div>",

There isn't anything exciting. Leftover pizza, random fruits and vegetables, milk. Tina's eyes glazes over at the mundane items.

The pleasant taste of the brew is amplified further by the knowledge that she wouldn't be suspected of taking the last can. Let Nick worry about it. Instead, Tina adjusts her oversized tee so that it covers her cleavage better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina glances over at David and Claire who are kept too busy by technology to notice that their sister is busy fondling her own bosom. The eldest child in the Anderson house soon decides that she needs more privacy. Gingerly she tosses the empty can away and struts away from the kitchen to the confine of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina smiles and her reflection in the mirror smiles back at her. She watches as the reflection mirrors her every move. Her hands trace the inside of her thighs, before they travel to the outside and rest on her firm and shapely buttocks. She doesn't feel the need to explore the rest of her naked body, including the slim stomach and the tantalising bosom. Instead she reaches for her phone and takes a few selfies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, David,'' Claire nudges your arm, breaking the hold of the television's program over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh, wha-?'' you don't pry your eyes away from the screen however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Have you seen Tina lately?'', Claire continues. If she takes any offences at the lack of interests you showed her, she doesn't say anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Huh? Yeah, of course. Didn't she was just here?'' you are puzzled by the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''No, I mean, like, do you notice anything weird about her?'' Claire seems to ignore your bewilderment and presses on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question actually has you racking your brain. You shake your head for you can't recall any odd thing that Tina had done lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire rolls her eyes,''It's like she wasn't herself, haven't you noticed?'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. Claire can be quite persistent when she wants to, ''Maybe she's just not feeling well'', you try to offer up an explanation to Claire's suspicions. Though judging from your sister's facial expression, she doesn't buy it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pauses and you think you can finally get back on watching the television,''I saw her playing with her boobs in the kitchen,'' she says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't hear what she says as your attention is again back towards the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the bathroom, Tina puts down her phone next to two pens. One is black whilst the other is brown. Physically, that's the only difference between the two pens as both of them contains some strange inscriptions and both has a button on top. A sly smile appears on Tina's face when she picks up the black one of the two. She points it to herself before pressing the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slit opens up at the Tina's nape. Her hands reach to what looks like a small incision, before splitting them apart. Tina's face twists and contorts out of shape as a head emerges from Tina's neck whilst her own head deflates and hangs loosely against her bosom. </span></div></div>",

Tina noticed all of this however and took it in stride, embracing him and gently kneeding the buldge in his pants. \"Been waiting for you for a bit Matt, you'll love what i got planned\" Whispered Tina, giving Matt a deep kiss before giggling and pulling him inside and up the stairs to her room, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Anderson siblings saw all this happen, and only when the door to Tinas room slam shut did David ask \"Shes got a boyfriend now?

Instead, Tina adjusts her oversized tee so that it covers her cleavage better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Nick's not going to be happy,'' Claire frowns and points at the now empty beer can accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Tina just chuckles, ''Our dear brother doesn't have to know,'' Her sentence ends with an inane smile that unsettles Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You should still get him a new pack. You-,'' Claire never finishes her sentence as her body convulses briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't worry <i>sis</i>,'' Tina chuckles. Tina's hands reach for Claire's before guiding them on her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Damn <i>sis</i>,'' an inane smile that mirrors Tina's earliest one now appears on Claire's face, ''Nice racks you have here.'' The younger sister squeezes her elder sister's bosom appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You girls need to give me a break,'' Jimmy walks into the kitchen only to be greeted with the sight of Claire molesting Tina's breasts. ''I think I'm hard again.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is that <i>my</i> panties?'' Tina chuckles at the article of clothing in Jimmy's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know it,'' Jimmy grins and chucks it inside the washing machine, ''One cum-stained panties to the wash.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Did you get our friend too?'' Claire cranes her head to peek at the direction of the living room, where David now is busy stroking his cock in the open whilst talking on the phone. ''Well, I guess you did,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Why don't I go and help our brother over there,'' Tina smirks and makes her way to David. Jimmy grins as his two clones exchanges some mundane conversation, before Tina grabs her brother's erect shaft in her hands and starts stroking it furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I knew it wasn't a mistake to make this,'' Jimmy brandishes the blue pen before he tucks it safely inside a box, along with the brown and black pens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy feels a hand brushing against his member which is now at half mast and recognizes the hand belongs to Claire,''We did good.'' Claire smiles conspiratorially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy reaches out for Claire's buttocks but finds his hand batted away by the youngest daughter of the Anderson's household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm still 16 you know,'' Claire giggles, ''Why don't you just relax and I'll take care of the rest.'' the clone peels of her clothes to reveal a white set of bra and panties. Gingerly, she licks her palm and starts giving Jimmy a handjob in the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's a good thing to be young again,'' Jimmy smirks. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A divorcee in her forties she lives together with Trish, her only daughter, ''Is anyone else coming?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''David and Tina are just lagging behind,'' Claire comments as she steps inside the house. ''Speaking of behind,'' Claire places a palm on Mrs. O'Neil's rump. The divorced housewife turns to Claire and gives her a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I never knew she's such a MILF too,'' Mrs. O'Neil quips as David and Tina make their way past her. ''Well, now that we're all here, should we start?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I still can't believe you're really doing this to David,'' Trish turns around to face Jimmy. ''Wasn't he your friend in high school?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm getting him laid,'' Jimmy smirks, ''It's about time someone puts out for him.'' Jimmy opens David's hollow and flabby head and inserts his own head inside. Jimmy feels his body shifting slightly as the transformation into David is completed. David grins and pats the ass in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''But with Trish's mom,'' Trish snickers before a soft moan escapes her lips, ''That's enough for now,'' Trish beckons to Claire who is kneeling directly in front of her pussy. ''I'm taking her off,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I've always had an eye on Tina,'' Jimmy-worn-David's eyes follows Trish's fit body as the girl walks past him. ''Trying, hoping to see if one day I can get inside her panties,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, you did get inside her, literally.'' Claire giggles and picks up the discarded skin of Tina on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I never realised my mother is such a MILF,'' Trish traces a finger up Mrs. O'Neil's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's my lucky day then,'' David guides his erect shaft between Mrs. O'Neil's thighs where it lingers before it plunges deep inside Mrs. O'Neil's awaiting pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I haven't had a dick in me for so long,'' Mrs. O'Neil groans. Her hips gyrates on the pole that is David's dick. The mature woman moans in ecstasy as David pounds her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish takes the black pen and shoots herself with it. A slit opens up at her nape. Her hands reach to what looks like a small incision, before splitting them apart. Trish's face twists and contorts out of shape as a head emerges from her neck whilst her own head deflates and hangs loosely against her perky bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good to see you again Matt,'' Tina greets the person emerging from inside Trish's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, is that Claire inside?'' Matt peels off the rest of Trish's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'm a big girl now,'' Tina giggles, ''Why don't you get Trish ready, while I show you why I had my eye on Tina for such a long time.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sure,'' Matt's eyes travels up and down Tina's shapely body. Ignoring the stirring in his groin, which is something he missed whilst he was inside Trish, Matt bends down and let Trish's body to inflate. ''She's fit,'' Matt quips, referring to the difference in physique. Whilst Matt isn't exactly overweight, he is a bit on the pudgy side. His rather modest height didn't help him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt doesn't let Trish stir, instead, he quickly zaps her as soon as the girl shows any sign of waking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''That's quite a sight to wake up to,'' a lazy smile on her face, Trish slowly gets up from the carpeted floor. ''Finding my best friend with his dick stuck inside mommy dearest's snatch,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're already awake?'' Mrs O'Neil manages to gasp in between David's thrusts. The two had swapped roles now, with David doing most of the work and Mrs. O'Neil being laid back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know David, you could've had this,'' Trish spreads her pussy apart for David and Mrs O'Neil to see. ''I should let Matt have it instead.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish ignores Tina who is busy touching herself on the floor and heads straight to Matt who is waiting on the couch with his member erect. Jimmy's accomplice can't hide the smug look on his face as the clone infused Trish clambers on top of him, before lowering herself down on his member, enveloping it whole inside her tight pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as Trish starts pumping, the smug look on Matt's face doesn't linger for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n''It's good to be young again,'' Jimmy flexes his muscle. It is nice to have a little bit of peace and quiet in the house again. There's only a soft slurping noise emanating from the sloppy blowjob-slash-cleanup that Mrs O'Neil's doing to Matt's member. The last hour or so has been filled with sex noises as the moans and grunts alternates harmoniously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I'll say,''Matt agrees and he shoos Mrs. O'Neil's attentive mouth away when the bell rings. Mrs O'Neil then starts dressing properly again to receive the unwelcomed guest downstairs. Claire and David are back at the Anderson's household, the clones playing the role of the siblings well. Their eldest sister remains a skin for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy shakes the deflated skin of Tina so as to let it settle, before stepping inside the deflated legs, then arms before finishing the transformation. Almost immediately, his chest and ass burst out. Where Jimmy stood before now stands Tina in her naked glory, ''Hit me up,'' Tina motions to Matt, who immediately zaps his cousin with the brown pen, giving Jimmy the mind and memories of Tina Anderson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I guess it's my turn now,'' Matt chuckles. What happens to Matt is in fact the opposite of Jimmy's transformation. As Matt plunges his legs inside Trish's deflated ones, they immediately becomes more shapely. His slight pouch on the stomach due to excessive consumption of fast foods, snacks and period of non-exercise turns becomes very noticeably slim and toned. ''Who needs diets?'' Matt smirks and grabs Trish's perky breasts appreciatively in his now dainty hands. His curly ginger hair and round face disappears under Trish's much leaner face and pointed chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I think I'll make this my permanent base,'' the new Trish shakes her hair into place. She takes the time to admire her olive complexion before Tina zaps her with the brown pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Don't you still have school to go to?'' Tina asks teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Oh, shoot. I don't see why I should go anyway, I know the answers already.'' being from the same alternate reality as Jimmy, it has been a long long time since the two of them went to high school. ''I could just stay here and enjoy this body.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Duh, your parents are going to look for you,'' Tina grabs her bra and clasp it around her before putting her magnificent globes inside the cups. ''What about the teachers there?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You're right,'' Trish sighs. Meanwhile, Tina takes the opportunity to slide her panties back on. ''It's just that after all this time, I had to deal with bullies again. We should've jumped a year later.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Duh, you know that the wormhole doesn't work like that. We calculated the best time to use it. We could've ended up in the prehistoric times.'' Tina dons her tee and look at Trish, ''You're not the same person, you'll know how to deal with them.'' a glint appears on Tina's eyes as she finishes the sentence. ''Besides it might be fun, I could even go there and take a look.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Wait, what about Heather and your mom?'' Trish enquiries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We can just pop a clone in each of them, no questions will be asked.'' Tina struggles to get into her jeans. ''That'll leave us two each to play with.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You know,'' Trish gets up and pace around the room, ''I was thinking we should go to your school instead.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Haven't you had enough fun years ago?'' Tina laughs at that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Not really,'' Trish murmurs under her breath as memories of the fun times filters in. ''We can put a clone each in my parents, and no questions will be asked too.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls exchanges knowing smiles, before breaking into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Looks like we have to settle this the usual way,'' Tina hides a hand behind her back. Her hidden hand is balled up. ''Best of one?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''On three?'', Trish similarly does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''One, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Two<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Three,'' the girls say in unison as they reveal their hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere can only be one winner in this age old way of settling things.</span></div></div>",

The front passenger side window rolls down so that Trish can rear her head out from the Japanese car and take in the familiar, albeit long forgotten view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Just as I remembered it,'' Trish comments at the white-walled buildings and the field that stretches to the horizon. Being located in the suburbs certainly has its perks. Edgefield High consists of a compound of buildings and spacious fields for sports and other activities, courtesy of the abundant space in the vicinity when it was first built. Somehow, despite the increasing population the school retains much of its grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well, have fun then,'' Tina quips beside her, ''I have to go for work now,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tina shudders as she feels something grips her shoulder tightly,''Don't forget we need to extract you out first,'' Jimmy grins as he rears his head between the two girls. His hand is still on Tina's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What are you-?'' Tina starts, but she stops as soon as Jimmy raises an eyebrow with a knowing smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Aw dude, I thought you had forgotten,'' Tina pouts uncharacteristically. She looks at Jimmy and Trish who is now looking at her amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''If you weren't trying to peer down your cleavage every time we come to a stop, we'll probably have forgotten,'' Trish giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina takes a few seconds to admire the deep chasm between her jugs,''You got to to admit they're impressive,'' Tina hugs herself,''And this skirt suit's the icing on the cake,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You look like a hot secretary or receptionist, does she have any glasses there?'', Jimmy motions at the gloves compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''None, I-, I mean Tina doesn't wear glasses,'' You should know, you've been inside her.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I can't remember really,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I doubt Tina leaves the top button of her shirt undone too,'' Trish finally quips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina sighs, but she dutifully do her button up,''I was really looking forward to going to the law firm she works in,'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We probably should, one day.'' Jimmy grins, ''But now, I need all my remaining clones on field. Don't worry, we'll get you inside a pretty young thing or two in no time at all.'' Jimmy and Matt needed to use one clone each to subdue Matt's parents to stop anyone who might ask about their son's skiving. All it took was a quick and easy trip to the city after they had left Trish and her mother to clean up after the fun night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Fine,'' the clone in Tina finally relents. As much as he likes being inside Tina's body, he knows that with the blue pen that Jimmy currently has in his other hand, he could be ejected out from Tina's body and back inside the pen. It should know, after all, it's a copy of Jimmy's consciousness made by imprinting Jimmy's mind inside the supercomputer inside the pen's hollow core, before being fired as an invisible beam at an unsuspecting victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Here we go,'' Jimmy zaps their driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy and Trish watch as Tina drives away confused and disoriented, after finding herself in near her former high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey, isn't that David?'' Trish says to Jimmy as the two of them walk by the railing that separates the field from the pavement. The whole squad is down on the field to train with a big game coming up, despite the chilly early morning condition. Unlike Jimmy, David is in the football (otherwise known as soccer) team with John, one of their mutual friend. ''I think I can see Jessica and Samantha as well,'' Trish continues enthusiastically. It's common for the girlfriends of the football team member to come down and watch the practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way inside the school ground, the two of them scans the horizon to see who could benefit from having a clone of Jimmy inside their bodies.</span></div></div>",

The Special Warrant Officer did not believe his eyes as he stepped over a solid metal wreck to make his way into what 24 hours ago was one of the most technologically advanced research lab in the United States, if not in the whole world. Instead, the immaculate work area that was manned by some of the best scientists was now a ruin. Electronic devices on site were melted or outright destroyed. There were cables jutting out from the ceiling. Rick Jones wasn't too worried about them, when an explosion was heard in the very early hours in the morning, the fail-safe mechanisms of the compound kicked in, shutting down the affected area. The compartmentalized design of the facility made it easier to stop the fire from spreading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the overseer of the research facility, Rick Jones was more worried about the figures who were inside the room with him right now. They weren't his men, despite the fact that they were wearing hazmat suits identical to one he was wearing. At this time, he was more worried about what they would dig up. Of course he had made some arrangements before they came, his gaze wandered to the giant titanium box on the middle of the room that appeared to be left unscathed<br>\r\n .<br>\r\n''Sir?'', a figure wearing hazmat suit stood in front of him. The voice was rather garbled, coming from inside the suit, but Rick Jones could recognise that voice anywhere. It was his deputy, Michelle Robertson. ''The President wants to see you and the Secretary of Defense is with her.''<br>\r\nRick closed his eyes momentarily, he knew that this was coming, but he didn't expect it to be this soon. ''Fine,'' he said through gritted teeth,'' Gather the scientists, I'll see them after this.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n''Ma'am, Sir'' Rick greeted the President and the Secretary of Defense who were already waiting in his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There's no need to salute,'' the President interjected when she saw Rick entering the room. ''Sit down,''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes Ma'am,'' Rick sat down and looked at his guests, alternating between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What happened?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick took a deep breath. ''There was an explosion in one of the research rooms located at 210 meters below ground.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''What was the cause? Were there anyone in the room during the explosion?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''We,'' Rick paused and he looked at the Secretary of Defense, ''don't know yet at the moment. Ms. Robertson is currently trying to find out if everyone's okay.'' Rick looked again at the Secretary of Defense. ''But it was in the early hours, so I doubt that there were anyone in the room while it happened.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is there no surveillance feed?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''There are no surveillance cameras at all Ma'am,'' Rick paused, ''Your predecessor, he specifically didn't install any inside the research labs, only around the perimeters. He was afraid that hackers would be able to gain access and gain classified information.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frown on the President's face made her look 10 years older. It wasn't the start of term that she had wished for. The facility and the research undertaken inside it was only revealed to her by the Secretary of Defense very recently. She only hoped that other countries would not find out about it. If she was lucky, it would only be reported as a massive earthquake. She dread the thought of the worst possible outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Is there any possibility of-,'' the President's voice shook as she contemplated the worst possible outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ma'am,'' this time, it was the Secretary of Defense. ''We made doubly sure that what happened at the Large Hadron Collider will not happen here.'' there was a grim visage on all three faces on that room. ''Our facility here is also smaller than the one now defunct in Geneva. Any chance of, ''the Secretary of Defense hesitated, '' - a blackhole, will be extremely rare.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Even if it was likely to happen,'' Rick found his voice again, ''Our researches on black holes in outer space has given us more insight. This lab is fitted with countermeasures and our location is much deeper than the LHC. Whoever designed this facility knew what they were doing.'' Although he was appointed the overseer of the entire operation, Rick was often surprised and made to marvel at the height of technology contained within the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of relief briefly washed over the President's face, ''I want a written report on my desk by tomorrow morning.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Yes Ma'am.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ms. O'Neil,\" Julia Martinez's accented voice finally speaks as the counsellor stands in the middle of the room again in all her naked glory. \" These babies are as firm as ever,\" Ms. Martinez juts out her jugs before running her own dainty fingers over them. A quick fondle then acts as a follow through. \"Let me see what I can do\", Ms. Martinez then picks up the brown pen and shoots herself with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I think I have a few names for us,\" Ms. Martinez beams a smile.

She's not above using the school newspaper for her own gain.

She smiled back, understanding wordlessly, as the two locked tongues and Trish tried to situate herself comfortably on top of the sitting guidance counselor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Ms. Martinez buttoned up her shirt again as Trish was idly admiring herself in the corner, making sure the office's blinds were shut. Jimmy put a dainty finger onto the intercom syster, cleared his throat and spoke into the intercom:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly Miller, Nadeem Al-bakar, and Mary Hoppe, please report to the Guidance Office immediately. Kelly Miller, Nadeem Al-bakar, and Mary Hoppe. Thank you.\" Signing off of the intercom in true Ms. Martinez fashion, she couldn't help notice Trish looking a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who all are you calling down?\" Trish's head fell limp in front of her bosom as Matt's head took a bit of a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some of the biggest bitches this side of Edgefield.\" Julia grinned at him, twirling the blue pen in anticipation. \"Thankfully they're hot, too. Should be a good start here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the office budged slightly, and Ms. Martinez frantically gestured at Matt. He quickly pulled up the head of his skinsuit, and soon his form was once again totally indistinguishable from that of Trish. The three girls didn't suspect a thing as they entered and sat down in the chairs prepared for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish's skin laid in the corner empty as Matt craned his head back and groaned. Nadeem stroked his erect cock with a sly grin on her face, as the Arab girl was still mostly clothed. Her sweater was tossed on the floor, revealing a vast brown cleavage that Nadeem was groping with her free hand. A small bit of her black hair was barely visible, poking out from the floral hijab she was wearing while jerking off a stranger. Matt's eyes darted between her and the sight just a few feet across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had shed her jeans and panties and was running her hands through her platinum blonde hair and torso, stopping occasionally to cup her huge breasts through her crop top. Kelly's body had been toned by her years of cheerleading, a trait that she seemed especially keen on enjoying right now. Since she was seated in one of the chairs, Matt also saw Mary's head and her messy black ponytail buried between Kelly's legs. The freshman was stripped down to her plain bra and panties; in addition to showing off her somewhat stout frame, Mary's pale white breasts seemed to be bulging out of her bra as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jimmy had mentioned earlier, before zapping the three girls he called down, that they were both some of the bitchiest and bustiest girls at Edgefield High. He didn't offer much more explanation before the girls entered. Kelly was swiftly turned into a skinsuit, whereas Nadeem and Mary were zapped by the blue clone pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy and Matt both discarded their skins of Julia Martinez and Trish for the time being. Jimmy went to put on Kelly right away, while Matt was more focused on Nadeem and Mary groping their own racks with a familiar manic smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, what exactly did these girls do?\" Matt asked, his arousal not yet overcoming his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jimmy answered, before pulling Kelly's head over his own and fully assimilating into her form. \"The whole cheer squad here is a fucking nasty clique.\" He continued, enjoying Kelly's ditzier voice. \"Sonya, Meghan, Leah... They all made people's lives a lot more difficult. But Kelly here was the worst, in my opinion.\" Kelly pauses briefly, hefting her generous bosom - certainly more than a nice handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Nadeem here is an awful gossip.\" Kelly had put on her crop top from the pile of her clothes - forgoing a bra. The cheerleader leaned over the back of Nadeem's chair, lifting up her gray sweater to reveal the Muslim girl's bountiful rack. Nadeem didn't object to this, but instead gave an exaggerated moan as Kelly manhandled her. \"She was a lot less overt,\" Kelly was now full-on kneading Nadeem's breasts through her underwear. \"...but she spread tons of nasty rumors about almost everyone she didn't like... including yours truly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Mary?\" Matt said. While the two girls next to her were busy attending to each other, Mary had already stripped down to her underwear and was taking several pictures of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, her?\" Kelly briefly looked up. \"She's got fat tits.\" Matt seemed a bit incredulous at this answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary's a good Christian girl.\" Mary snickered, which came out as more of a giggle. From what Matt could see on her phone screen, she sent the pictures she just took to some unknown number. At the same time, Jimmy's phone vibrated atop Ms. Martinez's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's two or three years below me, but I'll be damned if she didn't end up a total babe.\" Mary continued, poking and prodding at her abundance of titty flesh. \"I ended up checking her social media fairly regularly for quite a few years after graduating. Pretty sure she got married to some strapping lad, had a few kids, and got a breast reduction along the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately we landed in a time where she was still in her chubby phase...\" Mary jiggled her belly, and slapped her large thighs. \"But these are still some of the biggest tits I've ever seen.\" Mary's (or Jimmy's clone's, rather) assessment seemed correct; her breasts were bulging out of her plain white bra as she played with a little bit of the overhang on the sides. \"Mary here isn't too good at picking out the right bra sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough questions for now.\" Kelly said, exercising her authoritative tone. Nadeem's hands filled the void left by Kelly pulling away almost immediately. The cheerleader propped up her phone on a nearby table, set to record as she sat in an empty chair. \"Get over here and eat me out, you fat, stupid bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for a gal with tits the size of her head.\" Mary smoothly answered, wasting no time as she got into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's enjoy this little prime-time show.\" Matt was roused from his momentary stupor by Nadeem's soft hands guiding him to sit. Positioned facing Mary and Kelly, Nadeem licked the palm of her hand and began jerking off Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly couldn't hold back her moans anymore as she appeared to be wracked by an orgasm. Mary seemed to get the cue, and moved to lock lips with Kelly instead as their huge breasts and smooth stomachs grinded together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm gonna...\" Matt muttered, approaching climax as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make a mess.\" Nadeem chided him, using her free hand to expertly remove her hijab. She held it up to Matt's nose, who curiously took a sniff; the garment smelled like some flowery shampoo, with what must have been Nadeem's natural scent. After seeing Matt took a sniff, Nadeem paused for a moment... before wrapping her headscarf around Matt's dick and continued pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt certainly didn't last much longer after that; after only a few seconds he came buckets, soiling Nadeem's hijab as the girl watched on in glee. \"Beautiful.\" Nadeem murmured. The clone knew that she packed a spare in her backpack anyways, so there certainly wasn't any harm in putting one of them to good use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the room, you noticed that Kelly's skin lay limp on the floor as Jimmy was now fucking Mary doggy-style as on Ms. Martinez's desk. She was now totally nude, her tits smushed up against the tabletop as Jimmy plowed her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt took a second to savor the look of pleasure on Mary's face, as well as the camera still angled towards the two.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt groaned once again as he shot his load between Nadeem's breasts. Despite recently cumming from her handjob, it only took a few more minutes for the now topless girl to make him orgasm again. Nadeem certainly didn't seem to mind, as she wiped some of the cum off her bust with the same dirty hijab from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, Ms. Martinez, and Trish's skins still laid unused on the carpeted office floor. Matt noticed that Jimmy was now laying on top of Mary on the desk, groping and suckling the girl's massive breasts. Her ponytail was undone, and she had a calm yet inane smile on her face as Jimmy violated her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked at the clock. 9:15. They'd been in the office for nearly a half hour; staying much longer would probably arouse suspicion. He stood up to stretch, and Nadeem paid him no mind as she slipped a manicured hand down her jeans. She was so wrapped up in attending to Matt that she hadn't had a chance to enjoy her new body yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jimmy, we should probably move on.\" Matt circled the desk. A bit of cum was seeping out of Mary's cunt from when Jimmy finished in her doggy-style earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy sighed, letting the breast fall from his mouth. \"It's been a while, huh? Good idea.\" Matt's eyes widened slightly as he saw the various hickies and teeth marks all over Mary's body. As Jimmy got up to stop the phone recording, Matt felt that Jimmy was paying a bit more attention to this girl than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, already?\" Mary mockingly pouted, idly tweaking her nipples. Jimmy didn't dignify the clone with a response, zapping her and Nadeem with the black pen, turning them into hollow husks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan now?\" Matt asked, noticing how big these skinsuits' breasts were even while deflated. Jimmy wasted no time, putting on the Mary suit headfirst as a bit of excess cum dribbled onto the carpet. It was a surreal sight, looking like the cute and pudgy Mary with tits sloping down past her ribcage from the waist up, to Jimmy's less pale lower half with his penis still erect. Mary's waist and legs were flaccidly hanging, not touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already living it up. What else could you want?\" Jimmy asked Matt through Mary's head, picking up her glasses from the desk. \"We've got a whole high school to mess around with and the pens to let us do it.\" One of her dainty hands went down to Jimmy's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So soft...\" 'Mary' mumbled as her top half began to jerk off Jimmy's very much aroused bottom half. It didn't take long for him to cum, Mary's eyes rolling back in pleasure as Ms. Martinez's carpet was further stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, Jimmy had fully donned Mary's skinsuit - standing a few inches shorter. Matt was still undecided about which of the skins to try on. Kelly, Nadeem, (and still Trish &amp; Ms. Martinez) were strewn about the office as hollow skins, their lives and bodies quite literally wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mary' was starting to get redressed, and after sliding her panties up her thick legs, she seemed to be having a spot of trouble with her bra. There was a frustrated pout on her face as she tried and failed to stuff her massive mammaries in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, you wouldn't last a second trying to act like her.\" Matt laughed at the absurd sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I wouldn't.\" Jimmy sighed in defeat, reaching for the memory pen. \"Which is why we have this.\" With a zap, Mary's eyes went wide as Jimmy gained full access to the girl's memories. With a coy grin, she then expertly dressed herself, looking much more competent than a few seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really works wonders, huh.\" Matt said as Mary finished pulling her sweatshirt over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" Jimmy agreed, still in love with Mary's form. \"Here's the plan: we spend the day here at Edgefield and then hang out after school. I plan on getting very... familiar with Mary and her family here. I take the clone pen and you take the black one - deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't complain.\" Matt caught the skinsuit pen tossed his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading to class now - be sure to restore the girls before you leave!\" Mary gave a cute wave and left the office. To the world she would look like the same meek freshman, but little would people know the pervert wearing her skin was itching to do all sorts of depraved things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt looked down at his two new options. Kelly seemed like an obvious pick; cheerleaders were always a solid choice. Alternatively, something about piloting Nadeem's shorter body had its own unique appeal, too.</span></div></div>",

The story itself is told in third person, although a second or first person POV may be used. POV may be switched around between characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I would like continuity be adhered, I realise that imposing continuity across different branches is cumbersome and arduous. Therefore I only ask for continuity to be observed in related chapters (ie. a chapter should not violate the continuity of its preceding chapters). This will give extra flexibility and less time spent tracing the progress of different characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople might be puzzled by the dialogue in the opening chapter. However, in short, (I may expand on this as a story in the future) this Jimmy is a 'different' Jimmy. A result of a Jimmy from alternate reality transferring to this Jimmy's reality (think about alternate universes). The Jimmy from the other reality (Jimmy Earth One), is an old scientist who possesses both black and brown pens (this take place years after ''A New Beginning'' after the death of Eric and David of the Earth One reality) and created the blue pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason (which will later be thought of and expanded), Jimmy E-1 decided to visit an alternate reality (E-2) with his three pens in tow. Now, technology is very advanced in E-1 which allows Jimmy of E-1 to travel to Jimmy E-2's reality. However, there can be no two Jimmy's, so Jimmy E-1's consciousness takes over Jimmy E-2's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis means that the Jimmy of E-1 really is inhabiting Jimmy E-2's much younger body. This gives him full knowledge of black, brown and blue pens. He also have all three pens in his possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue pen further information:<br>\r\nPeople who are zapped by the blue pen convulses briefly as Jimmy's consciousness enters their mind. <br>\r\nThe way the blue pen work is that the zapped victims believes that they are in fact a part of Jimmy's consciousness. It's akin to wearing a Jimmy-tinted glasses. So Tina who is zapped by the blue pen is influenced by Jimmy's consciousness. <br>\r\nThe 'clones' retain full memories and mannerisms of the victims, but not thoughts as thoughts are fleeting. They can act 'in character' should it be required. <br>\r\nThe best way to imagine this is the victims of Joker blood transplant in Arkham Knight. All of them becomes Joker-like, but still within the boundaries of their 'character' so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore will be added later. Feel free to message me if you have any questions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>\"Mom?\"</b> <b>You call out, your voice trembling.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air is crisp and chilly tonight, everything's blanketed in darkness. Your eyes are useless to you, your fingers gently prodding and feeling around. Somehow, the power's gone out, even the street lights have been extinguished. <br>\r\nA few minutes ago, you heard what sounded like your mother screaming loudly, and a loud smash of glass. As you slowly advance up the corridor towards your parents' bedroom, the suspense builds as your nerves pound down on your body, shaking you like a leaf in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door, you draw your hand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom?\" You say, forcing you lips to open and barely managing almost a whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly drops from the frame, smacking down onto the floor in a loud snap. You jump, and your eyes stay widened as the curtain blows aside, allowing a moonbeam to cascade through the window.<br>\r\nIt looks at you, it's eyes red and pulsating, a long tongue seems to whip and snap from the thing it holds, retracting back into it's maw with a slick noise. Raising the thing in it's sickly thin hands, you make out long hair cascading down it's middle, the rest of it a pale, almost skin colour. The creature stretches it and begin to clamber inside, as it raises it and moves around, you make out a vague human shape. Legs begin to reform, like socks being filled with feet. A sick cracking enables free movement of the creature's newly acquired legs, toes wavering in the air slowly. The object it's donning appears to be a skin of sorts, a fact which becomes clear to you as it stuffs it's arm inside, it's long, thin limbs filling the pale skin's, causing a macabre transformation. The creature erects it's spine and shrugs the torso on, pulling the lip of the stretched hole up and over it's shoulders. Breasts swell on it's chest, it's entire body rippling and morphing as if acclimating to it's new skin. It slowly pulls the head of the skin forward, stretching the hole. Ducking it's own inside, you watch as the creature moans, stretching and pushing it's face using it's new fingers. An alien, low whine slowly transitions into a high, feminine tone, you recognize it's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom?!\" You stutter, taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opens it's eyes and stare as you, suddenly, it snaps it's head side to side, a sickening crack similar to the one prior sounds. You hear it gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David.. what are you doing awake baby?\" <b>Mom</b> says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back, tears begin to bubble up in your eyes. That's when you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"NICK! TINA! HELP ME!\" You scream as hard as you can.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to run, you immediately bump into someone. Staggering backwards, you look up and see the moonlit face of your big sister, she's completely naked just like Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Davie, why are you screaming?\" <b>She</b> says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling onto your butt, you look behind your shoulder at your mother, or the thing wearing her. It stares down at you, silent. You look around frantically, noticing a sparkling area of broken glass on the floor next to Mom's bedside table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, come, let's go back to sleep.\" <b>Tina</b> says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at her, she's standing over you, hand outstretched. You shake your head and cover your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-\" You begin to scream again, before you feel something prick the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken screaming, limbs flying as Mom grabs your shoulders and holds you to her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, calm down! It was just a dream, baby!\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop, then look up at her face, it looks normal. She releases you and smiles, a bit amused herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had another bad dream?\" She asks, \"You've been sick for a while now, I think that's why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really scary,\" You sputter, \"You and Tina were.. zombies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looks at you with a raised brow, before a smile spreads across her lips and she laughs loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, zombies again?\" She says, before you see her expression turn to a devious grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs you and begins tickling your tummy, you double over in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna' eat your brains! Yaaargh!\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you laugh joyfully, before she stands. Walking to the dressing table, she picks up the ointment she was applying to your neck. You feel a cool sensation as the breeze blows over you, standing your hairs on end. Screwing the small container shut, she wipes her fingers in a towel and opens the bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Davie,\" she says, smiling, \"Call me if you have another bad dream. I'll chase those zombies for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle and nod, she winks and shuts the light off. The door closes with a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from the door, Mom's smile fades. She walks to her room and flips open her cellphone, dialing in a number quickly. The phone instantly picks up, and she whispers something into it. Clicking it off, she sets it down and walks to the window. <br>\r\nGazing out into the neighbourhood, the dormant houses begin to spot the landscape quickly, bright yellow dots sparking to life. The light illuminates the dark night. <br>\r\nHigh above, an object of sorts hurtles through the atmosphere, before instantly halting right above the city, as if defying the laws of physics. It begins to brighten up, it's light similar to that of the houses below. Letting loose a shower of pods onto the city, it's centre bursts open, allowing a long root to drop. The root's end piercing the skyscraper directly below, ripping the building's left side clean off, sending glass splintering through the air, solid steel beams crushed to dust. Bursting through the earth's surface, it burrows deep. Before it begins to pulsate, it's pulses travelling upwards through the long appendage and into the main body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound inaudible to the human ear rings through the air, Mom begins to cringe, before staggering to her knees. Groaning, her neck begins to bulge, before the flesh splits apart, her face warping itself before deflating, flopping forward as the creature bares it's own. It's mouth opens, and a long tendril emerges, slowly wagging and coiling in the air. Small fibers unfold from it's surface and begin to twitch. Quickly, the creature snaps it's tongue back into it's mouth and pulls Mom's head back over it's own. A little tugging and coaxing brings Mom's face back to life. Walking out of the bedroom, Tina, Nick and Dad soon follow behind her, emerging from their respective rooms and Dad's study. Unlocking the front door, they walk out, leaving it wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire neighbourhood's population streams out of their homes, swarming towards the massive tendril. All except David, fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You press the button and watch as the video screen flashes to life. You're almost alone in the chapel, the only other person your grandfather's lawyer. You have never met Ms Jordan before, and were surprised someone so young and stunningly beautiful had handled the case. Still, you never met any of the other people that had attended the funeral, either. Your grandfather had abandoned your family long ago to live out in a luxury condo in the sun when he suddenly became extraordinarily wealthy, and you are the only person he kept in contact with. When you heard he'd died, you immediately flew out. You're on spring break from university anyway, a young 21-year-old looking to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grandfather was an interesting man,\" Ms Jordan comments. You turn to her and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was, yeah. A good man, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know about that.\" She grins mischievously. \"He did know you cared about him, though, even before he made his fortune. Which is why he's left you this. His most prized possession.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds out a box to you. It's faded, marked only \"costume set\". You raise an eyebrow. So far you've sat as people you don't know or recognize have been given more money than they clearly need. Your grandfather seemed to mingle with the rich folks who keep mansions along the coast, and you've watched as businessmen with buxom blonde trophy wives and spoiled heiresses have been given small fortunes. Nobody seems to know where your grandfather got the money, and nobody seems to care. As soon as they got their share, the wealthy elite just gave a smug, satisfied grin and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask, taking the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect his recording will explain that,\" Ms Jordan replies. \"It's the last item I have to give. Oh, and before I go, your grandfather's will also made a small provision for you to stay at the Plaza Hotel, down the road, for a week. He thought you might want to enjoy spring break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up. \"What? How did he know he was going to die during spring...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Jordan smiles. \"Your grandfather was full of surprises. Don't be distracted by what he gave the others. He left the best for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have done with some money, sure. People probably didn't end up in so much debt after university in his day,\" you shrug. \"But I'd rather have my grandfather around than a handout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyer nods, and rises. \"I'm sure he'd appreciate that. But he's now moved on to his next life, forever. I need to leave. I have a flight leaving for the city in a few hours, and your grandfather was specific that you were to watch the video alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until she leaves, and listen as her car pulls away. Then you start the DVD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the only one in the family who ever showed the slightest bit of interest in me.\" Your grandfather appears on the screen, far more pale and ill than you remember him. \"So I'm giving you the key to whatever you want. Whatever life you want - literally. I've had fun with the toy I've left you: how it came into my possession doesn't matter. It's easy to use. You point it at whoever you choose, fire and... well, you'll see, my boy! You'll see! You've got the suite at the Plaza for a few days. That's enough to test out what it does. The world is at your feet, my boy. Enjoy it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grandfather winks and the screen goes blank. You shake your head, and wonder what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way, sir.\" You follow the attendant as she sashays in her tight suit trousers and step into the luxury suite - a huge, fluffy bed dominating the room in silvers and creams. In front of you glass doors open to a balcony, and a gorgeous, deep blue sea. You can't wait to settle in, check out the bars in town and enjoy the beach. It'll take your mind off your grandfather's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which... you reach into your pocket and pull out the wooden box, opening it slightly. A black pen, glistening in the daylight, greets you. You shrug, trying to decide why your grandfather values it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bathroom is through here,\" the attendant says, \"and if you need anything you just call reception and ask for Carrie, all right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her. She's dressed in the hotel's gold blazer, her black hair tied up in a neat ponytail. She's a Chinese-American woman in her mid-thirties, small and slender, with large eyes and too much blush on her cheeks. Her name tag reads 'Carrie - Junior Manager'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" you say. She moves toward the door, then pauses, half-waiting for a tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, and wonder. Either you could give her a tip and work out what the pen does on your own, or... well, your grandfather said point and fire, right?</span></div></div>",

When she turns her back to leave, you take the opportunity to get the pen out and fire it. The majority of you didn't think anything would happen, but you still didn't want to be caught trying to use it in case she would get the wrong idea about what it was. Immediately after firing it, the attendant collapses. You quickly move to catch her, but, instead of catching a falling woman, you catch a plastic suit with her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit!</i> you think. <i>This set is for real!</i> You quickly bring everything inside your room and close the door. You remove the clothes from the suit and find a zipper slightly open on the back of the suit. <i>This must be how you use it...</i> You briefly wonder if you should stop what you're doing, but you feel quite an urge to put the suit on. After stripping from your clothes, you move to put on the suit, starting with your legs. As they get inside, you feel a tingling sensation around your legs and instinctively move to touch them. Instead of feeling your muscular, hairy legs or the plastic suit, you feel smooth, womanly legs instead. <i>This feels so real...</i> Intrigued, you begin to get more of your body into the suit and begin pulling up the zipper. The tingling sensation travels with the zipper, but it gets especially strong around your crotch area. You can feel your boner being pulled inside your body, and, when you instinctively examine the area, you find only a pussy that's getting slightly moist. Instead of scaring you with the loss of your manhood, you feel excited to have female genitalia, but you really are becoming excited by just what this means. Your grandfather has literally left you the ability to become anyone you want to be at will. With such power, you can't help but wonder if your grandfather is actually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug off the thought. The pen probably didn't have the power to keep death at bay by hopping into a new body. At any rate, you really want to complete the change. As the zipper moves towards your head, you feel your chest expanding as the plastic breasts of the suit transform into Carrie's breasts. You give them a squeeze and are amazed to feel how very much they're yours now. You finish off the transformation by pulling the plastic face over your own as the tingling sensation erupts all over your body from head to toe. You feel the back for the zipper, but you catch long hair instead. You gasp at the disappearance of the zipper, but you quickly calm down, thinking that it's part of the disguise in order to ensure only you can reveal yourself. You race to the bathroom to confirm the changes, and you're met by the sight of Carrie's naked body. Her breasts look much larger than what her uniform gave away, and her hair really looks better without being tied up in a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" you exclaim. You immediately make another realization. \"Holy shit! My voice!\" The skin suit the pen made out of Carrie had the power to change you so completely, that not even your voice would give you away. You stand there for a while and admire the body in the mirror, moving your hands to Carrie's cute face, watching the brown eyes, the cute little nose, and the long black hair hanging loose. You move your hands down, cups her perky breasts and watches them rise and fall in amazement before moving down to her slender waist. \"This is unbelievable!\"</span></div></div>",

This one is brown, and you wonder what your grandfather must have planned with it. For all you know, maybe you're about to sprout wings and fly with it. Taking the pen in your manicured hands, you turn it and point it at yourself, and fire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're Caroline Ma, 32-years-old, you're a junior manager here. You've been working for five hours now, and you've got a break coming up shortly, once you help out the latest guest. You're dating a guy who works in town called... you remember your last birthday... you remember waking up this morning and having to rush to get ready for work... you've got a spin class tonight... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger back, amazed. You're still you - there's no question about it - but you have all of Caroline's thoughts and memories. You simply reach for information, and it comes to you. You know the hotel layout. You know the emergency code for the guest rooms. You could use the system downstairs to duplicate a key to anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" you say, Carrie's voice framing the words with unfamiliarity - she doesn't like to swear if she can help it. You feel her breasts, still unused to the weight, and flick the long, silky black hair over your shoulders. Then you grin. Fiendishly, Carrie's lipstick-stained mouth twisting to an extreme angle as you decide what you are going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to gather your thoughts, you decide that you're going to make the most of this. First, though, Carrie needs to get back on duty. It takes no effort at all, sat on the edge of your bed, to slip her uniform back on, tightening her belt, straightening the shirt, and slipping on her cheap nylon blazer. You tie back her - your - hair, clipping it in to place, before straightening her name badge. With a last flick of your manicured fingertips, you perfect her look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Caroline Ma. There has never been another. And, with the exception of the pens and $10 tip tucked in your blazer pocket, you're no different to how you entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobby is hardly full as you walk behind the desk. Your colleagues barely give you a second glance, before you head to your console and bring up the information you want. As Carrie, you have access to the whole complex. You could try and be anyone you want - which is probably what your grandfather had in mind when he booked you in. A tear nurses the bottom of your oriental eyes as you think about him. He's given you a superpower. Though how he came by it you don't know. Nor do you want to think about what people would do to obtain it. Spy organizations would kill for such a tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and take a look at the information the computer has brought up. You don't really want to stay as Carrie, even though she gives you unparalleled access. After all, what's the fun in working for a hotel? You're assuming, of course, that this isn't permanent, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh man, you suddenly pause. What if this is permanent? Now you really want to be out of Carrie's life as fast as possible. You want to make sure you can get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around. It's Spring Break, so there's lots of events going on: mostly on the beach and in nearby clubs tonight. You could definitely lose yourself there: find a guy who stands a better chance with girls, or maybe even be a college chick yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not all the hotel has to offer. There's the spa, for example: you could easily find someone to be who needs to relax, and use their top package to get the full benefits of the hotel. Carrie's mind also tells you there's some kind of convention going on in the hotel - something for the more nerdy college kids. Maybe that would be worth checking out too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrie, could you do a key for 801?\" The voice to your side comes from one of your colleagues. That's the honeymoon suite. You look up and see the couple waiting. The guy is looking around impatiently, and the woman next to him is stunning: blonde hair around her neck, with a classic Hollywood style to her face - like a young Grace Kelly. Short, but with an incredible figure that Carrie herself would kill for. You smile and nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you chirp, tapping up the key. You wonder if it might be fun to play honeymoon for the rest of the day as you pass over the key. You can see that the woman - the new Mrs April Landers - has booked some time in the spa today; obviously she wants to freshen up a little. Alternatively, maybe you could find someone else whose life might be interesting to try. Carrie knows the hotel holds various performances for the guests, and some of the dancers could be supermodels with their looks. Right now, you have an all-access pass...</span></div></div>",

You are a female minority after all so you're rather quite liberal and a bit of a feminist, (even though you're dating a white guy after all.) So the fact that you would willingly use the pens on your fellow woman goes against all your feminist beliefs.

They waited, listening to the scratching of metal at the Latino man tried to jimmy the door to the basement open. None of them said a word, their minds too cold and tired to form coherent thought, as the sun rose on a another beautiful crisp early December day. <br>\r\nA small history lesson: The world in which the convicts lived in at a glance looked very similar to ours but their world had taken a much darker path than our own. In the early sixties the hippie movement started to rise, just like in our world, but the older generation saw the hippie as degenerates and perverts attempting to subvert the order of things. Out of fear and hate, the government increased all sentences for any kind of law broken to be a minimum of twenty years imprisonment. Of course there were riots, almost a revolution, but the older ways didn\u2019t mind playing dirty to win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe justice system quickly became a huge financial burden to the state but the public kept on finding more people to throw in jail. People with mental health problem, minorities, cripples, perverts, free thinkers, gays and lesbian, all found themselves in prison with rapists and murders. At the turn of the 21st century America was near collapse, even with forced labour, the country had run out of money, the soviets were going to win, and then someone came up with a solution, a \u201cFinal solution\u201d. A solution that would solve the problem of so many old people trapped in the system, refusing to do their patriotic duty and die once they could not work any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe convicts currently trying to break in to the house had been on a prison bus, with more people, heading to a solution facility when the bus unexpectedly crashed on the snow free road. As the last of the suns light disappeared, the thirty odd prisoners quickly fled in all directions into the snow covered woods. The small group of prisoners had accidentally found each other in the dark and blindly walked for miles all night till finding salivation, in the form of a house verging on a palace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Ray Willis looked to be most out of place among the criminals. A man in his sixties, with a bookish look about him, his face normally appeared calm but the over prisoners quickly learn that there was a sea of anger beneath the surface of his cool exterior. Nobody knew that got the Doc thrown in the slammer, but nobody dared ask. The next person to stand out was Rosemary Tate, a woman of indeterminate age, between sixty and thousand would be a good guess. She was a tough old bird, women had to be to survive in the mix gendered jails and Rosemary certainly was tough, a kind little lady to people she liked but a sawn of hell to the people who crossed her. She\u2019d ended up in jail because she\u2019d killed her husband, in prison something quickly broke inside of her and she\u2019d quickly moved from a shy woman to the queen of the women\u2019s area in a matter of two years. She\u2019d maintained a harem of the pettiest women, all servicing her desires, women who refused her will stayed alive, but they certainly weren\u2019t petty no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest person of the group was Vin. There wasn\u2019t much to say about Vin, he was a very large black man with a simple mind, he didn\u2019t say anything and he did what was told. He had been accused of raping someone, but it never went to trial instead he was put in jail straight away, it was high unlikely simple Vin could do such a thing he was just a another victim of the evil system. Vin was looked after by Max Price, another black man of small stature, Vin and Max look out for one another, Vin had the muscle and Max the brains, not that Max was smart if anything he could probably be outwitted by an ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latino man trying to silently open the door was Gustavo \u201cGus\u201d Cruz. Gus was your average wheeler dealer, good at breaking into places, but since he was in prison it was obvious not so great at getting out of them. The last man stood apart from the others, from the tattoos on body it was clear he was a white supremacist who would normally be welcome in current society but he like the rest of them ended up on the bus heading off to die. He said his name Jack and that been all he ever said while in prison, even when beaten by the inmates and the jailers.<br>\r\nThere was a soft click and the door opened, the inmates rushed in to the warmth of the basement and found what appeared to be a lab. They silently moved around the lab checking there was no one about, their teeth chattering all the time, they gathered at the warmest spot of the lab and tried to rub their limbs back to life hoping they had not got frostbite. They soon fell asleep out of sheer exhaustion, but they were soon woken by the Doc he\u2019d found a wonderful invention that was certain to change all their lives. Something the man of the house had been working on before going away on business, something that he had stupidly left instructions for, a crash and a simple black pen had improved the lives of six people a lot. As the sun rose over the tree tops it was most certainly going to be an interesting Christmas everyone in the house.                                                            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Max awoke slowly, his mind felt fuzzy, looked around the room and panicked, he didn't know where he was. Then he remembered the bus crash and walk in the snow, he relaxed a bit but then notices the others staring at him \"What?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel? What do you remember?\" the Doc asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, my head hurts a little\" Max rubbed his head and at that point realised he was naked. \"WHAT THE HELL HAPPEN?\" The other tried to quieten Max down \"VIN why didn't you stop them from raping ME?\" The group just about managed to quieten Max down enough to explain about the black pen the Doc had found, through the tried and tested method of everyone sitting on the noise person till they calmed down. Max's muffed voice came from between Rosemary's legs \"Ok, that sounds cool and all, but why the HELL am I naked?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I needed to test it on someone so, I did eeny meeny miny moe and got you\" the Doc explained coldly \"I then zapped you and put on your skin\". There was a fair amount of struggling and swearing from underneath the group of about a minute. \"Are you calm?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" came the reluctant reply. Everyone stood slowly, ready to jump of Max if he started shouting again. \"Why didn't you stop them?\" Vin just stared at Max. Max hit Vin as hard as he could on the arm but it seem to do more damage to Max than Vin \"idiot\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, with Max dressed, the group gathered on the steps heading up in the rest of the house. \"According to his schedule Dr Smith, is away for another few days, that should gives as time to adjust and learn about our skins, since we don't get the memories of the people we wear\" Doc whispered to the others. Placing a hand on Gus's shoulder Doc continued \"our cat thief is going to go in to the house find a skin for himself and then collect enough skins for the rest of us. Once we'll skinned up we can move from there.\" The rest of the group nodded their agreement with the plan, except Vin who just stared in to space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus's heart beat a mile a minute as he hide behind the massive Christmas tree, he had heard it was bad luck to bring a tree in to the house so early in December, but for Gus it had been a god send. When Gus had entered the room he had been stunned by the amount of presents the family had, the only presents he got from his parents was a good beating. The tree was beautifully decorated, it had bought a tear to the twenty-five year olds eyes. As he approached he felt like a child, he forgot he his worries, that was until he heard the chatter of two maids coming towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus had dived behind the tree and had been stood there half an hour as the maids moved around the room cleaning. Gus's sweaty hands held on to the pen like his life depended upon it because it kind of did. From what he over heard the family was very high up in polite society and also very racist, Gus didn't feel as bad about planning to taking their skins after hearing the rumors of what cruel things they did to the black servants of over households. The family was also very elitist, no ethic had ever stepped into their home, Gus could feel himself getting angry not only at the owners of the house but also the maids who laughed as they told the stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Gus's POV)<br>\r\nIt had taken a while for the maids to leave the room and allow to get moving again. You weren't a murderer, just burglar, and never really wanted to ever hurt anyone but you could feel a fire had started burning inside of you. It had been a shame the two maids left together at the end you really wanted to zap them but you weren't sure if there was a recharge period, so you let them go, for now at least. Unfortunately every person you came across was either with someone or to far away to skin and retrieve safely. After hiding and moving short bursts you came upon what looked to be the master bedroom, you carefully pushed the door open and saw.....                              </span></div></div>",

Its past midday but she\u2019s only dressed in her underwear and stockings, as you slip into the room her hand lazily reaches for a cocktail glass on the top of the dresser. She downs the drinking in one go and fill the glass again with more alcohol from a shaker. She breathes in deeply and out, doing breathing exercises, you stand there not sure what to do, you\u2019re just a simple crook could you really take this life, however it was just temporary, till the cops stopped looking for you. You were faced with something you had never had to deal with before, a moral dilemma, it was at that point you saw that the lady of the house had turned around and seen you. She breathed in to scream and then breathed out, and kept breathing out until she was a pile of skin on the chair. You looked down at your hands like they were covered in blood, you had shot her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you panicked, everything felt blurry and less real, you felt yourself move and pick up the skin. You wanted to be sick, but you managed to hold it in, you kept telling yourself you weren\u2019t a murderer and it was only going to be for a short time. You slowly slid your hairy legs in to the woman\u2019s deflated legs, the skin tightened around you and you felt cold air on your legs. You nearly past out as you pull the woman up to your waist and felt your manhood be tightened out of existence. Your sweaty hands let go of the bunched up skin and pushed into the empty limbs of the woman. The skin tightens again, almost like it wants to be worn, you feel a heavy weight on your chest as the breasts filled up, your body felt completely different to the one you had a moment ago. You take a deep breath and pull the face on to your head, you feel the tightness one last and then it\u2019s gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alcohol hits you like a freight train, the woman\u2019s body had been use to this level of intoxication but you had been in jail for the past five year and your brain was not ready to process that much alcohol so quickly. You sat down quickly, your mind spinning; you sat there hoping you weren\u2019t sick now because of the alcohol. You shifted your new plump bum uncomfortably, it felt like you were sitting on something, you looked past your breasts and saw a bit plastic on the chair. Your drunken hand eventually managed to find the plastic and pulled against it, your body responded in a strange way, it felt nice. You pulled again, wow, that felt great, you pulled really hard and it came out of your body, you held up the wet plastic up to your face, it took a few seconds for you to realise it\u2019s a dildo. You had never seen one before, you had heard about them being available on the dark market, you had always thought of it as a bit of a joke but now you\u2019d felt one you weren\u2019t so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand slowly moved on its own taking the dildo with it, you knew what you were going to do but you could not even admit it to yourself. The dildo gently penetrated you knew orifice, stretching you out, your other hand stroked your bra and then you stockings before taking the dive and touching your clit. Your hands quickly found out what felt good and what didn\u2019t as your alcohol fuelled mind spun in slow circles. You heard yourself make cute gasping noises as you watch yourself in the mirror, as your body built toward at orgasm, you barely notice your guilty for taking this woman\u2019s body melt away. From the wet noises coming from your new cunt you knew you were going to squirt all over the antique chair but you didn\u2019t care. You watch your gorgeous orgasm face in the mirror as you ruin a chair that could pay to feed the whole of your old family for years.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou sit in the wet patch of the chair for a few minutes and enjoy the afterglow of the climax; you didn\u2019t know why you had been so worried in the first place this was what you told your wife you wanted you all along, wealth, health and a great body. You sigh, you wish you could spend more time playing with this body but you had a job to do. You pick up a picture frame on the dresser and look at your current family, all smiling white faces, you smile but your smile is very different to theirs.</span></div></div>",

The man is significantly older than everyone else in the photo, you're guessing he's \"your\" father, or maybe just a sugar daddy. Putting the photo back in it's original position, you stand up and feel your own liquids trickle down your thighs. Giggling, you find a box of tissues nearby and clean yourself up. On the floor lie your clothes, a short skirt and a thick sweater.<br>\r\nBending over, a cool draft blows through your legs and tickles you.  <br>\r\nWoah, what the hell? That's.. weird..<br>\r\nYou're not exactly used to being a woman, considering this is your first time. Not having junk is truly a new experience. Slipping the skirt up your legs, you adjust it to the best of your ability, trying to imagine yourself as a model from those commercials you used to see on TV years ago, before your cell days. You've already got a bra on, thank god. You deem yourself a master of taking them off, not putting them back on. Throwing your sweater on, you pull it down your body, your bust sticking out like two small balloons on your chest. Looking down at them, you giggle childishly as you poke and prod for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting your study, you revise your objectives.<br>\r\nAlright, I've gotta' find those girls, dunno' if the guy's even around. Seems to me like I'm currently the eldest woman, if so, why wasn't I with the guy? <br>\r\nYou try your best to walk as pristine and.. \"white\" as you can, you know these white folks are always trying to be classy and uptight.<br>\r\nPassing through the hall, you see the christmas tree by your point of entry, the maids aren't there anymore. However, you hear talking coming from the kitchen.<br>\r\nMoving to the kitchen doorframe, you eves-drop for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta' get the kitchen ready for tomorrow's party ladies, chop chop!\" A prudent yet clearly black lady commands.<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Three other voices reply, must be some more maids.<br>\r\nYou simply walk on by, you're looking for the family, not the maids. We can't skin these poor hardworking ladies.<br>\r\nYou see a large staircase nearby and you assume living quarters would be upstairs, so you climb and hear a television coming from a nearby area.<br>\r\nUpon arrival, you see a teenaged white girl laying across the sofa in what you assume to be her pajamas. Her head flicks up to you as you come close.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Aurelie. What do you want?\" Jesus christ, she's snobby as all hell. I'll enjoy skinning this little bitch. Aurelie.. that's my name?<br>\r\n\"I just need you for a second.\" You say, and she groans.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, why? Can't you see I'm trying to watch something.\" Her face is prudent and annoyed. You're sick of her already.<br>\r\n\"Fine, you little witch, stay there.\" You storm off, looking for the other sister. You hear her whispering as you leave.<br>\r\n\"Witch..? Ha, you'd have to be referring to one of those negroes downstairs.\" You stop walking.<br>\r\nYou promptly turn around, she's the gonna' be the second white bitch to go.<br>\r\nWalking briskly up to her, she doesn't turn her head as you raise the pen and fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was referring to you, witch.\"<br>\r\nYou scoop her up and ball up her skin as much as you can, deciding to stash her underneath the sofa's cushions until you can retrieve her later.<br>\r\nAfter you lay her out flat on the sofa frame, the cushions hide her nicely and you dust your hands. Fitting, for a cunt like her.<br>\r\n\"Right, next.\" You say as you fix yourself, walking down the hall to a bedroom that you hear noise coming from.<br>\r\nThe door is shut, you try the knob quietly. It's unlocked, but as you listen in, you hear faint moaning.<br>\r\nJesus Christ.. what is she doing..?<br>\r\nYou open the door a crack and peer in to see a girl viciously fingering herself with one hand, the other on one of her large tits.<br>\r\nMust run in the family. You laugh to yourself as you simply open the door wide and zap her. After a brief look of surprise, she deflates into a skin. <br>\r\nYou shut the door behind you and lock it, then making your way to the bedside, there are stains all over the area her crotch was in the sheets.<br>\r\nGod damn.. what is with this family..? I hope that racist bitch doesn't do the same. What a horrible sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got two skins so far, but you need two more. There's one last sister you need to find..<br>\r\nYou hide the skin under the bedsheets and exit the bedroom, walking down the hall to the next room.<br>\r\n Doing the same routine, you see a younger girl, probably 13-15 years old sitting on the side of her bed on a laptop, typing away.<br>\r\n You open the door and step in, closing it behind you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi sis! What do you need?\" Phew, this one's not a cunt. Still, this makes it worse. I don't wanna' skin a kid.<br>\r\n\"I need your help with something sweetie, come with me.\" You muster up.<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, hold on.\" She types something on her laptop and puts it down, standing up, you examine her briefly.<br>\r\nWow, she must be older than I thought, probably 15-17. She's got decently sized breasts for a kid and wide hips, cute face with rosy cheeks.<br>\r\nWaving your hand for her to follow, you open the door and step outside, holding the pen up for her as she comes out.<br>\r\nAs soon as she steps out of the door, you zap her and push her back in, rushing in behind her and shutting the door.<br>\r\nThat was a little lazily planned, but you got it done regardless. Now all I need is one more skin.<br>\r\nThe man of the house isn't here, so I'll have to zap one of the maids. You make your way down the stairs to the kitchen where they previously were.<br>\r\nLooking inside, there's only one person there, a black girl washing the dishes.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, love.\" She looks behind over her shoulder at you, then briskly turns around to face.<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am? I'm just finishing up here.\" She says with a smile and false enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\"No need, come with me to my study.\" You command quickly.<br>\r\n\"Uhm, alright.\" She puts down the dish and cleans her hands, then follows you to the study.<br>\r\nEntering the study, you shut the doors behind and lean against your desk.<br>\r\n\"Alright, what I'm about to tell you is very weird, and please do not make any noise.\" You say.<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. okay?\" She seems nervous.<br>\r\n\"I'm not who I say I am, I'm actually an ex-convict from prison and I used this pen,\" you raise it to show her,\" to turn this woman into a skin and wear her, basically, I'm wearing your damn boss.\"<br>\r\nThe girl frowns in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Uh.. what? You're wearing Ms. Lavois?\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much. Anyway, I'm sorry, but I have to turn you into a skin too for my friends to wear, we're staying in this house for a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Ms. Lavois, I knew you were acting weird with how you're talking and all, but this is just too funny. Is thi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ZAP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't have time for chit-chat sweetheart, let's go. You scoop up her stuff and hurry to your entry-point, making sure that nobody's around.<br>\r\nGetting through, you are greeted by the sight of your comrades huddled together in the cold, waiting.<br>\r\n\"Gus? Holy shit! Who are you!?\" Vin says.<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, cabron. It's me, Gus. I'm in this bitch's body.\"<br>\r\nYou hold the girl's skin up in your hands and Rosemary takes it quickly.<br>\r\n\"I'm coming in next, looks like you've got a female here and I'm the only real female in this little clusterfuck of ours, seems fair innit?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I guess so, hurry up.\" You say.<br>\r\nEverybody turns away as she strips down, she's old, man. Nobody don't wanna' see that shit.<br>\r\n\"How do you put this thing on? Oh wait, I found the opening.\"<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she's successfully donned the girl's skin, you hear a sigh of relief in the girl's voice.<br>\r\n\"This feels amazing! It's so good to be young again.\" She gropes her now firm breasts and feels her thighs, but quickly gets dressed.<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, hurry up, we gotta' get the other skins.\"<br>\r\nShe finishes dressing in her maid uniform and stretches her limbs, smiling all the while like an idiot.<br>\r\nYou two enter the building and find the skins, the maids have gone off to their quarters as they'd finished cleaning.<br>\r\nBringing them back out, everyone's eager to pull them on and get inside, it's cold as shit out here.<br>\r\nThe Doctor put on the eldest sister, Max, the racist middle aged one, and Vin the youngest.<br>\r\nHe didn't seem to be reluctant to wear the kid's skin, and it's kind of ironic as such a big guy is being turned into a small girl.<br>\r\nAfter a brief party of titty-playing, everybody dresses and heads inside.<br>\r\n\"Everybody shut the fuck up, we gotta' get upstairs so the maids don't notice.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou successfully invade the household, making it upstairs, the Dr instructs everybody to go to \"her\" room.<br>\r\n\"Alright, so we're in, we've got skins and nobody suspects a thing. Gus, hand me the pen.\"<br>\r\nYou nod and give it to him. <br>\r\n\"By the way, my name is Aurelie Lavois or something. I'm guessing all of our last names are Lavois except for you.\" you say, looking at Rosemary.<br>\r\n\"Alright, what's our next move ladies?\" the doctor says in his high pitched voice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your heels click on the steps as you walk down in to the cool basement. You had planned to skin the kids, four girls and one boy but had quickly found out that they were currently at school for another few hours so, instead you rewarded the helpful maid by skinning her. You carried the skin and the woman's clothes in to the darkness and looked directly at the slightly too dark section of space \"you guys aren't very good at hiding\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time, where have you been?\" Doc and Rosemary came storming out of the darkness, both asking questions but you decided to answer Rosemary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kids are still at school but I need help if I'm going to skin four more people\". Rosemary grabbed the skin out of your hands and started opening it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean five skins. We need to skin the whole family and wear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc's face darkened \"how do you know how many family members there are?\" he said in a tone of voice suggesting he was not to be messed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I maybe a convict but I'm am still elite class, you always need to know these things, especially when it's to do with the Smith clan\". Doc didn't look convinced in the slightest, but he didn't question further. With the maids skin opened up Rosemary stripped out of her prison uniform, no one much cared about her naked old body by on show, in jail they all use to have to strip down in a locker room before entering the unisex showers. It was strange watching the old woman becoming the sexy maid, it been odd enough seeing Doc put on Max but this was different, Rosemary did it a sensual. She sat her old naked crack on a seat and slowly pushed her left leg in the soft inside of the maid, she gasp in surprise. You watch the wrinkles shift as her leg plunges down towards the maids illegal painted toenails, the foot fills out and tightens. Rosemary gently places her other foot inside and starts quietly moaning, like it's a forbidden pleasure that she's trying to deny herself. She raises both her feet and quickly pulls the skin tight over her thighs, she gasp like a teenager, she slows down now, her hand feeling the smoothness of her legs like she was appreciating a fine stocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't explain it but watching Rosemary's old arthritic hands move along the curves of the maid's skin was the hottest things you had every seen. She rolled back on the sit and slipped the skin on to her ass, as she rolled forward the skin tightened again. As her feet hit the ground the maid's pussy became Rosemary's, another moan, louder this time, she spread her legs and checked out her new cunt, pretending like she didn't have an audience, you had to give it to her she was amazing at acting like a slut. Every man in the room had a hard on, sex had been available in prison but the jail whores had, to make the understatement of the century, well used, so for you and the men to see a clean tight cunt being played with was almost to much. Rosemary only played with it a bit but her regulation shaven cunt clearly wanted much more than fingers, Vin grunted, you turned to see a new wet patch appear on his crotch and join up with the permanent drool patch, Rosemary smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid her hands in to the maids and marvelled at the easy movement in them, in one fluid move she pulled the maids tits onto her own. She toyed with her breasts like there weren't five people, you being one of them, pleasuring them to her play. After having an orgasm in a woman's body you could tell Rosemary was close, she picked up the maid's head and tugged it over her own. It only took a few seconds for her to adjust the maid's face over her own before the maid and Rosemary became one, at that point she came hard, like the whole process of process of putting on a skin was orgasmic. The other men came too, firing out their jizz all over the lab in thick wads, you hadn't managed to get yourself off but the show was over and what ever spell Rosemary had create was broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosemary lead the way in to the master bedroom, for some reason she knew where in was. As you came in she locked the door behind you, her face turn from a serene servant to anger. She grabbed your neck and threw you on to the bed, she leaped on to you and squeezed your throat. \"You listen to me Gus, I have plans. If you fall in line you can come along for the ride but if you don't\" she squeezed more \"if you get in my way I won't hesitate to kill you\". You did you best to nod to indicate you understood \"good girl\" she said and licked you red face. Rosemary's other hand moved down to your pussy \"you didn't have time to cum too my little dressing up, let me fix that for you\". It was a strange experience, you couldn't fight because Rosemary's knees pined your arms, all you could was try to pull as much oxygen as you could into your lungs as Rosemary felt up your surprisingly wet cunt. Then she let go, you breathed in that sweet, sweet, air, before you could even register that breath your body came, you lost any sort of control of your body as it spasmed, you felt yourself wet the bed. As you past out, Rosemary sat on your chest and licked your juices off her hand, she saw you pissing the bed and laughed \"It's been a while since a saw a pisser, you've quite the dirty woman, Gus\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you woke slowly the first thing you felt was the wet patch under your ass the next thing you felt was the person on top of you, the room was dark but you could tell the shape was...........                         </span></div></div>",

The girl brushes your long blonde hair out of your eyes \u201cwake up mum, dinner is going to be served soon and YOU need a shower\u201d she applies a gentle pressure to your sore neck \u201cyou dirty girl\u201d. You feel a rising sense of panic, that you can\u2019t hold back, your breathing picks up. It feels like your heart is going to explode, you realise you\u2019re starting to have a panic attack. Rosemary rolls off the bed and lands on her feet \u201cah it feels so good to be agile again\u201d you get off the bed less sleekly but much quicker. It doesn\u2019t look like Rosemary is going to strangle you again but you still need something to calm your nerves, you find the alcohol your skin was drinking a few hours ago, the ice had melted but the warm liquid soothed your raw throat. \u201cWhat\u2026. happened?\u201d you croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell long story short, even though I got no help from you, I easily skinned the kids and put the maid back to the way she was and then for the past few hours I\u2019ve doing research\u201d. You can see in her eyes that she wants you to ask what she means by research, but you don\u2019t take the bait instead you give her a sullen look and polish off the liquor. \u201cOh don\u2019t be like that\u201d she looks all sad now, damn she\u2019s a good actress, she move over to you \u201cI didn\u2019t  mean to upset you, I just wanted you to learn the rules\u201d. She kisses you, it been so long since you kissed somebody you\u2019d forgotten what it felt like, it felt nice, you\u2019d never fucked the prison whores because of your wife but now you realised how much you miss sex. God, you wanted to fuck this girl so badly, as your fingers penetrated the young woman\u2019s pussy you could practically feel your hard cock straining against the skin. You started pulling off your skin when Rosemary slapped you hard across the face. \u201cWhat do you think you are doing? You only take off your skin when I tell you!\u201d she slapped you again \u201cIs that understood?\u201d  You nodded, you had forgotten that Rosemary was a lesbian you cursed yourself for being so stupid, you could have had hot lesbian sex but you ruined it. \u201cNow go take a shower, you stink\u201d Rosemary said in a disgusted tone of voice and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you shower your new body you begin thinking up of you own plan, Rosemary is a manipulative bitch and knows how to use and control people, she\u2019ll wrap you up in her lies and then drop you as soon as you have no worth to her. You spend a while in the shower but the only plan you can come up with is to play along until the cops stop looking for you and then slip away back to your family. You step out of the shower and look at your skin in the mirror, she might have been a racist but that didn\u2019t mean her and her children should be treated like this. A wave of guilt threatens to overwhelm you, but you push it back down, you\u2019re just a burglar not one of these hard core criminals that can throw away people\u2019s lives. As your slightly drunken mind wanders, your eyes check out the body you\u2019ll be wearing for the foreseeable future, for a forty something year old woman it\u2019s in fine shape but it\u2019s not because of a good diet or exercise it all comes down to genes. Just as you got chucked in jail they finished the final stages of human testing for genetic alteration therapy on inmates, a year later it when on the market, the rich snapped it up, designing their improved bodies forgetting how many prisoners died in the experiments. You feel a wave of angry rising inside of you, god, you\u2019ve felt so odd seen the bus crash, your emotions had been all over the place, you felt so confused all the time, and this headache that suddenly appeared wasn\u2019t helping. You need a drink, badly, you can think of a plan later and maybe while you\u2019re at it check out this body, and now you think of it you can try that dildo out again.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was a quiet affair, everyone was still trying to get use to their new skins and watching Rosemary so they could figure out what piece of cutlery to use next. With the servants about you couldn\u2019t ask direct questions about who was who but you managed to figure it out.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus (you) - Lady Jane Smith (43)<br>\r\nRosemary-Beatrix (21)<br>\r\nJack- Harriet (19)<br>\r\nDoc- Edward (17)<br>\r\nMax-Katherine (16) <br>\r\nVin-Victoria (12)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the best meal of most of the groups lives, the newly skinned family splits up and heads off to their separate bedrooms.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Doc POV) You sat in the bathtub and relaxed, really relaxed, you\u2019d been tense for what felt like a life time. You\u2019d had to look cruel, like you were two seconds away from stabbing someone, and for the first few years you had a fire burn inside of you that you didn\u2019t think you could contain, all you ever thought about was revenge, but now you were an old man. That hate had cooled and hardened, into a weight that you carried around the prison with you but as the years had worn down your body so had it slowly worn down the young man\u2019s need for revenge. Through a stroke of luck suddenly the chance at revenge had been thrown back in to your hands, you watched the water run between your hands, your new young hands. For the first time in your life you felt you had lost your purpose, your goal, after years in jail this was the first time you had felt depressed. You tried to cast off these thoughts and enjoy the first bath you\u2019d had in years, you rested your head against the wall and close your eyes. Your mind moved away from an old man\u2019s depressing thoughts and towards the wants of the body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince putting on Edward you had been feeling horny, you\u2019d forgot what young male hormones coursing around your veins felt like. You thought back to when Rosemary had bought the families skins down, there had been a bit of fight over who got what skin but soon everyone was suiting up. You began to touch your dick feeling it harden, jacking yourself off slowly, you remembered the way the skins had tighten from lose stretchy material into firm round girly arses. Max had tested his new skin out by slapping his new skins ass, it had left a bright red hand print on one cheek. You had to hold yourself from adding a mirror image on the over cheek, one moment you\u2019d been surrounded by naked men the next there was hot teen ass everywhere, never mind that the other half of the girls were still men. It was a shame Rosemary didn\u2019t do her little dress up tease like she did when she put the maid on but still when they got to the chest area, and the new hormones were running, it was difficult not to jump one of these semi-ladies and start ploughing away. Luckily a distraction came along in the form of Vin putting his foot into Victoria\u2019s arm slot and the whole group having to help the largest among them fit into the smallest family skin. Victoria\u2019s skin had stretched but it did really reach its limit with Vin, you\u2019re a little afraid to re-inflate Victoria considering how much her skin was forced to change shape to cover Vin before tightening.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking of changing shape, you\u2019d just notice that Edward\u2019s dick is a lot bigger than you thought, it had been a few inches long flaccid but now it was hard it must be almost fifteen inches. You\u2019d seen a lot of prisoners be taken away to the labs for genetic testing, few had returned, it all because someone saw a profit and couldn\u2019t wait the years of animal trails it would take to get even in the ballpark of a workable genetic modifier. Before your imprisonment when you had been a doctor, you would have found the practice of using humans as guinea pigs to make products of no worth to humanity and selling to the rich as disgusting. Now however, the old man weighed down by his past selves, could only roll his eyes at the society that was based on anti-pervert ideology having an upper class that was in a race to see who had the biggest dick, even though sex outside of marriage was illegal. It was all so pointless, everyone was in a race to keep up with the Joneses, be the most prim and proper, have the most expensive toys and houses, go on the most exotic holidays, have the family with the best body mods, what was the point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Brother\u201d you turned with a start at the voice, Beatrix Smith stood in the doorway to your dress in a bathrobe. With the sightless movement of her shoulders the bathrobe fell from her body, you\u2019d always been scared of Rosemary even though you never showed it but in that moment none of that was important just that goddess like woman in front of you. \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d without waiting for an answer she sashayed over and climbed into the bath, taking the slightest of pauses to lower herself on to your lap, the pause giving you enough time to give you an unavoidable look at the perfectly formed red lips of Beatrix\u2019s pussy. She leans back, giving you a view of her DD tits, and hits a few buttons on the bath, water jets start up and the cool water heats to almost burning temperatures. She moans in pleasure \u201cOh that\u2019s so much better, when I get cold my nipples stick out so much. Here, brother, feel how hard they get!\u201d she takes your wrinkle free hands and press them against her tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know she\u2019s trying to play you \u201cI\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re not trying to threaten me like you did with all the others\u201d. You said trying to appear fully in control of the situation as your hormones encouraged you to play with the first pair of tits you\u2019d had in your hands since big Jim tried to rape you on your first day in jail, in turns your years of practice saving lives also helps take lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosemary played hurt \u201cbrother, I would never threaten you. You\u2019re too smart for that I\u2019m here to figure out what you want and then give it to you\u201d. She gasps at the sight of you cock clear pointing out of the water like she was seeing it for the first time, it stood rigid in between the both of, with the help of Beatrix\u2019s body it had reached its full height and girth. \u201cOh, Edward is that because of me\u201d she said taking hold of your dickhead and rubbing the foreskin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d you decide to play along but also take charge of the situation, you grab her head and kiss her hard on the lip, while you start to finger her other lips. Rosemary speeds up playing with you dickhead, trying to make you cum and you will cum but where and when you want to. You let go of her head \u201cSister, I want you all my life and now I\u2019m going have you\u201d you take a firm grip on her hips, lift her up and then drop her down on your dick. She squeals before you shut up with another long kiss, when you were a doctor you would have said it would have been impossible for a virgin to fit something so large in them all in one go but times have changed. Rosemary slid down your dick quicker than a fireman down a pole, her belly stretched to accommodate you as you felt her thighs hit your lap. Rosemary stopped struggling once she realized that her new body would happily take your size. Rosemary got a wild look in her eyes, she began to work her hips, driving herself up and down on your member, you both turned in animal biting, clawing, and bruising each other\u2019s flesh, as both of you tried to get the most pleasure out of the young nubile skins you were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************************<br>\r\nRosemary\u2019s back pressed against your chest, as you sat in the aftermath of a crazy two hour fuck session, you had your arms around her, and it was almost romantic. Rosemary lit the cigarette and breathed the smoke into Beatrix\u2019s well used lungs, she lit another one and pass it to you. You shook your head \u201cthose things will kill you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed think you were joking, until she turned and saw now serious your face was \u201cYou don\u2019t actually believe those crazy scientists, years ago do you?\u201d You don\u2019t respond, instead staring at a floating lump of cum, Rosemary start to put things together \u201cbut you can\u2019t be one of the scientists, they all got the death sentence for spreading lies with the intent of damaging American businesses\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t ever told an inmate your story before, but it was so long ago it felt like it happened to someone else so you just said it how it was. \u201cThe man who betrayed me and the other doctors and scientists, working to prove smoking kills, had been my friend. He made sure I was allowed to live, we\u2019re currently in that man\u2019s house\u201d. That was it, in two sentences you manage to sum up the reason why you had been in jail for the past few decades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to kill him?\u201d it was difficult to tell what her tone of meant. You shrugged your shoulders, you were an old man now, what was the point. Rosemary slapped you hard on the face \u201cyou listen to me, I\u2019m going to get revenge on the people who betrayed me and so are you! Neither of us deserved to be thrown in jail but we were and that made us tougher but our bodies were failing us but now we have new bodies, so I\u2019m going to use everything I\u2019ve got to get revenge on the Smith clan\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosemary had a way of talking that could convince anybody that whatever she was talking about was the right thing to do. \u201cDid you crash the bus and who do you want revenge against?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile plays on her lips as she starts getting you hard again, she knows she has convinced you \u201cI wish I had but no, I had nothing to do with the crash and my undying hated is for your dear friends parents.\u201d She turns around and presses your dickhead to her anus \u201cI saw that you were ass man brother, so I thought you could help me find out how much this little Smith cunt\u2019s ass can stretch\u201d. Before Rosemary came in you\u2019d felt and been an old man but you were now a young man who happens to have a lot of life experience.

Looking around, your room is dark with dim moonlight cascading through your window.<br>\r\nYou push the sheets from your legs and get up, rubbing your eyes. A feeling tells you to be careful, but really, you're just wondering why you're up.<br>\r\nWalking to the bedroom door, you open it and peek out into the hallway, it's barren, as expected. Darkness fills most of your house and you tremble slightly, your imagination conjuring up something strange, hidden behind the blanket of black. Smirking at your own childishness, you suddenly hear a noise coming from your left. It's from your mother's room, you frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mom shouldn't be up at this time.. What's going on in there?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, you think. What if it's a robber? You quickly retrieve your baseball bat from behind your bedroom door. Walking out into the hallway, you quickly but quietly advance to the door. Gripping the knob, it's unlocked. You inhale deeply and shut your eyes for a minute, then turning the knob and opening the door.<br>\r\nAs you open the door, you hear something, or someone, move sharply, before practically disappearing. Looking into the room, you step forward quickly, bat raised, towards the light switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" You hear a voice in the room mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you flick on the lights to see a woman standing naked in front of your mother's bed. You're momentarily stunned, and then horrified, as your eyes run up her body. A man is halfway through taking off your mother's skin, you realise. Infuriated, you run forward as he turns around, something long and black in hand, but you're too fast. Slamming your shoulder into his ribs, he's sent flying onto your mom's bed. The object he was holding clacks against the bedside table, the force of your impact must've knocked it from his grip. You raise your bat above your head as you stand there, huffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, and what is this?\" You ask quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, look..\" The man frowns as he speaks, he's incredibly frustrated. \"Put the bat down, I can explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck no! You're some guy wearing my mom's.. skin..!? What the hell!\" You say, almost shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but just listen, okay?\" He says, one hand raised towards you, as if that would stop your bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and nod. \"Alright, speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a rogue agent for a secret organization, I've been on the run from them for about 2 weeks. I've.. been hiding out in your mother.\" He says meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..\" It takes a second to sink in, \" Wait.. WHAT?! You were hiding in my fucking mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait! I was about to leave, but then you interrupted me! Just let me go!\" He pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms tremble as you hold the bat, ready to strike. This sounds like a bunch of bullshit, but.. the skin around his waist says otherwise. It's definitely your mom, you can tell by her hair. You sigh and lower the bat, stepping away from him. He gets up quickly and you see him duck to the side, snagging the black \"pen\" off of the floor. Looking back at you, you curse as he points it directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry pal, you know too much.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a jolt of electricity hit you in the stomach and spread out through your body, and then it's all black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken suddenly. Jolting up from the bed you're laying on, you look around, disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Woah.. that was the weirdest dream ever..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes a few seconds for you to realise that you're not even in your house. The door opens suddenly, and you see a girl enter. She's about 18, long black curls frame her cute face, and she's got a bronze skin tone. Her curvy form developed by her nice bust and, as she walks to the dressing table, you find out that her ass is equally as stellar. Around her torso she's wearing a thin cotton shirt, with black denim shorts. She looks at you and smiles, she was carrying a tray with food and drink. Walking over to you, she stands by the side of the bed and looks you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should feel sore after re-inflating, but you'll be fine.\" She says, her voice is high, and she has a spanish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually, I don't feel sore at all..\" You say, flexing your shoulders, \"I feel pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns and purses her lips adorably, you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange.. usually people feel really tired and worn out..\" She folds her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm special.\" You joke, and she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her walk over to the tray and bring it to the side of the bed, admiring the way her hips smoothly rock as she moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made you a sandwich, eat bacon?\" She says, smiling cheekily at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the cleanly cut triangle closest to you and stuff it into your mouth. Dear God, it's so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph, it'sh sho good!\" You say, whilst chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking her head to the side, she nods. \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, holding the empty tray after you guzzle down the cup of orange juice she'd brought. As she walks out quickly, you get up and look around.<br>\r\nThe room is definitely a girl's room, maybe it's her's. You're still trying to piece together what happened last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happened to Mom?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to a window, you look out into the world. You're greeted by the sight of a vast farmland, the house you're in appears to be an expensive cottage surrounded by fields of wheat and corn on one hand, flowers on the other. A few other houses dot the landscape. The door opens behind you and you whip around to see the girl walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have questions and.. I have answers.\" She says, folding her arms under her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. yeah..\" You say, your cheeks reddening slightly. \"Who are you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you for a moment, and you frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I? Oh! Oh right,\" she starts to laugh, shaking her head. \"I'm such a dummy, my name's Marisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lovely name..\" You say, nervously laughing, she simply smiles at you. \"I'm David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, next question!\" She says chirpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" By her expression, you can tell she was expecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are currently in a far away hideout that I took you to after I escaped your house!\" She says, rather casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That must mean.. she's that guy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, rage boiling to life inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! So that means you.. shot this poor girl and put her on too?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. more like zapped, and yeah. I use this place all the time. It's relatively safe.\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is wrong with you..?\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply laughs and turn around, her hips sway as she walks out of the room, leaving the door open behind her. You quickly follow.<br>\r\nLeaving the bedroom, you're greeted by a large upper floor with a large wooden staircase slightly ahead of you and two hallways on either side. Numerous doorways lead into different rooms on the top floor. You watch as she skips down the stairs quickly, her breasts bouncing slightly with every drop.<br>\r\nWalking down the stairs, you admire the redwood it's made of. A smooth red colour glossed over by a nice finish contrasts the cream walls, yet still compliments it. Reaching the bottom floor, you look right and find a kitchen, left is the living room. </span></div></div>",

You try your hardest not to nosebleed as you catch sight of her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thirsty?\" She says, waving a box of juice as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No..\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, more for me.\" She promptly opens the box and drinks straight from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way her throat moves and sounds as she gulps down the liquid leaves you dizzy, you shake your head and turns around, looking at the living room.<br>\r\nShe puts the box back in the fridge and shuts the door, exhaling deeply, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you wear me like you did my mother?\" You say as she walks past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops and turns around, looking you square in the eye. Her expression is serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's to say I didn't?\" She says coldly, before smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you.\" You say, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seriously though, I brought you here because you saw me, plain and simple. I didn't want to kill you because you didn't beat me to death with that bat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess being a nice guy has it's perks sometimes.\" You say jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, just because I wear people like costumes doesn't mean I'm <i>evil</i>. Though.. I can see why you would think that.\" She says, holding her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply frown and stare. She stops laughing and looks at you, a smile across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you act so.. happy?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean..? This is- Oh..\" She abruptly stops. \"It's.. because I can use this girl's personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How does that even work?\" You ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all in the pens, pal.\" She chuckles at her lame joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pens?\" You remember the black object that he used to zap you. \"Oh, that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's another one with different uses, but I'll show you that later.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. okay..?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes you by the wrist and runs up the stairs, pulling you behind her. Leading to you back to the bedroom, she throws a towel at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to clean up! You've been out for a while actually. You're pretty smelly.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you're in the shower, hot water streams from the showerhead over you when you hear the door open.<br>\r\nA shape approaches the shower curtain and you pull it back to see Marisa stripping right infront of you. She looks at you and giggles.<br>\r\nYou stare in awe as she pulls her shirt up and off, revealing her white lacy bra. As she tugs her shorts off, a matching pair of panties is revealed.<br>\r\nShe reaches around and unclips the bra and pulls off her underwear, and you promptly look away, not wanting to disgrace her angelic form with your sight.<br>\r\nYou dick's pretty much made of stone by now, but it gets worse as the curtain pulls back as Marisa steps into the shower with you.<br>\r\nTurning around, you yell in surprise. A bronze body of pure beauty wraps it's arms around your waist and pulls itself into you.<br>\r\nYou feel her breasts squish against your chest, she's not that much shorter than you. As she looks up at you slightly, she giggles.<br>\r\nYour dick's being squished between her pelvis and your body and you couldn't believe you could get this excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jessica..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering your girlfriend, you try to worm out of her grasp and you push her off of you gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, come on! You know I have a girlfriend, right?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, I was just teasing you!\" She giggles, one hand cups her breast and gently lifts it. \"Besides, your cock is just so.. attractive..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown and back away from her as she eyes you hungrily, looking down, you notice some liquid shimmering between her legs than you know isn't water.<br>\r\nShe laughs and walks forward, before she opens her eyes wide and shakes her head, black curls flaying about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Sorry, I lose control sometimes.. This girl's body is really horny often because she doesn't really hang out with guys.\" Marisa meekly whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what the fuck do you expect?! You're keeping her here, wearing her!\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuts her eyes and looks down, before she looks up at you and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. But I can't help it. I've got to hide and this is how it's done.\" She shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, looking down at the bar of soap you'd dropped previously due to her spontaneous intrusion. She notices and bends down, purposefully curving her body in a way to expose herself to you. Your eye twitches and you almost instinctively grip your cock. She takes this as an invitation and drops the soap, instead lunging forward and gripping your shaft above your hand. Her thumb on your head, you groan in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow..\" Her eyes widen as she stares at it, you can clearly see that she's struggling. \"Just.. let me..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she lowers her head, taking your tip in between her luscious lips. Her tongue gently runs along your flesh and you almost whine in pleasure.<br>\r\nHearing some kind of purr coming from her, she instantly thrusts her head forward and takes it full on, deep throating you. Instantly, you cum inside of her mouth and she chokes. Pulling her head from your member, white seed spills over her lips as she looks up at you. You feel your warm liquids slowly drip down your shaft. You see her cheeks move before she opens her mouth and smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just.. swallow..?\" You ask, one brow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else would I do with it?\" She says, cocking her head to the side and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..You've turned this girl into a slut, man.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous.\" She says, as you see her hand travels down her body inbetween her legs. Her back falls against the wall as she slumps onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare in surprise as she fingers herself, her other hand teases her nipple. You're not intrigued by the fact that she's masturbating, but by her facial expression. On her face is plastered a look of intensity and relief, she's so into it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, you're getting hard again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica won't mind.. right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what you're thinking as you kneel down to Marisa, leaning forward, you tip her head up to look at you with your fingers. Her eyes display not the expected sense of lust, but a sense of.. longing. It's as if she's fostered a deep love for you for such a long time, and now that you're intimate with her, she's crying silently in joy. But you don't know this person, not one bit. She's not even a person, she's a body, being worn by some sick guy with a laser pen. <br>\r\nBut that doesn't concern you, all that concerns you right now is the shapely breasts of Marisa, her curves as they run down past them, her wide hips below a slim, toned waist. Your hands soon trace her body as your eyes so, and you gently caress her thighs, before looking at your prize inbetween them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it..\" You hear a voice whisper, she's almost begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip her legs and pull her away from the wall, she slides down with her arms above her head, then laying her back on the wet floor. Her black curls sprawl in the water, fanning out into a wet array of onyx strands. You slide your hands up her thighs again, putting your mouth to her flower and you do what you must.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whines, moans and soon screams in pleasure, your hands massage her thighs and pelvis as your tongue works her clit thoroughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh! Aaaaghhhmmmm, mmmph!\" She involuntarily sputters, her moans turned from sharp to muffled by the biting of her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving up her body, keeping your head in place however, your tongue skims the surface, licking her rich skin as you snake upwards.<br>\r\nYou feel her abs tense as you stimulate them, she giggles. Her fingers, unsure of what to do, touch your arms and tremble.<br>\r\nLetting loose of a rumbling growl from your throat, you announce your arousal in addition to your rock hard member. Moving up on her suddenly, the movement causes her breasts to jiggle, and she tries to raise her torso using her elbows. You promptly push her chest with your fingers and lay her back down, denying her the effort of protesting. Assuming a comfortable position, you hear a gasp, then a moan as you enter her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's warm.. hot, actually, and it's kind of familiar. Memories of having intimate moments with Jessica flash through your head and you realise something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisa acts very similar to Jessica..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant you stop as your eyes open, the spray of hot water cancelling any other noise around you as you pull yourself from inside of her.<br>\r\nShe opens her eyes soon after and questioningly raises her brow. You stand quickly, and step away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong David..?\" She says, standing up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Jessica?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mixture of surprise, dismay and horror flashes across Marisa's face. You grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why..\" You simply whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you turn off the water and pull the shower curtain. She folds her arms under her breasts, staring at you.<br>\r\nYou can't help but see a shadow of Jessica's form inside Marisa's whenever you look at her. At first, you think you're hallucinating, but you soon find out that after a couple of blinks, there's more than Jessica inside. It's like.. an onion. Strange analogy, but appropriate. These other layers are being worn ontop of each other, Marisa on the outside, Jessica underneath her, and the vision gets more and more unclear the further along you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Why are you wearing all those skins?\" You demand to know, a fierce look in your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisa looks up suddenly, and then frowns. Clearly what you're asking is strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know..?\" She mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward, you grab her shoulders and spin her around. It's easy, due to the slippery floor. Throwing your arms under hers, her firm rear braces your hard member as you force your arms up, your hands around the back of her neck. You've got her in a successful headlock, she's helpless.<br>\r\nYou hear her laugh softly, her shoulders shrugging in your lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got me, David. Now what?\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me who you are, and why you're doing all this..\" You say, rather lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well, I guess.\" She says. \"Truth is, David, I've been in more people than just your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're dazed, this is just ridiculous now. You're confident that she's lying. Or he. Or it. Whatever<b>IT</b> is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the fuck are you my mother? That makes no sense.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie Anderson, forty three years. Has scars on her pelvis from a c-section performed 18 years ago.\" Marisa says, her tone's become cold, calculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the wall ahead, however, the strength in your knees weaken and you fall back. Hitting yourself on the shower knobs, a trickle of cold water hits your head and flows down to your chin, before dropping off. The pain loosens your arms and Marisa flies forward, twisting them. In a flurry of movement, you find yourself staring at the ceiling, or three of them, your shoulder being bent out of it's socket, Marisa behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lock was well applied, but unfortunately, you lack the decades of experience I have.\" She says, smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bitch..\" You stammer in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, David. I'll tell you the rest.\" Her voice twists into your mother's pristine and elevated way of speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at her, your head touching her stomach. She's grinning widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, I'm an agent for an organization that uses these pens. But what I didn't tell you was that I started that organization, and that I started it whilst wearing your mother. Your father's also an agent, infact, he's my best friend. Whilst wearing Marie, I got into a relationship with him and we had you. You're the only real child in our so-called family, everyone else is actually an observer. Tina, Claire, they're agents, my friends. We've done this because you're special, being born of a woman who's skin was being worn, you've been given special.. abilities. You're like a living pen, and more..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulder aches, and she lets your arm go, it falls lifelessly to your side, smacking your thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fucking liar.. Jessica..\" You say, standing up and turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisa tilts her head to the side and resumes her cynical smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to believe, yeah, it's pretty far fetched from your point of view, but you asked for the truth, and I have no reason to lie.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're my mother, then why did you try to fuck me?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisa appears confused as to why you would ask that, she expected something.. deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. I was horny, you were horny, we were alone and bang, that's what happens.\" She says, nervously laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your skins.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and nods, reaching behind her head, she peels her bronze skins from her body, turning it into a rubbery exterior as it separates from her skin.<br>\r\nJessica's blonde locks reveal themselves, followed by her face as she pulls Marisa's down, quickly, she sheds the rest of her skin. Her breasts's reduced in size, you feel more comfortable however standing next to your \"girlfriend\". Letting the brown skin drop to the wet shower floor, a wet sound follows it's collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy?\" Jessica says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare intently, and the \"skin-vision\" reappears, you can see further behind Jessica's skin than you could before. Now you see.. your own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God fucking damn it, how many people are you wearing!?\" You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, no need to get loud. Only a few. It's the best method of storage, you know.\" She says, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sick cunt.\" You step out of the shower and wrap yourself in a towel, Jessica follows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, you walk out, pursued by your girlfriend as you shrug off her grasping hands, ducking below her looping arms. Trying at every opportunity to deny him the pleasure of toying with your feelings. That's not Jessica, it probably never was. You don't know what's going on anymore, your entire family seems to be against you, according to what she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never had a family, you're alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two of you fall to the floor, stunned.<br>\r\nDeafened by the gunfire, you see holes being formed in the wall across from you a dozen a second, Jessica's yelling something, but neither of you can hear.<br>\r\nShe crawls to you, the gunfire stops, grabbing your arm, you're huddling besides the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.. how'd they find me?\" Jessica spits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, Jessica's never sounded like that before. But then again, your girlfriend probably was never even real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chopper lifts upwards, the sounds of men shouting is faint under the overpowering rant of the helicopter propellers.<br>\r\nJessica's eyes widen, and she grabs your arm. Pulling you off the floor, she then leads you to the bathroom quickly. <br>\r\nThrowing open the door, she slams it and locks it, then walking briskly to the shower. You see Marisa's skin in her hand as he turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it on, we need to run and she's fitter than you.\" Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching it, you look up at Jessica, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry the fuck up!\" She almost yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chopper seems to distance itself from the house as the noise subsides slightly, but you hear the stamping of boots.<br>\r\nClawing your clothes off, you turn Marisa's turn around and stretch it wide open, for a moment you're amazed by how elastic it is.<br>\r\nSticking your legs into it, instantly they stick to your skin as if it was wrapping itself around you. Your legs and ass thicken with both muscle and fat, you feel yourself being molded by the skin. Trying your best not to vomit, you pull it up and stick your arms through. Your groin is squeezed so incredibly hard and fast that you feel no pain when it disappears, replaced by Marisa's still moist snatch. Your abs harden and tighten up incredibly as your waist slims, you're surprised at the way this body feels. She doesn't look like she works out, but god damn..<br>\r\nFlipping her long black hair forward, you stuff your head into the back of her neck. Your cheeks and jaw assume the more shapely and pronounced form of Marisa's and you're almost surprised when two full breasts appear on your chest. <br>\r\nJessica stoops down and grabs your clothes from the floor, throwing them at you as well. She walks to the door and peeks out after opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've gotta' go. Now.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not dre-\" You say in Marisa's voice, sounding awkward as you lack her accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go!\" She yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinging the door wide open, she grabs your wrist and pulls you along with her, running into the hallway, 3 men in all black are rushing up the stairs with sub-machine guns pointed upwards, at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" The one in front yells, setting his sights on Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica almost blurs as she moves both gracefully and rapidly to the right, before kicking out the goon infront's leg. He tumbles backwards and slams into the guy behind him. Bullets create a line up the side of the stairs as their guns fire. With a quick extension of her leg, the last man descends the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" You say, one of your arms over Marisa's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time! Run!\" She looks at you, fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you run. Down the stairs, you're greeted by the sight of a dozen soldiers outside the house. Red dots blot the wall behind you, and soon they converge onto Jessica. She looks at you briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cellar!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blaze of gunfire, her body is torn apart by hundreds of rounds. Blood splatters over the wall behind as you stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica! <b>NO!</b>\" You scream, she slumps against the wall, blood pooling by her limp arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier's turn their sights on you and hesitate, for some reason, they haven't killed you yet. But you're not about to start guessing why. Whirling around, you speed into the kitchen. There was a small door near the back of the house that you saw, but only briefly. It'll have to be the cellar, or you're dead.<br>\r\nThe stamping of boots sounds behind you as the soldiers collapse on you, you're out of the kitchen and through the back door. As you hit the trapdoor to the cellar, you throw the doors open and run down the small, cold stone stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's dark, the only light coming from the opening you just came through. Looking around, you hug the wall and grope around. Something touches your hand..<br>\r\nA light switch! As you flick it on, white light floods the entire cellar, momentarily blinding you. Opening your eyes, you notice a red box next to the light switch, somewhat similar to a fire alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">IN CASE OF EMERGENCY PULL DOWN</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you do, almost ripping the small metal handle from it's place on the wall. Electricity seems to buzz to life around you, and you feel a strange pressure on your body. Red lasers seems to speed through the wall from a large metal object near the far end of the cellar. The beams converge on the door, and a wash of red energy forms a barrier in the opening. You see a soldier rush around the corner and peer into the cellar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in here!\" He yells to others. \"What the fuck is this..?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising his gun to the red barrier, he fires a few rounds at it. They instantly disintegrate.<br>\r\nHe seems to stare for a moment in surprise, before letting his gun point to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit.\" He mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem? Get the hell in there and grab her!\" Another soldier arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't, atomic displacement field.\" He replies. \"This whole cellar is sealed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! God damn it!\" The other grunts, more arriving behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop staring at them and look around. the floors and walls are all silvery, with red beams of energy flowing through them.<br>\r\nThe beams look holographic to you.. kind of like how you saw through Jessica's disguise. <br>\r\nThere's a table with a laptop on it, and a few papers scattered about next to it, along with an envelope.<br>\r\nSifting through, the papers are just incomprehensible numbers. You pick up the envelope.<br>\r\nBreaking the seal, you pull out the paper inside and unfold it. A small black pen, like the one Jessica had falls from the paper onto the table.<br>\r\nAs you read, you recognize Jessica's handwriting, and you start to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>David, if you're reading this, it means I'm dead.<br>\r\nDon't be confused, all of this was inevitable. I've lived a long time because of the skins, and you're going to have to if you want to fix all this.<br>\r\nYou're wanted, you should know by now, you've got special abilities. The reason they never showed up before is because your body needed the energy from the pen to turn them on, and I've probably used it on you. At the time of writing, I'm wearing your mother, Marie.<br>\r\n I've actually just given birth to you, trust me, it's really hard to write this. The nurses here are so kind, it's almost sickening when I think about it.<br>\r\nThey don't know who I really am, but that's besides the point. The pen in this note is for you to defend yourself with, please, use it.<br>\r\nYou're not the first to be born like this, you're actually apart of an experiment by the organization. There's another like you, his name is Daniel.<br>\r\nHe's about 24 by now, do the math when you read this. He'll find you. <br>\r\nHonestly, It's sad that I have to do what I'm going to, just to keep my eyes on you.<br>\r\nI don't want to take your life away, it's just.. we have to protect you. I wish you could understand how much we love you.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears stream down your face, your lips curl in grief as you sob in Marisa's high voice. You pick up the pen and look to the laptop.<br>\r\nStuffing the note in your pocket, you wipe your face with your wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boom cracks the foundation of the building, and dust falls from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the wall blows out  and stone is sent flying over the cellar, bruising your soft flesh as you raise your arms in reflex.<br>\r\nKnocked to the floor, the barrier powers down, and red dots light up the room like fireflies. Soldiers drop into the room and surround you on the floor, you see one stoop forward, a black object in his hand. Quickly, he jabs it into your neck and injects you with something. Your eyes roll to the back of your head as you pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're dreaming, or at least, you think you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages flash before you, you're seeing your mom dropping you off at elementary school, then your family at the dinner table, celebrating Claire's 9th birthday.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you're watching Tina drive you home from football practice, you're both laughing.<br>\r\nSomething latches itself around your wrist and drags you away, you try your hardest to reach out to the image, but you're pulled into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, your head's pounding. Looking around, you see a woman above you, a nurse. A cold hard surface under your back, you look to the other way. A young man, the doctor. You're covered by a lime green blanket, it's thin, but cozy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally awake, is she?\" The man says. \"We'll need more sedative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour strength is suddenly restored, and you lunge forward. Slamming your elbow square into his chin, he's sent staggering back. The nurse tries to hold you, but you shrug her off and leap from the table. Across the room, you see what clothes you had on before, and your pen. Running over to it, you grab it an swing around, aiming it to the nurse. As you press the button, your hand seems to pulsate with red energy, you see lines being sucked into the pen's along it's body.<br>\r\nThe beam fires and strikes her in the chest, she instantly crumples to the floor. The doctor follows quickly.<br>\r\nHuffing, you look around, there's nobody else.  </span></div></div>",
