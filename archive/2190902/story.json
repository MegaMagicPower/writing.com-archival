Someone once told him reading a book he was interested in before bed might help him fall asleep easier. Rubbing his eyes he continues through to the fiction shelves, hoping something will catch his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorkers prowl the aisles, keeping an eye on him as closing time is approaching, they're trying to pick the most strategic moment to tell Tom to get lost no doubt. A cute girl who looks around 25 decides to take the fall for the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me sir, we're closing in 15 minutes. Can I give you a hand with anything?\" Well rehearsed yet dull delivery, however she stepped up on behalf of her team so this generic 'get lost so I can go home' gets a solid 7 out of 10 from Tom. Her green eyes watch expectantly from behind a curtain of black hair which she brushes away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you can\" Tom replies with a hint of smile, trying to show he's slightly less dead inside. \"I'm looking for something chunky, something I can read for months but something I look forward to reading every night\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have some old books out the back we might be able to discount for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be fantastic thank you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the worker into the back room, she wasn't lying but she isn't exactly hiding another, better book shop back here. There is a grand total of 3 worn out books. Their spines do catch your eye though, strange symbols draw your eye along as you try to decipher which language they're from. Unable to read the titles, Tom has to judge a book from the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe least scuffed of the books catches his eye first. Purple and pink with slightly raised writing, written in a white colour. It looks like a fairly significant read but looks a bit plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second is a book which is a little more scuffed but very eye catching. A moderate shade of brown makes the backdrop of the cover with the symbols written across in a bold, fiery red colour. Blue borders surround the cover in a solid border.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final book is incredibly scuffed, it looks like it's spent it's life loose in a coal train engine compartment. The corners are blunted and the pages show through little tears. The cover is a light shade of smoke grey with imposing black writing over the cover. Red patches reminiscent of blood adorn the cover too in a chaotic pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint cough brings Tom back to the present, he checks his watch and seeing that there is 5 minutes left he makes his choice.</span></div></div>",

Driving in the city is always notorious so Tom never felt the need to invest in a car, instead relying on public transport. Luckily tonight he's near to his apartment. Working as a legal firm receptionist isn't the most glorious job but they pay above average. A lucky find led to renting a comfortable little apartment about 20 minutes away from the CBD. Nightlife isn't far away and on Friday nights it's easy  to hear the laughter and mindless chatter coming from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his bag onto a chair, undoing his tie, and trying to relax as his thoughts dwelled on the odd realization that the book might have been a bad impulse buy. Shrugging, he walks over towards a bottle of wine, a gift from a co-worker, and decides to pour himself a glass, wanting to unwind after the day he'd had and the peculiarity of that urge to buy a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsently opening the book to see if it had an index or anything of note in the front pages, while sipping at his drink, Tom gets confused as he thinks he sees something on a couple of pages. Drawn to put the glass down, and placing both hands on the book while leaning down to see what had caught his attention, Tom suddenly hisses, a burning feeling on the palm of his hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know, when they trapped me in the book, you think they would have made a proper instruction page instead of silly bindings and no real explanation what you did would entail, eh?\"</i> Comes the voice of an amused female, her tone both seductive, smokey, and in an apartment that should only have one occupant!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Tom quickly spins in place, gasping at the sight of the voice's owner, a stunning yet oddly simply dressed woman who hadn't been there before. With brown hair flowing down her back in a french braid down to mid back, a simple black dress, that showed just enough cleavage and her figure to be both attention grabbing, yet not enough to give off the 'slut' vibe. Her arms were crossed under her generous sized bust, lifting them up slightly, she had an amused smirk on her face....her pink eyes being the only true oddity aside from her sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Who the hell are you, and how did you get in here?\"</i> Tom asks, both confused and slightly aroused at the very sight of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slightly scowls when he sees her giggle, her breasts jiggling being the only thing lessening it from anger and fear to just mild annoyance. Chuckling soon follows before she holds up a hand in the universal gesture of 'wait a moment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sorry, it's just, the last time i was out and about, the person that stumbled across me didn't bother to think beyond 'ooh, sex!' - it's a novel experience, then again, it's been a while from what i can tell,\"</i> The woman says, moving over to the nearby couch, sitting down on it, crossing her legs, showing them to be long, milky, and sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's gaze is drawn to said legs, traveling up them slightly to the shadowed and hidden depths beneath the dress before shaking his head, focusing on the woman's face, which seemed to be both plain, yet beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You didn't answer my questions?\"</i> He points out, earning a nod from the woman, who gestures for Tom to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well Master,\"</i> <i>\"What?\"</i> <i>\"Master, if you keep interrupting i can't explain anything~\"</i> The woman teases, getting a glare from Tom, who holds his tongue to let her get on with explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"A long time ago magic was a common enough thing that supernatural beings were still out and about, and some were terrorizing the humans of the lands. Sadly, when one being causes trouble, all get tarred with the same brush, and that is no different with what happened to me.\"</i> The woman says, looking somewhat wistful for a moment before giving Tom a sharp look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom freezes, as he had been about to interrupt the brunette, but then sighs, gesturing for her to continue, getting a smirk in silent reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm a succubus, a 'demon' that feeds on sex and lust, as the legends likely go, though just like you humans, not all of us are 'good or evil'. Nearly a millennia ago, i was attacked while minding my own business, and trapped in that book. Over the centuries i've been found and used by my masters, as the book was designed - each one, if they progressed enough or such, adding their own additions to said book. You Master, are the most recent in owners of your very own Succubus~\"</i> The 'demon' finished, looking amused at the pole-axed expression that Tom was showing, as the whole story sounded so ludicrous that it would be impossible to state it with that calm yet alluring tone she had delivered it in the whole time she'd spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wh-wha-what exactly does this mean?\" </i>Tom stutters out, finally getting enough control of himself to get the most pertinent, in his mind, question answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, simply put, as long as you feed me, or allow me to find a way to feed, it all depends on what you want - and if you're willing to pay the price.\"</i> The woman answers, looking pleased that Tom seemed to be smart enough to ask questions instead of panicking as some would likely do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tom asked, confused at the phrasing of that answer, and not sure if he'd like what her response could possibly entail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Simply put, while you are my Master, you only have a nominal amount of control over me and my powers, as in i cannot harm, affect, or influence you in a fatal way. In other words, i cant kill you with my powers or at all really, but i also could just walk out and go on a crazed feeding frenzy. However, you could negotiate me helping you, or doing favors for you using my natural gifts,\"</i> The 'Demon' replies, rolling her eyes at the momentary scared look crossing Tom's face when she bluntly mentions killing him before it sinks in that she couldn't directly cause it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Okay then...what should i call you then?\"</i> Tom asks absently, not sure what to make of his bizarre night, as this was not what he expected when he was attempting to broaden his horizons spontaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, the woman locks her pinkish eyes with Tom's own, her voice taking on a seductive tone while answering, \"You can call me Lilith~\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you eat meat, dairy, vegetables. . .?\" </i>Tom asked aloud, only to trail off as Lilith's face slowly forms a grin, one that, while beautiful, was also telling him that he'd apparently said something quite unintelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<i>\"While i can eat those things, they do not sustain me. I do find some of the foods you humans make quite tasty, but it would be the equivalent of eating empty calories for me to eat just human foods. No, what i require is life energy,\"</i> Lilith says, rolling her eyes as Tom pales at her last few words. <i>\"Oh calm down - if what I was explaining was lethal or so bad, do you think i would be doing so calmly? Do try to recall I mentioned I couldn't kill you, and that means I wouldn't be able to kill you by feeding on you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom calms down slightly, though is still a bit freaked out about the blunt explanation he was receiving. Confused still, he inquires that she explain more. Nonplussed by this, she launches into a lengthy explanation before sighing as she notices that Tom's eyes had glazed over, and not because he was staring at her breasts which, while covered, were still enticing and attention grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her fingers a few times, and seeing Tom snap out of his distracted state, Lilith clears her throat before speaking. <i>\"Look, simple terms, as long as i can feed on people via sex, then i'm a calm and helpful sex-demon. The longer I go without feeding, the less eloquent and pleasant I am. Ergo, either you need to feed me, or give me leave to feed on nearby people.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Tom looks a bit stricken by those options, even with the reassurance that none would be killed in this manner.

Nightlife isn't far away and on Friday nights it's easy hear the laughter and mindless chatter coming from below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his bag on the dining room table, Tom loosens his tie and pours himself a glass of scotch. The book is resting next to the bag on the table and he's starting to regret wasting his time with the purchase. With a sigh he decides to skim through it, see if there's anything inside the cover like a blurb or chapter list which could indicate what it's about. Placing his hand inadvertently on one of the symbols on the page and immense, burning pain flows through him. Swearing, he runs his hand under cold water, glaring at the symbol now burned in his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really should have put a warning on the book after trapping me in there, that looks really painful.\" A lusty voice fills the quiet of your apartment causing you to jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around he sees the most intoxicating woman, half naked on the table, watching him keenly. Long black hair falls over her shoulders and rests about mid-back. Her face is soft, round and delicate. His gaze drifts down to her plumb, soft lips, then falls lower as he notices her sizable, unnaturally perky breasts, contained in a tight, brown cloth top which reveals an immense amount of cleavage. Her long, smooth legs go to a pair of light brown shorts which barely cover her firm backside. Her nails are painted black and come to more of a point than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most striking features of all though are the inhuman ones. Large, bat like wings are furled on her back. Rams horns protrude from her head. A tail with a tip resembling a spade in poker swings lazily behind her. Finally those piercing red eyes follow your movements with a look of bemusement. She gives a devilish little smile and leans further forward, showing off even more of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say hello. I don't bite unless you want me to?\" She stretches out loving how captivated you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking his jaw up off the floor, Tom composes himself. \"Who are you? What are you? How did you get in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly stands up, hips swaying as she moves to the bar and helps herself to some scotch. \"Always interesting what you humans say when you first see us.\" She finishes her glass easily and licks her lips. \"I'm a succubus, a demon of lust. But you can call me Mezelin. What can I call you other than handsome?\" She gives him a little wink, gets the book and sits on the lounge getting comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. Tom you can call me. You still didn't answer my question of how you got here though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting to that don't rush me. I was imprisoned in this book eons ago for trivial reasons I can't quite remember. I was told that I would be released in servitude of whoever touches the book. You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens up the book and allows you to read the succubus contract. \"It mentions hunger and feeding a lot here, should I be bold and ask how that works?\" Tom asks here a little cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you an cheeky little smile. \"I've been in that book for such a long time so I'm going to have to show you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click of her fingers your body refuses to obey you. Standing completely upright as she circles around you. Your body can't help but react as she admires you. Against your will you begin to undress in front of her. Her hands slide up your toned stomach as your shirt goes over and is flung across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm we can definitely work with this.\" She playfully strokes your cock listening to you groan in lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?!\" Your body follows her obediently as she walks back to the lounge, hips swaying teasing you before undressing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to feed on some well deserved lust, maybe show off a bit too.\" She giggles and lowers her hand downwards. Your body responds immediately as you get on your knees. She spreads her legs and you can see her soaking wet pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were MY succubus-\" With a wave of her hand she forces your mouth to shut and makes you crawl up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct but if I don't feed now I might die, better to feed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start helplessly eating her out, teasing her pussy with your fingers and her clit with your tongue. Her moans of pleasure are incredible to hear and to your surprise she tastes incredible. Under her control you soon have her writhing in lust, playing with her own tits and forcing your head into her sex with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's good! Oh just like that! Mmmm Tom!!!\" Bucking her hips she orgasms so intensely, moaning and squealing like a porn star. \"Oh we are going to have fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes you give her soaking pussy one last lick before giving you back control of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

She grasps the shaft softly, stroking it slowly before giving the tip a soft kiss. She wraps her lips around you cock and slides down to the base, she looks deceivingly innocent on her knees. As she works your cock she looks into your eyes, red irises looking into your soul. She builds up the pace, sucking faster and harder listening to you moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like me sucking your cock master?\" She bats her eyelashes and gives you a sexy smile, jerking your cock slowly knowing that she has you on the edge.

She leans back and lets you drink in the view. Getting on all fours she cleans your cock with her tongue, you can tell she really enjoys the taste. You start to feel incredibly fatigued, you assume that this is her feasting on your lust. Her eyes glow red for a moment and she beams at you before standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste good.. thank you for feeding me\", she kisses your cheek before heading into your bedroom and getting comfortable, leaving you stunned at the incredible head you just got.

As you walk back home the urge to read the book is getting more and more intense until finally you can't wait any more.

As the fire fades your lust is replaced by fear. While her body is striking, so too are the razor sharp horns emerging from the top of her head and the forked tail which sways lazily behind her. Bright yellow eyes and red skin complete the look of this woman. She is dressed in ancient, scaled armor which somehow has been designed to flaunt her body as well as protect her.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">When buying an arcane looking book at a book sale, Tom unintentionally unleashes a succubus bound to him. Or so he assumes. However life with a succubus is not all he dreams it to be. Constant feeding of lust is required to satiate a succubus's appetite. Undesirable outcomes may occur if your succubus is left to grow hungry for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom lives by himself in a city apartment. The nightlife of the city is vibrant with many colorful people travelling from all over the world. Working as a receptionist for a legal firm also exposes him to many interesting people, however limits his capacity to travel somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to broaden his mind he explores a local book sale and stumbles across an arcane book. In opening it, he as inadvertently unleashed a succubus into his life. When released into the world, succubi are bound by contract to the one who release them from the book. There may be a way to re-seal a succubus into their book however none will willingly tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Succubus Contract<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen released from their respective books, a succubus is immediately entered into a soul binding contract with the one who freed them. The rules of the contract are as follows;<br>\r\n- A succubus can never deliberately kill, or otherwise place their contract, their family or their friends in harms way<br>\r\n- A succubus is never able to deliberately reveal their true nature to another human without prior approval from their contract<br>\r\n- A succubus is not required to have sex with their contract, however there will be an enhanced attraction to their contract<br>\r\n- A succubus who is asked to perform a reasonable favor for their contract, within their abilities, will be adequately compensated with lust as payment. If a succubus's contract does not adhere to the payment of lust, a succubus is able to use their abilities to take it from them  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Succubi </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith:<br>\r\nA generally playful, flirty and overall harmless succubus, content with feeding in accordance with what Tom allows. If left too long however, she is prone to take matters into her own hands until her hunger is satiated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMezelin:<br>\r\nA more assertive and mischievous succubus who occasionally listens to what Tom wants, however will often do what she feels is right to get Tom out of his shell, whatever way she sees fit. Hunger tends to make her feel abandoned and leads to minor, vengeful actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThelsea:<br>\r\nA succubus who is not at all happy at her current circumstances. Will only obey Tom when need be due to the contract signed upon releasing her. Any opportunity Thelsea will wreak havoc in Tom's life regardless of how frequently she feeds. Best not to let her go hungry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Succubus Powers<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Possession (victim awareness of the actions they take while possessed is determined by the possessor)<br>\r\n- Mind Control (victim is unaware of the actions they are made to take)<br>\r\n- Body Control (victim is very aware of the actions they are made to take yet unable to stop them, unless via magical intervention)<br>\r\n- Lust Control (victim is made to be very aroused, either towards specific target or simply in general)<br>\r\n- Flight (succubi with wings have the ability to fly, however are unable to outside of the city unless permission is given by their contract)<br>\r\n- Disguise/ Invisibility (succubi elicit alarm from humans, to blend in succubi may go invisible, or alter their form to be less demonic)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Succubus Hunger</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccubi are constantly hungry so please consider this when writing chapters. Most succubi begin to feel the effects of hunger 3 days without feeding on lust, progressively getting more intense until 10 days without lust. Once the 10 day mark has been reached, a succubus must feed immediately or die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nature of a succubus's lust is complex, the same way lust is earned one day may not satiate a succubus's lust the following. Novel and spontaneous sexual encounters are safest for reliably feeding a succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease have a clock at the top left of the page indicating how long it has been since the succubus has fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't be afraid to add, however please try to follow the established personalities of the succubi, unless there is narrative sense for this to change.<br>\r\nPlease keep all sexual participants equal to or above the age of 18.<br>\r\nGo nuts, have fun!</td>",
