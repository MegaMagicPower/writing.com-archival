As she looked around there was Star Lab staffs, holstering their advanced fire extinguisher to fight the flames. But shockingly, their attempt was fruitless as the blaze didn't decrease in volume. \"Oh no, Help, Help!\" cried a staff which triggered your heroic instinct to propel yourself to fly forward, through the blaze and grab the cornered staff. <i>\"Ow it really burns.\"</i> the flame's properties are something else, the burn on your amazon skin require you to be more cautious and on guard of what's next. \"Thank you Wonder Woman.\" the rescued staff said weakly, which made you smile and strengthen your muscles up, ignoring the pain on your scorched skin. \"Somethings wrong here.\" she said as she focused around the specified zones, where the sprinklers are. Your eyes widen, knowing that this is a sabotage as it didn't went on to put out the spreading fire around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick on your planning, you tried finding another source of water. From the toilet, which one happened to be behind you. <i>\"Great Hera, the fire's spreading quicker than I anticipated.\" </i>You said, after turning to see the fire one last time. You immediately flied towards it, crashed the toilet's hard-steel door as you fly into it, send it flying inside. To your surprise, however, the door was stopped on its tracks before hitting the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(slow claps) \"As I expected...\" someone was heard from behind the stopped door, the voice seemed familiar. <i>This must be about revenge</i> you thought, not the first time this happened to you in a lifetime. <i>If revenge it is, the sabotage of Star Labs must had a bigger threat behind it</i>. You raised your bracelet-worn fist and holster your lasso with your right hand, preparing against whoever came out behind the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Who and from whose rogue gallery did she faced?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>----Batman's POV----</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your damaged batsuit and low on batarangs and empty gadgets. You needed to change and resupply at the Batcave before continuing patrol, never thought the Joker would went this far. Before, he's reported on broke into the Arkham Asylum. <i>Why did he went back home</i> you muttered but it is the Joker, his major damage was not to be questioned. As the police formed a quarantine line, you head on in with some of the GCPD Gordon sent. He sat at the reception table, letting out that eerie grin which meant his plan was in place. Suddenly you saw green smoke coming out of the ventilation, a small inhale made you dizzy before you put on your gas mask. The GCPD that went in with you went so lucky as they succumbed and fell, which left only the Joker standing and you dazed fighting the gas virus. It got harder as it went on, the laughing sound got louder, started from him then enforced by the inmates and even the fallen police unit. He turned everyone there against you. You fought your every breath, getting yourself focused while facing off the infected. It went on for hours, your signal for backup was not responded. Eventually you won, the Joker got away in the middle of the onslaught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered on the others, why they're not responding to your call for backup. Every time you call their answer was occupied, seemed like sabotage. As you're heading back you received a message from Catwoman, its been a while. Last time you met her was when you're together, but in the end she let you go. She sent you the coordinate of her location, you walked your bruised hard leg to the Batmobile and drove. You ended up on an empty building, casual Selina. She usually sat by the roof so you use the grapple gun to propel upward, but this time she wasn't there. (Thud!) Suddenly the roof you standed on was shaken, <i>What's in this building?</i> you inquired. You enter the skylight and landed on the building's top floor, based on the view on the multitude of floors on your side downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I hoped.\" Your immediate sight when stooded up was seeing Diana / Wonder Woman, her toned skin slightly scorched and her armor blackened. \"Diana?\" you asked, but she ran and hugged your battered body. \"I thought I lost you.\" she said and then stared deep to your eyes. You saw her face with her eyes dropping tears seeing you, its getting strange as she held her toned dainty hand onto your punctured chestplate. The eyes, there's something different about it, <b>her teary pupil's green.</b> You immediately jumped back, your visual memory and the Justice League database noted that <b>her pupil color's supposed to be blue</b> \"Who are you, what have you done with Wonder Woman.\" You questioned the 'Wonder Woman' in front of you. She wiped the tear in her eye and tried reasoning with you, but judging from today's event you stand guard. <b>\"Bruce, I'm... Selina.\" she said</b>, \"Recognize this?\" and hold out Catwoman's whip with claws on her fingernail you saw from a distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then wrap her hands with the Lasso of Truth and threw you the other end. \"The Lasso compelled you to tell the truth, who are you and what happened to you?\" you asked sternly. You stand by to listen, \"My name is Selina Kyle.\" Diana replied, she then told you that had been infiltrating a villainous organization led by Lex Luthor. He planned to ambush every heroes today with his accomplice consisted of every villain of the Justice League heroes. She was sent with Wonder Woman's villain Cheetah to beat her in Star Labs. As the fire event were set and in motion, she crossed Cheetah. She won but didn't came through well, her legs were broken and back aching. Around the lab she came through a device that could transform her battered body into something called electron-conscious. She laid in wait in one last active water source which she will be heading towards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>----Flashback to the Star Lab Fire----</b><br>\r\n\"Catwoman...\" Diana said then immediately wrap her with the Lasso, even though Selina can't really do anything with in her current state.\" Diana then pull a toilet out, when water burst out, confirming her suspicion she flew out to where the wildfire at and moments later came back scorched all around her which she didn't seem to mind. She came with a large hose which she inserted onto the crack and began watering the flames surrounding her. After that's done she went back and interrogated Selina, compelled to the truth Selina told every detail of her purpose here.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh Selina, I never thought you'd do such a thing... for that I respect you for daring to face my feral foe the Cheetah.\" Diana sympathized with the broken-bodied Catwoman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah princess you're welcome, and um could you do something about this.\" Selina nodded at her damaged body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes surely, I will take you to Themyscira, you'll be back fit in no time.\" Diana bent down to lift Selina up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well healing could come later, for now I need.\" Selina panted, feeling the broken bones of her body taken her toll, the continued \"Your body....\" She activated her electro-consciousness form and slide into the amazonian goddess. Diana jolted as her body went numb and fell down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wh-why?\"</i> Diana asked subconsciously, questioning helplessly as she's losing control and consciousness of herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry but Lex Luthor won't let this betrayal go unpunished so, and I really need to warn Bruce now while finding somewhere secure, really secure..........I mean....\" Selina replied as she progressively felt more in control. she then stood up and looked in the mirror, now with her reflection replaced with Diana's face with her piercing jade eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Back to Now, Batman's POV---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Who could touch an amazon warrior and got unscathed.\" Selina said with Diana's sultry voice, her toned body now following Selina's thoughts. She held up her palm now able to grow claws on Diana's manicured fingernail. \"What happens to Diana?\" you asked, concerned of your teammate's wellbeing. Diana isn't just a teammate, she was like a sister you never had, with those kindness and hope reaching out to you in your darkest times. \"She's save in here, though unaware of what's happening now.\" Selina pointed at beneath her tiara assuring you. Looking at your sister-like teammate, Diana, her body wounded from that fire now standing face-to-face with you seeing through you with Selina's emerald eyes. Being with Selina again was what you wanted, she proved herself to be a trustworthy ally and the one who could really understand you after all that scams she pulled and gained your admiration. Asking her to leave Diana might injure her further, she's being hunted by Luthor and you wouldn't want to see her be gone for good. But this electro-consciousness, you remembered that it was still on prototype stage. What if Selina was stuck as Diana forever. </span></div></div>",
