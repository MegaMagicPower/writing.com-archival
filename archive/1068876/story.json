At the end he'd wake up squint blearily at the clock then doze off and the whole thing would repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was outside and his thoughts seemed to come fom elsewhere. THey were telling him things, about himself and the nature of reality. All the secrets of creation were being explained to him if he could just remember!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him, the air seemed to smolder and melt, asthough the world was a photograph and a giant hand held a flame behind it. Black holes formed, framed in running black plastic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, do this. With your mind. It isn't difficult if you only REMEMBER\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't see what was beyond the holes. His thoughts, from wherever they came raced, endless knowledge.

Not lacing them.... no time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in his living room, at the site of an old dream. There had been a doorway in the wall, behind the sofa. He climbed onto the cushions and reached out. He knew. Not belief, but knowledge, which was different. The boundry between worlds was an illusion and all he had to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was strangely calm as he reached his hand through the solid wall. It was here.

There was a lack of undergrowth but the trees... were strange; unlike anything he's ever heard of, let alone seen. Great trunks were green not brown and many had bristles. Leaves were immense like something of some unknown jungle. Overhead vast leaves the size of car parks cast shadow over the path. Some trees had massive trunks bigger than any building but off-white and topped by fungus like caps, others had think trunks topped by towering green blades which swayed in some impossible wind high above.<br>\r\nThe terrain was mountainous and huge peaks rose all around. The familiar sounds of insects and birds were replaced by alien sounds unlike anything he'd heard before. The road to the city was relatively straight and he could see it but not yet clearly. Sometimes he was startled as huge creatures the size of rhinos flew overhead with helicopter noise of huge buzzing wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was nowhere on Earth, unless it was the prehistoric era of dinosaurs and giant insects. But there were no cities then. Was this another world? Another reality, even?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was approaching. It made a thunderous noise on the road.

All around creatures run about. Alien creatures! Scared but curious went to investigate. They were man-sized just about but impossibly strange. They ran on all fours with long slender legs... but six legs! They were like huge insects. Their heads were smooth with strange dark eyes and their black bodies segmented each part reflecting the light in strange ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he called out to one of the creatures. It (she?) was terrifying to begin with but now seemed graceful and beautiful as she moved lithely across what looked like vast moss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" she called and the words appeared in his mind. Telepathy! \"Who are you and where do you from? I am Issa.\"  She had mandibles and antenna protruding from her head.

We are the sisters of dream and you are invited to The City of Dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlla motioned behind her and he saw again the hill, now recognising it to be man- or ant- made, a vast mound over a hundred feet high crafted with bizarre architecture and designs and swarming with these strange beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't you come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee was confused and more than a little afraid.

On a strange world surrounded by aliens and who knew if he could even get home? He felt a more than a little trepidacious about that but he couldn't not go! As he approached Dream they passed outbuildings and crowds of Ulla's incredible people. The architecture was unlike anything he had ever seen. Rather than simply building and then decorating it they seemed to treat the structure as a work of art. It was functional and beautiful at once but even so many surfaces were carved or painted with images and stylised writing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlla explained \"To build is divine! It helps them us understand the mastery of the Architect of All who made the world. We work with the geometry of language and and every structure corrasponds to the thoughts and dreams of the Sisters of Dream. We build as we live. We record our thoughts and hopes and dreams. This is all our poetry, our art. It is us.\" <br>\r\nUlla moved her foreparts up briefly moving her front legs and Lee felt a surge of happiness.
