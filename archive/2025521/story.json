            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been another boring Friday, crummy lunch food and immature students at college. That and your boring curriculum as well.. God the spice of life was fading away you thought, which was sad considering you were only 19. It can't be helped, this is life you thought. At least you had gotten to see your Girlfriend Allison. Note to self don't call her by her full first name anymore. She preferred Alli, a nickname sorta her sister and mom gave her she explained today in the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just trudged along the sidewalk to home, you didn't need to drive since college was only a block or so away. You sighed, looking up in the sky thinking how you wish life would be more interesting for you. Tonight you'd probably end up eating a microwave dinner while your bitchy sister Laurie complained to you about the other girls in high school. She was a senior and next year would be joining you at college.. yay. Then your mother, who had been raising you two since 7 years ago when your father left. She would probably just be shut in her bedroom with a glass of wine. Such was the weekend life. Alli was suppose to come over later tonight hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As your walked continued you couldn't help but notice a flickering shine across the street from under a tree, it was really bugging you so you walked across to see what the hell it was. Just a ring Huh? But it looks kinda.. high tech? Whatever might as well grab it you thought before snatching it up and putting it on your finger. It actually fit quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your attention returned to getting home, which a minute later you were. You entered your house, walking past the living room entrance hearing the chatter of Laurie on the phone with her friend you guessed, probably gossiping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Laurie.. i'm home, did I get any mail? And where's mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie just held the phone away from her mouth to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold and Christine.. hey Jake, no mail and mom us out, she said she'd either be back late tonight or tomorrow morning. My guess.. a date.\" She said before returning to her phone conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh.. well thanks\" you said unenthusiastically before walking upstairs to your bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah come over at like 7 and..\" Laurie was saying, before you couldn't hear her as you entered your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tossed down your backpack and just laid back in bed staring at your ceiling, looking at the ring on your finger. This ring looked like it was out of a sci-fi movie or something. You just sighed again thinking..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Little did you know your life was about to get very interesting because of that ring..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *choose what you'd like the ring to do *</span></div></div>",

Whatever I'm gonna nap before Alli gets over here you thought. You laid in bed for awhile and before you knew it you had fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n During your sleep you tended to shift positions. Your hand with the ring hit the corner of your dresser hitting what you thought was a dial but whats actually a switch button. The ring made a click noise and glowed a bright red, then some red mist poured from the strange ring and entered your mouth which was open from snoring. You slept unphased.. but in your dream things became quite different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *Jakes Dream*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh.. my head why does it hurt.. huh.. where am I?\" You looked around in a empty space, void of color except for a red mist that was a ways off. You started walking that direction to the mist. When you entered it felt weird around you, your body felt numb almost but you were moving through it just fine. \"What is this shit..\" you mumbled as you passed through it. Suddenly everything around you just shifted. You panicked, slumping to the ground as everything slowed to a new scene. You were in your living room, and your sister Laurie was just on the couch still talking onto the phone with her friend. But you couldn't hear anything, like your ears were on mute. You walked over to her trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" HEY! Laurie? Helloooo...\" you said right next to her, but she just continued talking as if you weren't there. God you must be having a nightmare you thought.. the most realistic one you had ever had though. You tried shaking your sister but found your hands passed right through her, that odd red mist appearing where you tried shaking her. Yup.. I'm totally insane or dreaming you thought. You tried pulling your hands away but you found you were stuck.. what the? Almost immediately you felt yourself be pulled into your sister before everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*In the Living Room with Laurie *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie? Hellooo, girl you there..\" Christine asked over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Laurie opened her eyes slowly, her iris's glowing red before she spoke. \"Hey lemme call you back. Something came up\". She hung up immediately and sat up and stood looking down at herself. She seemed strange. She simply turned with a smile on her face and started walking upstairs to Jake's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laurie headed upstairs to the bedroom, her feet loud on the stairs. It was a weird sensation for Jake, the bouncing from his chest with each thumping impact was scary and unfamiliar. Each, every movement sending her bust rippling. Worse than the constant reminder of his new gender, was that damned bra. It pinched, and squeezed awkwardly, and did nothing to control... the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nervousness slowed her at the upstairs landing. Walking towards his bedroom the carpet muffled her footsteps. Turning the handle silently, thoughts of horror movies raced through her mind, as she braced herself for a jump scare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspecting she... he was just going to wake up, she opened the door, looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmh.\" she grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, she walked over to Jake's body. It was odd seeing it from the outside, his chest rising and falling slowly as he slept. Looking at his own chest, the movement was more visible, already he felt like he was on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, time to wake up...\" her words spoken, weren't loud enough to wake Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seeing something she leaned closer. Lowering her voice, she spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Laurie...\" it was barely more than a whisper. A smile forming at hearing Laurie's voice calling out for Laurie herself. But she definitely saw it this time, even in his sleep, they moved silently forming those same words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out a hand to shake ... himself ... awake, he became fascinated by his slender hand. The decorative nail polish, turning her wrist this way and that, she confirmed this felt as real, as... as the waking world.</span></div></div>",

I'm not Laurie man, I'm you. You remember, the ring?\" She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you are truly me then tell me, where exactly did I find this ring Laurie?\" You asked, figuring you would humor her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just sighed standing up and answered \"Under the tree on your way home\" as she broke into a fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What's going on..\" you said quietly staring at Laurie who felt herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down and I'll explain\" she said, as she finally calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Okay, so that ring you found today isn't just a normal fancy ring. It's responsible for.. well.. this!\" She grinned as she cupped her boobs in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you fell asleep you hit the button on that ring because of our damn clumsy sleeping habits, and it was the activation button.

Call me a clone or your sister, I don't care, because all I know is that Laurie isn't around anymore in here \" she finished grinning pointing to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wait.. what? Did I kill her?!\" You asked, slightly concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.. I wouldn't say kill.. but I have her memories and personality, all of it! Think of it like this, you simply placed a copy of yourself inside of Laurie and your side is the dominant one inside her.\" she smiled. \"Don't worry, I'll live her life just the way she did, but personally I think we've improved her don't you? I mean with this, we could have a cooler sister who could be just as cool to hang out with.  You barely got along as it was and she always complained to you, this would be so much better\" she said reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically she was right.. you two had a damaged relationship as siblings. You always fought and she was annoying you most the time.. but did that warrant all this? You looked at what was once your sister.  Your clone told you it would be better.. maybe it would be.. as you continue to wrap your head around what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well I've decided that this could be kind of cool for a day or two.

I can prove it. Remember when you were with your ex Jenny, and you went out to that lovely restaurant where the waiter kept hitting on her in front of you? Wasn't that the night you both broke up? Do you believe now? \" she finished as she got closer to you smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not notice because you were in a stupor.. there's no way Laurie could know that.. he hadn't even spilt the beans to his family until a week after it happened.. which meant..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you're accepting the fact that I'm telling the truth bud\" she grinned pushing you back into the bed and climbing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So.. you're me.. in there?\" You weakly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mhmm.

I know you have had the hots since our sister started maturing\" she giggled as she stroked your cock. \"Together we'll find out what more of that ring does and figure things out.\" She finished with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You played back, letting her have her way with you as you moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Little did you know that your clone was the evil side of your mind.

I have to remember that. You leaned up and pulled your shorts and boxers up as the clone in Laurie.. who you'd have to just refer as Laurie still you guess.. finished slipping on her pencil skirt and blank spaghetti strap tanktop. She was really attractive you thought..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm I think I make a better Laurie don't you?\" She giggled to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.. yeah..\" you just mumbled still at a loss for words. You looked down at the ring to notice it missing from your hand! \"Uhh.. where's the ring?\" You asked before Laurie twirled around you and showed you her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here buddy, don't worry, I'll give it back but I had an idea first\" said grinning as she started leaving the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't think that's a good..\" but your words were cut off by the sound of the doorbell. You looked at your bedroom clock to see it was 7:00pm. You then looked back to see Laurie rushing downstairs to open it. Crap.. well if he's just me I'll get it back later you thought as you started cleaning up the bedroom in case anyone saw it's current messy state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *Laurie's POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled evily knowing who was at the door and because you grabbed the ring. You knew a lot more about it than you thought at first. Your guess was because of that red mist. It must have given you the knowledge. You opened the door to.see Christine in front of you. Damn she was hot. She had come dressed in a skirt as well, after all you both planned to go out to that party in matching outfits. She was 5'7 with dirty blonde hair that was long and perfectly tanned skin. She had brown eyes and cute pouty lips and a soft chin, butbelow the neck was even better. 2 DD titties and a sexy waist that exaggerated her luscious ass.. she was quite the damsel. You held back a evil grin and put on your friendly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Christine, right on time. Come in I still gotta get a few things done before we go\" you said mimicking Laurie's innocent voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Always a procrastinator eh Laurie?\" She said giggling as she came in and sat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'll be down in just a minute ok?\" You said before rushing upstairs to Jake's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you entered the bedroom he turned to look at you only to see a evil and devious smile on your face as you aimed the ring on your hand in his direction. You hit the 2nd switch button on it and a red mist shot out at him and he just blacked out onto the floor with a thump. Christine called up to you from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Everything ok up there?!\" She yelled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh yesss, everything is perfect\" you said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You turned and headed back downstairs to your unsuspecting friend and from behind her, aimed the ring at her and hitting the 2nd switch button again. As  the mist shot out at her and enveloped her she started convulsing on the couch, much like you did when Jake accidentally put you in Laurie. Slowly she passed out and you clicked the first switch on the ring.. and you began to feel your mind wander.. searching for Jake's upstairs. You grinned finding it and just started copying your current mind into it. Jake was a nice guy, but as his alter ego you had no qualms with taking the driver seat from him. Life would be a lot more fun this way. As you finished creating a duplicate in the original Jake you opened your eyes to see Christine waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Jake's POV *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oweee.. my head feels funny\" you said as you woke up. All you remembered was Laurie aiming the ring at you.. and then.. wait a minute something isn't right. You opened your eyes to see blond locks of hair in front of them and looking down you saw two huge mounds on your chest as well as slender legs and a pencil skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my god what.. eep!\" You stopped hearing a womans voice but not your own. You stood, feeling wobbly and looked around only to see what looked like Laurie and your body?! Moving on it's own?! How?! You thought.. this all seemed impossible.. you then looked again to see they were dragging your unconscious girlfriend Alli onto the opposing couch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" G.. guys what's going on..?!\" You stammered out in Christine's cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well I see you're finally up 'Christine' have a nice nap?\" Laurie said giggling with a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What did you do to me and how am I right there.. and st by is my girlfriend unconscious?!\" You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well I thought that would be obvious haha . I switched you into that bitch, I thought it was more suiting. Also that there is Jake.. just like how I'm Jake in Laurie that is. \" she laughed as they finished Laying Alli on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" God my girlfriend is so fucking hot.. I can't wait\" the clone in your body said out loud with a evil smile. H leaned down to rub her tits through her shirt and groped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Stop that get your hands off my..\" but you were cut off by Laurie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You mean HIS girlfriend Christine? haha you aren't in charge anymore, I am. The only reason you are still around is because you created me. But now.. I think I'll spread the fun. \" she grinned pushing you back onto the couch before straddling you. \"Now here's what's going to happen 'Christine'. I'm the new Laurie and I like it in here \" she paused to grope her tits with a smile. \" and the new Jake will live your life no problem, after all, he's you. And Alli.. well let's just say I have plans for her \" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Every ounce of your being wanted to strangle her.. but you couldn't.. because no matter how much you wanted to.. it was still your sister's body..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So here's your choices 'Christine'. Join me and share the fun, or live your life as this hot ass girl. But if you try anything funny.. I'll replace you instantly. \" She said evily as a tear rolled down your cheek. \"What will you do then hmmm?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anger, fear, frustration, sadness, and desperation, all spun in your head making logical thinking almost impossible. You couldn't let this evil-you thing in Laurie continue to spread especially if she was going to do something horrible to your girlfriend, and she obviously was regardless of you being her creator as she said. At least she hadn't corrupted you, well, maybe a bit, considering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had let your sister, or the part of you in your sister, let her play with your manhood and bring you to a much more pleasurable climax than you had ever been able to masturbate. Laurie was now offering you the possibility of a lot of great sex. The fact that you had never, ever had sex - and neither had Alli since you were both waiting for that special moment - and that you hadn't even gone beyond first base, made you wonder how long you wanted to wait and if it would be as good as what Laurie had done for you. Yeah, you loved Alli and cared about her, but all that had gotten you was horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your arousal to conclusion and doing it with Alli or any hot babe rather than alone was a sincere craving of yours. Laurie was offering, no promising that you would have non-ending delights. Of course, you may have to ignore some morals which, at least one, you had already thrown out. You wondered what unknown pleasures may be before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations that you were getting from being in Christine's body were distracting your conscience as well. The pencil skirt had your bare legs wrapped tight together so you couldn't move them, and the skimpy top exposed way more flesh than normal, for you, although quite normal for her most likely. Your hair now tickled those bare shoulders, back, arms and upper chest, although it was soft and felt nice. The weight of breasts that you never had before was new. Straps tugged over your shoulders along with the tight wrapping across your back and chest. The silky material of it was so different than your regular clothes yet tantalizing as it pressed on your nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why put me in this girl?\" you asked as you just stared down at your current cleavage, so well displayed from your new angle. <i>Great pair!</i> you immediately thought, and your male mindset sent a warm, horny feeling through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is <i>Christine</i>, dear,\" Laurie explained with a smirk. After a pause and you didn't respond, she sighed, \"Well, I guess it isn't obvious to you. Christine.\" She raised your chin with her finger so your eyes meet. Laurie's pale blue began to slowly grow reddish until she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to please the ladies and make them happy, right?\" You nodded automatically. \"Of course you do. Every red-blooded man wants and fantasizes about that. But what better way to learn how than by being a woman, right? Besides you've wanted to try it and find out what it's like, haven't you?\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded again a bit more sheepishly admitting sometimes daydreaming what it would be like. Her logic made sense, although you never thought it possible to so easily become another gender. Maybe Laurie was actually helping you. However, looking over at your male body, you saw him unbuttoning Alli's blouse and running his hand inside to grope her bare breast which reignited your anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he doing that? Make him stop,\" you demanded in Christine's sultry voice, one that sounded authoritative. Laurie just rolled her eyes. It didn't affect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, <i>Christine</i>,\" she said emphasizing the name again. \"He's just being Jake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never done that,\" you argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean <i>Jake's</i> never done that before,\" she commanded looking you in the eye, again her eyes glowing red momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she wanted you to play the part of this body you have. You'd rather not, but you'd much more rather not get her upset so that she did something you'll regret even more than letting her out and taking over your sister. So, reluctantly you restated your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I mean <i>Jake</i> has never done that before. Why is he doing it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, dear, but he's always wanted to. You know that, right?\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth always hurt, and you swallowed hard on the guilt. Sure you had previously fantasized about playing with Alli's body, the both of you getting naked and exploring each other. Watching his crude actions, though, was nothing like what you - you as Jake - would do, but you did want to know what she felt like. It's just that it was not you doing it which upset you and, perhaps, made you jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when she's unconscious. That's sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can take care of that easy enough,\" she said pointing the ring toward Alli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait. Stop!\" you cried. The last thing you wanted was Laurie to wake Alli so she found that Jake had started to strip her and was fondling her body. She would have wanted to die, and she would hold you - your old you Jake - responsible not knowing the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPure evil shown in the grin that Laurie gave you. It didn't look right on Laurie's normally angelic face. You knew there was no way you could fight her, or the soul of you that had taken her over. She had the ring and obviously knew it's powers. She had your sister. She had Jake's, er.., your - it's getting hard to keep yourself straight - girlfriend. She had put a degenerate clone of yourself into Jake's body who was about to rape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you walked away now, Laurie and Alli would be lost to this demon-part-of-you that you had released. Your only hope was to stay and try to protect the two as best you could. Maybe you'd be able to negotiate something or, at least, save Alli somehow, plus there were all those extra benefits of being part of Laurie's gang that you could enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone Jake had now completely exposed Alli's chest. He lifted her pale mounds so that her areolas and nipples seemed to be pointed right at you, staring at you. Instead of making you sick, you felt aroused. The sensation was strange in this body as your groin warmed and your nipples pushed against the silk. You fingers reached out for Alli's chest wanting to touch them, but then Laurie's laugh brought your focus back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you <i>will</i> join us?\" she grinned confidently as your eyes met hers again, this time Laurie's true blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a deep breath, the words came out in a monotone. \"Yes, but only if you make Jake stop doing that to Alli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie became thoughtful as clone Jake continued his ravaging of Alli, burying his face and mouth on her chest. This provoked your emotions fueling both arousal and frustration. You squirmed wanting to throw Laurie off and go pull Jake away - pull him away so you can feel her breasts with the hands and face you have, but you couldn't move. It was as if Laurie had tied you to the couch. Your helplessness drove your desire for Alli even more to both protect and have her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your panicked mind had you desperate, Laurie turned to you. The grin now looked even more evil than any of the previous, but she spoke sweetly knowing she had you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we can make a deal. All you have to do is swear that you'll . . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look back at her, a frown on your face. You avert your gaze downward, but only see the lovely cleavage of your gorgeous new body, slightly covered by the long blonde hair that fell from your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in defeat, feeling yourself get even more turned on as you looked at what your body had to offer you. If only you were free from whatever your corrupt clone had done to you. If you could move, you'd be groping your chest, pleasuring yourself, and having the time of your life, all at the expense of Christine, who's true soul was who-knows-where along with the real Laurie's. As much as you hated admitting it, part of you was genuinely grateful to evil-Laurie for giving you this incredible opportunity. You had always wanted the chance to explore a drop-dead-gorgeous girl and now you had one all to yourself. In fact, you WERE one now. Not only that, but this experience probably would teach you how t better yourself as a male and please woman, which was something you desperately wanted, as your clone in Laurie had already pointed out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath in and out, watching your breasts rise and fall, as you think more about your situation. You did know that Laurie was powerful, and you also knew that you had next to no chance of getting the ring from her. If you didn't give in to her demand and help her with whatever she had in mind, then she could certainly make you help her if she really wanted to. On top of that, the clone of her in Jake....no, <i>your</i> body, was still getting ready to violate Alli in a way that you would have never wished upon her. That was your deciding point. If only for Alli's sake, you would agree to help Laurie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to gain as much confidence as you can as you look up into Laurie's eyes. \"Alright, you monster. You win. I agree to help you with whatever plans you have. This way, I'll at least get to have some fun in my situation\" you say, watching as Laurie's demonic grin gets bigger. \"But make Jake stop that. He's NOT going to violate my girlfriend like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie chuckles a bit as she turns to look at Jake. She looked back at you quickly, as if mentally debating something in her mind briefly. \"Alright, <i>Christine</i>\" she said with a triumphant tone in her voice, \"I'll call Jake off\" she said, pointing the ring at your former body. He suddenly collapsed to the ground unconscious as black smoke was forced out from his mouth and into the ring on Laurie's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" You said, breathing a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. What are best friends for?\" She asked with a chuckle. for all intents and purposes, the real Laurie and Christine were out of the picture, leaving you two as the only ones. For a second, you were going to laugh too, until you saw Laurie point her ring at you. \"Now, let's discuss my plans, <i>Christine</i>\" she says, eyes glowing red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wished that you had control of your body other than talking and breathing, but for now you couldn't do anything. You were completely at the mercy of your clone, and that grin on Laurie's face told you she knew that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's discuss my plans, Christine\" she says with a chuckle. She motions to the ring in her hand. \"This ring can control people's souls, Christine. That's how it works. As the first creation of the ring, I have knowledge of exactly how it works. I'm telling you that so you know not to try to play hero, because I can make you very, very miserable. Or, I can make you very very corrupt and like me, or anything else that I want....so don't funk with me unless I tell you to funk me. Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, letting her know that you understood. As much as you wanted to personally put an end to this, you realized how out of your control this situation really was. Laurie smiles as she continues, \"As someone who might as well be a god...well, goddess as long as I'm in a female body, I have some very big plans, but we're going to start nice and small. I'm patient and there's no rush for what I have in mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you have in mind?\" You ask curiosly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my little secret, Christine. But trust me, you'll be able to help quite a lot\" she says with a grin on her face. \"Once your parents come back, I'm going to take over the rest of my family completely. I'll either make clones of myself or corrupt their souls to do it, or maybe I'll be more creative. We') see. Whatever the case is, this house will become my palace and I shall be it's undisputed ruler. Everyone and everything in it will be serving me and believe me when I say there will be a LOT of sex. You'll be a big help with that, especially with your lovely body, Christine\" she says, locking her lips. You wanted to just get up right now and punch her across the face, but you still couldn't move. You just had to watch and listen as she continued. \"Alli is going to be a part of that too, Christine. Your part of the deal was that JAKE couldn't do anything to her, but you didn't say anything about me....or you\"she said with a wink. You just clench your teeth in anger and look at Alli's sleeping body. You didn't want anything bad to happen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning for her?\" You ask, trying to hide your anger, but failing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie chuckles again. \"Wouldn't you like to know, Christine? Unfortunately for you, I'm not quite ready to share that yet, but clearly you're uncooperative so I'll put a new deal on the table. Option 1 is that you stay as Christine and let me have my fun. You'll be helping me with my plans and getting in on our fun, but you'll still be going to school as Christine, living her life and having all her money. Not that you would know, but her family is loaded. You'll have a very fun life and I will make sure you know how to live as Christine, even better than she did. Option two is as follows. I'll use my ring and yank your soul out of Christines body. I'll make you Alli.  That way, you can personally make sure that I don't do anything to her that you wouldn't want done. However, you will be an active part of my plan and I will do everything in my power to indoctrinate you into my way of thinking. Maybe you'll be strong enough to remember who you are, or maybe you'll fade away into me, or into Alli. Maybe even some combination. That all depends on you. For full disclosure, I'll be having some mental fun with you no matter what you cjoose, but I'm offering you a way to keep Alli safe and happy at least in body. What Lloyd it be, Christine?\" </span></div></div>",

You grit your teeth tightly and reluctantly answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'll stay as Christine.. just promise no harm will come to my Girlfriend, or I swear I'll..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll WHAT?

You turned smirking and eyed Alli and Jakes lifeless body slumped on the couch, you grinned deviously in Laurie's body and had ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I did promise not to harm the body of Alli.. but I said nothing about what I put in it.. or her soul\" you laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Holding the ring you decide to..</span></div></div>",

The bodies that had once belonged to Jake and Alli were both on the bed, with Jake's body appearing to be passed out on top of Alli's. Christine's body, which would be worn by the original Jake for the foreseeable future was still sitting where she had been for the past few minutes, staring straight ahead like a robot. You thought about how empty all of them were. Their eyes open and breathing, but they did not have any mind or memories to make them do anything besides what they needed to stay alive. You took a moment to ponder whether they were more dead or alive and then decided that you didn't care. These shells would certainly not stay like this for long. You would be making use of each of them, but you didn't want them to be so disorganized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeezed yourself between Christine's body and the wall and wrapped your arms around her waste, getting a good grip so that you could lift her up and pull her onto the bed. She felt very heavy since you were using Laurie's weak body, but eventually you were able to lay her on the bed, next to the bodies of Jake and Alli, which you pulled apart from each other. Once your physical work was done, you look down at the three bodies. Your plan was to get out all of those dark desires that the old Jake had given so much effort to hide away. you were the embodiment of all of his darkest drives. Ultimately, your only purpose in life was to feed your desire for sex and power, and while Laurie's body was nice and you would always have a thing for your first body, you knew that it wouldn't help you much in those respects, at least compared to the other options in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine's body might objectively be the best looking of the three. She was Laurie's age, with long blond hair and the type of body that successful models put in a lot of work to get. Her boobs and ass were to die for, and you knew that the original Jake had many fantasies of having his way with her. Of course, he would never admit to that, being too 'in love' with Alli. It was a shame that you couldn't move yourself into her sexy skin, but you had promised her to your original. It was the least that you could do for him, seeing how he would soon be your most important tool. Christine's family was filthy rich, so she would be able to get you funding to do other things that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, you didn't want to have Jake's old body. Evil distortion or not, you were still Jake in some way so you had grown up your whole life with his body. It was boring for you and would do nothing besides give you a cock to play with. You'd probably just fill his body with that clone from before. The old Jake would have had no way of knowing this, but the soul in his body that was getting ready to violate Alli's body had once BEEN Alli. You lick your lips and giggle, remembering how you had tricked Laurie into coming over while Jake was knocked out. Pretending to be Laurie, you wasted no time, bringing her upstairs to show her what you had done. The horrified Alli didn't know what hit her when you stole her soul out of her body and brought it into the ring. Once inside, you took your time corrupting her and breaking her, molding her into a new being that was just as twisted as you and would serve you completely before you woke up Jake-in-Christine. You kiss the ring, knowing that the former Alli was in it right now, waiting to come back out and play. It turned out that her darkest desires were actually being Jake and having his cock at her disposal, so she would be returning to that body, living as a new Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, that left only Alli's body in question. It had been blissfully empty since you took her soul into the ring. You felt Laurie's crotch getting wet as you fantasized about all of the things that you could do with her body. she was soooooo hot. You wanted to parade her around like a trophy, dressing her like the slut she would be and using her to attract new bodies to add to your collection, while banging everyone you could get your hands on. Mmmm, that would be funnnnnn. From a practical point of view, there was reason to get her as well. Like Christine, she did not live in this house, which meant you had more options of people and more potential bases to operate out of. You could very easily take her sexy body for yourself and let the old Alli rule this house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that would be the best idea. You'd fulfill your own fantasy of being Alli, while allowing Jake to be Christine, and letting your corrupted Alli be Jake. That way, everyone was a winner in some way...well, except for Laurie and Christine. Laurie was gone forever, and there was nothing that you could do about that, even if you wanted to. You had completely override her spirit when you took her body from her that first time. Christine's soul was also trapped in the ring right now, completely oblivious to it's situation. She had been untouched, and was still completely herself, like the old Jake. The only option for her would be putting her into Laurie's body after you left it, which was reasonable. Christine had been Laurie's best friend, which means that she would get to keep Laurie alive in some way by being in it. That settled it for you. Christine would become Laurie, You would become Alli, Alli would become Jake, and Jake would become Christine. A complete circle with everyone getting something out of it. Of course, Jake and Christine still had to be 'indoctrinated' into your way of thinking. That was a simple matter though. The ring gave you complete control over their souls. As long as they were inside of the ring, you could make them think whatever you want. You could control their morality, memories, personality, anything you wanted. Their souls were like putty in your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sure you'd be getting both of them to your way of thinking in time, but for now you might as well focus on what was in front of you. You look down at Alli's unconscious body. She was wearing blue skinny jeans and a pink tee-shirt, that was a little too loose to really show off her curves. You knw from your time corrupting her original self that she did that purposely, not wanting other guys to be as attracted to her. She really saw you...well, Jake, as her one and only. the idea was cute, though not something that you liked. You wanted her showing off her skin and getting guys horny and girls jealous. Rile people up. That would just give you more options. You lick your lips and rub Laurie's pussy through her yoga pants. Ugh, you couldn't take this anymore. You wanted to be that sexy thing soooo badly. You point the ring at her empty body and concentrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision goes black as you feel Laurie's body start to gag. You open Laurie's mouth and suddenly feel yourself leaving Laurie's body and flying forward, into Alli's mouth, which was just a little open. You squeeze yourself into her mouth and down her throat as your smoky body expands inside of her, filling her up. You feel yourself shaking as you take the pilot's seat. You feel her legs shaking first, followed by her arms. After that you feel her chest and ass. You feel yourself breathing and the weight of your breathes as you take those deep breaths. They were so much bigger and fuller than Laurie's. Then finally, you feel the long dark brown hair falling down your back. You feel yourself coughing as your body tried to unconsciously fight out the invading presence. Then you open your new eyes, seeing the world so much more clearly without the need for Laurie's glasses. Slowly, you sit up and let your breathing slow down as your new body's fight-or-flight reaction dies down, realizing that everything was okay. You stand up off the bed, and look down at yourself. You grab your boobs, and give them a nice hard squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh yessss!!!!!\" You exclaim, hearing Alli's sexy voice coming from your mouth. \"This is sooooo fantastic! It's just what I've always fantasized about!!!\" you exclaim as you do a twirl, loving your new sense of balance that had come with Alli's muscle memories from being a dancer. This felt so good. You knew that upgrading to her would be a good idea. Then you look down at Laurie;s now empty body. \"Well, I guess I can stop thinking of myself as you now....even though I'll always have your soul\" you say, kneeling down over her and gently pulling the ring off of her finger and putting it onto your own. Your eyes glow red briefly as you feel your connection to the ring reestablish. You feel the souls in the ring and then look at the sleeping bodies again. the OLD Alli was already in your power so she could wait. Right now you had to prepare either Christine or Jake. You look over both Christine's body and Laurie's as you think about what would be best. There were so many options with both of them. You take a deep breath and....</span></div></div>",

Its time to enjoy your new body\" you whispered in his ear grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.. ahhh.. oh my.. my voice.. my body.. i'm in Jake now Huh?\" She asked from his male voice to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yes you are, a fine and ironic fit don't you think? I figured you would like to fool around in there and experience what having a cock was like, being more masculine.. fucking girls\" you smirked deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I would love that 'Alli'. Tell me.. do you enjoy my body. I was always so kind to it, keeping it fit. I bet my tits get you horny just touching them!\" the new Jake said sharing your same smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm hell yesss I do.. this sexy body will do wonderful for my plans. I wonder how long until you realize that she's been altered\" you winked with a hidden message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Knowingly Jake grinned and rubbed his cock. \"Oh she knows.. I'm changing her as we speak.. she's quite flustered\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *****************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*In the Mind*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ow.. my head.. it feels like I'm being squished inside. Huh.. why can't I move my body.. my hands.. holy shit why do I have a dick?!' Alli screamed to herself in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Finally awake I see, just in time for the change\" a voice rang out sounding exactly like Alli's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who.. who are you?! Why can't I move.. why do I have a penis?!' Alli stammered out in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Haha.. well I'm you actually.. the NEW you! I'm everything that you kept inside and all the deep dark desires you wouldn't act on. I'm you.. but better' the Alli imposter spoke with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I.. I don't believe you.. just wake up Alli.. wake up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Awwwwe.. honey this is no dream. I'm just taking the best parts of you into memory before we merge. Sadly for you I'll be the only one left around to think.. you'll kinda just go.. well poof!' She giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why.. why can't I wake up.. just wake up..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Shhhh.. just sleep into nothing Alli, i'll take could care of our life.. and i'll make sure Jake gets what he wants.. in body and mind.' She said deviously while Alli wept mentally as she witnessed her own body before her through Jake's eyes, watching her body smiling and rubbing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cloned then proceeded to absorb Alli and her memory while she cried and was weak minded. Her voice faded into a silent sound and all that remained was the NEW Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Jake in Alli's body * <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.. alllll done!\" Jake grinned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Perfect, now that we're both like-minded we can proceed with the plans. Or would you like to get more intimate with your newest body. Trust me.. it won't be your last either\" you sexily spoke as you sat in Jake's lap grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well 'Alli' i'll let you choose\" he said grabbing your tits softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You whimpered and licked your lips as you pondered what to do..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You frown as you think over your options. You look around the room, seeing Laurie on top of you, grinning that evil grin of hers that you realized was little more than a perverted version of your own natural smile. Then you looked at your body, who had that same grin on his face. He was stripping off Alli's clothes from her body, mumbling about how much fun this was going to be. You didn't know what these two twisted clones of yourself had planned, but you had a sneaking suspicion that it wasn't a very good thing. If these two really were twisted, evil versions of you, then you knew their plans would end with evil, kinky fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears rolled down your face as you looked down, Christine's considerable cleavage blocking whatever else there was too see. Christine's body really was nice. She had long, flowing golden blonde hair, big boobs, and an ass to die for. Just the thought of living out her life, doing whatever you wanted made your new pussy wet. But you couldn't just leave this scene, could you? Laurie and your former body were about to do horrible things to your girlfriend. You knew that getting in on their fun was a terrible thing and out of the question, but could you really just walk away from all of this and still feel good about yourself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything inside of you wanted to fight against these two excuses for you, but logically you knew that was out of the question. Laurie had the ring, which immediately put you under her power. If you even lifted a finger to try to stop her plans, you would be sucked out of Christine's body and into the black limbo of the ring. Or worse. You had no idea what that ring could actually do and you certainly didn't want to find out if it meant that twisted Laurie would in charge of what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more tear dropped from your face as you moved your dainty hand to wipe it away. There was only one logical thing that could be done in this situation. Since fighting was an impossibility and joining in broke almost every moral in your body, the only answer was to just give in to Laurie's suggestion. You could go live Christine's life and not stop this. That couldn't be so bad. You'd have a sexy body, and a filthy rich family that probably loved you a lot more than your current family did. On top of that, you'd be popular for the first time in your life. You smiled from that thought. A sigh escaped your lips as yo resigned yourself to your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Laurie and smile weakly at her. \"I can't join in on this, Laurie. You of all people should know that I won't participate in something like this\" you say in Christine's musical voice. Just hearing that luscious sound coming out of your mouth made you feel better about your choice. \"If me being your creator really gets me a \"get out of jail free\" card, then I'll take it. I'll walk out of this house and live Christine's life from now on. Just don't involve me in this evil.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie grinned as she heard what you said. She moved herself off of you and looked over at your body, who had finished stripping Alli out of her clothes. He was starting to strip off his own pants, that evil grin still on his face. Laurie looked back at you and smiled. \"Alright, Christine. I'm glad to hear that you won't be putting up a fight with this. I have to say, I'm a little disappointed in you. I reallllllyy wanted you to join our kinky fun, but I guess you just don't think the same way that we do. That's fine though. I'll just hope that you see the light at some point. You'll always be welcome into this club\" she says, extending her hand. You take it in yours and smile at her. You knew that she was about to do horrible, terrible things, but you couldn't put all the blame on her. She may be twisted, dark, kinky, and evil, but she was still you. \"Oh, before you go!\" she said, holding the ring to you and pushing a button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed smoke flew out of it and into your mouth, causing you to cough. \"What the hell...\" you ask, holding your head as memories filled your brain. You saw yourself as a young girl, being spoiled and raised int eh nicest luxury. You saw a life flashing before your eyes that you knew was not yours, yet felt like it was. You experienced every minute of that life as if you were the one living it. Once the pain stopped, you put a hand on your sexy hip, feeling much more confident in your body. \"Thanks Laurie! That'll really help me live my life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie giggles and hugs you. \"No problem Christine! I'll give you a call when our fun is over. We still have to hang out, after all\" she said, before turning and walking over to Jake's body. Thanks to the memories floating around inside of your head, you just couldn't think of yourself as Jake anymore. He was an outside person who didn't relate to you any longer. On that note, you walked out of the bedroom and headed for the front door. As you got in your car and headed back to your home, you didn't realize that there was now another force with you in the back of your mind. </span></div></div>",

I have to try..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What are you planning to do with Alli..?\" You said lowly in Christine's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hmm.. well.. I was thinking I'd do this first!\" Laurie said evily as she aimed the ring at Alli and hit the 2nd button on the ring. Almost immedietly a red mist shot out of the ring at her body and started slipping inside her mouth. Alli just began to convulse on the couch as your old body just smiled watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You kept to your feet to go help Alli. \"What did you do?!\" You growled angrily as you tried holding Alli's shaking body still. Before you got your answer her body stopped spasming and the red mist left her mouth followed by a light blue mist.. both floated to the ring on Laurie's finger and she just giggled as they disappeared inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" There we go, all done\" she quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" TELL ME WHAT YOU DID DAMNIT?!\" You yelled as you began swinging your fist at her. You didn't care anymore, you had to try something. Before your fist even met her face you felt your arms being restrained, you looked to see Jake just holding them behind your back painfully and tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh 'Christine'.. I warned you didn't I? You could have lived this girls life and been happy.. but now I have to keep my word. Tsk tsk.. well it never hurts to have another me around, I'm sure I can use her some way.\" Laurie said grinning as she pointed the ring at you. \"Don't worry, I'll make sure your girlfriend and sister.. and your old body get taken care of. Bye nooow\" she giggled hitting the 3rd button on the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your mind started feeling hazy as a red mist enveloped you.. your memories fading.. I guess.. this is it.. you thought lastly as Christines body slumped down in Jakes arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well now that he's outta the way, shall we continue dear 'brother'?\" Laurie said chirpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mhmm, I agree. Now what we're you going to do with these two?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie pondered her options as she studied the ring. I can either clone my mind into that bitch Christine now that the original Jake has been 'disposed' of.. or I can put myself in Alli.. ugh so many options she though grinning to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well I think I'll..\" Laurie started saying..</span></div></div>",

The blue smoke that left from Christine and Jake's mouths was their souls entering into the ring from their bodies. Now they would reside in the ring forever with no sense of where they are, or any memories of their lives until Laurie chose to put them into new bodies. If Laurie chose to put them into new bodies. If she wanted to, now that they were in the ring, she could delete both of them forever, rewriting their very souls into clones of herself, but she decided against that idea...for now. It would be fun to keep them alive and play with them a bit when the time came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though, there were more pressing matters to attend to. Laurie Told Jake about the function of the ring to copy your soul into a body, but it could also do so much more. It could force souls to exit their bodies and enter the ring until redirected, and it could also shoot your own soul out of your body and into another one. That was what she was going to do now. Laurie felt up her body one last time. \"Sorry sis, it's not you its me. I really loved being in your sexy body and having our fun with Jakey, but it's time for me to move on to bigger and better. Alli is just too good to waste\" she says before using the ring. Suddenly, Laurie's body slumped to the ground, becoming empty as red smoke left her mouth and flew into the air. the red smoke then flew down towards Alli's body and forced it's way into her semi open mouth. Since Alli's soul was in the ring, her body gave no resistance at all to the clone jake forcing it's way in and taking over. After several seconds of attaching itself to it's new home, Alli's body opened it's eyes and smiled. She sat up and quickly moved her hands to her chest, feeling herself up. \"Ugh...yessss....what a great choice it was to move into you Alli.....I always fantasized off seeing you naked...now I can be you naked. This is amazing....\" she said, getting up and slowly stripping off her clothes, giving the clone in Jake's body a little show. \"Do you like this, Jakey?\" she asked, now only in her bra and panties as she strutted herself over to Jake and gave him a big fat kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's body smiled at the new Alli. \"Oh, you might be able to say that\" he said with a grin, before looking at the two bodies laying on the floor, soulless. \"What are we gonna do with them, sis....ooops, I mean Alli?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli looked at them and then walked over to Laurie's body, removing the ring from her finger and placing it onto Alli's. \"Well...Their souls are still in here and I've been wanting an excuse to try out the fourth setting of the ring....You can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show\" she said with a grin, pointing the ring at one of the sleeping bodies. </span></div></div>",

You shakes thos thoughts from your mind as you aimed the ring at her and clicked the 3rd button, which sent Jake's soul shooting back into Christine's mouth as a mist. Her body shook for a moment before slowly starting to move again. Wasting no time you pressed the 4th button which shot out a black mist that forced it's way down Christine's throat. She coughed briefly before trying to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Huh.. ugh.. where.. what happened..\" she mumbled as you helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't you remember Christine?

You look over to Christine and Jake and smile at them. \"You two can start having your fun, I'll join you soon\" you say to them with a smile. Christine quickly starts pulling Jake upstairs, eager to fuck his brain out before Alli had time to even get to them. You giggle as you watch the two disapear up the steps and hold the ring, willing for Alli's soul to leave it and enter Laurie's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body shakes a little as the soul enters and easily takes over since it was faced with no resistance. Suddenly, her eyes flutter open and she looks around, seeming dazed. You knew the reasoning for this was because when a soul entered the ring, all of it's identity is erased. This leads them to being close to a blank slate whenever they reenter a body. While their regular minds would regain control after a few minutes of adjustment, one could easily place suggestions and alter that mind completely while in this state. That was exactly what you had done to Jake's soul, making him believe that he was not only Christine, but that she was such a slut coming here for that long awaited threesome, which would for now be just between her and the new Jake. You look at the new Laurie' who was looking around and smile at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sleepy head!\" you exclaim, startling her. She looks at you briefly, a flash of recognition in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look....familiar\" she says, sounding much more awake than expected. You just giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, silly. It's me...Alli\" you say with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns. \"Alli? I thought that was my name...\" she says but is interrupted by you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that can't be, silly. Alli is my name. You're Laurie, aren't you?\" you ask, gently putting your hand on her cheek and moving her face to look in the living room mirror. Alli had known who Laurie was after dating Jake for so long, so she indeed subconsciously recognized her face as Laurie's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Yeah, I'm Laurie, I guess I must have hit my head or something. Can you fill me in on what happened, Alli?\" she asks, curious. You smile at her kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can. Jake invited me and Christine here for a little sexy action with the three of us...\" she frowned in the middle of your sentence and interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake...isn't Jake my boyfriend?\" she asked, holding her head. You shake your head and point to the direction of family pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course now, honey. Jake is your older brother. But don't worry, that doesn't stop the two of you from fantasizing about and having fun with eachother. And you don't even have a boyfriend. You just have your girlfriend Christine, who whores around with everyone she can. You join her of course, since you just love giving your body away to those that want pleasure. That's why you and her are such a perfect match. You two are the finest sluts on the market and you both know it\" You saw the new Laurie nodding as you said all of this, making sure to go slow so that her mind could pick up on everything and use it for her new purpose in life. Upstairs, the new Christine was busy screwing Jake to kingdom come, but her mind was also changing to accept what you had just said as the truth. Gosh, molding people like this was so fun. You watched as Laurie sat more confidently and stood up, feeling herself over to make sure she wasn't hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked up the steps, listening to the noise coming from the room. \"Ugh, I can't believe they started the fun while I was knocked out! How are we supposed to have a foursome if they're just fucking eachother? I mean, really, that's just stupid, isn't it, Alli? We need to go talk some sense into our lovers, I think\" she said with a smile, her new life completely molded into her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, now having Jake and Alli out of the way for good. \"Oh, I agree one hundred percent\" you say as she grabd you and holds you against the wall, kissing you deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go show them real fun\" she says, taking your hand and practically forcing you up the stairs. </span></div></div>",

Aren't you gonna do something with those two?\" He asked pointing to Laurie and Christine's unconscious and soulless bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm but of course Jakey.. but first.. this!\" You giggled as you named the pen at him and hit the 3rd button. Before he could even say anything, red mist shot out at him and slipped in his mouth, causing him to shake in his seat as two black mist wisps floated out and back to your ring. \"All righty.. in you go in to Laurie\" you giggled as you hit the 3rd button again, sending your clone into the soulless Laurie. The mist flowed down her mouth and her body convulsed as your clone made her body it's new home. Laurie then gasped and breathed calmly before her eyes fluttered open. She grinned and eyed herself up, giving her new boobs a nice squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You know you can warn me next time 'Alli'.. oh my this is new. Laurie sounds so cute from the inside.\" She giggled with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I figured that she felt as better with a new pilot than being useless laying there. Sooo.. how do you like it in there 'Laurie'?\" You quipped teasingly as you climbed in her lap, your thighs wrapping around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm.. I can get used to this definitely\" she grinned and the kisses your lips, slipping her tongue in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm I think so too.. but we should turn this into a threesome no?\" You said sexily. Laurie just nodded her head and giggled. Still in the lap of Laurie you aimed the pen at the lifeless Christine and pressing the 4th button on the ring, you shot Jake's soul into her body, but it also sent a black mist along with his blue mist. The two together forced its way down her throat and she shook for a moment. You grinned and crawled to her. Now for some 'friendly suggestions' you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ehhh.. my head.. what happened? eep! My voice it's..\" Christine started saying. You cut her off before she had more time to think. Jake's mind was still in there and you had every intention of corrupting him to believing he was the slutty little Christine she always was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You ok Christine? You took a nasty hit to the head because of my dumbass boyfriend there\" you said innocently pointing at the seemingly unconscious body of Jake on the couch. \"He's been out cold for a bit now, but that's ok cause us girls wanted our alone time remember?\" You finished with a sly girly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Christine looked over to Jake and rethought that she was actually Jake.. that would be impossible.. I mean he's right there. That bump to my head really left my loopy. And our alone time.. why is Alli in that revealing outfit and Laurie too.. they look lustful.. lustful.. that's right our little 'girl time' now I remember' Christine finished thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now it's all coming back.. damn it Jake I could have lost some marbles from that thick skull of yours.. well good thing he's out, I don't want a peeping tom\" Christine said with a mischievous grin as she slowly stood, fixing her nylons and skirt a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Good.. it looks like I've got a new Christine and Jake in there is gone.. ah so easy you thought. You slowly stood and pushed yourself against Christine, your tits rubbing together through your clothes. You grin and kissed her lip before whispering in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let's go explore upstairs then before my boyfriend wakes up\" you said with a evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm, absolutely.. Let's go upstairs Laurie\" Christine whimpered out as she started walking up the stairs, her hips swaying seductively in her pencil skirt and nylon leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You just notioned to Laurie who had the same evil smile plastered on her cute face as you did on Alli's. You eyed Jake's body again as you started heading upstairs, wondering if you should do something more with the ring..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lead the two girls upstairs and into Lauriee's bedroom, which you felt the most comfortable in since she was the first one you had taken over.  In fact, Laurie ceased existing when you did since your essence deleted her mind as soon as you entered into her sexy body. Now she just housed on of your clones, so her room now belonged to you. You take Christine's hand in yours and pull her onto the bed with you, kissing her deeply, as she moves her hand around your body and gropes your ass playfully. 'mmmm, she's learning very fast' you think, loving how you had corrupted Jake's soul in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, you did not realize that Jake's soul was not as corrupted as you thought. While the black mist you had given Christine with his blue one was influencing his memories and choices, deep down, it was still good old Jakey in there, and he was fighting this with all of his might. He started out very week, but as the threesome progressed and the the girls began orgasming, they got tired and lost strength, while Jake was able to slowly but surely break free subconsciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The Real Jake's P.O.V.) <br>\r\nYou were so tired. Ugh, what had happened? You looked around and saw that you were in your room. Your memories were coming back to you. You had found that thing, talked with your clone in Laurie...then she turned on you and put you away. You briefly remembered her having put you into Christine....and then you looked down, seeing the boobs and blond hair hanging from your head. Alright, so you were still in Christine then. Not only that, but something about you felt..different. You couldn't quite place it, but you were thinking dirtier thoughts and tempted to do darker things than you normally would. You had no way of knowing that this was because of the black mix, still mixing itself with your blue soul and trying to corrupt it from inside of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. 'What I wouldn't give for revenge against that bitch....' you thought as you noticed Laurie laying in the bed next to you, knowledge out from the sex, but clearly breathing. You jumped and looked around, trying to find the ring. Where was it? Laurie wasn't wearing it and neither were you. Was there someone else? You looked around but couldn't see anyone, so you got up from the bed and backed away. There were three pairs of clothes on the floor. Christines, Laurie's, and...someone else's. Who else was here? You tried to remember as you opened the door and walked into the hallway. You heard noises coming from the house and walked towards them. They were coming from Jake's (at the thought of Jake, memories shot through your head of a guy from school you were attracted to immensely and wanted to physically pleasure in every way since you had an open relationship with both him and his girlfriend.... wait, stop that wasn't your thinking. You were Jake inside of Christine's body and you'd have to concentrate on that thought, since that corrupting smoke was getting stronger, and now not only taking over the blue one, but turning it just as black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm Jake...I'm Jake...I'm Jake....' just think that over and over and you should be able to fight off these memories. You noticed that the foreign memories and desires couldn't even have been Christine's. She was always relatively slutty, but she'd never given you or girls a second thought. They were some kind of dark corrupted version of Christine. As if you had a dark fantasy of the perfect slutty girl and it was those desires that were now Christine's memories and life. Not like you realized that though. You slowly and quietly open your bedroom door to see two people on the bed in the middle of passionate sex. The room was dark, but you could tell it was a boy and a girl and they both looked to be about college age. They were really going at it and you could feel yourself becoming aroused. 'Oooh, what I wouldn't give to get in on that action and fuck both of their brains out. I can't wait to show those two what REAL sex is...' you think and move towards them, but then stop. Why would you want to do that? You were Jake, not this dark new Christine! You wanted your body back and you wanted revenge on that stupid clone of yours and that was what you were going to get! You turn on the lights in the room, startling the two love birds. You saw that it was Jake and his girlfriend Alli. They were the two you came over here to screw. No! No, they were not! That Jake was an imposter! You are Jake! But why was Alli doing this? That was when you noticed the ring on her finger. She smiled at you seductively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, heyyyy Christine\" she said, winking at you as she got off the bed, kissing Jake...the FAKE Jake...on the lips before walking in front of you and pulling you into a kiss, which you happily returned until she let go, causing you to pout. You then realized what you were doing and stopped immediately. No, why are you enjoying this? If she has the ring then it's you evil clone in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to me, didn't you? You put me in Christine, then made me think I was her! But I fought back. I know who I am, and I know you're not Alli! So give me and her our bodies back right now!\" You yell, trying to convince yourself as much as them. You wanted to be strong and confident, but you knew you were thinking more and more about your dark Christine desires and less about wanting your old body back. Besides, Jake was just an icky guy and you could have so much more fun as a sexy girl....stop that! Stop thinking that way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli just laughed. \"Silly girl, you've been confusing yourself. Don't you remember all the fun we had last night?\" she asks. Sure enough, you remembered. You had lead the charge in the threeway sex with Alli and Laurie. You dominated both of them, making sure they were defeated by your sexual glory and perfection. As they should have been. After all, you were a goddess of the bedroom and they were just two fellow sluts looking for a night of fun. Wait, no that wasn't what it was at all! that wasn't you doing it! They had made you think that way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember that fun, but it wasn't me in the driver's seat! It was Christine! The Christine that you made me into!\" You yell, pushing away all the Christine thoughts for now. You knew who you were and you wouldn't let this bitch convince you otherwise. \"Now give me back my body! And then give Alli her own back!\" you yell as Alli just looks at the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor girl....I really wish I could, but I've already done what you've asked...\" she says with an evil grin. \"You see, Christine, that's who you are now. Your soul has been inside her body long enough to officially call it your permanent home. Since you are a normal human soul and not a manifestation of the ring, your mind is changing now to fit the body, but under the corrupted specifications I gave it earlier. that's why you're thinking like my dark little slut. Because you ARE my dark little slut! Now and forever more!\" she says with a laugh, looking at you. Your face got red. No, this wasn't right! You weren't Christine! The more you thought that though, the harder it was to convince yourself. You were feeling more and more comfortable in this body, and you wanted so much to just give in to these thoughts and live your life happily, using people up sexually for your advantage and having fun with that hunk Jake and his sexy Alli. You'd dominate them both and show them why you would be their mistress of sex! But you couldn't give in to those desires! That wasn't what you REALLY were and you knew it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I won't give in to this body! I won't become Christine! I'm Jake and I know it! And I know Alli's soul is in that ring! Give her her body back, please!\" Alli just laughed at your begging, noticing how much weaker you were getting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but Christine, I have already given Alli her body back\" she says with a grin, licking her lips and motioning to her naked body...that sexy naked body that you wanted to have some sexy fun with in bed. \"Alli's soul is in here with me, you see. And I'm making sure that she can see and hear everything that's going on. I'm corrupting her soul slowly, from inside of me, tearing her mind apart and rebuilding it as a replica of mine so that she can join in on the fun we're all having. So you see, I've already put you into YOUR body, and Alli is back in hers, until she decides to leave and take another. When that happens, I'll just send her away, maybe have her possess Jake's hot mom! Now wouldn't that be fun, Christine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick your lips and smirk. \"Aww yeah, that milf needs to learn a few lessons from me...\" you say and then frown. \"No! So she doesn't! That's my mother I'm talking about!\" you say, disgusted by yourself. Alli just laughs and you look at the ring on her hand. It was becoming so easy to just give into these Christine and take on the hot life that was offered to you. Christine's body would be nice and sexy would certainly be lots of fun. You were domineering, seductive, and eager to use anyone to get your way. It'd be a very nice life. But no, you couldn't do that! Deep down you were a good person no matter how black your soul got! It was still just blue enough to fight this one last time! You look Alli int he eyes and push all your desires away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli...Me...whatever you are in there. Please, I'm begging you, take me out of this body and get rid of these desires I'm having....I'll help you to have your fun...I'll use the ring however you want me to....just please let me stay as me...I don't want to live this life that I'm starting to believe I've always had...please if you're really a clone of me, find some goodness and let me live MY life....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you for several moments before smiling and responding</span></div></div>",

No! That isn't me damn it! Fuck you, I never should have took that ring home. I'm going to stop you if it's the last thing I do!\" You yelled charging at Alli who was giggling now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You raised your arm to strike her but suddenly found yourself not wanting. 'I don't need to hit Alli, she already knows I'm more a sexual fiend than her.. mmm and her boyfriend's cock.. I want to ride that til he cums... No! Fight it.. fight it.. what am I doing..' you argued in your own head. But your body was now on autopilot as it kneeled down and started stroking the new Jake's growing cock and kissing Alli in a passionate kiss. 'This feels much better.. it's easier to just be sexy and slutty.. after all I'm Christine now.. wait no I'm Jake damn it! Why am I stroking Jake's cock.. god it looks huge.. Mmmm and Alli is such a good kisser.. fuck I can feel myself slipping back.. no..' you thought as your mind went hazy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm.. so Christine, wanna fuck my boyfriend together? He's been wanting two sluts to show him a good time\" Alli whispered in between the kiss, her hands now feeling up your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yesss.. fuck yes I want that cock in me, come here big boy\" you moaned out as you quickly climbed over Jake and positioned his cock at your wet pussy. You slid down on it and whimpered in pleasure as it filled you. \"Oh fuck yes baby.. mmm grow that cock in me.. fuck me good\" you cooed as you started riding your pussy on his shaft slowly. 'This is so much better.. I'm glad Alli is letting me fuck this tool of a man.. his cock feels so good.. I'll make Alli feel wet later but right now I need to cum' you thought finally. All traces of Jake having been eradicated once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *Alli's POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect, seems Christine loves her new body even more now.. god watching them is getting me wet' you thought as you rubbed your clit slowly as Christine crimes her pussy into Jake's cock. Everything was now going smoothly so you turned your attention to the passenger inside you. She was crying it felt like but you didn't care. In just a little while she'll be like me you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh Alli dear.. I'm so sorry but it looks like your knight in shining armor failed.. now he's.. well she's just that hot slutty bitch Christine inside and out, don't worry though, I'm sure the new Jake will be better than the old.. and I'll be a better Alli than you were too.. mmm and a bit more slutty I think' you spoke to Alli's mind grinning evily as you moved your body into the action on the bed, climbing over Jake's chest and grinding your wet pussy against him as you made out with the new Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'FUCK YOU.. why are you doing this.. Jake.. what's happened to you.. aren't you Jake as well?! And stop doing that with my body!' She yelled out mentally angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mmmm no this is my body now Alli, and why? Because I can.. true I was once part of your goody little boyfriend but he kept me locked up.. now it's my turn and I plan on having all the fun in the world' you replied as you let out moans from Jake now licking your clit as  Christine shoved her tongue in your mouth as she groped your tits. Fuck this feels amazing.. now to corrupt the old Alli you thought. You started forcing your thoughts and desires onto her mind, overwriting all the parts that made her act like a good girl. Soon she won't be able to resist you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Agh! Get out of my mind you asshole.. fuck what Jake is doing is getting me horny.. No! That's not me focus Alli.. he's trying to change me just like he did Jake' Alli thought while resisting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bravo Alli.. but no I've got better plans for you. I'm going to make you exactly like me. You'll want so much cock and pussy that you'll beg for it after I'm done with you' you grinned inwardly as Christine shoved 2 fingers up your tight pussy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh fuck yes yes yesss baby just like that!\" You moaned out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh fuck that's the spot.. Christine you naughty slut.. wait no.. I don't act like this.. please stop.. mmm god my body is on fire keep going! Wait no!' Alli argued with herself as you started putting your personality over hers, erasing what Alli used to he for a new version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't fight it any more sweety, I'll make a better Alli than you did and live your life my way with Jakey here, then we can find you a new home, in a girl or a guy. I'm sure there's somebody you wanna be' you thought to her as your body started to shudder, your pussy clenching as a orgasm started..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fuck yes yes yes.. whatever you say Alli, just let me cum.. mmmph oh god my body is cumming' the new Alli moaned out mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh god yes.. Mmmm fuck you know how to get a girl off Christine\" you whimpered as you basked in the afterglow of your orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm thanks baby, Jakey here looks tired though. I think he came twice in my pussy\" she giggled still with his cock up her cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" F.. fffuck I did.. you milked me dry Christine.. how was it for you Alli?\" Jake spoke tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It was amazing, I'm going to enjoy it in here definitely.. I mean.. having sex with you both\" you said grinning as you dismounted Jake and stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you think 'Alli'. Was it good?' You asked the newly corrupted soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I say I can't wait for more fun baby.. let's find me a body now if you don't mind. Being a passenger is fun but I want to cum and I couldn't care less who I am at the moment when I do.' She replied evily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Seems like I've over written that girl Alli to me now.

The smoke was Alli's corrupted soul. You grin, now knowing that you were the only soul occupying the sexy body you were in. You walked out of the room and back into Laurie's room, where her body was sleeping soundly on the bed. After the fun earlier, you had switched your original clone from her body back into Jake's, leaving her as just an empty shell. You didn't want to make too much clones when there were souls to corrupt, so leaving her there seemed like the best idea at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as the red smoke flew out of the ring and into Laurie's nose. She coughed and shook a little as Alli's corrupted soul took over the body that you yourself had taken only a few hours ago. After a few seconds her eyes fluttered open and she looked her body over before looking at you questioningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, hun? You put me in Jakey's younger sister?\" she asked, clearly a little disappointed as she mutters under her breath \"my old body is hotter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax\" you say, leaning against the wall and crossing your arms over your chest. \"I think this is a nice place for you to be. Laurie here is nice and cute, and like this you get to have some incestuous fun with Jake's body and can still enjoy all of the pleasures that I'm certain Christine will be eager to give us whenever we ask...isn't that right, slut?\" you ask, noticing that Christine was listening to the conversation from the hallway while she was eagerly rubbing her pussy since she hated being without pleasure for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you think you two lightweights can handle me\" she says with a grin on her face, obviously confident in her abilities. You look at Laurie and the two of you laugh, knowing that the sex maniac that had said that used to be Jake. How the mighty have fallen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think the two of us will be more than enough for you, bitch\" the new Laurie says to the new Christine with a grin on her face. Christine just chuckles and keeps rubbing herself, obviously not believing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, girls. Do behave yourselves. There will be more than enough sex for all of us since I have this ring\" you say, holding up your hand to show it off  . As you do, you realize that the original Christine's soul is still inside of the ring, just waiting for a little corruption. You call Jake's body into the room and let her soul out of the ring. It flies into Jake's body and you watch as it merges with the clone's soul, allowing Christine to take over Jake's body. Until she becomes corrupt that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake's body convulses on the floor, you leave the room with Laurie, but not before whispering in the new Christine's ear, \"fuck his brains out. Dominate his mind. Turn the soul in that body into our personal sex slave. Have as much fun as you can.\" the new Christine smiles evilly, licking her lips as she removes her hand from her crotch and looks at 'Jake' who now wakes up and holds his head, looking disoriented. Oh, this was going to be fun for the new Christine....</span></div></div>",

I mean ive already done a little 'exploring' in here\" you giggled in her sultry voice as you cupped your full tits in your hands.

I'm Jake damn it.. wait I mean Christine.. get off... mmmmm ohhh that feels so good though.. maybe just a little more..\" she groaned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned evily as you kept rubbing his shaft. 'Soon Christine will be just like me and Alli.. and by us I mean erasing her mind altogether' you thought as you tugged the boxers down so the cock could stand erect 'Mmmm looks yummy' you thought as you slowly slipped your mouth over the cock and sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm fuck yeah that's good.. mmmph wait no.. stop.. I feel like I'm gonna black out.. oh god nevermind just keep going\" she gasped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Inside Christines mind she was fighting a losing battle, she felt like a passenger as her old body sucked off her new cock. 'God that feels amazing.. mm NO! IM Christine damn it not this ass Jake!'.. she fought mentally as she began to vividly remember Jake's memories.. 'whats going on.. my memories? Yeah.. those are mine.. and i'm Jake.. not Christine.. god I feel dizzy. By but cock wants to explode, now Christine is riding me.. Mmmm.. ' she thought.. her personality being replaced by the clone that was with her in the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yesss.. god your cock feels so good there Jakey\" you whimpered as you slammed your pussy into his hips. \"You're going to be my good little boy and fuck me all night aren't you?\" You panted as you saw Jake coming to again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Uh.. fuck yes Christine.. I'll do whatever you want, just let me cum up your pussy baby\" he gasped as you continued riding him. You could feel his cock throbbing as you moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mm yes.. yesss.. cum in me Jake.. fill me\" you seductively cooed as you felt his load spurt into you. Your pussy clenched hard and you gasped, using his chest to lean on as you slowed your grinding hips. 'Fuck that was good.. now to see if Christine is all gone..' you thought. \"Oh yes that was amazing.. Christine? You still there?\" You asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You could say that JAKE\" he winked. \"Christine is me now.. and now i'm Jake, she's all gone baby\" he grinned up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well I'm glad to see that I'm the only slut with this body now.. Mmmm Alli will be very pleased\" you giggled with a grin.</span></div></div>",

They've been waiting for us for awhile now\" you say with a wink as you side on your black leggings. You grinned when you saw the look of disappointment on Jake's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, we can't have another quick fuck before?\" he asked as he got off the bed and put on his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, feeling your long blond hair swaying from side to side as you do. \"Sorry big boy, but you don't get any more of my body until I say you do\" you say. Sure, you LOVED having a cock in you, but that didn't mean you'd just give yourself out for free to anyone who asked. no, you wanted them begging for your body. \"Now hurry up and put your clothes back on\" you say as you put on a black sports bra and decide that the bra and leggings were all you really needed to wear. It was certainly a sexy look for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch...\" you hear the new Jake mutter as he pulls on a T shirt and then puts on a pair of jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I heard that...\" you say, acting offended. \"Personally, I prefer the term slut, but I suppose you can call me whatever you want since I let you get a taste of what I'm like in bed. I don't let just anyone have me, you know. Besides, it wasn't much long ago that YOU were this 'bitch' remember?\" you ask with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I don't remember. Whatever original personality I had has been completely deleted and replaced, just like what you did to Laurie at first. Oh wait, it wasn't you because you were erased to become Christine, weren't you?\" he asks, responding quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you got me there. But I think we can both agree that being a sexy goddess like me is WAY better than being a good boy. Morals just seem to get in the way. If you were still Christine in there, you'd know that the life that I will be leading is exactly what you've always dreamed of but were too scared to achieve\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't doubt that one bit. But enough talking, Christine. Let's go downstairs and see the others\" Jake said as he finished completely getting dressed. You take his hand in yours and lead him down the steps. Hand in hand, you get to the living room where Laurie and Alli are busy making out on the couch. They stop what they were doing to look at the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Jake is the first to open his mouth. \"I gave quite a fight at first, but I'm all yours now, ladies\" he says with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli looks at you with a smirk. \"Very nice, Christine. I take it you had fun with your conquest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her as if it were a stupid question. \"Oh, you know it. By the time I was done with him, he was begging for more of me. I could barely keep him away\" you say with a grin as your eyes fall to the ring on Alli's finger. Technically that ring did belong to you. Sure, your soul was now corrupted beyond repair and you thought of yourself as Christine Walker rather than Jake Masters, but in theory, you should be able to get it away from Alli. Now that could be fun....</span></div></div>",

Sure, you were now a slutty horny girl that Alli made you into.. but you were once the original Jake, your memories and personality that erased his knew you were, and by that knowledge alone you craved the ring. Who was Alli to have all the fun? You had an idea of how to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm.. fuck.. Laurie let's take this into the bedroom\" you whispered sultrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" sounds fun to me\" she giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You both got up, Alli and Jake not even noticing as Alli was rubbing the bulge in his boxers. You lead Laurie upstairs into her bedroom with a kinky grin. As you both got in you pinned Laurie to the wall and kissed her hard for a minute, your tits pressing into hers. You then spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm.. you like my body Laurie? It's to die for no?\" You cooed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yesss.. it's so sexy, what I wouldn't give to have it, but Alli put me this slut, but i'll make due\" she huffed as your rubbed her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What if I said you can have this girl? Better yet.. anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What do you have in mind Christine?\" She asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I want the ring Alli is keeping for herself, if you help me get it, i'll switch you into this fine ass body, and i'll erase our new Alli\" you saidggesturing to your body sexily as you proposed your idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hmm.. deal, it's so kinky knowing i'll get to play with these titties soon\" she grinned groping your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You smiled in return and lead Laurie downstairs to the sound of moans. You peeked around the living room and saw Alli riding Jake's cock wildly, unaware of your presence. You motioned to Laurie to follow you quietly as you came up behind them. You whispered into Laurie's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull that sluts hair backwards and i'll snatch the ring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and stepped closer to them. Alli's hair was bouncing everywhere as she fucked Jake and was immediately lurching backwards as Laurie grabbed her hair. Alli let a squeak of surprise and pain leave her lips, her hands reaching back to pry her hair free.You quickly grabbed the hand with the ring and slid it off while Alli was distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" OWE! WHAT THE FUCK?!\" Alli yelled turning to see who pulled her hair, her pussy still impaled by a hard cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Alli\" you grinned slipping the ring on your finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What the hell are you doing Christine?!\" She growled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm, I think we're going to have a change of leadership, that's what i'm doing. Thank you Alli for making me this way, I like this girls body.. but Alli's is way sexier, and I think Laurie here should get my body. So i'm going to erase you and live Alli's life now!\" You said grinning deviously as you got ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slut I made you! You can't do this!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" But I can\" you giggled, hitting the switch which immediately sucked out your soul in the form of a red smoke as it did to Alli, your old body slumped into Laurie's arms as the old Alli went into the ring and you slipped into your new sexy body. Alli's body just convulsed as you took over but soon stopped. You opened your eyes and grinned, looking down at a bewildered Jake and your two DD tits which you hungrily felt up while licking your new lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm perfect.. her body feels so much better, sorry about all that Jakey.. you can just call me Alli now.\" You grinned as you began to grind your hips, making Jakes cock slide up your new pussy. You let out a whimper as did Jake before he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ohhh.. god I couldn't care less, just fuck me baby i'm so hard after that\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You grinned and moaned after as you fucked your new toy.

He had a look in his eyes that just begged for more. After all, as sexy as Alli was, all she was inside was an evil clone of the old Jake, while you were a true seducer. You could use your femininity in ways that the old occupier of your sexy new body never even dreamed of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoyed having that fun as much as I enjoyed watching it, 'Alli,' but can I pleeaaaseeee get my new body now? Laurie is cute and all, but she's certainly no Christine\" she says, looking down at the empty Christine body on the ground. You look at her and think for a second. Well, a deal was a deal so you might as well leave her around. You hold the ring towards her and watch as her soul is sucked out of her body. Once it was safely in the ring, you concentrated and willed it out and into Christine's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the new Christine's eyes fluttered open, you grabbed her and pulled her into a passionate kiss on the lips. \"Mmmm, now that I've had my fun with Jake, I'd love to have my fun with you...I'm eager to put Alli's sexy body to work fucking whoever I want. Think I can get more guys and girls than you can?\" You ask as Christine kisses you back and pushes you down onto the bed, the two of you pushing Jake out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, I don't care. We're both sexy sluts, we can get whoever we want\" she says as the two of you proceed to have your fun. After nearly half an hour, you notice Laurie's empty body on the floor and smile, looking at the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Christine, I'm beginning to feel bad for that original Jake clone that had Alli's body before me. I mean, clearly I deserve to be the one in control of all of you, but she was so deviously kinky that I think it would be nice to have her around. What do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine thought for a moment and then nodded. \"I agree, Alli. Having her input would definitely be nice and I'm sure she'd lead us in a lot of fun, but we can't be too careful. Maybe you should use the ring to make sure that she won't sway from our side\" she says. You nod to her and hold out the ring. </span></div></div>",

Why would there even be someone else in there? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning!\" Jake exclaimed with some stupid grin on his face. You jumped, startled by him being there. Why the hell was your stupid brother always trying to invade your personal space?!? Pervert...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, you scared me!\" You yell at him, and then hold your head.

YOU are!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what????\" You ask, confused, backing away until you feel your back pressing against the wall. Part of you had no idea what he was talking about, he must be crazy!

Jake held his head as you faded into nothing and then he turned into you! What the hell did you just see???<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, I see you're remembering a little. That's good. Basically, I took over your body and sent you into Laurie here. I expected Laurie's mind to just disappear and die in her body, but it looks like she was sooooooo angry at us for having our little fun that she actually over rid you with her memories and personality before she faded away into nothing. Laurie's dead, but she has you thinking your her. I can't believe I'm saying this about a dead bitch, but I'm impressed\" he says with a grin as you stare him down. You didn't want to believe a word of it, but deep down, you somehow knew what he was saying was the truth.....Part of you did remember being Jake and having some sort of 'fun' with him when he was in your...you mean Laurie's body....but there were so many holes in your memory thanks to what you...you mean Laurie supposedly did to your mind. You didn't know what kind of fun you two had or even why you were in Laurie's body in the first place....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know...I'm not remembering a lot. I believe you...but there's so much missing\" you say, holding your head. You were so torn and fragile right now....part of you knew you were Laurie, but part of you knew you were Jake. Part of you trusted this new Jake, but part of you wanted to run away. You start to cry as you collapse onto the floor, like a scared girl. \"I don't know...\" you say to yourself over and over again, so unsure about anything. Who even were you? Were you Jake or were you Laurie? What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake...the other Jake....walked over to you and put his ringed hand on your shoulder. Your instinct was to try and grab the ring, get it far away from him, but you just couldn't bring yourself to do it. You were too busy crying over your little identity crisis to bother. \"I get how confusing this must be for you, Jake...I really do....\" He says and you flinch as he says your name. It felt so natural being called that, but most of your memories told you that wasn't right. This was so disorienting. \"I'll tell you what. Why don't you let me fix up those memory holes for you? Once I'm finished, you'll be good as new...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to do...part of you told him to not let him touch you. You wanted to run away and get away from this guy. The other part of you wanted to know the truth though....in between your tears, you pull your head up to look into his eyes. \"Do it...\" you beg, just wanting this damned confusion to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure....Laurie\" he says with an evil grin as he presses a button on the pen. As he says that, you scream as you realize you've made a terrible mistake, but it was too late....</span></div></div>",

Your eyes glow bright red as you begin looking through Laurie/Jake's mind. \"Well...this is interesting\" you say with a grin, licking your lips as you make your plans. Strangely, the mind inside of Laurie's body was neither fully Laurie's nor fully Jake's. Rather, it was a strange combination of the last bits of each of them. It seemed that Laurie had been so mad at Jake that as her own mind wad dying, she had killed Jake with her. Parts of each survived, but neither of them survived in full, which was why the new Laurie had been so disoriented once she woke up. She didn't know whether she was Jake or Laurie because she was neither. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was all just fine for you. If anything, it made things easier to have your fun as you build your new playmate from the ashes of these two poor souls. The first thing you do is delete all of Jake's memories, leaving no no more confusion about whether she was Jake or Laurie. From there, you got to work on the personality. You decided remove all of those pesky morals that were floating around in both Jake and Laurie's personalities. On top of that, you removed all inhibitions that both Jake and Laurie had. Finally, you left in both Jake and Laurie's kinks and increased the sex drive of this new Laurie. Essentially, you had just created a bisexual slut that was just as devious as you. Of course, such a person would be dangerous if you didn't play your cards right, which was why there were still two changes to make. First, you decreased the new Laurie's intelligence a bit. Laurie was always very smart and those smarts could be used against you. The new Laurie now had an IQ much closer to the original Jake's, which gave you quite an advantage over her since you were essentially the dark side of the original Jake with Laurie's smarts. Just in case, you also made the new Laurie know that she was your slave. Her greatest goal was to please you, physically or otherwise. She would never dream of doing anything that would get in your way and would assist you in all of your plans, provided that she had fun with them also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that didn't take so long\" you say as the glows in your eyes and the ring fade.

It had 4 tiny bumps on the top of it which were all different colors but only slightly. You felt your finger over the one on the left and heard a audible clicking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell..\" you said before a quiet buzz emitted from the ring, the button glowing a dark red before fading to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" That was weird.. what the hell is this thing\" you tried removing it from your finger but found it was stuck, almost as if it'd been super glued to you. You started feeling nervous and tried pulling again with no luck. 'Shit.. I should get Laurie to help' you thought as you got up to head downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Laurie! I need your help\" you said entering the living room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" God what now Jake.. hold on Christine. What did you do?\" She asked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Nothing, this ring is stuck on my finger and I need help getting it off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Woooow.. really... too weak now?\" She said grabbing your finger firmly, then you heard the buzz and click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before your sister could even say another thing, you watched, your jaw dropping and silent as you saw your sister deflate in front of you into a heap of skin and clothes on the floor. You covered your mouth almost screaming and leaned down.. gently poking what looked like her skin, empty and lifeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my god.. L..Laurie.. what the hell happened.. oh my god\" you said in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then heard Christine complaining over the phone that had been in her hand and you quickly closed it, hanging up on her. You carefully and slowly grabbed Laurie's skin, it felt warm and soft.. you lifted it up and felt the clothes sliding off her empty form..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" The ring.. the fucking ring must have done this.. that first button maybe.. but this is so weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked over your sister's skin and found a slit down her neck and back all the way down to her ass and you gently opened it. It was completely empty and smooth on the inside, and a lightly goopy too. You felt so awkward about this.. but fascinated. You had an idea.. one you might have regretted if Laurie was there consciously. You slowly stripped the clothes off her body and then laid her skin naked on the couch. Your parents wouldn't be home all weekend because they'd left early that morning for some family relatives wedding. So you were alone..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stripped yourself of your own clothes and slipped your boxers down, revealing your growing dick, you were feeling hot and aroused somehow. You then looked at the ring on your finger and tried taking it off, and surprisingly it came free. You set it aside and lifted your sister's skin up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well I've gone this far\" you mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You began sliding your legs into the skin suit that was.. or had been your sister not 15 minutes ago, slowly fitting them in. The goop in her skin was warm and felt like it was helping your leg into place. You th n lifted your other leg into her and started pulling hr skin up like it was a one piece costume. You got to your dick and grimaced.. you tucked it in the area where your sister's pussy would have been and pulled it over your hips, feeling the warm goop surround your groin. It was actually quite arousing you thought. You quickly pulled her skin over your abs and though you struggled, managed to get your arms into her petite ones. You were amazed that she wasn't stretching or ripping, th goop was definitely helping. Suddenly as you pulled the skin up f Laurie up to your neck, th slit down the back sealed itself all the way up. Your heart was pounding and the empty boobs on your chest and bulge under the skin of her skin's crotch looked weird certainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" All or nothing.. let's try it!\" You said to yourself for encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You pulled Laurie's face and head over yours, it felt tight to slip into and you could feel it attaching to your face. You gasped as a cooling sensation ran through your body and you moaned out as you fell slouchy d into the couch. Your body spasmed a little as the bulge of your cock disappeared from her crotch and the empty looking breasts filled suddenly til a full DD cup. You whimpered as you felt the changes and heard your voice rise in pitch as well, until you sounded just like Laurie until it was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmph.. oh my god that was like an orgasm.. holy shit my voice.. it's entirely Laurie's..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly stood and swiped up her skirt, panties, bra and top and rushed upstairs to her room to look at yourself. You were a teenage boy and you couldn't help but gawk at your sister's body. She as fucking sexy you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hi, i'm Laurie and i'm an annoying bitch\" you said mimicking her voice and giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" God this could be fun.. being my sister for a little couldn't hurt.. besides I get to experience life as a hot girl for a little\" you grinned as you fondled your new tits in your hands, letting a soft whimper out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ohhhh.. god thats sensitive.. what to do now..\" you thought holding the ring in your palm.</span></div></div>",

You assumed it would just be attached to whichever your outermost akin would be at any given time. You were in no rush for more skins right now though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could certainly get used to living Laurie's life, except for the fact that you didn't seem to know anything about her. You closed your eyes and tried to think of some of Laurie's memories, but couldn't do it. The only things you could remember about her life was from the perspective of being her brother. \"Well that sucks...how am I supposed to be able to impersonate you if I can't even see your memories?\" you ask your reflection in an annoyed voice. \"Unless...\" you say as you press the second button on the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a brief pressure in your head as your mind becomes expanded. You suddenly remember things that you never knew before. You remember being the only child in the family for a few years. You remember the birth of your younger brother John. You remember your parents getting divorced (which the old you was too young for). You remember your dad remarrying and how his rich family was always better off than the one he left behind. You made note of how hot your step sisters now were though. Finally you remembered being a straight A student in high school, while also participating with cheerleading and volleyball, where you and your friends had earned reputations as the sexiest girls in school. Though you were amused that Laurie was still a virgin, wanting to take her life seriously unlike some of her friends that were total sluts. You remembered how happy you were when you got into your top choice for college and how awesome it was. It was a much better school than where your younger brother was going and you loved rubbing it in his face how much better you were than him. He was so annoying and never able to reach his potential. You felt bad for the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you remembered talking on the phone with your best friend Christine, who was surprisingly even sexier than you were. You were on the phone with her to set up a girls night out with a few friends when Jake came down and asked you to help get that weird looking ring off of his finger. You smiled as your newly squired memories ended. \"Well Laurie, I didn't know that was how you felt about me\" you say to your reflection with a grin as you strike a sexy pose for yourself. \"Actually, now that I have your memories I should get into character...<b>I'm</b> such a sexy bitch. Oooh, I can;t wait to go out and live <b>MY</b> life!\" you exclaim with a smirk on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>JAKE STOP IT!!!!!!!!</i> You jump as you hear Laurie's voice coming from somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie?\" you ask confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>JAKE WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME????? WHY CANT I CONTROL MY BODY??!!!???</i> she sounded extremely angry, but also scared and confused. After all, who would have thought something like this could ever be physically possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, just shut up for a little....\" you say as you try to think about why her mind was awake now. You figured that when you gained access to her memories it also brought her mind back to consciousness. That would definitely make sense. You press the second button again, but nothing changed. Clearly getting her memories was a one way street. Maybe one of the other buttons will fix this.....You quickly press the third button on the ring, hoping for the best....</span></div></div>",

Before you had your fun and took over Laurie's life, it'd be nice to know what the last button on the ring did. Still naked, you walked over to Laurie's desk and pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. In Laurie's beautifully neat handwriting, you wrote: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton 1- Turns a person into a suit <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton 2- gives me the memories of the person I'm in (but also wakes up their sleeping mind)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton 3- Converts person's mind into a clone of me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton 4-????<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, trying to think about what it could possibly do. \"Hey Jake, do you have any ideas?\" you ask the copy of you that was now just floating around in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have no idea...'sis'</i>he says, followed by what sounded like a chuckle. Typical you....<i>The last thing I remember, I was in control of Laurie's body trying to find out what the other buttons did. Next thing I knew, I'm in here and you're out there. The only reason I know I'm a clone and not the real me is because I have some compulsion to do what you tell me</i> he says, which you thought was interesting. So all of your clones would be an exact mental copy of you, but they'd be required to do everything that you told them to unquestioningly. Now that was something you'd be sure to take advantage of when the opportunity present's itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...let's give this fourth button a try...\" you say as you press the fourth button. You feel an odd tingling sensation, but look in the mirror and just see yourself. Strangely, you didn't seem to be able to feel that other you in your head anymore. \"Hey, Jake! Are you still in there!\" you say, but then notice that your lips in the reflection weren't moving. You put your hand on your face and realize that it pulls away a little. Were you wearing another suit? You reach behind you and sure enough find an opening. You pull yourself out and find that you were now wearing a Laurie suit over Laurie's body. \"Wow\" you say as you take it off and put it on the floor. You wonder if your clone was now in there....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel down in front of the new Laurie skin and press the first button on the ring, thinking about having the new skin re-inflate. Sure enough, it does so, and fills up with air. Soon, the new Laurie opens her eyes and stands up, shaking a little. As soon as she notices her reflection she smiles brightly and starts to feel herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUDE!!!!!\" she exclaims, giving her boobs a nice squeeze. \"This is so fucking cool!\" she yells with joy, feeling herself up all over. \"You got me out of your body!\" she says as she pulls you into a tight hug. IT was very strange, looking into the mirror and seeing two exact twins of your older sister hugging. It was even more weird thinking about how the mind currently feeling up the second Laurie actually used to be her and just doesn't remember it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you have any of your original memories left in you?\" You ask the clone who was still busy feeling herself up. She frowns as she tries to think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I can't say I do. Looks like you've stolen every inch of Laurie out from me\" she says, not seeming to care. She was content just to be feeling up her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So then clearly you won't make a very good Laurie anymore...give me a second\" you say as you leave the room. Once you come back, you toss her a skin of your original body. \"Put that skin on\" you tell her, knowing that she would do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were out of the room you realized that pressing any of the buttons again would reverse what it did. Pressing the fourth button again would re-merge a copy skin with it's original, pressing the third again would turn a clone back into it's original mind, pressing the second again would let you put their mind back to sleep, but still keep your acquired memories, and pressing the first again would let you take off the skin you were wearing. Knowing that this could now all be fixed and be simply harmless fun made you feel a lot better about doing some of the horrible things you had planned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Laurie sighs and does as you ask, sliding the Jake skin on over her body and closing it up, becoming an exact copy of what you used to look like. You smile at her as you say \"Now, you're going to continue living my life as if nothing ever happened. As far as the world knows, you are Jake Masters and I am Laurie Masters, got it?\" you ask followed with an understanding nod from him. You think for a moment and then decide to give another test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I want you to completely forget anything about being a clone of me. You are Jacob Masters and always have been. You're just a regular college freshman. Forget all about the ring and forget about me being anything other than your older sister. Now go to your room, get dressed and do whatever it is you'd normally be doing\" you say as he does so. You had no idea if that would actually work or not, but you hoped it would. Having that much control would definitely help to clean things up after your fun. And having him believing he's actually you would definitely help with things. After all, you had to keep your grades up somehow while having all this fun, and that would allow you to do that. You look in the mirror and smile at your reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad for <b>ME</b> that my grades will certainly be taking a little plunge. After all, <b>I</b> need to stop being such an annoying prick and loosen up\" you say with a grin on your face. You take the piece of paper with the ring instructions on it and add what the fourth button does as well as the reversal information. You fold it up and put it on your desk before walking over to Laurie's wardrobe. \"Now, let's pick out something nice and sexy and go have some fun....\" you say as you start to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Shut up in there!\" you hear your now completely normal 'brother' yelling from his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you shut up, loser!\" you respond, sounding just like Laurie would. This would be fun....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Christine Donovan was always the star of the show. She had a great body, toned and tan from swimming, volleyball and cheer leading, and was at the center of her social circle. Despite being known for being the sexiest girl in school, she was also known for being the richest. Her family was incredibly wealthy and she inherited a vast fortune from the deaths of her parents, who passed away in a boating accident when she was 10. She was raised by her grandparents who taught her the value of saving and not buying more than you needed. As a result, Christine lived in regular college dorms, instead of one of her luxurious mansions, and never showed off her wealth. She would always give a bit of money to the poor people she'd see on the street and would never leave a friend in need. After all, even if she were to buy another few mansions, she'd have enough money left to never need to work a day in her life. Despite that knowledge, Christine liked the idea of doing something with her life, no matter how small, so she worked as a waitress in a local restaurant where she was well liked for being extremely nice and sweet, but knowing how to handle the perverts that tried to slap her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven knowing she had such a wonderful body, Christine was raised an extremely religious Catholic by her grandparents until they passed away. She would wear modest clothes as much as she could, often wearing leggings under her skirt if it was too short, but making sure she looked good no matter what she was in. She also never let any boy get farther than second base with her and was very careful about protecting her virginity. She was currently in a strong relationship with her boyfriend Jared and she never had any thoughts of cheating on him. Christine took great pride in never indulging in her wealth, being the sexiest girl around, but also being one of the most intelligent and surprisingly, one of the nicest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently  pacing her room, unsure what she should do. She was sweating nervously and was worried sick for her best friend, Laurie. The two of them had been roommates in college all the way from their freshmen year to their senior year and had grown incredibly close, treating each other like sisters. Not even Laurie really knew how wealthy Christine was, but she planned on sharing the information once they were both out of college.  They were talking on the phone, planning to go out together and have some fun in town when Christine heard her phone drop. When she picked up the phone again to see what was wrong, she heard a boy's voice sounding nervous, as if something bad had happened.She tried calling back for the past hour or so, but got nothing. Christine even debated calling the police but a small voice of hope told her not to. Maybe she could just go over to Laurie's house and see if she was okay? If she found more reason to worry, then she'd maybe call the police. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging into some black leggings and a pink T-shirt that was tight but not too tight, Christine left to go over to her friends house, praying that everything was alright as she drove. </span></div></div>",

It was Christine and you knew that immediately from your stolen memories.. well now yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh god Christine I'm so sorry, I got caught up with something.. special\" you smiled knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Special? So you ignored my calls? Must be pretty important, I was really really worried about you.. I was literally driving to your place just now.\" She scoffed in a annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God were all of your new friends gonna be this bitch.. well I think in can fix that' you thought evily as you grinned looking at the ring onyour finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm noooo I wasn't ignoring you I just got distracted Christine, tell you what i'll come over and show you what what it was, can I head over in like 30 minutes?\" You asked innocently as you impersonated Laurie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah thats fine you were suppose to come over early anyway remember? We were gonna get ready to hit that girls club up that you begged me to go to since your parents were out this weekend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right.. well i'll see ya soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*beep*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled mischievously at yourself in the mirror and struck a erotic pose as you thought about Christine and what you had planned. With the ring the possibilities of being anyone were real.. and you had an idea about what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shut your bedroom door and pressed the 4th ring button again, feeling another Laurie skin form over you which you quickly used the ring on to form another you. The new Laurie stood and just eyed you silently while you whispered to her the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you're me in there right, slut?\" You asked meanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes.. jeez. And hey you're the slut if i'm just a copy of you bitch\" she replied quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Shhh.. zip it. I just needed to confirm that for what I have planned for that bitchy new friend of mine Christine.. I think she'll be better under new management.\" You giggled as you used the ring and 4th setting to turn the Laurie back to a skin which you happily put back on over yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You went to the closet and pulled out the sexiest clothing Laurie had in there. Black nylon leggings and a short pencil skirt with a cute hot pink Uscoop shirt and a bra that just pushed your new tits out even more. You grinned, loving the feeling of the lace on you and looking sexy, but more so because you were tricking people that you were really Laurie even though you'd essentially replaced and deleted her. You finished dressing and grabbed the keys and phone and the purse she usually carried and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Jake I'm going out, don't wait up\" you yelled upstairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I never was!\" He yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, seems he still is me almost you thought as you shut the door, thinking about Christine with a devilish smile as you got I'm the car and drove to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew from your newly acquired memories that she lived alone in this small house when she was off from school. You also knew she didn't have much of a family and figured she paid for the house with whatever money she was left, plus her job as a waitress. You had no idea how wealthy she really was or how useful she could prove to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after waiting for a few minutes, she opened the door and smiled at you, giving you a hug as you entered her house. \"Like, I was soooooo worried about you!\" she said, letting go of you and closing the door behind you, locking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awfully careful\" you say to her teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a girl can never be too careful. You never know when some crazy guy might break in and attack you\" she says, shivering at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we'd never want some nutcase getting a hold of your sexy body, now would we?\" you ask, licking your lips. Christine just laughs, figuring you were making a joke. How unfortunate for her that she had no idea how close she was to meeting that fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you told me you wanted to show me what kept you so held up and gave me that little panic attack?\" she asked, frowning as she noticed what you were wearing. \"By the way, what's with the outfit? You're not dressed like yourself...\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just grin at her. \"Well, I just figured I'd try something new. I'm tired of being the boring old me and really want to get out more and have fun with my awesome life and my sexy body, you know?\" you ask, doing a little spin and smirking at her. \"But that's not so important. It's this little baby that's really important\" you say with an evil grin as you hold your hand out, showing Christine the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with that ring? It looks really weird..\" she says, bending down to take a closer look at it. You just keep grinning, having something marvelously devious planned as you move a finger to press it.  </span></div></div>",

The quiet buzz signaling it worked you watched with evil delight as Christine's eyes widened and her voice muffled as she deflated onto the floor in the main room. You dropped your purse and started unzipping your skirt and pulling down your panties and leggings and then removed your bra and shirt still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm the most popular and sexy girl at college.. and she's all mine. God this ring is amazing\" you said laughing softly as you set it to yourself and pressed the 4th button again. You happily removed the duplicate skin of Laurie from your body and started stripping Christine of her clothes. 'God she always dressed so modest, why hide this sexy body from the world and that boyfriend of yours' you thought as you finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Time to upgrade!\" You grinned as you said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You began pushing your smooth legs into place with Christine's, her legs were more tanned and toned than yours but you squeezed in good and pulled her ass and waist over yours. This was much easier than when you had a cock and your old body.. you smiled as you got your arms in, feeling Christine's skin seal up behind as you shoved your head into hers, aligning the face. You gasped at the cooling sensation as your body morphed under to her new soft skin. You grinned with your new mouth and twirled, cupping the breasts that the old Christine kept hidden. The were so soft and voluptuous and her pussy felt tight since it never had been filled yet.. something you would enjoy doing. But first, your new memories and to rid yourself of the old Christine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed the 2nd button and felt a rush of memories enter your mind, the years spent with your grandparents, meeting Jared and growing up being a 'good girl'. You smiled as they finished flooding into you and you could hear the faint pleas of Christine in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What.. what's happening.. where am I and how did I get naked?\" Christine thought as she tried moving her body, but found she couldn't. You just grinned in a mirror at yourself and grabbed your tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hi there Christine, you know I've gotta say, you are fucking sexy. This body is way better than Laurie's surely\" you said evily as you continued rubbing your smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wh.. what.. who.. what's going on.. why can't I move my own body? And who are you?!\" She asked almost fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well.. i'm going to be Christine now, I'll be enjoying this body from now on and i'm sure I'll love it, as for who I was before.. let's just say that the real Laurie isn't around anymore!\" You giggled mischievously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" And soon neither will you Christine! I was thinking that maybe I shouldn't corrupt you and just erase you.. but then I figured it'd be more fun to stick you in my former skin! So hang tight sweety, this may hurt.\" You smiled as you used your mind to suppress Christine away as you hit the 4th button on the ring again, creating another skin of her which you mentally put Christine in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm perfect! Now i'm alone in this sexy slut to be\" you cooed. You then had a choice.. put your duplicate of Laurie in Christine for some fun.. or you could reform Christine and shove her into Laurie's skin and have the clone of yourself in it corrupt her.. choices choices..</span></div></div>",

She jumps back as she notices you, which causes you to chuckle. \"Now that you're awake, I'd like you to wear the skin next to you. Don;t worry, I'll wait for you to stop gawking over the fact that there are two of us first\" you say, smirking evilly as she looks at you with anger in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never get away with this you freak!\" she yells, causing you to just laugh at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please! I already have! I have your body and your memories. So not only will I finally be giving your body the sexual fun it's been craving for so long, I'm going to be filthy rich and make sure to indulge myself in all those sins that you never wanted to give into! It'll be great!\" you exclaim. \"Now just put on that skin, become Laurie, and it will all be over. You can go live her life and do whatever the heck you want. No one will be the wiser that this switcheroo happened\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I do that? What's stopping me from running away and calling the police right now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact I can turn you into a skin whenever I want to and the only reason I haven't done that yet is because I'm giving you a chance to have a new life instead. Come on, Christine. You're a genuinely sweet girl. You deserve a chance to continue on. Laurie is gone for good so the least you can do is preserve your best friend's legacy by taking on her life, right?\" you ask, trying to make it sound like you genuinely cared and wanted Christine to continue existing. Of course, part of that was true. You had Christine's memories so you knew she was more wealthy than anyone else in the area, but you also saw just how fun she could be if corrupted. Though she had no idea about that part....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine frowned and sighed. \"You're sick...\" she said, now giving up and putting on Laurie's skin. You watched with a smirk on her face as she finished putting on Laurie and the skin became her body. \"There...\"she said, now in Laurie's voice. \"Are you happy, you sick freak?\" the new Laurie asked, spitting at your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just keep grinning. \"Almost. There's just one little thing left to do....\" you say, pressing the second button on the ring and concentrating on her. \"Feel any different?\" you ask as she frowns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear someone...talking to me\" she says, putting her hand on her head. You knew that she was talking about that clone of you that was inside of the Laurie suit. Christine continued to hold her head as she gained the combined memories of both Laurie and the Jake-clone that was in control of the Laurie body before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. You see, there's a clone of me inside of that skin you just put on. A clone of me that also has Laurie's memories. Now, I need a new Laurie by my side as a sort of sidekick, but I want her to be just as corrupt and evil as me. Having an exact replica is fun, but honestly, it can get kind of boring. I need someone that's similar enough to me to be fun to have around, but different enough to keep things interested. Which is where you come in. I'm going to try something with you, Christine. I'm going to try to merge your mind with the mind of my clone and make a brand new person. If I'm right, you should still be in control of Laurie's body after this, but you'll be a bit...more agreeable with my desires\" you say as she starts getting scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!!! I won't let you corrupt my soul! I want to be good!\" she yells, but you just keep smiling. The new Laurie turns around to run as you press the third button on the ring, thinking about combining your clone's mind with Christine's. You can't help but get wet from the idea of your corrupt clone and Christine's sweet mind becoming one brand new person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wanted to start completely fresh with Christine and make her your home, so you wanted to get rid of all the loose ends, and the new Laurie was one of those. This way you could just have fun with total strangers with little to no repercussions when it comes to your conscience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Laurie and smile at her. \"Alright Laurie, I want you to forget the fact that you are anything other than Laurie Masters. Lose all your memories from the lives of Christine and Jake. You have only ever been Laurie Masters. You're a smart girl, and also an incredibly attractive one. You love showing off your body and using it to your advantage with both guys and girls. You love having sex and always have a hunger for it, but you also care about your grades and family. When you get back home, you're going to apologize to your brother Jake for always being such a bitch and you'll do whatever you can to make him happy from now on. Understand?\" you ask, seeing in her eyes that she took in all of the knowledge you were giving her. \"Oh, and I'm still your best friend. You know that the innocence I have is just me pretending and the two of us just love having fun together\" you add with a grin. You then pull her into a long kiss, fondling her breasts as you do before pulling away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Laurie smiles at you. \"Mmmm, that was a great time Christine. I need to get home, but I'll call you later, okay?\" she asks. You just smile at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Take your time\" you say as she leaves your house. You grin, looking down at the ring on your new finger. \"Now that my family is completely out of my life, I can move on to some real fun\" you say, licking your lips as you ran your finger over your crotch. \"I'm going to need to make some serious changes to my life style if I'm going to be in this sexy skin for the long run...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You moaned out as he kept going and you decided you wanted to take control, you were the dominant type anyway. You rolled in the bed and slammed down on his cock as it slid all the way in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm uh.. uhhh fuck yes yes yesss! God you feel so good Jakey.. harder.. harder\" you moaned out as you felt his cock pump in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh god.. Alli.. I'm gonna cum baby.. shit..\" Jake panted as he thrusted his shaft up in you before releasing his load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At that moment you both orgasmed, moaning as you were filled, you gasped and used your hands as leverage against his chest as your body spasmed. You took a deep breath and kissed Jake long and deep before rolling off him to his side to snuggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" God Jakey that was good..\" you said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just sighed and held you as he usually did after such activities in bed. Soon he'd be asleep as normal too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were woken by the sound of the front door shutting and hearing Jake's bitch sister Laurie yelling she was home. You couldn't stand her, she always acted like she was better than everyone else and it pissed you off to no end. 'Whatever, she's not my sister' you thought as you got out of bed, not waking Jake who slept soundly. You pulled on your black panties and matching lace bra and walked over to Jake's dresser with the mirror to fix yourself up a little. You looked down on it and saw a piece of paper with some notes on it. You looked closer and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ring's Functions<br>\r\n <br>\r\n1. First button turns people into wearable skins<br>\r\n 2. Second button gives you the skins memories after it's worn<br>\r\n 3. Third button suppresses skins mind and memories<br>\r\n 4. Fourth button makes duplicate of current skin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill experimenting, Christine will be my test..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read through it once again with your thoughts confused as to what the hell this note was talking about and why Jake had it on his dresser. Was this some weird joke or something he actually found? You were so lost here. You were about to wake Jake up to ask when you heard the front doorbell ring and the door open. You creaked the door open and peeked out and down the stairs to see Laurie letting Christine in. You heard the conversation a little..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey why are you here Christine, I thought you had stuff to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did but there was a change of plans, is Alli here?\" She asked smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah upstairs.. but wh..\" Laurie's words are cut off then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You could not believe what you just saw, Laurie was deflating into a pile of skin and clothes onto the floor as Christine just smiled with a hand held out in front of her.. with a ring on it! You quickly shut the door as your mind raced. 'That fucking ring is real?! Oh my god thats so cool! But fuck wait.. Christine is looking for me.. I don't even know her though.. wait the note said Christine was the experiment..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked over to Jake still asleep in bed and your mind was putting the pieces together.. what if that wasn't Jake but someone wearing him.. what if it was Jake wearing Christine.. god this was so crazy you couldn't figure it out. One way or another, you knew Christine was after you, you could hear the stair creaking. You stepped back and waited as the door to the bedroom opened.</span></div></div>",

Don't worry.. she's quite alright, it's not the first time i've done this to her\" she giggle mischievously with a grin staring you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah.. I did see.. and I know about the ring too, I didn't think it was really a thing when I read the notes..\" you said lowly as your stance changed a little.

You're looking quite damn sexy as always Alli, did you fuck Jakey's brains out tonight.. you certainly look like you did\" she said stepping closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..

But sorry to say i'm not Jake anymore.. in fact.. in a few minutes i'll be Alli Marie, the sexy college girl. And you'll be.. well I figure that out\" Jake in Christine laughed as she held her hand out about to press the first button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew exactly what was about to happen, you quickly dove in 'Christine's' direction under her arms and tackling her to the door. She hit her head good against the doorknob and you immediately pinned her hand with the ring and ripped it off as fast as you could. You scrambled back and aimed at her and hit the first button without regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No wait..!\" Christine tried yelling out as she deflated in front of you into a skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You breathed heavily and deep as you got up and looked over to Jake, still dead asleep.. if that was even Jake. You held the ring in your palm and studied it. You didn't know what Jake's plan was, but you figured he was going to steal your life and wear you just like he was Christine. You went over to her skin and found a slit in the back, and reaching in you felt something soft, upon pulling it free you saw it was Jake.. or at least his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So if I put this on.. I'd be Jake huh..\" you thought putting the ring on your right hands index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wonder what Jake was planning..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked down at his skin in your hands and then the second skin laying in the bed. You shot that Jake with the ring too just to be safe, you didn't want any interruptions while you thought either. You sighed and studied the functions listed on the paper again. You'd have to put Jake on if you wanted to find out what he was planning. You wanted to try it out anyways so you slipped off your bra and panties and began the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your legs fit pretty easily into his, you were slender there so it was no issue, but that weird warm goop in his skin threw you off at first. You looked down at your pussy and realized that once you finished this.. you'd have a cock. 'I might have to try that' you thought smirking as you pulled your boyfriends, rather now your ex-boyfriends skin over your hips and up your smooth stomach. The hard part was tucking your tits in to his chest, but after that was done all you had left was his neck and head. You yelped as you felt the skin seal up your back and giggled at your own reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well.. let's see what this fucking perv was thinking about\" you mumbled as you pushed your head into his skins head. Suddenly it sealed around you and you felt your body tingle with a cooling sensation. But that soon ended and you opened your eyes, turning to the mirror in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my god.. i'm Jake! Wow.. his muscles and voice.. everything..\" you giggled in a manner that was still your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You slipped the ring back on and hit the second button and almost collapsed from feeling light headed suddenly. Jake's memories flooded and mixed with your own, as did his personality. You saw everything he'd done up to you using the ring on him, you saw all his devious schemes and how the ring worked fully. 'Well now I know why there is 2 Jake's' you thought. After they finished being absorbed you could hear a faint voice in your head, one you quickly recognized as Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah.. fuck.. what have you done Alli! Let me go, I'm sorry for what I was gonna do babe, I just wanted to see what it was like..' he thought to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Bull shit, I saw all the memories asshole, you were going to live my life. Well guess what, tough luck cause now I know how to work that ring and I don't think i'll let you even live YOUR own life again\" you spoke aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wh..what.. babe really?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your 'Babe' anymore, we're over obviously asshole. And this ring is mine now too. I saw your plan.. and to be honest, I kinda fancy it, but there's no way I'm leaving you around!\" You laughed in a evil Jake manner now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Have you absorbed me already?! Alli you need to stop or..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or WHAT? Jake maybe you didn't know but this is my kinda thing, being dominant, in control.. and yes, you're in me now.. and like I said.. I like your plan but I don't need you for it, so I'm gonna do what you didn't have the guts to do. Erase you!\" You grinned as you began forcing your ex-boyfriend to disappear from your mind. True you had noticed parts of him melded to you but you couldn't care less. It was incredibly kinky to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No.. Alli.. i'm.. sorr..' but his mind faded and was gone before it could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmm that's better, just me now in here.. damn that got this body hard as hell\" you grinned rubbing your borrowed cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed it another moment and then hit the 1st button the ring again, Jake's skin deforming around your own. you slipped him off quickly and smiled to yourself, admiring your sexy body. 'Damn Jakes got some horny thoughts.. guess they're mine now' you thought grinning as you put the ring on again. You knew exactly what you wanted to do.. you put your finger over the 4th button, hitting it to create another skin of yourself over you..</span></div></div>",

You then remembered from Jake's memories that he had convinced the original Laurie that she was actually Jake, meaning you had essentially fucked a brainwashed Laurie. You then move to the Laurie skin on the floor and see that inside of that was another Christine. So Jake had kept making skin copies for himself and brainwashing the originals to take on new personalities. While that was certainly a turn on for you, you had a much better idea for what to do. While the original Jake might be deleted forever, you wanted to have some fun with his mess. You carefully sort out all the skins into piles on the floor. There was a grand total of two Jake skins (his original body and the one that contained his clone), one Laurie, two Christines (the original Christine that was wearing Laurie and the second one that Jake was wearing) and the one new Alli skin that you had made.  You mind was filled with all sorts of kinky things you could do with all of these things and just the thoughts of those possibilities got you so wet. You could feel a slight pushing in the back of your mind to have all the fun you wanted with this new power you had. It was as if a primal force inside of you had been awakened when you absorbed Jake into you. In fact, part of you felt like you were more Jake than Alli right now. Thought hat was a stupid thought. Clearly you were Alli, weren't you? It doesn't matter....either way, you were one horny bitch right now and you wanted to start your fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were done with your mental planning, you used the fourth ring button to make yourself four more Alli skins. You then used the first button to inflate three of those new Allis. \"Alright Ladies, I take it we're all on the same page?\" you ask them. The three copies of you nod in unison. \"Excellent\" you say as you continue to give them their orders. You pick up one Jake skin, one Christine skin and the Laurie skin and give one to each of them. \"Put on those skins and get used to them. You'll be staying int hem for the rest of your lives, or at least until we've had enough fun. Since you three are cloned directly from me, and I have all of Jake's memories, it means I also have all of Laurie's and all of Christine's. Use those to impersonate them after our fun\" you say as they nod. You grin and send the new Jake, Laurie and Christine to go and have fun in another room while you look at the three skins you had left. it was one Jake skin, one Alli skin and one Christine skin. Your newly made clones would be able to have the memories of their skins without you having to wake up their minds thanks to Jake's memories in all of them, which saved a lot of effort on that end. And now you were presented with a very special opportunity. The Jake skin you were left with was the Laurie that was rewritten, meaning you hadn't deleted it like you did the real Jake. That meant that there was still a sleeping mind in that skin that was Jake and he didn't have any knowledge of the ring, yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't quite place your finger on why, but part of you really wanted to leave him as Jake and bring him in to your plan somehow. Sure, a different version of him wanted to take over your life, but this version was still your boyfriend and you knew you could always 'persuade' him to do what you wanted. You press the first button on the ring and grin as he inflates back into a human and opens his eyes, looking incredibly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Jakey\" you say to him with a seductive smile on your face. You were still wearing only your underwear and knew that he'd be turned on from it. Your thought was proven correct as you say him immediately get hard and smile at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd I miss babe?\" he asked, assuming he had just woken up after your sex. Which was true for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin at him. \"Oh not much...I just found the coolest ring and I want you to have a little taste of the fun that it brings me\" you say to him, giving him a sexy smile. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the back of your mind, you didn't realize any changes that were going on because you were so in the moment here and now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your finger and get off of the bed, holding the ring at the new Alli. \"Good bye forever, Jake\" you say with a huge grin on your face as you prepare to start his corruption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wore a black trench coat and hat, and Christine felt nervous just being around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?

I have no protection against that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus dug into one of his coat pockets and produced a strange-looking bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will give you some protection, but follow my lead.

Leaning up and out of bed you started to it, picking up the miscellaneous trash and dirty clothes, throwing them in the trash and hamper. You grabbed the vacuum and spent the time blasting music as you continued cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n About an hour later after you put the vacuum back, you looked around your room, pleased with the results. You checked your phone and saw it had a text message from Alli reading \"Hey I'm heading over, see you in a little :)\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should probably change quick. You pulled off your shirt and shorts, grabbing some nice jeans and a black tshirt. Plain and simple was your style tonight. You looked down at your hand remembering the ring was still on your finger. You were about to remove it when you heard the door bell ring. That would be Alli you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Jake! It's for you!\" Laurie yelled upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You just frowned and rushed downstairs quickly to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You know you could've let her in.. and you didn't have to yell either\" you remarked to her as you passed by the hall doorway to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever she's not my girlfriend\" she retorted snootily as she put her headphones back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly opened the door ignoring Laurie to greet your girlfriend. She looked really hot, as was usual you thought. She was 5'6 with Auburn hair that went slightly past her shoulders and a beautifully soft face with green eyes. She was wearing her school skirt still but was wearing a black top with a half jacket over that. She was not only beautiful in the face but her body was also by far in shape. She must have had DD boobs.. they looked huge. You didn't know for sure since you had so far only seen cleavage. Her hips were curved nicely and she had toned but slender legs. How you ever got her attention was beyond you but you were happy nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Jake!\" She said smiling brightly as you two gave a quick kiss hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey babe, how was classes for you today?\" You asked as she walked in, you closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" They were ok, my professor assigned some easy homework for the weekend. Hi Laurie!\" She said friendly to your sister who simply waved an arm above her head without looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Let her be, she's in a mood I think\" you half heartedly joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alli just giggled and followed you upstairs to your bedroom, you shut the door finally alone with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My my somebody has been a maid today hmm?\" She joked as she scanned your bedroom and it's cleanliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You just blushed and kissed her on the forehead. \"Don't tease a man who cleans, it's a good thing haha. So when does that movie start hun?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well it's.. 6:32 now, and the movie starts in an hour\" she said checking her phone for the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Cool well lemme get my shoes off and a jacket and we'll head out\" you said smiling. You sat down and started getting your shoes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jake, what's the ring for? I've never seen you have it before\" she stated taking your hand to eye it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh that, no I found it today on the walk home under a tree. I looked so weird I thought I'd check it out. I should take it off actually\" you said as you pulled your hand back to remove the ring only to find.. it wouldn't budge. What? It can't be stuck it felt loose earlier today you thought. You tried pulling it again but it still wouldn't give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Need help macho man?\" Alli giggled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Honestly I think so, it's stuck, here you try pulling it off\" you said holding your hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alli grabbed the ring and started tugging on it \"what the.. it's really on there babe\" she mumbled as she tried harder to yank it off, wrapping her hand around your index finger to pull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.. babe not so hard it hurts a little\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She just nodded and gripped the ring again. You heard a slightly audible \"click\" sound and then your vision went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my head feels funny.. did I just black out you thought. You opened your eyes to see where Alli was, her back was turned to you and she was hunched over your bed. Wait.. that's.. my body?! Oh my god! You looked down at yourself and saw you were naked but visibly transparent. Did I die?! Oh my god oh my god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alli ! Babe can you hear me?!\" You yelled to her. All you heard was sobbing in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Baby wake up, wake up! What's wrong with him.. I need to go get Laurie..\" she said as she turned around to head out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You held your hand out to see if you could touch her, but she just started walking through you before she stopped and you felt a shock run through you. Suddenly you felt yourself be sucked into Alli's mouth before your vision went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ***************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli's body just stood there convulsing and shaking, her eyes flickering before she stopped and slumped to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You opened your eyes and put your hand to your head to rub it. God that must have been a dream you thought. You opened your eyes and immediately saw the two mounds hanging from your chest. You pulled your hair into view and saw.. auburn hair.. you were Alli?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the.. eeh?!\" You started as you heard your voice. You looked left to the closet door mirror and saw Alli looking back. You slowly stood and felt wobbly, the weight of her tits throwing you off balance a little. You just looked at the mirror in awe of what was happening. You looked over at your body, still lying on the bed unconscious. I.. I possessed Alli.. you thought to yourself. You had to figure this out soon. You peered down at Alli's tits again and tugged her shirt open a little to see a pink lace bra cupping her boobs. You grinned a moment.. I'm in Alli. You slowly pulled off her jacket and lifted her shirt up over her breasts and eyed them in the mirror. You slowly traced your hands to them, groping them before letting a soft whimper out. So that's what they feel like you thought. You just gazed at Alli in the reflection.. well yourself at the moment.. pondering what to do.</span></div></div>",

Alli and you hadn't gotten too physical yet, but you didn't want to pass up this experience. You just grinned and pulled your shirt completely free, before unclasping her bra, letting her tits bounce freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" They're way bigger than I thought\" you giggled in her voice as you cupped them in your tiny hands. Mmm gosh that feels nice.. do all girls feel this way with their tits? You bit your lip as small whimpers escaped you while you stroked your nipples, Alli's body sure was sensitive. You kept at this for a minute before you noticed a warm moist feeling at your crotch.. I'm.. I'm getting wet you thought. Deciding to venture more into her body you unzipped her skirt and it slid down your slender legs. You eyes the matching lace panties that showed a wet patch. You brought your hand down to the fabric and rubbed where her clit would be..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mmmmph.. fuck that felt.. unbelievable.. \" you moaned out. You slowly continued as you backed against your bedroom wall, watching yourself stroke Alli's clit through her panties in the mirror. God this was getting you horny you thought as you slipped your finger in and rubbed it. You let out soft huffs as you slumped to the floor continuing. You groped a hit in your other hand and started grinding motion with your hips. Your body was on fire.. your pussy ached for something.. you needed to be filled you thought. You eyed your body on the bed and grinned. You slowly stood and started unzipping the jeans on your body, pulling them down as well as your boxers to see what was your limp cock until a half hour ago. You had no idea why but the thought just got you more riled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started rubbing and stroking the cock to see if you could get it stiff, and to your surprise it started growing. You smiled deviously as you stroked your former cock in one hand and rubbed Alli's clit with the other. You mumbled and and slid down your panties and climbed over your body in bed. You don't know what came over you but you needed to be filled.. you gripped your cock and slowly slid down on it, your pussy stretched and filled as you swallowed it to the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uhhh.. fuck yesss.. Mmmm yesss\" you moaned as you started riding your cock, bouncing your hips while you stroked your clit and rubbed your tits with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Uh.. uh.. yes yes yes.. Mmmm I need to cum.. I can feel it. Cum for me Alli.. cum for meee\" you whimpered as your vagina became more tight and wet. You then felt your body start to spasm as you experienced your first orgasm in Alli. You just panted.. using your body's chest as leverage to stay up. Fuck that was incredibly hot.. you were now jealous of girls sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You slowly slid out your cock, gasping as it slipped out and you crawled off the bed. You just stood there eyeing your body and then the ring on your hand. That's what must have done this you thought. You then looked in the mirror and grinned again at yourself in Alli. You cupped your tits gently as you thought of what you had to do now.</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly it slid right off and you held it in Alli's petite palms. This ring must have turned me into the.. spirit.. or whatever and then I possessed Alli you thought. Studying the ring closer you saw the ornate lines that curved around it were glowing a light red. Odd that wasn't there before.. whatever I needed to figure this ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The ring had 4 of the little buttons, one which was still clicked down. Alli must have hit that one when she tried grabbing it. So if that button was what caused you to possess her.

You felt something in your throat, like you wanted to throw up. But instead of the content of your stomach, you spewed quite a long trail of mist, which quickly dissipated into air that you couldn't see it anymore. Pondering what the heck just came out of you, you suddenly saw your body moved. Soon, it woke up, shaking his head as if to dispel drowsiness. You froze, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, I'm back to my body,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" you said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He finally acknowledged you, \"oh...

I am Jake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what's going on in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both discussed and debated over what just happened. It seemed that the ring had made a clone of your soul when you pressed the second button. One of you left Alli's body, and seeing your unconscious body, opted to go back there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so one of us seems to be a clone... But who?\" you in Alli said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the ring and its maker who know... Too bad I didn't find it with an instruction manual...\" replied your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't plan to have a dead match to find out who the original is... Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Better to get along and not try to kill each other... Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both shook hands with yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you might want to zip it up,\" you gestured to your body's crotch, who still had his dick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"I don't think so... I would like a round two\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I just got dressed...\" you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*groan* Alright... I don't mind round two\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRound two was more intense since now your body could move. You both pleased each other, who was who didn't matter anymore. You both climaxed and finally rested on the bed, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew... That's awesome...\" you said in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally...\" your body approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli's body is amazing... I am terribly lucky to be his boyfriend... And now herself,\" you laughed while slowly massaging your breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...hey, do you think we can swap places? I kinda miss being her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem... If we know how to use this ring right, that is...\" you showed him the ring on your (Alli's) finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know the second button created clones of ourselves... What if you pressed the first button again? That might work...\" he suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up and inspected the ring. The first button was still clicked down since the first time you used it, but the second button was not like that, it stayed the same. You mentioned that to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... I guess that means the first button has duration, while second button is one click per use... Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So maybe if I press the first button, I'll be spirit again... But then that'd means Alli will be back to herself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the time for me to grab the ring, press first button, possess her body, and you entered... Umm, our original body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" you liked your plan so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prepared yourself, and so did your body. With a nod, you pressed the first button, but nothing happened. You pressed again, but still no result. The button stayed in pushed down position as if you were not able to press it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell? It doesn't work...\" you complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Then the answer must be either of those two buttons left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be... But which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... Also, if one is correct, what does the other do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Can it release Alli's soul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a possibility... Your pick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then... Here goes nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced yourself and pressed one of the button. Then like before, a trail of mist went out of Alli's mouth. Whose soul was that?</div></span></div></div>",

You could slowly begin to feel yourself and your body, and then the unwanted visitor as well. You reached out with your mind as you continued to assert control over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jake! Get the hell outta my body, I can't believe what you were trying to do?!' You mentally attacked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oweeee.. not so loud..' he thought back. 'I was only experimenting, and hey it got you out and back here didn't it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good cover you perv but I felt everything you did in my body, it was scary watching someone else be in control. Now just fucking.. LEAVE!' and with those final words ringing through your mind you felt Jake's presence and soul be shot out of your mouth into his actual body's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You coughed and slumped against the bed and watched as the mist flew into Jake's body, which began to spasm and shake against the wall until his hands slowly reached up to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You know that really hurt Allie..\" he spoke angrily with what seemed like a tone of exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well tough luck.. I've got the ring on my finger now and if you want to at least remain in your body you'll leave me alone.. you've really left me wondering if I can even trust you Jake..\" you said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I.. I know.. I'm sorry sweetheart.. I screwed up\" he spoke quietly, slumping to the floor looking at you with a weak face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You eyed the ring deciding what to do..</span></div></div>",

Sure, he violated your bod while he was in it, but it's not like you wouldn't have probably tried the same if you were in his shoes. In fact, you couldn't help but think his actions were kind of cute, in a demented, kinky way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the ring on your hand and smile to yourself. You knew you could accomplish so many fun things with this, even if you didn't know how to use it properly. After knowing Jake for so long, you knew that he just wouldn't be able to be creative enough to take full advantage of this power. He'd probably just keep using it for sex. You'd use it for lots of sex too, of course, but also soooo much more. There were quite a lot of super kinky possibilities. Maybe punishment enough for Jake was having him know that he could have held onto the ring if he had played his cards right, but now know that it was yours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Jake and kiss your boyfriend passionately. \"It's okay babe. I forgive you\" you say to him with your best smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Jake asked, as if he didn't hear you right. He looked at you confused and the adorable face made you giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, baby. It's just not possible for me to stay mad at you. You're too cute\" you say, kissing him again before moving back. \"But I'm going to be keeping this ring. Think about it as my present for our three year anniversary\" you say with a grin, kissing the ring on your finger. \"And maybe if you're lucky I'll use it on you in a way you'll like\" you say with a wink. You could tell by his expression that Jake wasn't happy with this, but he wasn't going to argue with you out lound since he knew that you now had all of the power. He also knew that any right to having the ring back was forfeited when he used your body for his fun, so the fact that you didn't punish him was already more than he deserved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I think I'm going to run a few tests on this ring and figure out it's true potential...make sure not to get in my way, baby\" you say to Jake as you turn around and leave his room, an evil grin on your face and a faint red tint in your eyes as you start to become corrupted by the ring's power.  </span></div></div>",

Now you had the ring all to yourself, and you could always bring Jake into the fun later on. For now, you had to find your next test subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed to the end of the hallway and started to walk down the steps, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Alli\" Jake's sister Laurie said with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Laurie! How are you?\" You ask with a grin as you look over Jake's sister. She was a really cute girl with a nicely developed body. It'd be fun to runs some tests on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie looked like she was about to answer but was interrupted by the sound of a car door closing outside. \"I'll get back to you, Alli. Christine is hear to work on something with me\"  she said, running to the door and opening it for her best friend. Alli crossed her arms over her generous chest and watched the two of them. Maybe she could use them both? That could be complicated though, maybe it would be best to just leave the house and try it on someone in the outside world that she didn't actually know. </span></div></div>",

As soon as the button is pressed, you feel a strange heat coming from the ring, though you think nothing much of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, you think nothing much of it until you open your eyes. \"What the fuck?????\" You jump up and look around. You weren't in your room anymore. You were now downstairs, where Laurie was just a few seconds ago. \"Holy shit...\" you say, breathing deeply as you hear your voice. It was much more high pitched than your normal voice. Then you notice that you feel extra weight on your chest rising and falling with your breathes. You look down, seeing two large boobs. You put your hands on them, feeling them and making sure this was actually real and that you weren't just dreaming. Then you notice the feeling of absence between your legs and the feeling of longer hair dropping down to your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh....\" you say as you look into the nearest reflection. \"I'm Laurie!\" you exclaim before noticing Laurie's phone on the ground. You quickly pick it up and hear...Christine's?... voice coming out of it. As fast as you can, you hang up before she hears too much. You were still freaking out when you toss Laurie's phone onto the couch and notice the ring on your finger still, though it was now Laurie's finger. \"This...is so damn weird....\" you say in your new voice as you hear footsteps running downstairs. You look up to see your body freaking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAKE!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!!!!!!!!\" your old body yelled loudly. It was strange, you sounded different in Laurie's ears than you thought you sounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know...I put that ring on and pressed a button\" you say, holding your hand out. \"Maybe the other button will switch us back...\" you say as you press it, hoping for the best.

She no longer seemed to be freaking out about being in your body. In fact, she shifted her posture, taking on a lazy pose that you had often used.

The second buttons seemed to make Laurie think that she was you. On top of that, the newly programmed Jake didn't seem to have any memories of the ring or what it did.

It felt like it was swelling up as all sorts of strange scenes and thoughts and feelings were pumped into your head. As it built to a crescendo, you grabbed your head to keep your skull from cracking open. Then just as suddenly, it all started to make sense, and the pain faded. In a few moments, you felt normal. Completely normal and comfortable being in Laurie's body. No longer did your new chest feel odd, or any other part or missing parts for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blink, you remembered that you needed to get ready for when Christine comes over. You and she were just discussing what to do for the evening when your annoying brother, Jake, had come in and bothered you about your mom. She had texted you earlier saying she'd be out late or until tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait a minute?</i> you thought and stared at the cell phone. <i>Those are Laurie's memories.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few quick thoughts and you remembered all sorts of things you never knew, and some you did, but all from Laurie's point of view. As your focus shifted to the ring, you realized that the third button gave you Laurie's memories. You still knew who you are, but Jake's memories - you mean <i>your</i> real memories - were there but in the back in your mind as if you saw them in a movie or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was amazing, but more than that. The way you felt now, you're sure you could act just like her as well. You turned to the mirror and noted your posture is pure Laurie, not what you saw earlier with Jake, er yourself, slouching in an unfamiliar body the way he always does. When you posed in different ways, it's exactly like Laurie does. You couldn't even make yourself do Jake poses the way he struts or brags sometimes. When you did, they looked exaggerated and nothing like you knew how you, you as Jake, look doing it, or at least how you thought you look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, this is so weird. I really have to concentrate to think or do anything like myself.</i> You smiled realizing that you probably couldn't even screw up impersonating your sister, or anyone else that you wanted to if you took them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis. I'm going over to Allison's,\" Jake offered as he bounded down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you're glad that he wouldn't be around to bother you and Christine when she got here in a little bit. Allison is a good girl for him, although you wondered how he was able to latch up with such a looker. Surely she had the pick of just about any guy. You sort of missed spending more time with him since they got together, especially since that creep Mark, your ex-boyfriend, cheated on you then seduced you ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>TMI!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK, Laurie? You look a little spacey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yeah. Just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're thinking whether you wanted to stay as your sister or not and spend the evening with Christine. She's definitely hot and dresses to show it, unlike Alli who's rather conservative in dress and actions even though she is truly a gorgeous girl as well. You might be able to show Alli the ring and see if she wanted to swap or something. You could even take over and go for second base which she's so far denied you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the ring as the Jake body turns to leave. There's only one button left. Surely it must reverse everything. A horrible thought occured to you about what if it didn't. Now would be the best time to try this while you're together and hopefully Laurie wouldn't remember or just think it was her weird imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the ring, you made your decision and . . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was also a strange feeling that the ring was giving you, as if it were watching you, but that couldn't be right. After all, it's not like rings could be alive, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept looking the ring over and saw that there were multiple button like things on the ring. You wondered what they could possibly be for and placed your thumb on one of them gently, not using enough force to push it down, but enough to feel it. Something in you was telling you to press down on it. You could feel a subtle demand in the back of your head to press it, but where could that be coming from? It wasn't like your first natural impulse would be to push down on one of those buttons. Pretty soon, the impulse was too strong to fight and you let yourself press the button on the ring. You dropped the ring to the floor as it became incredibly hot and you let out a yell. The ring started to glow and began to crack just a bit. From the crack, a black smoke exited the ring. You could hear the sound of evil laughter coming from it as the smoke rose from the ring and soon, created the outline of a silhouetted person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped open. \"What the f...\" was all you managed to say before you were overcome with fear. This shadow felt incredibly evil, as if it represented the absolute worst that humanity had to offer. Though the shadowed figure had no eyes, you felt as if it were staring at you, looking deep into your soul. Visions flashed through your mind of an ancient wizard who wanted to cure mankind of evil forever, so he did an experiment to trap every dark and twisted desire from his mind inside of this ring. All of his twisted fantasies, sexual thrills, evil drives and more became the demonic entity that was trapped within this ring, and became a power source for those who used it. Unfortunately, ripping out his darkness killed the original wizard. But thanks to the ring, his demon lived on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to shiver and noticed you could now see your own breath. The demon was making everything cold. You felt yourself getting tired and losing energy. Your vision started to go dark until everything slowly faded into darkness. </span></div></div>",

You sit up and look around slowly as your eyes adjust to the light. You knew that you were in your room. You remembered buying all the posters that were hanging up and reading all of the books scattered across the floor. You remembered taking the pictures with your girlfriend that were hanging above your bed. You stand up and smile at your reflection in the mirror. This was certainly not as attractive as your last body, but you'd been trapped inside that blasted ring for so long that it didn't matter. You were just happy to be free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jake\" you say in your stolen voice, looking into the mirror as your eyes glow a blood red. You could feel him inside of you, wondering what was going on. This boy would be a passenger in his own body until you chose to either release his soul or kill him. \"It's funny that your name is Jacob Masters....funny because I will be the master of all things with your body. Once my powers fully return to me, I shall take over everything on this stupid world, and make it something a lot more...fun. I will fill it with my beautiful chaos and the two of us can watch it burn together. Maybe we can even bring in your sexy piece of ass Alli to help us out...sorry, I meant to say MY sexy piece of ass, Alli\" you say followed by some evil laughter as you turn around and head downstairs to where you heard the television blasting at full volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie, would you mind turning down the volume?\" You ask, knowing her name from the memories floating around in your head of this life you stole. Your new sister turns around to look at you annoyed. It also seemed like she was on the phone, talking to one of her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One sec, Christine....\" she says into the phone before continuing. \"Why don't you just go take a walk or something?\" she asks you, not even looking your direction. You grin as your eyes glow, causing the TV to turn off and her phone to die. Laurie tries to get them back on without success as the glow fades away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better idea, sis. Why don't you take off your clothes, giving me a nice little strip show before the two of us have some bonding time together?\" you ask, getting her to finally turn and look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you saying? Are you drunk, Jake?\" she asks, getting up and walking over to you. As she takes her first step, your eyes start to glow as you smile at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Jake anymore, Laurie. I'm your master now and forever. Isn't that right, you slut?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues walking over to you, giggling. \"Of course that's right, master!\" she says, pulling her shirt off and throwing it to the floor. \"Now why don't we start that fun you wanted, sir?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later, you were nude on the couch. \"You know, you're pretty good at having sex, master\" she says, giving you a nice back massage after your 'bonding time.' \"I realllly enjoyed the fun we had. We should do it more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, taking a deep breath. It was the first sex you'd had in ages (literally) and boy was it worth it. Too bad the kid who's body you stole hated your guts for it. \"That can definitely be arranged. But before then, I'd like to add a few more playthings to serve me alongside you. Once I have a nice little team assembled, we can start phase two of my plan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what plan would that be, master?\" Laurie asks before giving you a gentle, teasing kiss on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrupting this world of course...but first, who do you think we should take first? My girlfriend Alli, or your BFF Christine?\" </span></div></div>",

You chuckled as you looked at that adorable face. She reminded you of a puppy that only knew how to cuddle and play. She wanted her friend here with her and you would be more than happy to oblige. Jake didn't seem to know Christine very well, but you could tell from his memories that he thought she was very attractive. In terms of flat out looks, she definitely rivaled Alli, who was by far the sexiest girl that Jake knew. It was only Jake's deep love for Alli that he had never before tried to make an advance on Laurie't hot friend. Good thing you didn't have that same problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Laurie. I'll bring in Christine first. Call her over\" you say as you get up and walk to the nearest window, looking outside. It was a beautiful summer day. Birds were chirping and children were playing in a neighboring yard. You laughed as you thought about how the whole world would be corrupted in your image in only a matter of time. In the background you can hear Laurie dialing in her phone, no doubt sending a text to Christine urging her to come over. You lick your lips thinking of all the fun you'd be having once you made her yours. Your stolen cock got hard just from fantasizing about it. This would be fun....</span></div></div>",

You were laying down on Jake's bed, and you could feel his mind inside of your body, trying his best to fight and regain control of himself. You knew his fighting was a lost cause, but that didn't stop him from being annoying. On that note, you sat up and jumped off of Jake's bed. You looked yourself over in his mirror again, getting used to calling his body yours. He was an okay looking kid, o the tall side with short black hair. He would make an acceptable home for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\" Jake asked from within his mental cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I can, Jake. Now please, do yourself a favor and let me work my magic on the world in peace. You'll get to have lots of sex and I get to have my fun. What do you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'll never stop fighting you!\" He exclaimed loudly in your mind, causing you to cringe just a bit. This was a bit too annoying for your tastes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I'd better make it quiet myself\" You say, looking down at the ring that was still on your stolen finger. You press one of the buttons on it and chuckle as it glows ever so slightly. You hear a faint humming sound and then feel a tingling sensation as Jake's soul is pulled out of his body and forced into the ring, trapping him just as you had been trapped for such a long time. On that note, you closed your eyes and took a deep breathe, bathing in the new found quiet in your head. \"Ahhhhh, much better\" You say happily as the doorbell rings. You hears the patter of Laurie's feet on the floor as she runs to answer the door. You whistle a tune as you walk out of Jake's room and to the front door, which Laurie opens with a mischievous grin on her face. Even you smile as you see who is at the door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eyes fluttering open you could see Laurie face right in front of you. She grinned widely and you were sure that there was a red gleam deep in her baby blue eyes. She giggled once she noticed that you had woken up, which caused her blonde hair, dyed so that she and her 'BFF' Christine had the same hair color, to dance in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back again, Wonderboy?\" It was Laurie's voice alright, but not the way she behaved or talked. \"You are the first fool to actually push that bloody -what do you call em now? Buttons? Yeah, that's it- Button. Everyone else has always thrown the ring away or tried to get rid of it in a more elaborate way. Was that foreboding 'Do it! Do it!' feeling not warning enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeechless, you tried to get up from the bed you were in and easily enough Laurie, or whatever was wearing your sister's face, made room. She was still wearing her shirt and skirt combo and, judging by the light outside, it was still afternoon, so at least you hadn't been out long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure whether I had been lucky up to now or not, either. My good half really knew his business. You do remember the vision, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and finally get your mouth open: \"So that wasn't a dream? That really happened?\" You didn't realize that you missed the more important first sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, pretty dumb way to die, huh? Completely 'pure' and boring. Say, the longer I'm inside this sweet body, the easier it is to talk and access her memories. Did you know that she'd love to have a better relationship with you?\" Not-Laurie had plopped down next to you, propped her head up in her hands and let her bare feet fall up and down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill flabbergasted about the situation and the swift change in topics, you managed little more than look astonished and ask lamely: \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot-Laurie seemed to be amused by this. Her grin came back full force and she continued: \"Yep, totally. Your Mom isn't in the running for any parenting awards, as far as I can tell, and you are the only one who she can vent to, you know?.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally something akin to thoughts made it through to you. \"I'm pissed off that Mom didn't bother with us either the last years, but you don't see me bitching at Laurie because of that.\" You are still missing the important part, that your SISTER is POSSESSED by an entity of PURE DEPRAVITY, but it is a reaction at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl lounging next to you twirls a lock of her hair. \"Maybe, but your Mom isn't on your case about everything. Did you know that whenever Laurie is home early enough that she has to cook? And sometimes when she didn't come home early enough, too. Or that ever since you joined college your dear sister does more and more of your chores? That she gets told all these nice little pearls, like that she should be thankful for everything? Don't look so shocked. Your sister really likes you, but she can't cope with everything on her own. And she doesn't want you to be as miserable as she is, so she keeps that to herself and spends as much time with her friends as possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Not-Laurie really enjoyed telling you how miserable your sister was. You suddenly feel like you should have protected Laurie better, that you should have seen the warning signs in your mother. She was starting to act more like your father. He had been emotionally abusive, before he finally let you three in piece. Of course, your mother never learned out of it and while she tried to do right by you and Laurie, she ended up dating men just like your father. And now it appeared that she started to act like him, too. If you could believe anything this spirit told you, that is. For now you are mainly suspicious and want to get your sister back. Even if all that stuff was a lie, Laurie was still your sister and you loved her dearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me all this?\" You just have to voice your suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh getting mistrustful, Wonderboy? But okay, I'll tell ya. Boredom mostly.\" That damnable grin is back on Laurie beautiful face as she stopped playing with her hair. You actually got a uncomfortable with how close Not-Laurie was to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you out of my sister, whatever your name is.\" You could see the ring lay next to your bed and grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, currently my name is Laurie, I think you might manage to remember that. And you might want to not play with that thing.\" You clearly saw her eyes darting to the ring and thought that you finally had some sort of leeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid what I can do this?\" You place the ring on your left hand and try to appear menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot-Laurie just goes back to twirling her hair. \"Nope. Just thought I'd warn you. You freed me after all. Keep in mind what happened when you pushed one button. Any idea what could happen if you just try em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any chance of you telling me what they do?\" You managed to grumble out, suddenly very aware that you might make it only worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've got no reason to.... BUT I could think of something you could do for... to me in exchange for information on the buttons.\" She crawled closer to you and grabbed your crotch. Her face contorted into a lustful leer. \"I hope I don't need to make myself any clearer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo shocked to move you ground out: \"You were a wizard! And I can't sleep with you for info! That's my sister, damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to sleep with you, I want to FUCK you! And do keep in mind that I'm the debauched parts of that wizard, all packed into a very hot body. You know that Laurie looks every bit as hot as your girlfriend. Don't worry, I'm not your sister, it's just her body.\" With that she closed the distance between you two and pressed her lips to yours. Despite her barely contained desire, her lips still feel so soft and sweet... </span></div></div>",

The very idea to cheat on Alli, especially with your own sister, seemed like an incredibly bad joke. You considered yourself lucky to have such a gorgeous girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a purely intellectual perspective, you knew that Laurie was incredibly beautiful herself. Blonde hair, fair skin (fitting for her usually brown tresses) dazzling baby blue eyes, round and perky C-cup breasts... you could go on, but you feel like you just read of a list. None of these mattered to you, however, because she was your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned and ground out: \"I can't, you are - I mean Laurie is my sister, that's just wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad. Then you better get to experimenting. Maybe you'll manage to make things even worse.\" Not-Laurie might have talked like she accepted your decision but her hands started to unzip your pants and snake their way through your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thing might not act like you expected of an entity of evil, but she was clearly far away from anything like 'pure' or 'good'. You needed the information, to make everything normal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking in a mixture of fear for your sister and immense arousal, you gasped: \"I accept!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot-Laurie's expression turned downright feral. \"Good choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been out of her clothes faster than you believed possible and yours weren't far behind, either. You tried your utmost to be gentle, but Not-Laurie knew exactly how to push you. The way she moved, the way she kissed you and the incredible feeling of her cunt as she speared herself on your cock. You couldn't believe how much you were enjoying this. You started to rationalize that this really wasn't your sister, that this was just her body. A body that clearly knew what to do. Slowly she prodded you into taking a bit more charge and you were putty in her hands. You noticed her climaxing way before you, but instead of stopping at that point you continued. Then finally you were cumming, deep inside your sister's vagina and you had long stopped pretending like you weren't relishing this moment. The look of pure bliss on your sister's face was gorgeous and, unknown to you, mirrored your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Laurie lifted herself of your slacking prick you felt disappointed that it was already over. That disappointment was short lived as Laurie quickly went for your dick and got to work. She got you hard, using her deft hands and skilled mouth to get you erect in what felt like record time. Shouldn't that take longer? That thought vanished quickly from your mind. She lifted her head to look directly into your eyes and smiled mischievously. She backed away and leaned into your two pillows, making herself comfortable and spreading her legs. The invitations was clear. Before she had literally fucked you. This time Laurie wanted you to fuck her. You didn't have to, you had already done what she had asked, but you weren't even considering that. You only saw your gorgeous, naked sister smiling at you, wanting you. Bringing her legs into a comfortable position, you aligned your prick and entered Laurie. Both of you quickly fell into a steady rhythm, exciting and enjoying each other. Time and again either of you would gasp the name of the other. Suddenly her legs wrapped around you and pulled you even closer as both of you were approaching your climax. With a shudder you empty yourself for the second time inside your sister, just as she moaned, deep in the throes of her own orgasm. With the last of your strength you roll on your back and pull Laurie's naked form over you. You had no idea whether she wanted another repeat but you were definitely spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling Laurie looked at you and traced circles on your chest. \"I'm glad you enjoy this as much I do, Wonderboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a mirror shattered. Your mind blanked once you understood what had happened. You hadn't just done what you agreed on, you went much, much further. What was worse is that you didn't even remember that this wasn't Laurie at all! In your mind you had had incredible sex with your sister and hadn't even minded! Even now you couldn't bring yourself to push her off you. In fact, you could do nothing but gape at Not-Laurie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This had been the best sex your lil' sis ever had, you know?\" That damnable grin marring your sister's face once again and part of you had started to enjoy seeing her look at you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to block these parts from your mind and get back to the important matter: Regaining some measure of control over the situation. \"We had a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a very romantic thing to say to a girl after something like this. It might give of the impression that you only did this for my knowledge, when we both know this isn't completely true.\" She had gotten closer to your face with every word until you were only inches apart. \"Oh fine, be like that! A deal is a deal.\" She made no effort to get up from you, however, and neither did you try to push her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going through the buttons in simple order alright? Good, so the first button allows me to possess another person and have some degree of control about her hormones, memories and personality. That means I can get inside a person, alter them a bit and get out. The second isn't <i>that </i>different, it also enables me to possess somebody, but gives me nearly free reign, allowing me to transform the body as I want to. I can't access the memories though and thus can't reliably alter the personality. It also makes the body my default one, essentially overriding the original until I choose another even if I'm out possessing someone through the first button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed odd to you. Why had the ancient wizard given the demon he wanted to use as a power source so much freedom? You stayed silent and continued to listen however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The third one allows me to access my ability to transform others. Since I can't force change upon people I am not possessing, this means I can create some form of catalyst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a medallion?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close but not quite. The catalyst needs to be something a bit more... intimate I guess. For timed changes I can conjure up liquids. For a transformation that can be more controlled something like a mask works better. It's usually more elaborate if the change is more complex, too. I'll show you once we use it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but interrupt Not-Laurie. \"Once <i>we</i> use it?\" Wouldn't it make more sense if she had said 'he' or 'I'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes 'we', do pay attention. I can't access my own powers, but I can't be forced either. So you push the button and think what you want and if I agree or you give me something in exchange I'll do it. Of course I can't do something that goes against your thoughts. That's why I possessed your sister here, you allowed me possess someone, but made no limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confused you again. \"Then why not possess me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? You are the wielder of the ring.\" Her tone made it clear that this was everything she was going to say on that subject. \"Now, before you ask any more question, let me finish. The fourth button is a reset button. It allows us to unmake the mental or physical changes to a host. That would also be possible with the other buttons, but is a lot more elegant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have two more questions.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask away.\" She seemed really comfortable using your chest as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I saw in my memory that you were totally evil. Why would he give you so much power and why are you rather nice about it? Shouldn't you, I dunno, try to murder me or something?\" That actually made you worry a lot, now that your little head wasn't so big an influence and you got over your sister being currently possessed by a ancient spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are technically two questions. It's a lot easier than it sounds: Value dissonance. To my 'good' half wrath wasn't evil, but part of righteous person. Neither was pride or overindulgence in food. I'm mainly his sexual desires and I relish in breaking taboos. Like this little incest thing we had here. Not to mention that I need you as a partner, if I want to come out and play. For the other thing? I was in that ring for what felt like eternity. Believe me, what the ring does now and what it was designed to do are very different things. Next one.\" There were things she wasn't telling you, you were sure, but you accepted her explanation for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't told me how to get you out of Laurie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that wasn't part of the deal, was it? Just that I tell you what the button's do\" If possible her grinned widened and she started rubbing her breasts against you. \"Let's make a new deal, I'll leave her body right now and you swear that you'll use the second button on someone of your choice within 24 hours. Careful, if you swear something to me you will be forced to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't something that you needed to think about. This was your sister, after all. \"I swear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now let's decide what we do with your sister.\" Her grin turned into an honest-to-god smile, that was rather beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" How she managed to always confuse you was a mystery to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I leave her right now, she will wake up in a few seconds and remember nothing, only waking up on you. I can make her black out for some time or I can try fix it myself. The question is basically: Do you want to take care of the situation or do you let me do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned and thought about it.</span></div></div>",

No, she looked like Christmas had come early. \"Press the first button again and imagine me leaving her. I have made the important changes already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That easy? I thought it would take longer and shouldn't you go to her room or something?\" You were sounding incredulous. How often would she abuse your lack of knowledge to get what she -soon it again- wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just because you don't understand it doesn't make anything complicated. Don't forget, I don't have to leave, so don't get any ideas, Wonderboy! You and me are a team of delicious sin, as far as I'm concerned\" She sounded sincere, but you just couldn't trust her. She had been manipulating you from the start, She even made you swear to give her something like a permanent body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell there is nothing for it now.&lt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip the ring on your left hand and press the first button again. You focus on the entity leaving Laurie. This time there was no compulsion to touch it. \"Like this?\" But as you ask your sister's head is resting on your chest as if she was sleeping there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, just like that, Wonderboy!\" The voice was in your mind and you couldn't determine whether it was male or female. \"Dear Laurie is going to wake up soon, be nice to her, she really doesn't have it easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell neither have you and you didn't really get what was so bad about Laurie's life. A few chores weren't that horrible. But maybe it wasn't the chores at all. It was clear to you that the spirit had downplayed what bothered your sister. Maybe it was all about how your mother made Laurie do them. That would be in line with your father, at least. He had never forced your mum to do horrible things, but when he made her do anything he managed to make it seem like torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding, Ding, Ding! Wonderboy you never cease to amaze me. I wondered how long till you make the connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could have told you, but that was probably another instance of her being needlessly cruel. And again an affirmative sound echoes through your head. You got your focus back to your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter less than a minute Laurie's body started to stir again. She turned her head and pushed some strands of her blond hair away. \"Must've nodded off. You really tired me out there, Jake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you the most wonderful smile you had ever seen on your sister's face. Then she moved her hands around your neck and pulled herself in for a kiss. Her lips were just as sweet as before and you responded eagerly. After all, you didn't know what she thought. Did she think that she came in and seduced you? Maybe the other way round? Better to just play along until you found out. Especially if it felt so very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you two separated again she went back to talking. \"I can't believe that happened. I came in here to fix our sibling relationship and vent on our dear Mother and ended up blurring out my crush on you.\" What?. \"I'm so glad that we are trying this now, especially since Mark broke up with me.\" She was done talking and snuggled into a more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you couldn't contain yourself \"Wait, What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened and she put a hand in front of her mouth. \"Didn't I tell you that Mark cheated on me? No? Well he did, said I was a frigid bitch with no life in bed.\" If Laurie behaves even remotely like she did when possessed, than her ex-boyfriend had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to salvage this somehow, the spirits giggling in your mind was no help at all, big help it turned out to be. \"Laurie, I want to try this, really, but I don't know if I can hurt Alli like this.\" You just hoped you sounded sincere. Part of you knew that, given the chance, you wouldn't say no to another round with you sister, so you probably did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie only gave you an understanding nod. \"I don't expect you to drop her. Actually, I feel bad for making you cheat on her. Alli is a really great girl. We'll figure something out, but best get into a shower now. Christine will come over later and she really doesn't to know, does she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alli is going to come, too, so it's for the best.\" You were relieved that your sister, changed as she was, hadn't lost her brain. What they did was wrong, regardless of how great it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you started to gather your clothes and Laurie made to leave for the bathroom first. Before she could leave you grabbed her on impulse and pulled her in for a last kiss. \"Don't worry about mum. I won't let her keep this up, Laurie.\" You had no idea what came over you, but it seemed like the right thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was scarlet and she only nodded, before she gave you another heart-felt smile and skipped out of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell back into your bed and contemplated the mess. Right now you had a great girlfriend and had just entered something like a relationship with your sister. That last part may not have been willingly, but you couldn't even pretend that you had put up much of a fight. In fact you didn't mind it much right now. And now you have to find someone to sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that thing would get neither Laurie nor Alli, that much was certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOhh, BOOOOH!!! Party pooper!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have left Laurie, but you certainly kept a few habits.\" You knew that you didn't have to speak, even in that low murmur you do now, but it was easier than divide between your own thoughts and the ones directed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm just kidding. I have full confidence that you'll find someone interesting, Wonderboy. We are a team after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we are a team, why do you keep trying to trick me into doing what you want?\" She wasn't just trying, she was succeeding just fine. And both of you knew this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderboy, I want you to listen to me very carefully. Right now, you are far too uptight for this to work. I can see promise in you. But I want you to live up to it. If we work together, a world of pleasure and endless fun awaits, but you think it's wrong, just like my good counterpart. I need to show you, lead you until you understand and if I have to twist your arm a bit so we can work together, I won't lose even a second of sleep about it. You'll either thank me later or you weren't right after all, in which case I at least got to see another goody goody do something he'll regret forever.\" Yep, she might not be what you pictured as 'pure-evil', but she was evil alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she told you about her plans, you felt even more paranoid. Why did she tell you? Wasn't she afraid, that you would be better equipped to deal with her now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just told me to make me more wary, right? To see what I would do or not do in my panic.\" It was frustrating that you actually started to understand how it thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo! Yep, that's why I did it. It was the truth, believe or not, but I simply wanted to see how long you would scurry about. I think you deserve a cookie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but roll your eyes at that. Of course, of all the things to pick up from your sister she went for current colloquialisms. \"Yes, that's just what I deserve, baked goods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought you got smarter. Remember the third button? For a change to manifest you need to do something. I could make you a cookie that would make it easier for you to fuck. No more chaffing and fewer breaks between the fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would it stay that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entire weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You pressed the button and focused on allowing her to create precisely what she described. You wouldn't give her another carte blanch after she 'fixed' Laurie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Be boring like that. I wanted to make it something really special, but nooooo.\" It tried to sound annoyed, but you could feel it being actually pleased. \"Now you know how to keep me in check, Wonderboy. Don't blame me when I get carried away. Though, I'm looking forward to the time when you simply trust my perfect judgement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like perverse judgement.\" You ignored her answer and thought about who would be a good... victim for the second button. You were adamant about your girlfriend and sister staying free and since you did only have 24 hours that left only a limited amount of choices. A random person just wouldn't do, he or she needed to be close, both so you could keep an eye on your 'partner' and to keep it around in case you need its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine, your sister's best friend, would be a good choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second that. She is soooo hot, I wouldn't even need to change much. And she is an orphan living on her own, too! We could spend a lot of time at her place.\" Everything that got the entity so excited couldn't be a good choice. It might prove necessary however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me 'it'. How about Mara instead? After being Laurie I feel quite feminine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, 'Mara'.\" The cookie had meanwhile materialised and you started to chew it absent-mindedly. That slight discomfort around your crotch faded and you felt like you could manage another go or three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally I get to use my powers.\" Mara sounded very giddy at that prospect. Must be because of her long imprisonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly another idea came to you: Your mother! She was always around, lived off your father's alimony and was a pain in the butt. But she was your mother, regardless of everything else. Could you do this to her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were pretty sure that your new relationship with Laurie was to blame, but you felt even more protective of your sister than before and less towards your mother. After your father left she held everything together, but with every passing month that had lessened. By now she didn't work, dated assholes and turned even emotionally abusive towards Laurie. She probably wouldn't be home today, but you had already made your decision. Your mother would be replaced by the Demon inside the ring, Mara. If you could you would spare anyone that fate, but you had needed to save Laurie. You hoped that, when everything is said and done, that Laurie would appreciate what you did for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, she totally would.\" Despite taking on the name 'Mara', the demon still didn't sound distinctively male or female inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now, she totally would bone me, you mean. I don't get why you made her think she was crushing on me. Come to think of it, is she on the pill? I came twice inside her.\" Incest was bad enough without having to worry about the consequences.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I told you I have been able to control basic things like personality, memories and hormones just fine, remember? Without the right hormones there will be no ovulation.\" You furrow your brows in confusion. \"Your sister's memories of sexed are a lot better than your own, aren't they? She can't get pregnant until I change it again, simple enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without Laurie's memories you wouldn't understand half the things you actually affect either, would you? Something unrelated, though, once I allow you to possess my mother, will you be completely out of my head, like with Laurie?\" Hopefully that would be the case. You didn't want Mara to read your thoughts. For all her talk about being a team, you couldn't trust her. Maybe she would be proven right and you will end up trusting her, but you couldn't even imagine it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. you can still direct thoughts at me, though, as long as you were the ring, but I can't simply read your mind. I'll miss your deeply philosophical thoughts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you will. Much like I will miss the sarcastic commentary.\" You could really do without Mara's mocking voice. \"When Alli is here, could you please leave things be? I need some quality time with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I really don't get why.You could have both girls as yours, just let me tweak them a bit and done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I like Alli just fine as she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you can hear the main entrance to the house open. Wasn't your mother supposed to be out for a lot longer? It's just five pm. Worried you make your way to your small lobby. And truly, there she was, Kathrin Masters, your mother looking for something. Her best years had clearly passed. He wouldn't call his mum ugly, but who would? Besides her being your mother, you really couldn't imagine a lot of guys thinking of her as attractive, however. Wavy brown hair, that was beginning to grey, body no longer in shape and quite a few wrinkles in her face. Seeing the toll her life had had on her, you started to get doubts. She was your mother, surely you can think of some better way to thank her for raising you than to make her a demon's victim. But you made a promise. Suddenly an idea popped into your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake? Listen I need to take... SON PUT ON SOME CLOTHES!\" Wow, that pitch of her voice was really annoying, hopefully Laurie didn't hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore her and You pressed the first button and concentrated on allowing Mara to posses your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the? Shouldn't you press the second one?\" The confusion was clear in her voice, still trapped in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had presses the second button, Mara wouldn't have your mother's memories. And you need Mara to have them, both so that she could impersonate her... and to find out what you were going to do with your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll do it.\" You could feel Mara leave, but this time you didn't black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(POV Mara)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frustrated as you entered the aging woman. Why did Jake chicken out now? Sure Kathrin's memories would come in handy, but you were getting impatient. Still, you would play along with him and his idea for a while longer. It had been a pleasant surprise how quickly he accepted his own sister as his lover. At first you thought that he'd be too uptight, but that was more like a wall that needed to be broken down. Now he was only worried why you made Laurie ready to jump him. As if it weren't totally obvious. It's forbidden, both are good looking and was a lot of fun. Besides, with one taboo broken Jake was already far more pliable than before. Adding Laurie, and her newly acquired kinks, would prove a very long term investment. Didn't take much effort either, because Laurie often heard that her brother was quite a catch from Christine. The siblings were lucky that family attachment was considered a weakness during your creation. A sign of lacking diligence and obstacle to true detachment and enlightenment. So you were of a different opinion and valued family somewhat. It was far from an important value, however, mostly interesting due to various taboos that sprang from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now to Kathrin. Ugh, her personality was every bit as dreary and revolting as Laurie made it out. That woman had started to resent her children, because, in her delirious mind, they had cost her her true love. Of course that wasn't everything, that would be too easy. She genuinely loved both her children, too. Their mother wasn't really aware how much she was hurting them or how hard she had made everything especially for Laurie. In fact the woman seemed ignorant of next to everything. What a pathetic, if partly admirable, existence. Just running around and fulfilling her own desires. Now if only Jake could be so blissfully self-serving. Well better scrupulous and aware than selfish and ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it, Wonderboy.\" That voice was even more annoying inside than out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... well, what does my mum think of us? Are we important to her? I need to know, Mara!\" God, that compassionate neediness was really not what you wanted to see. He should just press the button and get on with it. But why not tell him the truth? That would make it easy and cruel at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what Jake considered your trademark grin you told him. \"Yep, she loves you both, alright. Just not nearly enough to care more for you than herself. You two are a distant second behind her personal wants and needs.\" Maybe you did focus on the unpleasant part, but it wasn't like you were really lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that did it. You could see Wonderboy's world shatter and his resolve harden at the same time. It was perfect. You couldn't have enjoyed the situation more if you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she hear me? No, don't tell me. This is goodbye, mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel it and followed the flow of power. Your control shifted from personality to body. It took all of your self control to not instantly change into a smoking hot babe or a ruggedly handsome stud. But you didn't. Instead you went the subtle route and made your current body a bit more desirable. There was still that date with Kathrin's current boyfriend and changing back and forth would proof exhausting. Your power was versatile, but not limitless. In fact these limits are what excited you so in your current situation. The constant and swift alternation between having to submit and being able to dominate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you want me to continue her boring life?\" You knew the answer probably. Your ability to read the ring bearer's mind while disembodied was not nearly as complete as Jake believed it to be. But you were in no hurry to correct that misconception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long. I don't really want you to be miserable all day and take it out on me.\" He seemed sincere, but, just as he didn't trust you completely, you weren't convinced that he didn't plan to get rid of you down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake appeared on the verge of adding something. \"What is it, Wonderboy?\" His hesitation annoyed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something from you.\" His voice was surprisingly strong, considering his posture and amusing lack of pants. \"Swear to me that you don't intentionally harm me, Laurie or Alli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally you'd make use this with no mercy, but something about the way he said it touched you. Huh, you were pretty sure that compassion wasn't something you could actually feel. Not that you mind, though, just because you were more reluctant to trick him didn't mean you couldn't easily use it to ensnare your partner. And he was your partner, maybe not equal, more like a junior partner. Best not let him catch on to your growing attachment to him, so out with the grin he so disliked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you swear that you aren't going to stab me in the back, we have a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Jeez, he certainly took this very seriously. But then again it <i>was</i> a pretty serious milestone for you two. Well hopefully three soon. The nice changes you made to Laurie would make her such a great influence on her brother-turned lover. She was quite a bit more open to discoveries. And he couldn't even know how much of it had been you and how much was simply Laurie. That made you suddenly feel guilty, because you weren't sure if you could have done what you did with your new promise. You could feel the oath form now. Time to get on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just grab some things and be on my way to my date then.\" You made your way towards your new room and heard Laurie still busying herself in the shower. \"Press the third button, I want to leave you a little something before I'm too tired for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a limit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there is. I'm not omnipotent or something like that.\" At least he wasn't arguing right now, probably too happy that you swore the oath. You felt him press the button and created a small bottle of pills, tailor made to increase sexual appetite and endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya, Wonderboy!\"</span></div></div>",

You as good as killed your mother, sold her being and body to something that can only be described as a demon. Well, it\u2019s too late for second thoughts now, so you pick up the bottle with the pills. There\u2019s a little note attached that read: 'These little wonders increase libido and endurance for about an hour. I also added some of that 'no-chaffing' trick for both genders. Have fun, Wonderboy!' signed Mara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow nice of her.\u201d You absently murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There may be side-effects, but probably nothing too drastic, not with her oath. It\u2019s a lot easier to trust her, knowing that she won\u2019t, or rather can't, do anything to you and those close to you. Of course the oath was also proof that she probably had no intention to do so to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the bathroom, Laurie is taking quite some time. Before you entered you remember to get your discarded clothes. The bathroom is filled with steam and Laurie seems to be washing the shampoo out of her hair. There\u2019re a few towels ready for use, enough for both of you. Usually you would leave, but right now you need to get your mind off your mother. You think about joining Laurie in the shower, but hesitate. Just because she loves screwing you now, doesn\u2019t mean that she has no modesty. Well, you need to find out just how changed the usually confident and abrasive Laurie now is. Thus you open the shower and step in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO'S THERE!?\" The panicked voice of your sister shrieks. With her hands covering her unmentionables she spends a few moments to calm down. \"God, Jake, you jerk! I thought mum was going to yell at me again, or worse someone broke in!\" Her hands fall to her sides and a mischievous smile forms on her face. \"Well you certainly got used to this faster than I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she pulled you under the shower head and crashed her lips onto yours. Your hands instantly snake around your sister's body and press her closer to you. You enjoy running your hands down her back and around her ass nearly as much as the feeling of her tits. With each time you do it, you enjoy it more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is this little reminder running through your mind: \u2018Laurie's mind was altered so that she loved this, but what is your excuse?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You know that you have none. Once Mara forced - no persuaded is more accurate - persuaded you into fucking your sister the dam was broken. Now, only hours later, you have few misgivings beyond the occasional whispers in your mind reminding you of how wrong this is. Laurie's kisses become more demanding, but her hands didn't wander much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit sore, sis?\" A sly smirk forming on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it was totally me that nearly fell asleep right after we were done, thanks for reminding me, wuss! You know, we could go another round after the girls go home again. Or is Alli staying the night? Could be a lot of fun. Sharing is caring, brother. I know I wouldn't mind sharing with you.\" She seems a bit too interested in that topic. You aren\u2019t sure if that, too, is Mara's fault, because from what you\u2019ve noticed, your sister has always been a curious one. Especially in terms of sexuality, if the time you caught her naked with Christine is anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so. Mum packed more clothes, so she might be gone till Sunday. We can spend the time together.\" You turned Laurie around and washed her back, something she very clearly enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to it,\" she purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was nearly done before you entered and quickly finishes up, leaving the cramped space to you. Taking your own long overdue shower, you contemplate what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you tell your girlfriend? Before you haven\u2019t even considered it, but Laurie seems to want it. The main problem is that without Mara you have no way to control the situation. What will you tell your girlfriend? 'Hi Alli! Listen, this demon from antiquity made Laurie a sexual deviant and she wants to fuck us, interested?' No that wouldn't do at all. After finishing you grab some underwear and make for your room. Without hurry you put on some clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the doorbell and then Laurie greeting someone with exuberance. Christine seems to be early, she shouldn't be here for more than an hour, but you don\u2019t mind her being around. For one she is hot as hell. Natural blond hair, fascinating grey eyes and a smile that you\u2019d usually find in a commercial. Her body is a perfect package as well, already matching the looks of professional cheerleader. Now that you know how your sister looks naked, you can imagine how many guys ended up with blue balls when those two went out to party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they even go out to party? You realize that you don\u2019t know much about your sister or her best friend. Well, this will probably fix itself in time now. Of course not everything was great about Christine. Everyone has their little weird habits. You walk downstairs to wait for Allison in the living room and also see the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Jake,\" Christine greets you quietly and a slight wave of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Christine,\u201c you respond warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re in my room, if you need something, Jake!\u201d Laurie announced, clearly in a great mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walk past you. Laurie has mainly eyes for her glasses, making sure they were fine. She usually left them lying around the second she came home from school and must have found them somewhere. Then she gives you a sudden smile and you respond automatically in kind. Christine seems to be very surprised by this and her eyes dart from Laurie to you and back again, trying to understand why you two are suddenly so cordial. Usually Laurie would either be terse, tense or ignore you entirely. So you just shrug your shoulders at her and hope that your sister would find a reasonable explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not too long until Alli shows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend is a vision regardless how often you see her. While Laurie and Christine may be comparable in looks, to you Allison is everything you want and everything you need when it comes to appearances. Brown hair with a few soft curls and bright green eyes, with a cute nose set in a heart shaped face and crowned with a downright heart melting smile. Not quite as athletic as Christine, Alli reminded you more of a soon-to-be model: Thin, with soft curves around waist and hips. If she had faults, they either added to her charm or are downright invisible to you. Even in Flip-Flops, slacks, a wide shirt and a rucksack on her back, she looks gorgeous to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, since you are absolutely in love with this girl, you are probably not a reliable source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best part about her, however, is how perfect she seems to understand you. She's kind and gentle, open to new things, but also ready to remind you that there are limits. Not that you hit those limits all that often, seeing how you usually are just as good at reading her. Sometimes it looks like the two of you can reach each other's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison doesn't wait for you to invite her inside. She goes in, closes the door behind her and gives you a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you,\" she breathes in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel all warm and fuzzy inside and remember that you extended Mara's vow to Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed you, too, Angel.\" And she is your angel in every sense of the word, having come to make your life brighter just when your mother dropped deeper and deeper. You shake those thoughts out of your head. As painful as it was, your mother is no longer there to hurt you or your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" you say and break the embrace. \"My mum is out for most of the weekend and we have the house to ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Laurie? She usually throws a tantrum ever time your mother is out.\" Alli asked with concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be no problem this time,\" you assure her. \"We cleared some things up between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! Hopefully that peace is here to stay.\" Of course, Alli would be happy for you. \"She can't have it easy all on her own with your mother.\" This goes to show just how clueless you sometimes are, when your girlfriend is more aware of your sister's troubles than you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a large part of our problem, actually. To cut a long story short, I promised to help her more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you keep chatting and get ready to watch a movie. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You and your brother are never this nice to each other?\" you ask while sitting on Laurie's bed rubbing your head. You had a slight headache before you left but it was getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was busy digging through her closet looking for something when she turned around and responded, \"It's the most amazing thing. We had a good brother sister session and we finally connected on a deeper level,\" she grinned. That really didn't answer your question, but Laurie was acting a bit goofy and you weren't in the mood to figure out her miserable family. Though Jake wasn't as bad as her mom, he still had a creepy vibe. Laurie returned to her digging before declaring,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha, here it is!\" Holding up a large strawberry flavored wine cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, \"Really Laurie? You expect me to drink that sugar water? I don't want to get fat while we are still cheerleading. It isn't even cold...\" Laurie had mentioned at school she had flirted with a guy and convinced him to get some alcohol, but you were hoping for some good liquor or even beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to relax Christie,\" she went over to her computer and turned on some pop music, \"Just be lucky I even got this. I seem to remember your attempt at getting alcohol didn't go so well.\" your face reddened as you remember tripping over the curb in your heels as you approached some guy to buy you some vodka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you are right. I should be happy just to have anything. Between applying for colleges and next month's competition, I think the stress is getting to me,\" you admitted rubbing your head once again, \"Hey do you have any aspirin? I this headache is really getting to me.\" You knew alcohol and aspirin was a bad idea, but you didn't want to wake up to it tomorrow along with a potential hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be some in the bathroom. I'll go get some glasses and ice to and we can have some real fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Thanks Laurie,\" you get up and walk over to the bathroom. Looking at the counter, you spotted an unlabeled bottle of pills. Laurie's and Jake's bathroom didn't have a medicine cabinet, so you figured this is what she meant. Grabbing a couple of pills and getting some water from the faucet with your other hand, you down the pills and head back to the bedroom. A tingly feeling filled your throat, then stomach, then just about everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, I am feeling good. Like, really good!\"</i> you think. Sitting back on the bed, you loins now started to tingle. You could feel your panties dampen and your vagina began to moisten. It was taking all of your willpower to not finger yourself right now and rub your hardened nipples that were poking through your bra. However, your own thoughts were jostled by your right hand plunging underneath the waistband of your skirt. A slight moan escapes your lips and you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As mean as she can be, she's still my mom, and I'd rather have her as untouched as possible. But maybe later, we'll be able to fix her up a bit to make her nicer to Laurie and myself. How about that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, keep in mind that I'm the one that makes the deals with you, not the other way around. But I like the sound of getting to play around with her later, Wonderboy.\" You figured she would. But the changes to your mother would have to wait until later. For now, you had to focus on finding Mara a host since you actually had a time limit on that and knew you were prone to putting things off if you weren't careful. You head upstairs and go into Laurie's room just as she was getting out of the shower. Laurie was wrapped in a towel and int he process of drying her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's up?\" she asked you with her smile that immediately lightened your mood even though you knew you'd have to ask her something she probably wouldn't be okay with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is Christine coming over?\" you ask her, not wasting time asking anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she said she'd be here pretty soon...why?\"  You smile. This should be over soon and then the pressure of finding Mara a home will be over. But this would still mean that Laurie would be losing her best friend, and you certainly weren't happy about that, knowing how bad her life was right now. This left you in a bit of a troubling situation. You certainly could not give Mara Alli's body, since she was too important to you. This left Christine as the only option since she wasn't family to you or important enough for you to personally miss. The question was whether or not Laurie would help you do this...You could try explaining the situation to Laurie and getting her help honestly, or you could make things easy and use the first button to let Mara change Laurie's mind a bit, making her okay with sacrificing Christine....That second option would certainly make things easier for everyone, but still...it was Laurie. did you really want to enlist her help in giving her best friend's body over to an evil entity?</span></div></div>",

You knew that she wouldn't just willingly lose her best friend, but you also didn't have much of a choice here. Your options were your mother, Laurie, or Christine. Christine was the only one you were willing to sacrifice for this and so Laurie would have to be willing to do that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know what to do, Mara' you think with a twinge of regret as you look at Laurie. \"Oh, no real reason. I just found a ring that contains an ancient demonic creature in it and I need to give her Christine's body. You're okay with that, right?\" You ask as you press a button on the ring and feel Mara flying out. You see smoke quickly fly into Laurie's mouth before she even has a chance to react to your question. Her eyes glow bright red as her body shakes and spasms as Mara takes over. After a few moments, she smiles evilly and licks her lips, the glow staying in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, you know this body isn't so bad, Jakey? You sure you don't want me to just be Laurie?\" Mara asked from inside of your sister's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yes, I'm sure. Just make your changes and leave her please\" you say, really not being in the mood for this. Why was Mara even asking that? Did she really think you'd give her your sister after already deciding on giving her Christine? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're no fun\" she said with a pouting face as a look of concentration came to her. After a second or two she smiled at you. \"All done, master\" she said with a wink before the smoke left Laurie's body and flew back into the ring. Laurie's body looked like it lost balance for a little but then recovered and briefly held her hand to her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurie? Are you alright?\" You asked with some concern as you ran over to her and held her to make sure she could stand. Laurie wrapped her arm around you for balance and settled her hand on your ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I'm fine Jakey\" she said in a strangely seductive voice. before moving her hand away and taking a step back. \"Sorry for giving you a little scare, I must have tripped or something\" she said with a shrug, as she unbuttoned the top of her blouse, giving a better view of her chest. \"Anyway, Christine will be here soon and we'd better get ready to give her her new driver, shouldn't we?\" she asked, not seeming to care about what would happen to her friend. You pause for a little, thinking that maybe Mara had gone a little too far with Laurie, but part of you didn't really mind. This would certainly be more interesting. Suddenly, the two of you were interrupted by a knock on the door. </span></div></div>",

Are you ready for me?\" Most of your friends know they can just let themselves in after knocking, so you aren't surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get her, Jake. You should put some clothes on before you take her over,\" Laurie told you as she heads downstairs just wearing the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Wonderboy. It's a bit early to parade your manhood until I get my new body and we share,\" came a thought into your head. Obviously, Mara can still communicate with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're partners, and partners share. It's makes it so much better,\" Mara chortled demonically. Of course, her being a demon, you'd expect that type of laugh. It's just that maybe you expected and were accepting too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed and angry, you decide not to comment and stride quickly into your room. As you search for your clothes, your mind thinks about Christine. She's an exceptionally attractive girl with those long, toned legs that she always displays below short skirts and shorts. Her hips flare out just right, not yet expanded to that matronly form but far from being flat. Her abs are perfectly centered around a piercing in her navel. Sometimes it's a colored jewel, and sometimes, a little trinket. You've always thought it was hot when she attached a key with a chain that would dangle below her waistband as if it lead to her special entrance. Your manhood hardens as you imagine what piercings she may have down there threaded together with a lock for that key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a struggle to button your fly with your boner sticking up, but you finally get it tucked inside. When you pull your shirt on, you can hear Christine's voice talking to your sister. It's a breathy alto that has your cock trying to break back out. You picture Christine's face of cute innocence and angelic blond hair that truly belies her personality and the rest of her body. She's fond of wearing low-cut blouses that show off her ample cleavage. Her bust is not excessive but fitting for her five foot seven height and slender model build. If you weren't dating Alli and Christine wasn't your sister's best friend, you might make a move on her. The thought that you're about to turn that body over to Mara makes you shiver with both excitement and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you hear footsteps getting close up the stairs, you make sure your door is cracked as you prepare to push the button and send Mara into the girl with Laurie. With eyes closed, you concentrate as you grasp the ring on your finger. As the footsteps come at your door, you think to Mara and push the button on the ring, <i>OK. Take the girl with Laurie.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open you eyes and look out, you see Laurie and ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough, Christine was standing next to Laurie. She was just as attractive as you were just imagining her to be, wearing a tight fitting pink tank top that was cut low enough to show off her ample chest well. Her black leggings were tight and accented her great legs. The two girls were smiling and laughing, probably gossiping about boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh I'm going to love it in there, Wonderboy\" Mara said happily as you feel her leaving your mind and exiting your body through the ring. A cloud of black smoke flies out of the ring with lightning spead, going straight into Christine's open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprised Christine started gagging in midsentence as your demonic...friend? forced her way into the girls body. Christine's whole body was shaking as if every cell that made it up was trying to push the demonic invader way. Christine's eyes started glowing bright red and her body fell limply into Laurie, who caught her and lowered her to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Christine, but Jakey and I are are going to have sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much fun with the new you\" Laurie said to her former best friend'said sleeping body. Again, Jake felt a twinge of regret in his mind. He and Mara had essentially turned his sweet and innocent sister into a sociopath. Wasn't that wrong? Jake looked down at the ring in his finger that allowed him to control Mara. If he wasn't careful, he could end up working for it, rather than the other way around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake watched the sleeping Christine's chest expand and concract, his erecting quickly changed his mind. Because of Christine's shirt and how she was laying, Jake got an amazing view of the side of her chest and boy, we're those things massive. Sure, he may be dating an also attractive girl, but what use was having a demonic servant if you didn't let yourself relax and give into a sexual desire or two? You kneel down and put your hand on top of one of Christine's dainty ones and notice that her nails were painted black, the color of her new soul. You grin and whisper into her ear, \"hurry up, Mara. I really want to play with her...I mean you\" you say with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie leans against the wall with an evil grin on her formerly innocent face. In her new mentality, she was much more than a little bit more seductive and willing to let her best friend be taken over by a denom. She was also Mara's slave, and and she was so happy to see her mistress taking over a body. She knew that Mara had more plans than just proving Jakey with sexual fantasies. Soon enough, Jake would give in completely to his inner temptations. His soul would become completely corrupted, perfectly cooked for Mara to eat it up and take his empty body for her own completely freely, using it without fear of a master to command things of her until he died and she would have to return to the ring to wait for a new victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your and Laurie's thoughts were interrupted suddenly as...</span></div></div>",

As she looked down at herself, her hands raised and cradled her chests juggling them slightly as she walked forward into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No. This can't be,</i> you thought stunned. When she moved past, you looked into the hall only to see Laurie entering her room by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right,\" you said turning back inside wondering why it was Alli that Mara had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, this is so right, Wonderboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were suppose to be Christine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'd rather have Christine than this?\" she purrs unbuttoning her blouse to give you a much clearer view of her grand cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your arousal rising, you could only mumble, \"But where's Christine? I heard her. She should have been with Laurie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's downstairs waiting. We both arrived at the same time, but I came up for you, Wonderboy. I thought you'd want me to come,\" she purred seductively at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlli had finished unbuttoning her blouse and dropped it to the floor before popping her bra and doing the same. You eyes went wide as blood shifted south of the border halting your previous thoughts and leaving your mouth hanging open, words unable to come out. You had never seen Alli undressed or even her in her bra. Of course, you knew the shape from when she wore bathing suits, but now her naked chest in all its glory was exposed. She held them up, and they peered at you. One winked as she moved her thumb over the nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" Alli's voice moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was gaze upon the lovely mounds as they hypnotized you. Their smooth, snow-colored slopes topped with a dirty-brown crown. Small dots circled the edges as grand pillars rose in the centers. They invited your touch although you seemed unable to move. Your pants suddenly felt very constraining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop! Think. You can't let it be Alli,</i> your mind screamed breaking your trance. Looking away to the ring, you muttered, \"I n-need to reverse this and put you in Christine. Is that this last button?\" You started your thumb over the button, but Alli's voice stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably don't want to do that and have Alli wake up and find herself half naked in your room.\" Then she added with a smirk, \"Although that would be quite an interesting way to start her indoctrination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Right. But I need you to switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I, Wonderboy? You gave me this body and put me in it. I like it,\" Alli said jostling her boobs, causing your eyes to again fixate on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wake up, stupid,</i> your conscious cried, but it sounded like a faint whisper from across the room. Your hand slacked from the ring as Alli put on an sweet, innocently seductive smile. <i>NO!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, but <i>please</i>,\" you begged. \"I'll do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a pout putting her hands on her hips. \"You should have watched what you were doing, but I guess I could move again, if ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat demonic grin again filled her face. You get a very uneasy feeling as her eyes measure your crotch like a succubus. After a few seconds she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is swear to me to do something for me for this 'inconvenience' that you have caused. I will leave this body for another. Just remember that if you swear that, then you must do it or will be forced to do it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara knew that it wouldn't take too much to keep corrupting Jake, especially how he fumbles into everything, like this. How easily it was for him to take his own sister. Jake was weak and already leaning to the perverted side that Mara knew so well. She would lead him until that was all he had and at the same time break Christine and Jake's innocent girlfriend, Alli. Jake was both blind to it happening and deeply lustful of the latter underneath his respectable facade. Mara knew all this because she had so much of Jake's deepest, darkest desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no way you want Mara in Alli, but you're unsure what devious scheme Mara will want you to perform. You didn't have to swear if it is too terrible; however, she had left you little choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, what is it that you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a partner, I'm not going to force you into one thing. I'll give you a choice and let you chose.\" She then held out one delightful breast as she told you, \"I want you to ...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There are only a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 1.) Write good chapters please, nothing that is a one liner or simply says \"what happened next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) I would appreciate good grammar, otherwise I have to spend time fixing the chapters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) There are plenty of fetishes, Taboo, perversion, TG and more in this story, but certain ones will be removed if they do not belong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 4.)
