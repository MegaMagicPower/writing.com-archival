On her death bed she made your dad promise to protect her baby girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad promised, and kept it for the past 10 years; nothing in your life has ever hurt you. Not even your neighbors big, mean dog when it went mad and broke through the fence into your back yard, where you were playing dolls when you where 7. The dog snarled at you and made you cry. That was when your dad came out of nowhere and gave the dog a stare that made it seem like a bug. The dog ran away after that and your dad got you an Ice-cream to make you fell better. Yes your dad is one of the nicest people you know even if he is a little weird. By weird you mean he acts like Ichigo\u2019s dad. (Bleach) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura what happened to you, you fell unconscious during school?\u201d your dad asks before saying \u201cYour friend Nina and her twin brother Max carried you here from the track field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey did I\u2019m going to have to thank them.\u201d You said as you tried to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOo, no you don\u2019t.\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice from the other side of the curtain. It was in fact the school nurse \u201cYou passed out during P,E so I\u2019m going to have to ask you to rest for a bit while I talk to your dad.\u201d Then the nurse saw the look in your eyes, so she said \u201cI will call Nina and Max for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d you said to the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina and Max were there in 7 minutes<br>\r\n\u201cSakura, are you ok.\u201d They both ask at the same time. Nina came up and hugged you, Max who valued his life did not touch you because your over -protective dad was so close, the last time he hugged you in front of your dad he was 9 and some how he \u201cSlipped\u201d and fell down the steps, your dad said he \u201ctried\u201d to stop it but was too late. After that Max has never touched you with in a mile of your dad, you always thought it funny because you never put 2 and 2 together. Even after that Max never hated you, he was just scared of your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 minutes of talking with your friends they had to go back to class. As they left your dad and the nurse came back in. Your dad had a worried expression on his face. The nurse was the first to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakura, I don\u2019t know how to put this but it seems that when you passed out you developed an aura\u2026 Not only that but I can\u2019t seem to be able to say what type of aura you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you remembered your dream, the \u201cPara-Dream\u201d that you had. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
