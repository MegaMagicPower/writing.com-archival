You look down at him chipping happily at the destruction he caused but you stare back disapprovingly and he bows his head sadly. You stroke his head gently \" don't worry I am not mad but you can't do that in here, it's bad\". He perked up a little but you stared a the burnt spot in your recliner and began to think. As long as he couldn't control his breath you ran the risk of him burning down your house, maybe it might be better to put him in your backyard. Who knows he might love the woods but get lost or set a forest fire if left unattended. That gave you idea. Over the course of the week you checked all and installed more smoke detectors in your house along with the fire extinguishers. You made dummies from sticks and dry leaves wrapped with paper and put it in a outdoor fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does it go?</span></div></div>",

How is there even a dragon here at all?\" After a  moment of asking dumb questions to a dragon that it can not answer - outside of calling you \"daddy,\" again - you take it upon yourself to see if there are any other eggs abandoned within the caves. You slowly explore deeper into the black caverns. A small crack like entrance catches your eye and you are quick to explore the long narrow pathway that leads deeper underground. As you walk, hunched over, the cold damp air of the cave is in surprising contrast to the young dragon's warm body. There are many things about this that are not ideal and in any other situation would scare you, but as far as this little heat source in your arms is concerned, it is quite welcome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time the sloping path enters into a large room with a vaulting ceiling and a soft trickle of water breaking the eternal silences of the underworld, as it flows from some unseen stream into a large pool of black water. You stand in awe for a moment on the ledge of the path as your flashlight pierces the darkness to reveal an obelisk jetting out from the black pool. You continue down the path you have been following as it slowly encircles the cave wall as it descends onto the smooth open floor of the cavern. Softly you set the dragon down as you walk forwards towards the black waters with your eyes fixed on the ancient runes that cover the obelisk. The little dragon trails behind you as you continue to walk to the water's edge. A calm nervous feeling guides you forwards as you try to make out the symbols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the water, you look down at your reflection in the rippling pool before being plunged into complete darkness as your flashlight dies. You freeze in fear as you find yourself hopelessly trapped. You then almost jump as you feel something hot slides across your leg and start to nip at your shorts. As you swallow your fear the world comes back into focus and you remember your new friend and bend down to pick it up. As you hold it tightly in your arms some odd happens.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stand in front of the tiny dragon. The little light blue lizard was beaming up at you, its tail sliding left and right behind it on the floor. The smooth scales make a shuffling sound on the wooden floor. Nirrus sat on his haunches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNirrus looks like a complex dragon, scale plates lined from just below the crane of his neck to the tip of his tail, softly clicking with every movement made. The belly of this creature was smooth and flat, which from this angle was hard to tell, as the little guy only sat at the height of about your knees. (Bigger but slightly less intimidating than the average house pet). One would think dragons do not exist, but this little creature, sitting in front of you, completely changes what you had believed to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon below you chirps anxiously, looking around for something to do, but it held itself back from the ever so tempting destruction of inanimate objects that sat in the most obscure of places. It glances back and forth between you and a cup sitting on a nearby table. The cup looked like the strangest of things and it was the most important toy in the room. A mere moment before his attention is caught by something else you crouch down in front of him. This new found movement excited the dragon, and it chirped again, happy that something interesting is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspect the dragon even further, admiring the scales and otherworldly textures of his relatively blue skin, entirely different to the world around him. You attempt to stroke the top of his head, but the overly ecstatic lizard pushes forward and, before you can react, knocks you backwards. You try to catch yourself but end up sitting on the floor too. Nirrus takes advantage of your downed position by hopping onto your legs and wagging his hips in playfulness. It sniffs and licks and invades the personal space you admired so dearly, inspecting every square inch of your front to see what kind of creature you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push against the dragon softly, a gentle response that you want to get up. He doesn't listen or acknowledge your motion. After growing a bit disgruntled you take matters into your own hands by lifting the dragon up by its torso. Nirrus goes stiff- this new experience- what was happening? He looked down and around as you shuffled onto your feet. It seems that Nirrus doesn't quite know what to do with the rest of his body other than his head, and it hangs limp while he looks in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at Nirrus, he stops and stares back into your eyes, you feel... entranced... this little turquoise lizard is stunningly beautiful, and cute, and just so innocent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNirrus shifted nervously, being suspended in air for a bit. You snap back into reality to find that it was apparent the day was nearing its end. You hold Nirrus closer to your body and cradle him in your arms. While you look for a room, or really any place you can put a baby dragon to sleep, Nirrus squirms in your grasp. You become exhausted trying to keep him in your reach and end up just letting him onto the floor of the living room. The lizard squeals with delight and hops up onto the couch you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were a bit hesitant to let this rambunctious dragon jump on your furniture, you figure it wouldn't harm the couch so much in contrast to Nirrus if he were upset. He seems to curious and young to be distressed, much less angry, and his destructive tendencies that he has towards some of your valuables doesn't actually warrant any caution. Not yet, anyway. You don't know how much this softly green dragon will grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out the window and into the forest. The window having been open this whole time, the curtains swaying softly from the mountain breeze. You weren't on a mountain, per say, but more of a coastline. And if you knew anything about nature, you were certain the coast had something to do with this mystical, mythical creature being here. This dragon came from an egg... eggs are usually small compared to their layers, the parents... which would lead to the obvious conclusion that maybe they get their food from the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put, your reason for being alone was that you enjoyed the gorgeousness of the forest and coast. If there was one place you wished to stay... it'd be here. Loneliness was one of the greatest factors to your great love and admiration for the scenery. You could enjoy the world silently, the freezing air and smell of damp plants from the rain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now there's a dragon. In your home. You break from your elongated state of peace and stare back to the spot where Nirrus was. The green dragon was pawing at a spot on your couch, obviously intent on accomplishing something... but what? You make your way to close the window then stand next to the occupied lizard. While listening to him chirp and sit and brush his body against parts of the same spot you finally realize that the little dragon is tired and sleepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and crouch next to Nirrus, this time with a good hold on the armrest so you don't fall again. Nirrus doesn't realize you are staring at him until he conveniently turns his head in front of your face. It spooks him momentarily before he gives a rapid few squeaks of mixed pleasure and crossness, before stopping at inspecting you again. His shiny eyes look at you for help, you imagine in your head his voice, 'what are you doing there?'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle and stand up, he cranes his neck to continue staring at you once more. A motherly feeling take root in your chest, causing you to slowly pick up the dragon, but this time you turn to sit on the couch. While you take the time to sit down Nirrus starts to squirm again, but his efforts slowly faded with his drowsy state. At this point in the day it had become almost dark, borderline between pitch blackness and the soft, deep red of the sun. The stars had come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finally relax, Nirrus lays on your body, spread out, too tired to continue. With all the exploring of your house he did today you weren't surprised to see him yawning and smacking his lips, settling down and curling up on your lap. His wings folded perfectly and out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn as well, stroking Nirrus's back and scratching behind his ears. He vibrated, an audible mix of purring and growling... it seems that he's content, you imagine. What a weird sound, a dragon purring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're caught off guard as you stare at Nirrus's body, wasn't it light blue before, or blue? No wait, turquoise, green? Because now it was a calming yellow. You look closely at Nirrus's scales, your face inches away from his rising and falling chest. Surely enough, it was changing color, but excruciatingly slow. Nirrus looked at you through his half closed eyes and gave you an affectionate lick on the face. You bite your lips calmly as a chill goes do your spine. The heat of his tongue harshly reminding you of how ice cold your feet are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly move, making sure Nirrus isn't disturbed while you wrap a nearby blanket around your legs. Looks like you're sleeping on the couch with a baby dragon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun sets, and all there is is darkness, and the light of the stars cascading into the house from the outside in. Just as you're about to close your eyes... Nirrus suddenly starts to change color once more... but this time, it was quick. What amounted before you, you could only describe as unnatural. His skin, belly, scales, wings, everything on him was swirling, the shade of color, into a deep black. You're taken aback as he starts to glow in random places- the trims of his body and scales shone a nearly blinding white- the tip of his tail too! Random colors, sparkles, twisted and appeared everywhere, much like he was see through, but you knew better that he wasn't upon stroking his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fluttered open again to see you petting him. His eyes never changed, still the icy white you remember. He chirps lovingly before rolling on his back. He fidgeted in place, making use of your legs once again for comfort. You finally recognized what it was that he looked like- he looked like the night sky! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile absentmindedly petting his warm belly, you felt another heat from a part of his body you didn't expect... even though the outside of his body was cosmic... the red flesh of his abnormally shaped dick was unchanged. It slid out of an odd slit, positioned between his hind legs. You were slightly perturbed at the sight of it... the smell of young dragon musk flooded your nostrils. It stuck you odd he had no balls. They must be on the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was- or it <i>felt</i>- wrong. Your own bulge was growing at the sight of Nirrus's length... and you, for some reason, felt jealous that it was, indeed, longer <i>and</i> thicker than yours... and it was only a day old!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a final time you cast aside your attention to it and focus on trying to sleep... as it was your duty now to take care of this little dragon.</span></div></div>",

I bought some rabbits and let them breed, of course the amount of them was massive, I had to buy twenty to keep Halaria full. but about six months Halaria was as big as a horse and had to stay outside, Thankfully Zander's business was profitable.<br>\r\nOne day though he got a knock on his door. He answered, It was people from the state. their reason for coming was to tell him that he couldn't have a horse in city limits. He was told to get rid of the horse or move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent time looking for a good house in the country... after a week of searching he found the best house he could for a reasonable price. 100k 3 bed 2 bathroom, and two living rooms, with property size of 30 acres.<br>\r\nHe was able to secure a price 95k, he bought it on the spot. He then had to get everything moved. after moving the rabbits <br>\r\nhe then got Halaria who was sad that she couldn't be with him. She cheered up when she saw him, he moved the 'horse' to his new property. After settling in he returned to his old house, and cleaned it up. He looked into renting it out, it seemed to be a nice, neighborhood. So he rented it out for a reasonable price. The family that moved there did complain of it smelling odd. He took note and did his best to get rid of the smell, only time could get rid of the smell.<br>\r\nAs another three months past Halaria was now a good foot over Zander. She became a good hunter, so the rabbit farm was just a back up if she needed to eat, however it was noticed that she searched out for stimulation. She would take tool handles, and sometime living things and shoved them up her vent.<br>\r\nZander would have to handle this somehow... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zander came over to her and stopped her.<br>\r\n\"But daddy my slit is wanting something.\"<br>\r\n\"Then let me help.\"<br>\r\nZander then stuck his arm up the hole in the slit, as it would have it she wanted more. So Zander put his other arm up in there too. Halaria was purring now, but it still wasn't enough, even so Zander didn't have the leverage to do much else.<br>\r\nBut Halaria helped by sitting on him. The anus had the feces smell, but it also had a cinnamon smell too.<br>\r\nHalaria purred and Zander made her purr more by squirming. After about fifteen minutes she pressed him out.<br>\r\n\"Thanks daddy but my slit is still wanting.\"<br>\r\nSo breeding season for her struck, and being the only dragon around, she wouldn't have any stimulation.<br>\r\nSo it was up to Zander to fill that hole, almost literally. So Zander stepped up to her slit once more and pressed an arm up the slot in the slit, and started to stimulate her. Zander used his other arm to stimulate the clit, the clit was on the middle flesh in the slit, Halaria moaned in pleasure. She kept on moaning and after ten minutes she had her release. After collapsing, she purred and curled in pleasure. Zander though wanted one more thing of her. Zander crouched down to her slit once more. Then put his feet in, Halaria rolled to her back, letting go a low pleasured howl. With the new position Zander slipped into the slit and through the slot. He curled up in Halaria's womb, he heard her said, \"stay with me daddy.\"</span></div></div>",

At the age of one, she was able to talk, walk, fly, and be able to spell.  When she turned ten, she found out that you weren't her dad by asking you where she came from, and after that she started calling you by your first name, which you were fine with.  At the age of fourteen, she started to go in heat for the first time.  It was also around that time in which she had developed a romantic crush on you.  Now, she is a 15 foot 9 inch tall dragoness, with a wingspan of 35 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up that morning to feel Halaria stroking your clothed crotch very gently while she sat on the ground next to the side of your bed.  Apparently, her dragon vagina was slightly leaking sexual fluids onto her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Zandy-poo~\" Halaria said to you in a sweet and sexy manner.  \"How did you sleep last night?\"<br>\r\n\"Morning... Halaria.  I slept alright... I guess,\" you replied back to her, trying to ignore the hard on that you getting in your crotch.  \"W-w-w-w-w-what are y-y-y-you d-d-d-doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Zander, I have always wanted to say this for the past two years:  Ever since I found out that you are not my father, you still treated me like I meant everything to you.  What I am trying to say is... I love you Zander.  I want you to be my love forevermore,\" Halaria confessed romantically.<br>\r\n\"You really mean that Halaria?\" Zander asked with shock in his voice.<br>\r\n\"I do, my love,\" Halaria replied.<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say... I am lost for words,\" Zander replied back.<br>\r\n\"My love, all I want for you is to enjoy your life with me.  I can even change you into a dragon, both temporarily and permanently,\" Halaria told Zander with love in her eyes.  \"My body has been craving for you for two years.  I want you and only you to fill me with your seed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZander gave this a long thought.  On one hand, he two loved Halaria, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to turn into dragon and losing his human job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Halaria, I have made my choice,\" Zander said, \"I want to...</span></div></div>",

So, i opted for a cabin one of my friend let me stay in during my field trips, or hiking depend on the mood really<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents may have been asshole but at least they got money, money that permitted me to open my own shop first, and leaving a far more enthusiast old friend manage it in my place later, luckily people are always in need of electronic devices of some sort, and of other people capable of making them work. I was lucky i guess, the small city i live in lacked a real place where to buy the lastest technological gizmos with Competent personal selling it, thus my small fortune was born<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if i could just but something that give me some measure of willingness to work...i suppose next time. Technically i am on extended vacation, and i should return to work like any-, bullshit, most of my so called friends have rich families of their own, i won't call what they do work, pass the time more like<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway i really should, but being your own employer has it's advantage, and i got daily calls from Jeremy anyway, so, yeah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time not being an issue, and father being none the wiser, i usually enjoy my freedom by devoting myself to my hobbies, which include hiking, which brought me into this mess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dada? Hungry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you are, now returning to the present i find myself in a small problem of not easy solution, despite the mostly quiet night with the small creature staying with me in this chalet, that can snore like legendary size one, has quite the appetite and while i do have some food in the pantry, it won't last long, especially with that black hole she has instead of a stomach, and no way i leave her alone to buy provisions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A moment will ya, i just need to make a call\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remain impossibly still for a few moments, then she begin to make a strange acute noise from her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cover my hears \"Stop it! Stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obey \"Cal ling\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove my hands from my ears just in time to facepalm \"Hmm, look Halaria, we humans have a more efficient methods fro calling someone over long distances, one that does not require making me deaf\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Df deaf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes you see, if i begin screaming n your ea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop just in time to avoid saying something stupid, not because it's obvious, but because i should have really payed more attention, that or i am humanizing Halaria too much. She does not have in fact, ears. She probably hear me through vibration or something, i am no expert i don't know<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't do it again ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am not sure she if she is looking at me like i am stupid or just with curiosity, but nonetheless nod<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, smoked meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe make a yelp of joy, practically salivating at the word<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get some, stay here\" I enforce my instruction with my finger and she nod eagerly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i walk toward the pantry i mentally prepare myself to contact Eric, the old friend who own this chalet, and to my great amusement until yesterday, a dragon fanatic, he would have given a small fortune just to meet one, the fool<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never understood his ideas-turned-into-obsession as i call them, or curiosity of shit-i-don't-care as he call them, well not shit or...bah, he may very well be one of my best friends, but he has strange ideas that for sure. Anyway, despite my reason telling me that asking him to come here is a Very bad idea, and i must say my reason has probably right, i have no one else i can trust that is not on the other part of the world doing who know what<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh \"Time to sign my own death warrant, oh well, there are worse way to go then by friend overexcitement i suppose, barely but..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI already imagine the scene, he coming with an enormous question mark over his head, he see Halaria, he freeze while i run towards the most soundproofed room of the house, then a scream worthy of an 15 year old girl on steroids will be heard in the whole valley and..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where i left the aspirin?\"</span></div></div>",
