            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThe source of most mythological creatures is related through stories of gods, demons, and other beings creating them.  The truth is only known in a few small circles.  The truth is that almost all mythological creatures were created by alchemists when they still ruled.  Alchemy is currently defined as 'a medieval chemical science and speculative philosophy aiming to achieve the transmutation of the base metals into gold, the discovery of a universal cure for disease, and the discovery of a means of indefinitely prolonging life.'  The true aim of alchemists was only the third part of this.  All alchemists aimed to \u201ccreate an undying body that could take any form through the transmutation of both organic and inorganic materials, both living and nonliving.\u201d  The goal was to become a perfect homunculus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second problem is that transmutation is defined as 'the conversion of one element or nuclide into another either naturally or artificially.'  The definition as used by alchemists is 'the conversion or combination of one or more parts, be it organic, inorganic, living, or nonliving, to create a new substance, falling in one of the four previous categories, that is not any of the original parts.' Thus the first attempts truly resulted in the changing of elements into other elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the humanoid mythological beings were created by alchemists attempting to create the homunculus by combining humans and animals.  The first of these was the centaur.  An attempt at giving humans the speed and power of horses resulted instead in a new creature that could neither change its shape nor live indefinitely.  Centaurs speed and power not only transferred to the body though.  It grew into their minds, giving them enhanced wisdom and thought capacity.  Centaurs had vast amounts of knowledge and wisdom, and perfected many things that humans had begun, though never alchemy.  Centaurs avoided alchemy and alchemists, deeming it unwise to attempt to achieve immortality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother result was the lamia.  Strangely, the combination went more smoothly than with horses.  Lamias are part snake part human, though always female.  Any attempts to create male lamias ended in failure.  Lamias gained several enhancements due the combination.  Most obvious are the powerful bodies of snakes that have an enhanced bone structure allowing for easy movement, and venomous bites.  Less conventional is the lamia's ability to hypnotize and charm its prey.  Against males, lamias use their natural shape and the movements of their bodies to charm men into a sense of security.  Against females it involves the swaying of the body as created by snake charmers and hypnotic gaze due to the shape of the lamia's eyes.  In the case of lamia's few remember meeting them due to the hypnosis.  On the rare occasion that people do remember their encounters with lamias, it is usually because the lamia fell in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn even more complete combination was the minotaur.  Fusing a bull with a human created an immensely powerful body and the ability to live for uncountable generations.  The downfall was that a large amount of intelligence was lost in the process.  Because of this minotaurs were often used as guards.  Using short commands and rewards, a minotaur could be trained to obey a single master, creating a cheap and nearly unbeatable guardian.  As long as they were not placed in positions where they could be outsmarted, minotaurs proved vastly useful despite the fact that they were not even close to the desired homunculus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many more part human creatures that were created in the attempt to create a homunculus.  Several alchemists gave up on that route and decided to transmute only animals and attempt to embed their own minds into the resulting body.  Griffins were the most successful of these attempts.  By combing the eagle and lion, a body was made that lived centuries, and was nearly indestructible.  While it could not change shape, it was a highly useful body.  The ability to fly coupled with the power of the king of beasts was a strong lure to many alchemists.  The alchemists successful lived extremely long lives and became intelligent beyond human understanding.  Unfortunately, such long lives often became boring and Griffins looked for ways to make it interesting.  Due to their intelligence it led to the liking of riddles.  Many griffins were known to wait in passes and force travelers to play games of riddles with them.  The losers were often never seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother such combination was Cerberus.  The attempt was to expand a dogs life by combining the life forces, thus extending the lifespan of a single dog to the lifespan of several.  It was going to be a precursor to using the tactic on humans.  The resulting creature lived many times longer than humans, much less dogs, but also combined the physicals aspects too.  This was unsuitable to alchemists, who immediately discarded the idea, not wanting to share eternity stuck with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alchemists who continued to combine humans and animals began to look for ways to cause the animal DNA to lay dormant except when desired.  The first result failed entirely and created vampires.  Vampires are not truly immortal.  They live for as long as they can consume the plasma from blood.  A normal body has a limited number of times it can produce living cells.  Vampires can produce a limitless number of new cells as long as they have enough plasma.  On the downside, a vampire can produce no new cells without plasma.  This creates a nearly uncontrollable desire for blood.  The DNA did remain partially dormant, but when called upon was too strong and caused the person to transform into a vampire bat entirely.  Many alchemists decided this was as close as they could get and turned themselves into vampires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second attempt was with wolves, and was both more and less successful.  This time alchemists looked for a trigger to unleash the DNA.  This held the animal DNA in check at all times as long as the trigger wasn't released.  Werewolves were the result of this attempt.  By using the change in fluctuation of the light of the moon as the trigger, alchemists were able to create a body that lived many times longer and was much stronger that could be controlled without fear of accidentally setting off the animal DNA.  The trigger was only strong enough to be activated by a full moon.  Unfortunately, when this happened the wolf DNA was often too strong and overpowered the human half of the DNA.  Very few alchemists were stable when transformed, and many people today are werewolf descendants.  This explains why activity on the full moon nights is different from any other night.  The DNA is extremely diluted to the point that no transformation occurs, but instincts and feelings are activated by the light of the full moon.  This is why criminals are more active, men are braver, and couples find the full moon romantic.  The animal DNA boosts these feelings when triggered.  However this was not the homunculus either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt remains unknown whether or not any alchemists actually developed a homunculus.  After a while, all the alchemists had either transmuted themselves, or been killed by their creations or victims of their creations.  Alchemy and its goal faded from history, along with many of the transmutation processes.  How do we know about this then?  While the alchemists themselves are gone, there was a group of people who remembered them.  That group is Novo.  For some time now Novo has attempted to recreate the lost arts of alchemy, and has succeeded in several experiments as well as discovering other uses for alchemy and new methods of transmutation.  And obviously you all know that Novo has now opened a very selective school for training alchemists, seeing as you are all here in my class.\u201d  The instructor gestured to the students sitting before him as he summed up his lecture.  \u201cNow for introductions.  We'll go around the class giving names, type of alchemist, and a short introduction as to why or how you became involved in alchemy.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Most of them didn't know what kind of alchemist they were and had only discovered alchemy recently.  Kyrian on the other hand had known of alchemy almost since birth.  Finally it was his turn to introduce himself, \"I'm Kyrian Marcus.  I'm a transfiguration alchemist.  I've known about alchemy for as long as I can remember because those monsters that we're going to fight took my family.  I was raised by one of the alchemists who helped destroy them.  I'm going to fight to prevent anyone else from having their families taken.\"  Kyrian sat down and leaned back so that he was looking.  He didn't look particularly intimidating in any way.  At 6 feet even he wasn't particularly tall, and at only 180 lbs. he wasn't even overly muscular, though it was clear that he was athletic.  His black hair was moderately long, stopping just below the tops of his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Marcus,\" called the teacher.  Kyrian leaned forward to look at the teacher.  \"Please explain to us what kind of alchemy a transfiguration alchemist uses.  It seems that not everybody here knows about the different alchemy types, so we don't want to leave them in the dark.\"  The teacher smiled as he finished speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but please don't use my last name.  I don't like my last name.  A transfiguration alchemist can change the physical structure of solid objects.  I'm particularly adept at manipulating metals.  Transfiguration alchemists can't effect non-solid objects, but still do fine with semi-solid objects like earth, sand, or glass.  We don't actually change the material of objects, just the shape that it takes.\"  Kyrian leaned back again, clearly done speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a decent summary of transfiguration alchemy,\" said the teacher.  \"Moving on.\"  The rest of the class introduced itself one by one until everybody had gone.  Kyrian barely heard any of it.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story must have main characters who will be introduced in the story.  There will be an option for creating a few new personal characters, but if they are made their alchemy should still fall within one of the 4 major types of combat alchemists, which I will describe later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for writing:<br>\r\nAdd to the plot - there is no minimum or maximum length for a post (outside of site rules), but it should contribute to the story.  Try not to do short posts unless there is no other way to advance the story you have planned.  In such cases please create a follow up that expands on one of the options you create.<br>\r\nStay clean - violence and sexual references/romance are not forbidden, in fact both are encouraged, but keep violence mild and sexual references down to innuendo or implied references.  DO NOT go into detailed descriptions of either.  Limit cursing to mild swear words as the rating is 13+. (this may change later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings to Avoid:<br>\r\nRandom - don't randomly change information about a character.  If you're going to write on a storyline then read the preceding chapters to get an idea about how that storyline is going.  If you really feel you must change something about a character then build in some story to explain the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory information:<br>\r\nAn introduction will be in the story, both for the story and for the 4 main characters.  Alchemy classes are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\ntransmutation alchemist \u2013 uses alchemy to adjust the substance of his/her surrounding environment.  This involves changing the actual substance of the environment, such as changing steel supports to gold causing a building to collapse on an opponent or the air in an area to consist of carbon monoxide to suffocate an opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ntransfiguration alchemist \u2013 uses alchemy to change the shape of some material to be used as a tool or weapon.  Involves changing shape and structure of solid substances such as creating a sword from an iron pipe or spikes to erupt from the ground.  Only works on solid materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nelemental alchemist \u2013 uses alchemy to control one or more elements around them.  Involves manipulating the surrounding particles to create elemental effects such as fire, cold, wind, water, etc.  The effects for an element like are are the result of manipulating the physical particles, not actually creating fire.  Any non-solid physical particles can be manipulated by elemental alchemists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ntransformation alchemist \u2013 uses alchemy to integrate and remove animal dna from their own bodies.  This is pretty much the only alchemist with time limits on the powers.  A transformation alchemist could keep a wolf claw with them and use it to amplify there abilities, giving them added speed, strength, and depending on the level of integration, claws.  This can be used with any animal dna, and even living animals in the area.  transformation alchemists can only stay in \"animal form\" for 10 minutes maximum or they risk being unable to completely remove the animal dna from their bodies.  They can integrate with a different animals dna immediately after reverting, but must wait half as long as they were in animal form before they can use the same animal dna again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are guidelines.  Feel free to bend and twist these rules as much as you want without outright breaking them.  I love creative thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would also love for main characters to meet and have mixed or overlapping stories.  While there are only five \"creatable\" main characters, that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be other key characters.  They just shouldn't take a primary role in the story.  If there are any questions feel free to email me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will try to add at least 1 new chapter every week, with my chosen path reserved with \"coming soon\" as the text.</td>",
