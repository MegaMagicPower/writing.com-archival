Was going to be given a room in the barracks, where he was to stay at until the personnel fixed his vehicle. Problem was that he caught a mermaid skinny-dipping- and realized that she was part fish. Personnel were alerted and the commander gave him a choice- 20 years in prison for espionage or 5 years in the Service, as someone who helped the residents of the nearby city. He took the 5 years- as a military record sounded better to him than a criminal one. Given his previous job, and the fact that there was an opening on the force, he was made part of the MCPD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair Color: Dirty Blond<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye Color: Green<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: New Rookie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: More than a little nervous about his new job, but tries to get along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It grows reasonably quick, and, once it gets a certain size, quits spreading, until it gets damaged, or harvested, and then it regrows to heal the damage.\" She then removed some of the mold, and placed it in the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any real issues with it?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on how you define an issue,\" said Janet. \"If you want it, it will take up about ten square feet of space, at about an inch thick, at most, which is nice, as you can sort of frame it into a three foot by three foot square that's about two inches in depth. If you don't want it, it's awful hard to get rid of, like most other molds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if this is the stuff you're looking for, would there be any issues having it?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have to check the sample, but if it is, there shouldn't be any health concerns,\" said Janet. \"Might need a special growing permit to have it grow here, but since it would save the price you'd normally pay to get mushrooms, it shouldn't be that big of an issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it's just the regular stuff?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the usual,\" said Janet. \"Get rid of it within 48 hours. That being said, I'll take this to the lab, and call you within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks,\" said John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if you wish to talk to me later, I know of a nice place we could go to,\" Janet said, as she wrote something down on a sheet of paper and handed it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf grinned. \"For coffee, nothing serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn chuckled nervously. \"Right.

It was one of those crossroad towns with a population that was under a thousand.  It had no schools, no library, and just one traffic light.  Crime was pretty much nonexistent.  The closest big city in any direction was Massillon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was a simple life.  Then Jerome just so happened to win the lottery which earned him a small fortune.  After winning the lottery Jerome decided to see all fifty states for some adventure.  Eventually he made it to Las Vegas.  There in Vegas he met a rather enchanting woman named Marissa.    The two spent a week together seeing the sights and going to those big Las Vegas shows and, of course, gambling in the numerous casinos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Then Marissa vanished suddenly and Jerome looked in vain for her until he spotted her in what looked like a government truck just by chance.  Jerome followed the truck out of the city and all the way to Area 51.   Jerome had somehow, despite all the super tight security, had entered Area 51....or, Monster City as it was called.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n             Jerome expected to see secret military craft rather then aliens because he had been a skeptic of UFO sightings and the like.   He found Marissa of course and found that she wasn't a human at all but a kitsune with nine tails who had disguised herself as a human for some fun.  Unfortunately it was illegal for a resident of Monster City to leave without permission, if they were a convicted criminal.  Marissa had to pay a hefty fine, but avoided any other punishment because she was practically worshiped by the MCPD....or the majority of it at least.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         As a kitsune with nine tails Marissa had powers that made her into a practical goddess; she's able to change her form, size, weight and everything else into whatever she wants.  In her human disguise she's a gorgeous sight with long red hair (orange in Monster City) and is six feet tall while Jerome stands at 5'10\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Jerome chose to stay in Monster City rather then be charged with treason and has made friends of nearly all the residents of Monster City.  Jerome has short dirty blond hair and has a job at Marissa's cafe called \"The Tipsy Vixen\" where he is a bartender.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, let the story begin! </span></div></div>",

Far too many humans spreading out. Staying in his old home was risky. Especially with never being truly able to go outside without looking like a burglar. Using his lovely shadows he learned from his mother would've been far too risky. Luckily, the city welcomed him with open arms. On one condition. He joined MCPD as a medical official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair color: Pitch black<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye color: Dark purple<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin tone: pale<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing: dark blue pants and a dark blue button up shirt. Black sunglasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: M.E. (Medical Examiner)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: A bit of a sweet heart. But don't give him the opportunity to be a sarcastic twerp. If the opening appears, he takes it. He loves screwing with his boss and coworkers. Though on more than one occasion it's almost cost him his job. He's not too fond of newcomers. But if he's gotta deal with them, he'll suck it up in hopes of at least getting on their good side. Though just like his great uncle, he can hold a grudge for a millennia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Tania Kernova<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Pijavica (Vampire)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: Immigrant from Eurasia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormer Occupation: Homeless, Revolutionary, Soldier, Clerk and Guard (last two concurrently) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for Being in the City: Rose from the grave of an impious sole in East Romania, 1890; lived a quiet life, sucking blood at night. Perpetually on the run, she worked herself away from Clergymen and ever deeper into Siberia, circumscribing a broad arc between the Black and Baltic Seas as the Russian Empire met its end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         When the second Revolution hit, she was quick to decide to tone down her mosquito-like ways and become a Bolshevik, fighting in the Civil War and earning some distinguishment offing foreign interventionists, as well as in the War with Poland, and subsequent Collectivization Crises. She managed to survive the Purges -more due to the fact that the people who would've Purged her mysteriously did not survive more than anything else- and served during the War with Japan and Great Patriotic War, surviving after considerably discomfiture and eventually finding peaceful employment as a camp-guard in Kolyma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         For almost sixty years, she fed considerably better working with the system than she ever had against it, but after Comrade Steel booted the pail, she quickly became a liability to the new, Thawing management. Her kind and activities were ordered dispensed with during a certain NKVD manager's day in the limelight, and Tania made a run for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Almost liquidated, she illegally immigrated to China, then North America, eventually ending up in the only safe place in the world left for her kind. Fully aware of that last caveat, she keeps tabs open on Somalia and North Korea, while scrupulously trying to keep on the law's good side. The thought of deportation makes her very worried. She is determined to never take a unconsenting person's blood again, and works as a barrista to buy the expensive substance needed in question. Well, that gig, and also working as an informer for police whenever she can find the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair Color: Raven black (Skin is marble white)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye Color: Blood Red (Solid)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: Civilian<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Misses Russia a bit, but fully naturalized and no-longer in love with Communism after getting staked in the shoulder during her sudden and unexpected emigration. Normally cheerful and friendly, if a bit sarcastic, especially around people who already know her; always up for a bit of slapstick. Has something of a phobia of hammers, though, ever since she was captured as a Partisan and the Waffen SS broke every bone in her body (Including the ones in her inner ear) with one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anita\" Of The Third Kingdom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Mummy (Egyptian)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: Immigrant From Cairo,Egypt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormer Occupation: Magical Curator for a small Cairo store, was found out to be a mummy by some people.

Taking a job as their Magical Curator, looking over any evidence for the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair Color: White Gauze<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye Color: Blue Fire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Anita loves messing with people, she is probably one of the oldest beings in the city. And most of those monsters aren't willing to talk to another being. So Anita spends her days spinning tall tales when she isn't on the job. Telling unsuspecting listeners of her \"great\" deeds, which anybody with a bit of knowledge would know were fake. The only truths she says when she isn't on a job, is the fact she comes from the Third Kingdom time of Egypt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName:Cullen The Gillman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Fishman (Subspecies: Gillman, only one he says)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: Native<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccupation: Nobody knows where Cullen came from, it just seems like he was always in the city. He just keeps mostly to himself, but isn't adverse to conversation.Cullen seems to talk about very trivial things, but not to hide anything in a facade of chatter, just to enjoy the thing in general. He also has a weird thing going for him;if he doesn't want to be seen, nobody can find him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair Color: None, Orange Fin technically counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye color: Yellow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: Civilian Insider<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Chatty, but reserved, Cullen has two personalities traits that shouldn't work. He stays away from people, but when they come to him, he is all too willing to talk. He also acts as a consultant on shady deals, allowing the police to be tipped off.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Richard moved himself onto the edge of the bed, with one grunt, he pushed himself up. Yawning, he made his way to the small bathroom, taking a look into the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yep, still the same face I had before. Wait, could I somehow become a monster here? Nope, bad thought Richard, just keep yourself sane.</i> \" Richard did a hygienic routine that was normal for him; unfortunately, he was doing it in a environment that wasn't. Finishing up, Richard went towards a closet and pulled out his new uniform. Going through the motions to put it on, with a sigh, Richard then went back inside the closet to pull out a duffel bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, off onto my first day on the force.\" Richard said as happy as he could be. He opened the door, and walked down a flight of stairs. Which, also lead down to the Monster City Police Station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">====</div><br>\r\nRichard watched as beings from myth, legends, or things out-of-this-world, came together a collaborated. The architecture was built differently than a normal station, in fact, it could be called a stadium than a station. Beings flew, slithered past, strode, hopped, or any other forms of transportation than Richard could ever hope to conceive. It was disorienting to watch this cacophony of movement, thankfully, somebody came to his rescue before he hurt himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard, over here.\" A voice deep enough to be heard over the squalor of monsters called towards him. Honing in on the voice, Richard saw the owner. It was Frank, who was currently in human shape, waving over to him. Richard smiled, and walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frank, nice to see ya\" Richard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same, how do you feel about the place so far?\" Frank replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda scared man, I know I moved in here, but I just now realize how <i>big</i> this place is. How did they build it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when some of your citizens are 20ft and above, it makes most building easier to do.\" Frank laughed, then looked down at a sheet of paper. \" Oh, Richard, I need to introduce to your partner. You're both rookies, so both of you can learn together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that doughy in experience, I've been with the LAPD for 4 months already.\" Richard shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you haven't been in the MCPD yet. Now come on, daylights wasting.\" Frank motioned Richard to get on his back, shifting into his werewolf form, which Richard replied with a look that said \"Are you kidding me?\" Frank rolled his eyes, and still motioned to his back. Richard then shrugged, what was the worst thing to happen to him? Walking over, Frank allowed a piggyback ride for Richard. With that settled, Frank bent his legs and jumped upwards, Richard's breath escaped his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying upward, Frank landed down, and jumped up again. Richard's eye wiggled in his head at the fact. Finally, the jumping ended and the duo appeared to be in a cafeteria, which housed a couple of large beings in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was fun, how are you doing Richard?\" Frank questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah\" Was all he could reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to note, now come on.\" Almost to make sure the ground was real, Richard quickly followed Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Hey, Zyla I got your partner here. Come meet the fellow.\" Frank called out. The duo were converging upon a small table, its occupant hidden by what appeared to be a over-sized newspaper, well, to Richard anyways. The faintest appearance of feathers could be seen on the reader's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looked as the occupant lowered the newspaper, revealing a stunning woman with striking, red eyes. Oh, and feathers located on her head were another feature. She looked inquisitively at Richard, but not in a disdainful way. No, more like she did that because that was what others did in a similar situation. Like a child copying the movements of a parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is... him..right?\" Zyla stated, saying the words as though they were alien. Which hopefully she would get that Richard was human, not alien. Richard could hear a light accent on her tongue. Sounding like it was she an Eastern European of some sort, maybe Greek?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just say? Come and give this man a handshake.\" Frank smiled, and patted Richard on the shoulder. Zyla shrugged, and got up from her seat. Richard then received a better view of the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already noted her face, so a better view of her body was appreciated. First thing he noted was that she was taller than him; wasn't saying much, seeing as he was 5'6 in height. But even he knew she towered over him, 6'4, 6'5? Second thing he noticed was the feathers located on her arm, which were like those of a human's limbs. The feathers on her arms matched the feathers on her head; red  that was dark enough, that one could mistake it for brown. Her torso was athletic, with a fairly small bust. What really got Richard's attention was her lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips were the widest things he ever seen! They were lovely in their swinging motion, hell, almost hypnotic. They were definitely wider than even a normal woman's hips. If they were a inch or two wider, they would have been absurd. He couldn't wait to see the butt they were carrying. Then Richard noticed something else; looking down, he saw that her legs were that of a falcon sized up. They could easily disembowel him if she decided to even kick him. Richard's dirty thoughts left his mind like the devil was upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZyla held her hand open. \"Zyla, please to meet you Richie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard, and likewise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rich - hard.\" Zyla rolled his name in her mouth. \"Noted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, introductions are done, let me assign you your posts.\" Frank butted in, and gave the duo their first assignment. </span></div></div>",

It wasn't his fault that he wasn't well accommodated to his surroundings yet. Frank seemed to acknowledged that point and indicated where to go next. A little crevice was located past the shuffling forms of some monstrosities. Richard tipped a nonexistent hat at Frank and made off with Zyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe straddled down the stairwell, the looming shadow of his partner made Richard all too aware of the fact he was <i>way</i> out of depth. Finally he made his way to the garage, where currently twenty vehicles were parked around the area. Even then, he say that many of the missing spots would only add up to fifty vehicles in the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, thought there would be more cars here.\" Richard said, Zyla nodded and then bumped her hips against his arms as she moved forward. Richard blushed from the strange contact he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many different types of being here, each with their own body-types and movement. It would be weird for <i>all</i> them to use humanoid vehicles.\" Zyla put in her own \"two-cents.\" Richard shrugged at her suggestion and moved towards his vehicle. He opened the door and went insides, feeling the a familiar scene that he was well accustomed to. Except the part where his partner didn't get into the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You getting in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZyla looked at the vehicle like it was the devil and weakly replied. \" No..no... I feel that my services would be better equipped while being outside.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard would've told her to get in, but he didn't know the process of this place yet. For all he knew, he could've just broken twenty rules in place. He waved her off and began to start the automobile. He backed out of his space and drove towards the exit of the garage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to follow me?\" Richard looked back at the harpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZyla wiggled her impressive hips and posed her arms in a \"T-pose.\" With a quickness that Richard almost thought of as unreal, Zyla appeared to have grown wings, almost as massive as her. Open mouth at the sight, Richard was brought out of it by the ding of the opening garage doors. He steadied himself and drove towards his destination, his partner followed him out. Zyla braced herself and jumped upwards, like a bullet she shot into the sky. Richard lost his view of her, but she was no doubt following him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life here is going to get interesting.\" He proclaimed to no one.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life here is going to get boring\" Zyla said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She and her partner had arrived at the park not even thirty minutes ago and they had yet to acquire anything to do. Zyla was unaware of Richard enjoying the sights of the city. He gawked at everything like a three year-old. Zyla, who grew up in a monster world, saw this as another Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think that Zyla, your parents gave you the opportunity to achieve a better future. Thoughts like that will bring you down.\" Zyla said , she didn't think those words, she liked to say them out loud. Zyla thought of where she was at now and found the shunted negative thoughts out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a <i>serious</i> world, not like the carefree adventure lands she traveled with her family. Those days of delivering packages to the multitude of islands in the Mediterranean were over. Now Zyla had to sit down and show herself as the professional she was. And with that thought in mind, Zyla formulated her view on Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My partner seems to be a little more experienced than me, no doubt getting it from some other precinct he came from. Although, he did look at my hips, are they too small? Dammit, I knew I was slacking off in my mating appearance. Zyla, how are you going yo find a mate with hips these small?\" Zyla admonished herself in shame. The harpy flew through the air, while her partner on the ground covered the area. All seemed good for today, though, maybe something would break the peace?</span></div></div>",

Both her height, and her mostly stoic personality, made a very intimidating figure. But it did raise the question: was she an outlier of her species or a normal member?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please.\" She smiled at Richard's suggestion. The officer walked off, heading towards the lakeside. Various stalls sold there wares, though, this city was  different. Things that Richard couldn't even describe were hocked and hollered to various passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard stared as an octopus like fellow handed a strange piece of meat to a three eyed girl. He saw small pixies flutter through the air like darts, mingling with bigger, bird-like entities. He gawked as he saw what appeared to be mermaids beached themselves on the lakeside shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must've been staring hard though, as he saw a couple of the citizens looking at him funnily. He averted his eyes, focusing back on the topic at hand. He searched for what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wish there was a guide or something.</i>\" Richard thought as he looked over the strange assortment of foods and drinks. Seeing wonders that he could've only dreamed of when he was back at LA.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scuse, officer.\" A voice called out, Richard turned his head as he saw a dwarfish beings move towards him. The dwarf thing held up two strange containers,in them were blue liquids; Richard raised an eye at that, whatever was in them resembled soap more than actual drinkable things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm local; Yuri is the name.\" He drawled when he spoke, an accent that Richard couldn't place burbled out from his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Its nothing wrong with it. I make good for protectors; call in to check,\" Yuri smiled as he handed the drinks over to Richard, the dwarfish thing waddled off, leaving Richard confused holding two drinks. He peered as the blue liquid bubbled in its container, he walked off back to Zyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pear shaped Harpy stood where Richard last left her, though, she did seem to be focusing on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Richard called, Zyla gently looked back at him, staring as he brought his drinks over. Mumbling a \"thanks\", Zyla took the weird liquid. She drank with a stoic face, which Richard mentally noted look surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to sound too intrusive, but what were you looking at?\" Richard asked as he open his container and peered inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, some monster.\" Zyla replied back, nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Whats the reason you're staring at him then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he just came out of his car and thought he was being sneaky. He just put in about ten pounds worth of cash into a briefcase.\" Zyla responded, Richard spat out whatever was in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was watching if he did anything else.\" Zyla told him with the a voice that said  \"Yeah, nothing out of the ordinary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still watching him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Zyla spoke. \"And he appears to be heading down the street at this moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard gawked as he tried to stare where Zyla was looking at, only to find his vision only seeing blobs and dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you learn to see like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harpy genetics, ship watcher, and family genes\" Zyla told him.\"Now quiet, I need to keep sight on him.\"</span></div></div>",

The wind in the background was whistling in the, monster-kids were yelling and screaming, and the sound of urban noise filled the air. But Richard still felt that it was too quiet between him and his partner. He opened his mouth to give break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be very...uh... good with your eyes.\" Richard spoke, smiling a little to make himself seem friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what my mother said.\" Zyla bluntly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard temple his fingers and continued. \"Didn't you say you were a ship spotter? I didn't know that is still a thing, I thought GPS had replaced that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the human side, yes.\" Zyla said. \"But Harpies generally can't buy that for their ships, unless we work through a more humanoid monster or shapeshifter. My family had to make do with what they got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have to look out for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pirates, Human ships, wreckage...\" Zyla was interrupted by Richard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pirates? I know Africa, and some parts of Asia, still has them, but in the Mediterranean?\" Richard questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there are pirates. Its not like in the human world where everyone is near the same size, or has the bigger and better tech than the other. Our pirates have their own specialties that we have to plan for.\" Zyla answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as some of them could be over 30 meters long and be intelligent enough to trap your ship, or make it seem that their ship is a human one, and should I continue?\" Zyla looked at Richard who whistled a tune to take his mind off of what he just heard. Turning back up, Zyla's eyes grew wide and quickly grabbed a hold of Richard, who yelped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew so fast, that whatever complaint Richard was about to say was cut off as the two landed on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" Richard huffed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw a flash of a M.E.G, what model I don't know.\" Zyla bluntly stated as she used one of her talons to cut open the roof door. Richard pulled out his gun and softly spoke to dispatch of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a M.E.G?\" Richard said as he went down the stairwell, doing his best not to look to closely at Zyla's bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Monster. Ending. Gun. Made in a variety of models and with a hundred accessories. Us monsters have so many different strengths, its hard to keep track of our weakness. Why not make an all purpose line of weaponry that can suit whatever needs for whatever you fight? Plus,  some of them use air to blast out their packages, making it damn near silent. That flash happened because its another accessory, off the top of my head, I can't remember which.. That mean that one of the things here was tougher than expected.\" Zyla quickly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making their way to the floor, the duo saw the blood seeping out of the figure. Going over, Zyla looked at the figure closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the guy I was watching.\" Zyla said. Richard walked towards her, before he saw something on the ground. Not wanting to containment the scene, he crouched down, peering intently at a broken vial of...something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That being said, despite that fact that his uniform includes a saddle and reins for \"suggested steering\" are attached to parts of his uniform, and armor, at his torso, he normally doesn't allow people to ride him while on duty, although he does tolerate curious children.

However, due to a certain incident involving a crazed fan, Nick stopped touring, not because his secret was blown, which it wasn't, but because he didn't want to get jumped in his dressing room again. He is also the namesake behind the character of the same name in the Netflix movie <i>Bright</i>, with Joel Edgerton borrowing some of his mannerisms for the movie, and even has the actor's autograph, and a picture of the two of them, with Joel in full makeup, as well as Will Smith's autograph, although Smith had previously worked with Area 51 during the filming of the <i>Men in Black</i> movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan Silvian<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: High elf/Drow elf mix<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: Native<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormer Occupation: Bounty Hunter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair: Blond<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes: Red<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: Sargent<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Initially seems to look at others with more than a bit of irritation, and malevolence, but that's mainly because he has the eyes of his father - who was a drow, and drow's eyes tend to hurt when forced to look at something in a brightly lit place. In a dimly lit, or dark, place however, and his eyes are more relaxed, and he's less irritated. Of course, since he has to work during the day at times, he tends to wear dark sunglasses and a wide-brim hat in order to protect his eyes. His skin is fair, like a High Elf, but those eyes tell people about his hidden duality - and that is the fact that Drow's tend to be rather cruel. Of course, while Logan himself isn't cruel, and his father wasn't, he does use this belief to his advantage when questioning suspects..</span></div></div>",

The Felineans are a culturally rich race that utilizes a world system similar to the concept of tribes in Native American culture.  Felineans structure these tribes around familial lineage.  Halloween has no knowledge of to which of these tribes she belongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: Halloween was captured and brought into the custody of the City ever since she was a newborn to serve as the subject for research on feline behavior and anatomy.  At this point in her life, she was an Outsider, but after having been in the City for such a long time into her adulthood, she has now achieved the status of Insider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormer Occupation: While in the custody of the City researchers, Halloween was still a minor and never held a professional occupation.  However, she was allowed to attend a private high school for monsters in the City as part of an experiment on how she would react to harassment from peers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for Being in the City: The City researchers abducted Halloween from her home planet when she was just an infant to use her as a subject for research on feline behavior and anatomy.  She spent her entire life growing up in the City under the supervision and custody of the City research department.  Due to having been raised there since infancy, Halloween believes that the City is her real home and has no knowledge of her Felinean heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair Color: Halloween has black hair and fur with a small white patch on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye Color: Halloween has bright green cat eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: When the Monster Police Force was under development and looking for recruits, the City research department staff recommended Halloween as a Detective due to her high intelligence and ambition.  Halloween served dutifully and put out outstanding work and thus is currently Chief Detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Halloween is naturally hard-working, independent, and ambitious.  She strives to do the best she can at her job and is extremely passionate about her work.  However, due to years of living in isolation at the research facility, Halloween works better on her own and struggles when working with others.  While she has excellent leadership and communication skills, she fails to understand that the way others act does not always revolve around her.  Halloween becomes easily frustrated when her expectations don't come true and has a reduced ability to monitor her emotions and how she expresses them outwardly.  She is also somewhat reliant on praise to maintain her self-worth and will become jealous and competitive toward anyone who challenges her or appears as a match to her in receiving the approval she desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b></b>Choice 3:<b></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Hooh'Hawh Vrucrak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Hooh'Hawh is an alien from the planet Tubekorosuth.  Tubekorosuthans are large, ugly, hairy, lazy, and unfriendly creatures.  Their society revolves around crude entertainment, primarily featuring smut and the objectification of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: Hooh'Hawh is an Insider born to Outsider immigrants who migrated to the City in hopes to make a living off their artisan sculptures of beautiful nude women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for Being in the City: The City is Hooh'Hawh's birthplace.  His immigrant parent raised him in the City to become a sculptor like themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin Color: Hooh'Hawh has green skin that is warty like a toad's and perpetually greasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair Color: Hooh'Hawh has coarse mouse brown hair covering not only his head but also his back, armpits, and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye Color: Hooh'Hawh has beady, squinty red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: Hooh'Hawh was randomly assigned the role of Detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Hooh'Hawh can be friendly, but he is very selective about to whom he wants to be kind. Precisely, he does not like ugly women or people who express disagreement toward him.  He is lazy with his detective duties but engages delightedly in reading his graphic smut novels and making his smut sculptures.  He does not care if anything he does rubs people the wrong way and will argue with anyone who points out unsavory actions or traits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b></b>Choice 4:<b></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Phantom the Echidna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRace: Phantom is a Mobian from the Planet Mobius.  Mobians are anthropomorphic animals and come in a variety of species.  Phantom, as the name suggests, is an Echidna, more specifically from the Yugin-Dae clan, which is known for their metal bones that allow them to retract metal blades from their joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatus: Phantom is an Outsider who evacuated to the City after a monster terrorized Mobius by eating another Mobian and wearing his skin as a disguise to trick other Mobians into letting their guard down so it could eat them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormer Occupation: On Mobius, Phantom was a monster hunter.  He began hunting monsters at an early age as monster attacks were a significant problem on Mobius when he was growing up and he wanted to do something about it rather than hiding away being scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for Being in the City: Phantom seeks refuge in the City as it keeps him and his clan members safe from the monster that is currently on the loose on Mobius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair Color: Phantom has blue fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEye Color: Phantom has blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRank: Phantom is new to the Force, so he is currently a Rookie stationed at the coastal beach area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Phantom is very friendly and sociable, often seen chatting and joking around with other Force members.  He's very kind-hearted and will provide support for anyone who needs it.  While often hyper, he is nonetheless dedicated and hardworking.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">When one hears about Area 51, they think about Top Secret military aircraft and weapons testing, or, if they believe in aliens, where certain experiments are being done with alien corpses, including genetic manipulation. Thing is, those don\u2019t even scratch the surface about what really goes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one were to manage to slip past the roving armed guards, they would find out that the area around the dried-up Groom Lake is actually a city- one home to over a hundred thousand inhabitants. Thing is, the majority of these people aren\u2019t exactly humans, and most of them aren\u2019t aliens. No, these people are what most would classify as Monsters. Werewolves, vampires, kitsunes, nagas, mermaids, dragons- if it isn\u2019t human, and seems to belong in the realms of myth and legend, or horror or even Sci-Fi, odds are it\u2019s there. The city is simple called Monster City by the residents, as it was more preferred to its true name of Dreamland. What\u2019s more, if an Outsider is caught past the guards\u2019 patrol area, they aren\u2019t exactly allowed to leave the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Origins of Monster City can be traced back to the Expansion of America. Monsters fleeing from Hunters came to the New World, and would settle in remote areas. As America expanded, monsters were forced to flee. Eventually, they settled roughly a hundred miles north of what would eventually be called Las Vegas. Since it was Federal Government land, and undesired by humans, no one came to bother them, and the people were free to start building a life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen World War Two came along, and the American Military decided that they needed a place far from prying eyes, especially those of the German and Japanese. To their surprise, the area that they wanted was already inhabited. Initially, the military wanted to go to war with the creatures, until a certain high ranking general saw them himself and realized that negotiating with the creatures would be far easier than being involved in a secret war in the middle of the country, especially after he saw how strong one of them was, when his jeep ended up in an accident, with him trapped under it- the five men with him couldn\u2019t lift the vehicle up enough to free him, but one werewolf, who saw what had happened, was able to lift the jeep upright. This general had a talk with the President, and convinced him to have a talk with the creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the monsters had known what was happening in the Outside world, as there were creatures coming from various parts of Europe and Asia, and they were bringing tales of what was happening- genocide against those of different religions, State-sponsored Secret Hunts, and more. When the creatures heard that the American President was going to come, the leader of the community, a European dragon, decided that he was going to meet this human leader, and prepared himself for battle, making sure that he had plenty of fire in him, and that his scales and everything were polished to a blinding shine, as he wasn\u2019t just going to walk away from his home, like others had before him. Much to his surprise, the human he encountered was one who needed to use a chair with wheels to move around. For reasons known only to himself, the President got the dragon to talk with him in absolute privacy, though the locals, the military, and the Secret Service observed them from several hundred yards away. When the two leaders came back to the others, they agreed that another meeting would be needed to discuss the details of the treaty between their peoples. What is known about that particular conversation is this; in spite of their appearances and abilities, the monsters and other creatures were indeed American citizens, and therefore were guaranteed certain unalienable rights, including the right to happiness, justice, and freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after this, the military was given permission to build their base and testing facility, in exchange for making the 25 by 23 mile area nearby off-limits to Outsiders, unless the Outsider was authorized to be at the facility for any reason. However, if an Unauthorized Outsider found out about the locals, said outsider had two choices, Military Prison for a minimum of twenty years, or live in the City as a resident for at least five years without leaving- unless there was an emergency- in which case the person would be escorted. In either case, before the person was allowed to leave, they had to sign a Confidentiality Clause- under Penalty of being charged with Treason, they were forbidden to talk about what they\u2019d seen, or heard, or did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the stories about aliens, it seems that Earth is a midway point for travelers between Mars and Venus, especially those planning vacations that last several Earth Years \u2013 in that they\u2019ll wait until the Earth is in a certain position before traveling to it, then wait a few months before traveling to the next planet. Area 51 is something of a Resort town for these people, where they can be themselves, without having to hide what they are. In exchange, the military is allowed to reverse-engineer certain aspects of Martian and Venetian technology, like fuel efficient engines, cloaking devices, and even wrist-like devices that allow the wearer to change their form into something else. Also, the aliens like to buy souvenirs of Earth origin, especially Sci-Fi films about \u201caliens\u201d \u2013 seems they treat them like comedies, over how ridiculous the \u201caliens\u201d are made and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the Plot behind this story, New York City Police Officer, Jeremiah Johnson, was returning from vacationing in Las Vegas when he took a wrong turn, due to a faulty GPS device, and his car broke down on a road patrolled by Area 51 Security Personnel. When the Security Patrol located him, they contacted Command, and a deal was made \u2013 Jeremiah could stay at the base while the mechanics fixed the car, providing that the officer stayed in certain areas, like his room, and was to be escorted at all times, due to \u201cNational Security Reasons\u201d, of course. Problem was, a late night excursion to the bathroom caused him to get lost, and for him to catch a mermaid skinny-dipping, and for him to realize that she was part fish, and that it wasn\u2019t a dream either, especially when the mermaid alerted the base to the apparent intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Jeremiah Johnson was given a choice, 20 years in a Military Prison, under some charge of espionage, or 5 years serving at Area 51, and living in Monster City. Due to his then-current job of being a police officer, he\u2019s given a job on the Police Force. Now he has to find his way around, learn how to fit in with the others on the police force, and how to work with his new partner, to say nothing about trying to keep the peace between the various factions within the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as with any city, there were those who cause trouble and special people are found to keep the peace. This is the story of these people, who spend every day making sure that the biggest top secret remains just that, Top Secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The laws of M.C. are basically the same as every other city- keeps Outsiders comfortable during their forced stay- plus it\u2019s easier on the Area 51 military personnel, so that that they don\u2019t have to do the job of protecting wayward humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Killing people just to eat them is classified as a capital offence- meaning that werewolves and dragons just can\u2019t eat humans, not without paying the penalty- their life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Spelling and Grammar are a must.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Story is to be in Third Person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The creatures can come from all realms of Horror, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Mythology, or your Own Imagination. Just create a Quick Bio of Sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. While in the City, the uniforms worn by the officers on duty look like typical police uniforms. However, when they investigate cases outside of the city, they look like something out of M.I.B - Black Suit, White Dress Shirt, Black Slacks, Dark Sunglasses (very important for non-human officers), and an expensive-looking watch that can actually cause the officer to change their species or increase their strength and speed, among other things, which is useful for hiding non-human officers and helping human officers in a fight where they are outnumbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee the following Campfires for the Inspiration for this - Truth be told, I had planned to make an interactive originally, but at 22 Interactives, and a then recent 10 interactive limit, I had hit the ceiling - so I'm recycling an interactive that went nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td width=\"55\">\u00a0</td><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"63\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a style=\"padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\" target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/campfires/item_id/2029858-Monster-City-Police-Force\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/icon-2000.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"30\" height=\"25\" valign=\"middle\" align=\"center\"></a></td><td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\" style=\"padding-left:15px;color:#000000;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/campfires/item_id/2029858-Monster-City-Police-Force\" target=\"_top\" class=\"blue2roll\" style=\"font-weight:bold;font-size:1.3em\">Monster City Police Force</a>\u00a0<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/campfires/item_id/2029858-Monster-City-Police-Force\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> (<a class=\"blue2roll\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools.php?action=pop_rhelp&amp;crating=40',%20'crhelp40',%20'500',%20'350');\">18+</a>)<br>If you think you know Area 51, you know nothing.
