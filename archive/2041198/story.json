I suck at first impressions, so let me just lay everything down on the table for you right now:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Melanie Carlyle, I'm a Saggitarius, I've got long blonde hair, and I'm fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, I'm probably the biggest girl you'll ever meet. So 'fat' is kind of an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm <i>huge</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time I weighed myself, I was somewhere around four hundred pounds. And my belly was so big that I had to get my little sister to look at the scale for me. I've put on three hundred pounds since my freshman year at prep school, and by the time I graduated I could barely fit through the front door. So yeah, I'm pretty fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know, I know. Heart disease, diabetes, whatever. Who gives a crap. I love my body\u2014and I mean I really <i>love</i> my body. Back in my Buttercombe Academy days, I was the hottest piece of ass to waddle down the hall, and it was <i>because</i> of my weight. You'd be surprised how many heads you can turn at my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is? It's not enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to get bigger. Is that crazy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I'm already the fattest girl I know. I spend more time eating than I have any right to, and it takes just as much food to feed my parents and my little sister to fill me up at any given meal\u2014sometimes more. I <i>love</i> to eat. I <i>love</i> how people look at me when I waddle down the street. And, probably most importantly, I <i>love</i> the look on my Mom's face every time I break a chair or pop a button at the dinner table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the long and short of it is: my name's Mel Carlyle, and I want to get as fat as humanly possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is probably good for me, because\u2026</span></div></div>",

And that's for people who AREN'T trying to break the four-hundred-pound mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent most of my high school years away at Buttercombe Academy getting fat, coming home only for holidays and summers while I pigged out for pretty much the rest of my time there. Which worked out great for me, because while I didn't have to hear my Mom constantly bitch and moan about how much I was eating, I <i>also</i> developed independence that helped ease the transition into a more \"permanent\" living arrangement away from my parents. So, go me I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know what I was expecting, but the dorm rooms at Stuffington U weren't very nice. Kinda small. But then again, I guess the people in charge of housing probably just thought I was \"too big.\" Pfft, whatever that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents weren't gone five minutes before I flung myself on top of the bed, the springs inside screaming as I forced all of my weight on top of it. They'd helped me move all my stuff in, even if my Mom was super snarky about how \"even my clothes were heavy\", and the whole ordeal had left everyone (but especially me) totally exhausted. Everything was still packed up, and I was already a couple hundred calories short of having the energy to do much of anything about it at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still dressed in my \"please like me I'm new\" clothes, but I managed to peel off my big burgundy sweater and fling across the room, landing on the unclaimed bed on the other side. My belly hung out by a wide margin from the tank top I had on under it, even as it sagged under its own weight when standing upright. My fat ass bubbled out from my jeans, meaning that basically my entire lower roll was just out and about for display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance over to the empty bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope my roommate doesn't mind a show.\" I thought to myself, my hands coming to cradle the expansive belly blob in front of me, \"She'd better get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I wrestled with the decision as to whether or not to remove my <i>pants</i> as well (y'know, getting comfortable and all), I hear my door handle turn...</span></div></div>",

Especially when all of \"that\" was about three hundred extra pounds or so. I mean, I like to fondle myself as much as the next obesophile, but there were... boundaries, y'know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to my roommate. She was your tall, conventionally-pretty type. Bright red hair, freckles with green eyes and really strong features. Tight waist, narrow hips with a big chest. Is it weird that I stared at her chest? I hope not. It's really kind of hard not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean just... <i>damn</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, normally I'm not the kind of girl to just stare at another girl's tits, but they were... stareable. Other than her sweatermelons, this girl was built like a stick. Narrow waist, very slight curvature for her hips, and no ass from what I could see. But then, up top, it was just like \"oh, here's where all of my body fat goes!\" That's not normal, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I wriggle my way up to a sitting position which, given my rampant obesity, is beginning to become something of an issue. I couldn't really make it over the overbearing swell of my belly rolls, and my own chest was still pounding from the exertion of having to haul myself from Dad's car down the hall to the elevator two or three times. I make a few pathetic attempts at sitting up, but eventually I just kind of roll myself onto my side and push up a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, that's a lot of work for big ol' me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" I'm a sweaty panting mess by the time I actually make it up, \"I'm Melanie Carlyle... call me Mel.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth and replied...</span></div></div>",

That just kind of came out,\" she stammered quickly, keeping her eyes on her shoes. Well, where her shoes would be below her giant tits at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point though, I mean, I am big. Actually, that's not true at all. I'm HUGE! What else was she supposed to say to 400 pounds of goddess enjoying her folds on first introduction? \"Hehehe, really?\" was my reply. \"I always thought I was more of a petite body size. But now that we have me sorted out, what's the deal with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to catch her off guard as she looked up from the canyon that was her shirt's neckline, but her face stayed just as red. \"Oh! I'm Amy. Sorry, just not a sight I've seen every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that went surprisingly well. As well as meeting the massively obese girl she'd be sharing a space not big enough for two normal sized people fondling a belly that probably weighed as much as she did could possibly go at least. But god it felt so good just sinking my hands into my soft folds. As I thought more and more about my belly, and all of its folds to be explored, I noticed her eyes were glued to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy whole lower roll was exposed to her view to go along with the love handles pouring over my jeans, but I couldn't read the look on her face. Was it disgust? No, that wasn't it. There was definitely something there though. \"Well if you give me a hand up, I could help you bring in your things,\" I offered. Fortunately, the panting and sweat gave away the bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer green eyes shot up to my face again. \"No, that's ok, I didn't bring too much with me.\" She wheeled in a large suitcase behind her and threw it on her bed as I struggled to get up. If you've ever tried lifting 400 pounds of jiggling flesh, you understand that it's a struggle that's hard to win. My huffing and puffing weren't helping as all of my efforts seemed to accomplish was sending waves undulating through the fat on my body. Not that this was a problem, the feeling was absolutely magnificent. Honestly standing may not have even been worth the trouble with all the fun I was having. Over my huffing and puffing I heard her offer, \"Here, let me give you a hand. It can't be easy to get up when you're so... tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed to myself a little on the inside. Nice save Amy, good thing you didn't call me fat! I would've been crushed over it. Oh wait, that's the ton of lard that was already crushing me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out her hands, so I paused for a second to let the jiggling subside. This took a fair bit longer than she seemed to expect, but none more than I was used to. Once we reached a relatively stable level, I reached both my hands out to her. \"Thanks, just don't let me crush you!\" I half joked, though I'm sure the two airbags hanging off her chest would help soften any potential blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grabbed my pudgy wrists and said, \"Alright. One, two, three...\" and...</span></div></div>",

I couldn't really blame the poor girl. I <i>did</i> weigh about four hundred pounds at that point, and aside from her enormous shoulder boulders, Amy was pretty much a waif. Somehow though, we managed to get me moving; whereupon I asked the ever-important question when it comes to getting to know <i>any</i> of my roommates:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... who's hungry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy guided me to the Campus Life Center\u2014this big building that apparently served lots of other functions but was, for all intents and purposes, the cafeteria. We swiped our student ID's and headed inside to a large room with plenty of round tables scattered about. It hardly measured up to Buttercombe Academy's grand freakin' dining hall, but there were a few amenities that I was familiar with, thanks to my background with a posh preparatory school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a self-service station (though it looked like this one only catered to burgers, at least today) off in the corner, with a small line forming behind this one fat guy who was loading up his plate. There were three different service lines, all with different entrees. The first had the standard college-kid fare, pizza, pasta, french fries, et cetera, while the second was Mexican-themed. The third had some gross vegetarian shit, so I didn't really even pay attention to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this great?\" Amy said happily as she handed me a plate, \"They change the menu every three days, so if you ever get tired of anything you can just live on Jasmine's or Wholly Habanero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what now?\" I asked, taking a small step forward in line at the first service station<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're like two little restaurants. They're in the bottom of the Horace building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet.\" I said with a small nod of affirmation, making sure to remember that I could mix up my palate a little, \"Can I use my card to get in or do I actually have to pay for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! You can use your card.\" Amy said with a big-girl step forward as the fat chick in front of us finally left the line, \"You live on campus, so it should be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so far, not shaping up to be too bad, right? A nice cafeteria with plenty of variety. Free food from almost every angle. Plus, with all the vending machines on campus, I could conceivably spend an entire day eating without having to spend <i>too</i> much of my own money. Not to mention the standard pizza delivery or all the places in town there were to eat at; it would never beat Buttercombe, but I could already see myself getting comfortable at Stuffington University.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway, we got our food (it took me a whole five minutes to get everything I wanted in a first course\u2014people were <i>so</i> pissed!) and headed out into the dining area...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a pile of pizzas which were supposed to be served one slice at a time, but I didn\u2019t see that policy lasting long with me around \u2013 instead, they were stacked like pancakes. There were a couple of towers of burgers, and a few coops\u2019 worth of fried chickens arranged artfully to make them take up as little tray as possible for the sheer mass of greasy meat they represented. I had to admire the skill of the people who worked behind the counter \u2013 of course, this didn\u2019t stop me demolishing their work at once and stuffing it into my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI folded up each large pizza like a taco, and opened my mouth as wide as it would go, my chins squishing together and my cheeks bulging to admit the mounds of cheese. I stripped the meat off the chicken drumsticks like a ravenous wolf. I grabbed the burgers two at a time, cramming them into my mouth with alternate hands. Whenever I got tired of chewing, I\u2019d wash it all down with a huge glug of thick chocolate milkshake, and keep on going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as I gorged myself senseless, I was surprised by how much Amy could pack away. She wasn\u2019t up to Mel Carlyle standards by any means, but she didn\u2019t waste a moment, her slim fingers always questing for the next slice or morsel, and volume-wise too I had to admit she was some eater, especially for a skinny girl. She wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at Buttercombe \u2013 well, not her appetite, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was way more captivated by my appetite than I was by hers. Every time I glanced up she was surreptitiously watching me, taking note of every detail. She almost rocked backward in her chair when I first deployed the pizza-taco move, but covered it well by adjusting her top, which she did often. If I thought I had trouble containing my belly, it was clear Amy\u2019s breasts were just as rebellious, quaking and shimmying with every move. I wasn\u2019t sure what was attracting more stares from the other students \u2013 my epic feats of gluttony, or Amy\u2019s ongoing jiggle show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Amy when we were done, leaning back in her chair. I couldn\u2019t tell if she was impressed or stuffed \u2013 most likely extremes of both. \u201cDamn, girl, you can EAT.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2013 rp\u2013 know,\u201d I said, leaning back myself with a creak of timber and rewarding my bulging belly with a slow, two-handed blubber-stroke. \u201cBut you\u2019re not so bad yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed. \u201cSo, um\u2026 you want some dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I stopped outside my room, where one of our neighbors was manhandling a heavy-looking cardboard box. Milo was a jock, plain and simple, although he took pretty big advantage of the dining hall too (not as much as me, obviously). Still, I did wonder what it would be like if he didn\u2019t have to burn off so many of the precious calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey, Mel,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw you got a package so I thought I\u2019d bring it up for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, dude,\u201d I said, swiping my card to open the room and letting him carry it in. Milo put it down carefully in the middle of the floor and looked around a little wistfully at the empty room. Like a lot of guys in our dorm (and beyond), Milo would take any excuse to be around Amy. In the last month, she had only grown more ample, stretching her tops and sweaters to a quite distracting degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmy\u2019s in class. She has a screening for \u2018Women in Cinema\u2019 til 7 tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilo nodded nonchalantly. \u201cOh, cool. So, uh, what\u2019s in the box?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the return address: PENSATUR METRICS. \u201cAha!\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s my new scale, I\u2019ve had this on order for weeks.\u201d I tore open the box to reveal the large, shiny-looking device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we have one of these at our gym,\u201d said Milo, and without being asked he took it out of the box and began setting it up in the corner. It was a pretty big job, as it came up to eye level and had one of those round dial-type displays, but Milo was pretty handy. I grabbed a box of chocolates from under my bed and sat back with a creak of springs and munched away as he worked, muscles bulging whenever he reached around to tighten a bolt. Soon, the gleaming scale was ready to go, and Milo stepped back to admire his handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Amy came in, dropping her bag on the floor and flopping down on my bed next to me exhaustedly. Her breasts bounced outrageously, clearly one wrong move from popping out of the lacy bra that was outlined against the fabric of her skin-tight, plunging v-neck. She grabbed a chocolate from my box and took a large, hungry bite. \u201cThat movie WOULD NOT END,\u201d she groaned. \u201cHey, Milo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just, uh. Helping. With the. When it\u2019s. There\u2019s a. Box! Delivery. And it, you know, with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven a popular, good-looking guy like Milo tended to get a little side-swiped by Amy if there was no warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, thanks, Milo,\u201d said Amy with a dazzling smile. \u201cSo, I gotta get changed, do you mind? We\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look on his face as though Christmas had been cancelled, Milo left, and with a speed and dexterity that would put a superhero in a phone booth to shame, Amy pulled off her top and unhooked her bra. \u201cI swear, this thing is killing me. I really need to size up,\u201d she said, dropping it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain??\u201d I said. \u201cAmes, what is happening with those things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d she insisted, weighing one big, round, bowling-ball breast in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve got an idea,\u201d I said, and stepped up onto the scale. Groing went the mechanism and the needle spun around to my new weight \u2013 445 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been stuffing your face for four weeks straight, big deal,\u201d Amy laughed. \u201cYOU of all people shouldn\u2019t be surprised by the freshman fifteen \u2013 sorry, fifTY. How does that help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, I was just, uh, testing,\u201d I said, and stepped off again. \u201cNow you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stepped up, and the needle made its considerably shorter journey to 160 pounds \u2013 still pretty heavy, though, for someone who still fit into the designer jeans she\u2019d arrived with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve gained 20 pounds?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could introduce you to a few trips to the sundae bar who\u2019d be able to explain,\u201d I chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve noticed my pants getting a LITTLE harder to button,\u201d she said reluctantly. \u201cBut not 20 pounds harder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going there \u2013 not most of it, anyway,\u201d I said, staring at her tits as I so often had occasion to do. \u201cIt\u2019s settling north of the border.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d said Amy in consternation. \u201cI mean, I like being busty, but it\u2019s getting beyond a joke. And this has only been a month! It\u2019s not normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you could \u2013\u201d I winced. I couldn\u2019t believe I was suggesting this. \u201cTry to lose it. Like with a\u2026 diet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked horrified. \u201cI\u2019ve NEVER dieted. What, you want food and you don\u2019t eat it? How does that even work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, me neither. It\u2019s downright unnatural, if you ask me.\u201d In that moment, I was hit with a revelation, like the first bite of a steak and bacon burrito. \u201cWhat would you think about going the other way, trying to even it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat down on her bed, unsupported bazongas bouncing. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems like all your weight gain is going to your tits. But most people aren\u2019t like that. You\u2019re going to gain weight \u2013 unlimited meal plan, ME for a roommate, it\u2019s just a fact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m cool with that,\u201d said Amy, \u201cI mean, I was expecting to thicken up, but not like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we fix it,\u201d I grinned. \u201cHey, if there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s, how to grow a belly and get a fatter ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened up my laptop and googled, \u201cfoods to gain belly and butt weight\u201d with my non-ice-cream-eating hand. I had to change my search terms a few times and scroll through a few pages of articles telling you how to AVOID these things, but eventually I found what I was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, it says here bread \u2013 baked goods \u2013 potatoes,\u201d I said. \u201cI have to say I haven\u2019t seen you eating much of any of those.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shrugged. \u201c I\u2019ve never really developed a taste for them. I was always more of an ice cream gal. Or chocolate. Ooh! Or fried chicken...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mused for about half a pint. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the plan: you\u2019re going on a cake diet. You\u2019re gonna add an entire cake to every meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like cake that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well, that\u2019s just completely insane,\u201d I said. \u201cHere.\u201d With a grunt of effort and a wail of springs, I leaned over and took a large pink box out from the midnight snack supply under my bed. I opened it to look at a heavenly triple-layer chocolate fudge cake. My sausage fingers itched to grab two of the pre-cut slices that second, but I held firm and passed it to Amy. Skeptically, she lifted up a thick slice and took a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly \u2013\u201d she couldn\u2019t even finish her expletive before grabbing another, and another, and another. \u201cUnf,\u201d she said finally, leaning back on her bed and tossing the empty box aside. \u201cCake is AMAZING!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may be a little late to the party on this one,\u201d I said with a belly-quivering chuckle. \u201cBut it looks like this plan can work. I think the bakery where I got this down the street delivers.\u201d Amy paused from licking frosting off her fingers and looked over at me with raised eyebrows. \u201cFine, I know they do. I\u2019m going to see about placing some sort of regular order. And we should go down there at least once a day.\u201d I licked my lips hungrily. It was good to help out a friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so for the next few weeks, the folks down at Cake Street saw a lot more of me than they bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost days after classes, Amy and I would call up and order ourselves personal size cakes to be delivered to our dorm room. On days when we were feeling particularly indulgent (which were, as I slowly turned my roommate over to the Fat Side, becoming increasingly common) we would skip a class or two so we could pig out on an extra helping of carbs. Sometimes when we were feeling adventurous, Amy talked me into actually going my fat ass down there so we could wedge ourselves into the booths they kept at the window and just stuff ourselves more conveniently. And we would eat all kinds of flavors; pound cakes, strawberry shortcakes, chocolate, double fudge, sometimes just plain ol' vanilla cake. Before the end of the month, we'd had every kind of cake on the menu! So we moved onto profiteroles, cupcakes, cookies and pies... anything with carbohydrates and yeast to help foster Amy's (and my own!) growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! This isn't working!\" Amy announced one day, standing on the scale that I kept proudly displayed in our living room, \"My boobs are still getting <i>bigger</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh. Cuz the rest of you is getting bigger, Amykins.\" I extend one wide wobbling arm to palm the crest of Amy's blossoming belly and give it a good shake, \"It's only natural those titties of yours are gonna keep growing while the rest of you porks out. We're trying to <i>curb</i> the growth here, not play God with your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut good God if this girl wasn't a pro. If I hadn't gone to an all-girls school where gaining forty pounds in two months was just shy of <i>ab</i>normal, I might have actually been worried about my redheaded roomie! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had made a habit of having our weekly weigh-ins. It was only fair that I did what I could to help her on her quest to even out. And other than tell her what to eat (everything, extra starch) and when to eat it (all the time) there wasn't a whole lot I could do. I figure the least I could do to help was tell her how good she was at putting on weight, and the scale did most of that work for me. Besides, it helped alleviate her questions as to <i>why</i> I bought the damn thing in the first place, and that was always helpful when it came to the topic of how I knew so much about packing on pounds like we were going on a trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not enough though.\" Amy said with an unmotivated roll of her eyes as she took hearty bites of her latest cupcake, \"My breasts are still getting bigger, faster than the rest of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy made it a habit of weighing herself naked in the living room. Aside from getting an \"accurate\" representation of her weight (a not-so-modest gain of another twenty pounds. My roommate would be at the big 200 before she knew it!) it also gave her an idea of how heavy her titties were in comparison to the rest of her. She would prop one of her massive mams up with one hand, roll it around a little with her fingers while she snacked freely on whatever we had laying around the dorm room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo-hoo.\" I stuck my tongue out at her, \"Have you ever tried having a butt big enough to crush furniture? It's not fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrection, it's very fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more cake.\" Amy said through bites of dough, \"We've been slacking. Eating cookies and stuff. We need to go back to one cake a day. A whole cake. Maybe two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could honestly watch Amy stress-eat all day. It was just so cute watching her freak out over school, her homework, and the fact that her breasts were growing faster than most people's student loan debt. I had her eating almost all the time now. She wasn't quite on the Mel Carlyle diet yet, but I was working her way up there. I had almost forgotten what it was like to have a roommate who was just as obsessed with their figure as I was! In a slightly different way, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Amy.\" I pinched the side of her belly, which was starting to cut into distinct rolls by this point as it lapped over her panties, \"<i>Two</i> cakes? You might start to get kinda chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.\" Amy bit into her cupcake, smearing bright blue frosting over her lips, \"Just for that, you can drive us back to Cake Street.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>University is one of those times in a young person's life where they should be out, making friends, socializing, really exploring their new home away from home for the next four to eight to ten years.  I wasn't really one for <i>roaming</i>, so the various trails that wound their way through the campus like so many snakes, all leading to various buildings that could've held any sorts of surprises for prying eyes of young adults, would probably remain unseen by me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless I had a good reason to explore.  Like the one Amy presented to me that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Friday, which meant I had the entire day free after 11 in the morning- that is, if I actually managed to haul my fat ass out of bed for my Macroeconomics course (Don't ask- I requested a new counselor for next semester- I'm <b>not</b> going in to Economics, no matter how hard they push it on me).  Amy wasn't so lucky- for some reason she decided that a lighter schedule earlier in the week and a heavier schedule on Friday was a good plan?  So she was usually out until after dark, if she didn't play hooky at some point to come back to the dorm to stuff her face with whatever I had dragged in throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when I heard a frantic banging on the door around 3 (and I was finally getting into <i>Friends</i>, dammit!) I assumed Amy had skipped class, or busted open her blouse and killed someone with the projectile button, or something.  What I <i>wasn't</i> expecting was a very out of breath Milo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, dude, where's the damn fire?\"  I exclaimed as he launched himself into our room.  The dude was literally out of breath- a rare feat for a guy as cut as him, who usually picked up things like, I dunno, industrial sized scales with no effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, you- you gotta...\"  He dramatically threw a hand out, one finger extended- at which point I realized that a few other guys from the dorm had crowded around the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy isn't here, guys.\"  I said in a flat tone.  Seriously, Amy had to be the only woman on the planet who could pack on twenty pounds in a few weeks and still attract more male suitors than... I dunno, Milla Jovovich in her prime, or something.  However, the crowd didn't disperse- which is when I realized they were staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel.\"  Milo had recovered, apparently, and he now stood, any trace of fatigue out of his system already.  Damn, that dude was fit.  Seriously.  Like, I would take longer recovering from walking up the hallway!  \"We're... Kinda in a pickle.  Uh...\"  That's when I also realized that the group of guys outside our room weren't the usual suspects.  For one, they were all as fit- if not fitter- than Milo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them- a tall, blonde dude who looked like he could actually pick <b>me</b> up- stepped forward.  \"Our Fraternity is entered in the annual cupcake eating fundraiser that Stuffington has every year.  I'm Brock, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charmed, I'm sure.\"  I quipped, taking the hand he extended and shaking it cordially.  I had to admit, it was pretty obvious where this was going- and I wasn't a huge fan of being utilized as a tool.  However- and you might find this hard to believe- I <i>really</i> had grown to like cupcakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\"  Oh, and he was polite!  Be still, my heart.  \"Anyways, Milo here-\" He pointed a finger at Milo, who bowed his head.  Holy shit, this dude had Milo wrapped around his finger.  \"-Wants to get into our Frat.  And so he claimed he could sinch us the win in this cupcake eating fundraiser.  Said there's no way in hell we'd be able to lose with his 'secret weapon', which I'm assuming is you.\"  I nodded.  Yup, this tracked, alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\"  Milo shouted, his drooped head snapping back to attention.  \"I hope you don't take offense- I just saw how much you and Amy have been getting from Cake Street- I just... Uh...\"  I was really milking it at this point, shooting what I was sure came across as a comical stinkeye in Milo's direction, but the poor guy wilted like a flower.  So I turned back to Brock.  <i>Brock.</i>  Seriously?  What a jock name.  Jock Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well- he isn't wrong.  I can eat sweets like a motherfucker.\"  Brock nodded, and a few of his jock posse fistbumped behind him.  <i>Be more of a cliche!</i> I almost yelled, but held back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also dawned on me at this point that I was, in fact, wearing a sweatshirt adorned with a large set of \"S&amp;U\" letters that were covered in crumbs from my latest meal- an entire cookie sheet cake.  It also dawned on me that I was wearing booty shorts that, from the front, could not be seen, giving all the men in my hallway and dorm the impression that I wasn't wearing pants.  To disperse these rumors, I waddled back to the couch, giving them all a clear view of my clearly clothed rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\"  There were a few audible whoops at this.  Apparently, just seeing a fat girl was enough to instill the belief that I could eat more than anyone else, I guess.  Of course, my daily trips to the various eateries around campus meant that at least a handful of these dudes had seen me gorge myself at one point or another.  Turns out being the token unashamed fat girl on campus came with a reputation.  \"And if I beat the competition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well- Milo would get in to the Fraternity.  Which I'm assuming-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd owe you like, a million favors Mel!  A <i>billion!</i>\"  Milo interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled.  \"Woah, cowboy.  We'll cross that road when we come to it.\"  I turned to face Brock again.  \"Any other perks to this job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock shifted slightly on his feet.</span></div></div>",

Because I am a fan of perks.\"  I didn't mention that most of the 'Perks' I had seen in my day were in form of \"Buy 9 Subs, Get the 10th Free\" or \"Every fifth carton of ice cream is free\" type perks.  Y'know, the good ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.  Our Frat has bi-weekly 'gatherings', and if you pull through on this, you'd get free access to all of them.  Normally, there's a cover.\"  He glanced at me for a second.  \"Yeah... You look 21 enough.  So free booze, basically.\"  I nodded.  That sounded alright.  \"And, uh.  I mean, we have a big brunch buffet every Saturday in the commons building.  You'd get into that for free too.  And, of course, we have a few... Connections, around campus.\"  Well, that certainly sounded suspicious.  \"We can talk about that later- If this works out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.  Look at me.  It'll work out.  And I'm in, if that wasn't obvious.\"  Milo whooped, and Brock grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tight.  Be at the courtyard by the clock tower tomorrow at noon.  And, uh...\" Brock shifted awkwardly on his feet.  \"You're gonna have to wear one of our shirts.  You're gonna need... Uh...\"  He waved his arms lazily in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brock.  Just get the biggest size you can.  I'll make it work.\"  He coughed awkwardly- For being a jock that looked like he was chiseled out of granite, he sure did crumble like a cookie when it came to discussing a woman's shirt sizes.  I got the impression he had tried to guess a woman's size before and it didn't go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded once more, then him and his group of dudes shuffled back down the hallway- except for Milo.  \"Mel, I seriously can't thank you enough.  I'll stop by tomorrow to walk over with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned.  \"About that.  That's like... five miles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilo laughed.  \"Good one Mel, it's like 200 yards from here.\"  I stared him down.  \"Oh.  Um.  I'll see if I can borrow a golf cart or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  You better.  Remember, you <i>owe</i> me.\"  He did a mock bow and backed out of the room, still bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mel.  Anything for my new best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're offering... I'd definitely take a pizza right now.  Or like, three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do!\"  Milo shouted from the hallway.  I silently hoped he wasn't still bowing- even as Amy wobbled her way into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is Milo walking backwards while bowing?  And I thought <i>I</i> was your best friend!\"  She pouted as she flopped down onto the couch next to me, causing both the couch and her horribly strained blouse to creak loudly.  I shot a side eye at my busty, bloated roommate.  The gap between every button was... <b>pronounced</b>, to say the least, meaning both her pale belly and double-enforced bra that probably involved at least three letters were pretty visible- of course, both probably weren't noticed due to the top four buttons being undone, leaving her with an ocean of cleavage that could probably turn the gayest dude on the planet straight- or at least bi-curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, a few things.  One, you <b>are</b> my best friend, don't worry.\"  I ruffled her hair.  \"Two, Milo is bowing to me because he owes a million- no, a <i>billion</i> favors, because I'm getting him into a fraternity, because I am a good person who does good deeds.  Three...  You honestly need to give up on blouses, dear, because they aren't doing you any favors.  Seriously, someone could fall into the cleavage and not be found for two weeks, all cutting their hand off to escape like in <i>127 Hours</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pulled a face.  \"Why'd you gotta get all gross!\" She looked down and sighed.  \"And... Yeah.  Why do you think I'm home early?\"  She grunted as she pushed herself off the couch, swiftly discarding said blouse in a rather practiced motion.  \"My professor said it was... Distracting.  And also... I may have lost three buttons since I put it on.  I wasn't exactly flaunting these things when I first got dressed.  That was a little more cleavage than even I was comfortable with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flopped back down, now shirtless.  \"And yet, here you are, not wearing a shirt.\"  I had to admit, those things were powerful- Even I couldn't break my stare to see whatever hilarious thing Joey just said, watching those sweater puppies wobble in her reinforced bra was absolutely hypnotizing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well- you're not gonna 'accidentally' trip and grab a tit, regardless of how much or little I show off.  The only reason I'm keeping this bra on is because I'm pretty sure I heard Milo say something about bringing pizza- which again, begs the question- what did you do to get that guy so hot on you?  I'm guessing you didn't seduce him or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, if Milo sees you in a bra, I think he will literally die.  Like, his brain will stop functioning, turn to liquid, and fall out his nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fake wretched.  \"Why are you being so gross today!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't want you eating all my damn pizza!\"  I shoved her, only to get entranced once again by her wobbling assets.  \"And Milo owes me because...\" I proceeded to explain the entire situation to her- and had just finished when there was a knock on our door. \"Are you seriously gonna sit here in a bra? Because if Milo dies because his head explodes like in <i>Scanners</i>, this whole deal presumably goes out the window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grunted.  \"Fine, let me know when he's gone.\" She stormed off into her room.  Despite the pounds she had accumulated over the past few weeks, I had to admit- this girl did not pack much in her lower half- she barely even had a muffin top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's open!\"  I shouted once Amy was safely concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope, uh... Cheese is okay.\" Milo muttered as he pushed his way into our room.  \"I got three, but... It's like 3:30, so they didn't have anything else.\"  He walked in, deposited the pizzas on our coffee table, and immediately spotted the blouse on the ground.  \"Oh, shit, is Amy here?\"  I rolled my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...  I thought maybe I could fit into her shirt.  Wanna watch me try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I'll just see you tomorrow, okay?  Goodnight Mel!\"  Milo was blushing, hard.  I guess it was pretty rare for him to have woman offer to try on clothing in front of him- even if they were rapidly approaching 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're-\"  I paused.  Could I really spare a pizza?  Amy <i>did</i> say I was her best friend...  Yeah.  That was a good move on her part.  \"You're good Amy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God!  I can smell that pizza, and I haven't eaten since noon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too excited.\"  I said, pulling one box off the pile and sliding it under the couch.  Stealth pizza.  Whaddup.  \"It's just cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy walked out- she had exchanged her bra for a \"loose\" tank top which showed off, somehow, even <b>more</b> cleavage than her bra, while also allowing her boobs to wobble much more aggressively than the bra did.  \"Pizza is Pizza.  Know who said that?\"  I grunted, a slice of pizza already crust-deep in my mouth.  \"Ghandi, probably.  So anyways... You're seriously gonna have some hookups around campus?  And you're, uh... I'm in on this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy third and fourth slices were gone at this point, so I could actually respond.  \"Dude.  Of <i>course.</i> If I can't get you in... I'll bring home a can or two for ya.  Maybe even three, if I'm feeling generous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mellllllll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, I'll get you in.  Don't worry about it.\"  I sandwiched three slices together, which elicited a shocked gasp from Amy.  \"<i>I'm in training!</i>\" I said dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like you need training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI attempted to hum the Rocky theme as I shoved triple-stack into my mouth, and failed miserably, instead shooting crumbs out of my mouth in a comical fashion.  \"Look, who's getting us the hookup?  I am.  Me.  So don't berate me, or I'll revoke your underage drinking privileges.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I arrived in my gilded chariot- a phrase which here means, a golf cart with Stuffington University's logo spray-painted on it- at 11:46 AM.  An early hour, to be sure, but worth it for the future pay-off.  Plus, I had already been up for almost two hours.  I currently was adorned in my eating gear: The largest t-shirt I had, which actually had a bit of give to it still (I had bought it as a joke like, six years ago, when it fit my frame like a loose dress- Oh, how times had changed.  The thing has at least eight X's in the size) and a pair of sweatpants that could probably encapsulate a compact car.  I wasn't oblivious to the fact that said golf cart was listing pretty hard to the right, IE my side, and when we 'parked', I turned and saw a deep rut left in the grass leading up to the clock-tower courtyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling confident, Mel?\"  Milo asked, innocently enough.  Oh, you sweet Summer child.  \"I mean, you did kinda devour like, five bagels today...\" Milo had, ever so kindly, invited me to the brunch that his future Frat held.  I had abstained from bacon, scrambled eggs, and pancakes, because I was a good glutton and didn't want to load up on calories.  However, when the five-hundredth (or second, but who can keep count) frat boy walked in front of me with an Asiago bagel... Well, I kinda lost my cool.  And ate like.. Five bagels.  Or six- Milo ran to the bathroom at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milo.  Sweetheart.  That was almost two hours ago.\"  I patted his shoulder with a pudgy hand as we approached the event.  \"I can do this.\"  We made our way through the handful of people who actually bothered to show up for this thing, at which point Brock came sprinting up.  He was wearing black trackpants with a matching black t-shirt that proudly displayed his Frat's logo- some Greek letters that I didn't recognize beyond their Greekness.  \"Mel!  Milo!  You made it!\"  He thrust a shirt in my direction.  \"Mel, this is the biggest we had in our storage... I...\"  He looked uncomfortable.  \"It's not that big.\"  I unfolded it and nodded.  It really wasn't.  Still... When in Rome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr Greece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled it over my head, wiggling my arms through the sleeves- and feeling my arm fat get pinched.  Not a great sign.  I pulled the fabric down, not hard, but forcefully, and managed to get the fabric down to about five inches below my fat tits.  Brock looked away, Milo stared.  \"It's a perfect fit!\"  I exclaimed, waving my arms in the air.  \"Seriously, I could get into <i>Penthouse</i> with this look.  Wait, do they still publish <i>Penthouse</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that the loudspeaker went off.  \"All fundraiser contestants, please report to the stage!  I repeat, all contestants for the 'Annual Stuffington Cupcake Fundraiser', please report to the stage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my cue!\" I shouted, and slowly made my way to the stage.  This shirt?  It didn't fit.  I was rather thankful for my oversized undershirt at this point- It wasn't exactly warm out- and despite what they say, fat people get cold just as easy as skinny ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I slowly made my way on-stage, I could tell that I was gonna win.  I wasn't the cockiest person in most situations, but these girls?  They couldn't eat their way through fifty cupcakes if their lives depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that this 'contest' was an excuse to flaunt the Fraternity's ability to attract the hottest girls.  As I slowly stumbled onto the stage, the other girls turned and stared like this was the first time they had seen a female that weighed more than 120 pounds soaking wet.  There were various t-shirts, boasting different Greek letters, but they were all tightly stretched against C to E cup bras that sat above flat tummies.  Shit, if this was a tits competition, Milo backed the wrong horse- Amy would've cleaned house in this category.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, they were nice.  A bit vapid, but nice.  They didn't know how to respond to a girl that weighed more than all of them combined, so they just awkwardly waved at me.  My eyes were focused on one thing- the cupcakes, which were comically piled up in a pyramid shape.  As the announcer rambled on in the background, I sized up the crowd.  Lots of dudes, lots of various Fraternity shirts that matched the colors and letters of the girls on stage.  Too bad they wouldn't be winning the cupcake crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the whistle blew, I began.  Cupcakes were kind of a joke- given how many cakes I had devoured in mere minutes, Cupcakes could've been potato chips, given how fast I ate them.  One by one, the skinny, busty blondes and brunettes \"conceded\" while I continued to devour.  I ate and ate and <i>ate</i>.  At one point, I saw Amy cheering me along, her massive chest wobbling in time with her fist thrusts and attracting the attention of numerous frat boys.  I only stopped eating when I reached for a wrapper that held 1/3 of a cupcake, only to have a trophy slapped on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations are in order, for...\" The guy with the mic paused for a second while he was handed a cue-card.  \"Mel Carlyle... For beating our previous record by... Almost fifty-five cupcakes!  A round of applause for her, and her Fraternity, who... Clearly... Picked a winner this year...\"  The disappointment?  Palatable  I could tell by the announcer's voice that they weren't used to girls showing up who actually knew how to eat- and had the body to prove it.  I had a nagging feeling that next year's rules might be a little more strict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock had gotten up on stage at this point, while the various busty beauties walked away.   \"I knew you would come through.  And you have.  You, and anyone you know?  You're cleared for every event we have for the next year.  And if you ever need... Well, a bunch of dudes.  You know how to reach me.\"  Brock held his hand out, and I was surprised to see a sticky-note with his number and his university e-mail on it.  \"Seriously.  You really killed it up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he was gone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, this might come as a bit of a surprise, but I was never really a <i>partier</i> back at Buttercombe or at home.  I mean, sure, I had done the whole \"sneak a beer or two from the six pack of beer from the fridge and hope no one notices\" routine once or twice- my Dad usually noticed but didn't say anything because he's a cool dude.  Of course, a few cans of Bud Light does not a drunk Mel make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I knew some girls at Buttercombe who were 9 to 5 teetotalers and 5:01 to 2 AM drunken sailors, so I could've had my pick of any sort of flavored schnaps and vodkas.  But I was more interested in stuffing my face than getting blitzed, so it just never naturally came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess in that regard, Amy and I were pretty different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, Mel!  I'm so excited!  Free booze!\"  She waved her arms wildly in the air as we made our way to the frat party- I could hear the bass thumping from our apartment, which was the only reason that I had agreed to go in the first place- the party was practically next door to our dorms.  \"I haven't had a drink since I got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes.  \"What a burden.  Sobriety truly is a cruel mistress, Amy.\"  I wasn't gonna lie- I wasn't in the best mood for this.  We had made our daily voyage to Cake Street, but the dude behind the counter had recognized me from the cupcake thing the day before (what can I say, I'm basically famous around campus now) and hooked us up with several free cakes on top of our order.  Which was awesome, don't get me wrong.  What <i>wasn't</i> awesome was taking a bet with Amy that I could eat a cookie cake faster than her, then winning, only for her to want to do best two out of three, and then eating another triple fudge cake on top of it- my sugar rush had been the stuff of legends- <i>I actually walked down the hallway to the vending machine instead of making Amy go</i>- but that buzz was long gone, leaving me fatigued, grumpy, and most of all- <b>hungry.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!  This is gonna be awesome!  Free booze!\"  She bounced on her feet, doing some sort of pathetic skipping thing for about four feet before stopping and arching her back.  \"Fuck, that hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you better keep careful with those things at this party, or you'll concuss someone.  And if you get too drunk, I'm just leaving you there, I can't carry your fat tits home.\"  I had put on my usual wear- sweatpants and a sweatshirt, because it was a fucking frat party and it didn't matter.  Amy, however, had gotten dressed up- which, with her fatter frame and humongous melons, meant she has crammed herself into a cocktail dress that was one wobbly step away from shredding into confetti.  Seriously, her boobs were oozing out of the top like overproofed bread dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, lighten up!  And I'm not gonna get too drunk, don't even worry.\"  By now we had arrived at the party, and I was slightly winded, while my roommate was starting to act like she was gonna develop a bad case of the shakes if she didn't do a keg stand in the next five minutes- something which I warned her against doing, lest she flash the entire party when her ballooning chest burst out of her dress.  She assured me she wouldn't literally do a keg stand, which I took as truth- I honestly don't know if her larger frame would even let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dude at the front door didn't even glance at Amy- just scribbled on her hand with a sharpie while getting a nice eyeful of her cleavage.  When I tried to walk in behind her, he put a hand up to stop me.  \"You gotta pay.  Ten bucks.\"  My jaw dropped.  Cool, my boobalicious roomie gets in without a second look, and I get fucking stopped by the party gestapo?  I didn't think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fuckface, I don't know if you're aware, but I won this frat bragging rights for the next year for some dumb cupcake thing, so I suggest you let me in before I give Brock a call.\"  It was hard to tell with the bad lighting and black lights, but I'm pretty sure the dude went completely pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I... Sorry, Mel.  It's... Really dark.  Hard to see.  Pleasedon'ttellBrockohmyGod.\"  He scribbled on my hand, then shuffled out of the way so I could actually fit through the doorway- if he stayed where he was he probably would've been crushed against the frame.  I still hip-checked him on the way in, with a little too much force- he toppled backwards into a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry.  Maybe next time don't be a dick to the fat girl, though.  Just a thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped into the dim living room of the house that had been turned into party headquarters for the night.  It honestly looked a lot like the cliche college parties they show on television.  A shit ton of balloons and streamers (seriously?  I didn't realize we were in Kindergarten) several kegs set up around the perimeter, a few drunk people making out on the couch.  Oddly enough, the music inside seemed almost quieter than the music that seemed to be permeating throughout the campus.  I made a mental note to ask Milo or Brock if they did that on purpose the next time I saw them.  \"Oh shit!\"  Someone shouted from a corner.  \"It's Mel!  Mel!\"  A bunch of people looked up at me as I searched for who called out to me- only to spot Brock walking towards me.  \"Hey, everyone!  Shut up for a minute!\"  The room got quiet, leaving only the music playing in the background.  \"This is Mel Carlyle, and she put us on the map this year.  You see this girl around campus?  You say hi.  Be nice.  If she wants something, she gets it.  We take care of our own, and if we could sign you into our house, we would.  But we can't, so... Yeah.\"  Weak finish to the speech, Brock, but the sentiment was appreciated.  There was a smattering of applause, and then everyone went back to what they were doing- mainly making out or trying to get drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was very sweet of you Brock.  You're quite the charmer.\"  I winked at him.  He took a long pull off his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the least I can do.  We've struggled in the past in the community events around campus.  Getting that cupcake fundraiser win upfront was a pretty good power play for the year.  Oh, shit, you need a drink!\"  I started to protest, before realizing I really didn't have any excuse.  \"We got plenty of beer, but you don't strike me as a beer person. Lemme... Hold on.\"  He walked off down the hallway.  I looked around, realized I couldn't see Amy anywhere, and decided to follow.  Besides, a few people were still staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waddled down the hallway into a weird kitchen set up- there was a small corner with a stove and a sink and a microwave, but the main attraction was a massive table that was covered from end to end with bottles of booze.  And among the smaller crowd in here was my lovable roommate, Amy, conversing with some scrawny dude that I had never seen before and a short chubby girl that I vaguely recognized from our dorm.  He was currently mixing a drink for her, which was impressive since his eyes were firmly locked on her tits, while Amy laughed and conversed with the shorter girl- and sipped on a beer.  Boy, she sure moved quick.  \"Mel!\"  She shouted, waving at me as though I was across a crowded room and not standing six feet away from her.  \"C'mere!  You gotta meet my friend, Sasha!  She's awesome, I have class with her!\"  Brock was talking to the scrawny guy, who finally broke his endless gaze at Amy's mammaries to talk to him.  When he finished pouring whatever clear liquid he was dumping into the solo cup, Brock grabbed it out of his hand, took a sip, then handed it off to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Ray.  He's kind of our bartender, usually until everyone is drunk enough to not care about what they're drinking.  This is... Uh, what do you call this again, Ray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was staring at Amy's boobs again.  \"It's, uh... It's kinda like a Fog Cutter, but we didn't have any sherry, so I used bourbon.  Yeah.\"  I didn't know what a Fog Cutter was.  Or, honestly, what sherry was.  I think you use it in cooking sometimes?  Still, it didn't smell half bad, and when I took a sip, I was pleasantly surprised with how it tasted.  It was boozy, for sure, but not overly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good, dude.  Hey Amy?\"  She slammed back the rest of her beer and threw the empty can into a large trash can that was sitting in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"  She said eagerly.  Oh, God.  It occurred to me that my top heavy roommate might be a light weight when it came to the spirits.  If she was that fucked up on one beer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do you wanna stay at this thing?\"  Brock had been pulled aside by the shorter girl, and Ray was back to making another drink, presumably for Amy.  \"I mean, I'm cool for free drinks, and this weird Fog Hat or whatever it's called is good, but I'm hungry.\"  Amy stared at me wide eyed, before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think they don't have food here?\"  I looked around the kitchen and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure doesn't look like it, and we <i>are</i> in the kitchen.\"  Amy giggled again as Ray handed her a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ralph.  Follow me, Mel!\"  Ray didn't seem phased that his busty crush didn't even know his name, instead watching longingly as Amy ran off down another hallway that lead away from the kitchen.  I dutifully marched after her, sipping at my drink- and that's when the smell hit me.  There was pizza in the house!  I guess the smell of empty beer cans and open booze bottles distracted me, but I'd know that smell anywhere.  I hadn't quite mastered the smell portfolio of the wide array of pizza places around the campus, but the strong garlic scent just <b>screamed</b> Luigi's Pizza... Or maybe Quick Slice?  If it was Quick Slice, I hoped and prayed they got a few deluxes.  If it was Luigi's... Well, their meat lover pie was the stuff of legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, they bought both.  We emerged into yet another room- much like the booze kitchen, there was a massive table overloaded with goods- but this time, it was pizza!  Pizza, garlic knots, cheese sticks, chicken wings... A true spread.  A spread that was made for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can stay a while.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Look.  I could've eaten all the pizza, and cheesy bread, and wings, and garlic knots, <i>and</i> the sliders from White Castle that some dude drunkenly deposited on the table after I cleared off a few boxes... But I didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mostly because I felt that all the skinny women and horny frat boys probably wouldn't have appreciated my skills, but also because I didn't feel like passing into a food coma on the couch and being rolled home, <i>Willy Wonka</i> style.  So I abstained from glutting myself, instead eating a few appetizers and a pizza by myself before forcefully shoving myself off the couch and slowly making my way through the house to find Amy again.  It was when I went into the living room, scanning the various faces of boys and girls (and boys and girls and boys and girls, I thought in my head- fuck, that song was catchy) when a visibly drunker Brock stopped me.  \"Mel!\"  He shouted, waving his brightly colored drink in the air.  If I had to guess, I'd say it was Midori (yuck) and lemonade?  It was a mixture of green and yellow, at any rate- and alarmingly neon-colored.  \"Mel... Did you know... That I'm... Just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put a finger against his lips.  \"Brock.  I won that contest.  I can win other ones.  I just want to find my friend.  You see, she's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy???\"  Brock shouted, and I swear to goodness, his eyes literally turned into question marks- like a cartoon.  This dude was in no mood to talk in front of a billion of his peers, so I guided him by the hand towards a hallway that seemingly hadn't been filled with horny college-goers.  \"Mel, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped him again.  \"Brock.  We've known each other for like, sixty hours.  I just want to find my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at me, slightly glassy eyed for a moment, before continuing.  \"I wasn't gonna hit on you, dummy!\"  I narrowed my eyes.  \"Sorry!  Sorry!  I'm drunk, Mel.  I was just gonna thank you again.  You got me a lot of cred by wining that competition, you know?\"  He took a long sip of his drink.  \"Uhm... Amy is, uh.   With one of our younger members.  A real suave dude.  I think his name is Jason?  Jack?  Uh.... James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes.  \"It starts with a 'J'.  Got it.  Thanks, Brock.\"  I started to walk back down the hallway towards the main party, only to feel a hand grab me- I turned around, ready to punch Brock in his drunken face, just for the fun of it- only to spot Ralph- Er, Ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\"  He said simply.  It was clear he hadn't been imbibing in his own creations... Heavily, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ray.  How's it going?\"  I asked, trying to keep it casual.  My stomach was already beginning to rumble for more of the pizza and accoutrements provided, which meant I needed to wrangle up Amy before I really lost my patience and devoured... Well, not all of it- it was enough food to feed at <i>least</i> forty people- but I would've made a dent in it, for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I just-\"  A cold solo cup appeared in my hand, almost by magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Need a drink.  I get it.\"  He nodded sagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I need to know where Amy is!  I wanna go home, and she's my roomie!\"  Ray's eyes went wide.  \"Don't get weird, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not...\"  I clearly offended the guy, and I started to stutter out an apology, but he cut me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's upstairs with Janus...\"  I barely managed to hold back my groan of disgust.  \"Who even names their kid Janus, anyways?  See you around, Mel.\"  I made a note to keep Ray on my good side as I sipped whatever drink he gave me.  It tasted like heaven, even as I climbed the stairs (my mortal enemy) to find Amy.  Thankfully, the second floor wasn't filled with groans of sexually-repressed young adults, and I began the laborious process of opening every door on the second floor and weakly calling out Amy's name as I did so.  Finally, after several failed attempts- and miraculously not busting into any mid-sex scenes- I found Amy... Sitting alone on a bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!  We gotta go home soon...\" I shouted, before finishing off my drink and lazily throwing my now empty cup behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"  She shouted from the bed, apparently in good spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"  I paused for a moment.  \"Where's, uh, Janus?\"  I felt hotter than usual- I realized my drink was probably plenty boozy.  Amy scowled at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janus?  Oh, that douche?  Trust me, his hands got on these things-\"  She grabbed her tits (I would've assumed, of course) for emphasis.  \"- And I said goodbye.\"  I plopped down next to her- too aware that my entire left ass cheek hung off said bench, even with her (relatively) frame staying on next to my massive right cheek.  \"He was... A pervert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Are you ready to go home?\"  I offered helpfully.  \"I mean.  I am...\"  My head was starting to spin lightly.  I wasn't used to feeling drunk, since my body fat tended to absorb most booze- whatever I had been given clearly was strong.  To my surprise, Amy was shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna... Get drunk.\"  She muttered.  \"Forget about the fact that most dudes just like my tits.  There's more to me than that!  You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in agreement.  \"Trust me, I've got the tits of a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed.  \"-A fat girl.  I know.  You just have... All the other stuff.  Of a fat girl.  My fat goes to my tits.  Whatever.\"  Amy stood up, before pulling me to my feet. \"Look, I need another drink.  I'm getting you one, too.  Then we can talk more.  Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in agreement.  I felt good on the couch, and I didn't want to get up- and I definitely didn't want to back down the stairs- so I simply watched as my top-heavy friend stumbled down the stairs...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Okay.\"  She flopped down next to me, and I- much to my surprise- felt my entire form wobble a little.  Was she seriously getting big enough to start acting as a counterweight to my own massive form?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on a futon!

And hey!\"  I poked her in the boob, causing her to wince as my finger sunk knuckle deep into her fleshy upper half.  \"You're the one who wanted to come here, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, first of all, you're not wrong.  But... I just... Ugh.\"  She took another drink from her cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down, killer- I warned you before, I'm not carrying you home.  I mean, I couldn't, anyways.  I'd probably just hide you in the bushes and come back in a few hours to wake you up... Because we're friends and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's part of the problem!  Before I started bloating up like a balloon from some perverts fantasy land where all your weight goes to your tits, I could get a nice buzz off of like, ONE drink!  I've had four of these and I just feel... Kinda hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded sagely.  \"Welcome to the life of a fatty.  It's hard to get drunk when you have an extra hundred pounds or more of flab to soak up all the booze.  I know that's not technically how it works, but... Even someone like me who's never really gotten rowdy off anything but beer before can tell you it takes a lot more get to a fatass drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\"  She pouted.  I put my arm around her shoulder- resisting the urge to bury my face into her mesmerizing chest (in a platonic way, obviously), I instead leaned my head on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... You're my roomie and my best friend and I don't wanna see you all depressed... What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... God, I just honestly thought that Janus dude wanted to come up here and talk or something!  I just wish there was literally one person that didn't just stare at my tits the entire time I was talking!\"  I briefly stopped watching Amy's tits wiggle to let out a small noise of affirmation.  \"I... Ugh, I know I'm just being a dumb baby about it.  Like I said, I don't even feel drunk!  I just feel kinda... Weird.  And I know you don't wanna stay much longer, so let's just finish up and head back to our room.  We can get pizza or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up off the <b>futon</b> and held my hand out.  Amy stared up at me- and for a second, I sympathized with Janus.  That girl's cleavage could hold a potted plant between it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She moped, staring into her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to party.  Let's party.  And also I want more pizza, and I'm not waiting for delivery- and I think you do too.  Drink your drink, and let's get another.\"  She grinned up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we gonna get turnt, Mel?\"  I groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say 'turnt' again and I'm leaving.\"  She frowned at me again, before finishing her drink and taking my hand.  I hefted her up, partially to prove I was still the heavier counterweight in the equation- and I was... For now.  I made a mental note to think about this more when I wasn't lightly buzzing on booze-juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, my boy Ray was still tearing it up at the drink table.  \"Ray!\"  I shouted, shooting him a grin and hoping that me dragging Amy back into his line of sight was a good way to make up for my social faux pas earlier.  \"Look who I found, and she wasn't even hanging out with Janus!\"  He grinned at me and I took it as a good sign, so I walked up and whispered in his ear for a moment.  He grinned and got to work.  \"Yo, Amy, pizza!\"  We ran into the food room- while a major dent had been made in the table (including, much to my disappointment, the sliders were gone.  Hot commodity, I guess), but there was still plenty of greasy goodies for us to go to town on- which we did, with pleasure.  Ray showed up in time, handing off drinks to Amy and myself- and now I could tell he had given up on hiding the booze.  Amy's eyes went wide at her first sip- and I won't lie, it made me a little proud to watch my fatass roommate hold her drink in one hand while expertly chowing down on a double-stacked slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drank my own drink at the same rate as her- and if there was any doubt that I was getting drunk in my mind before, this definitely cemented it... And made me remember why I tried not to drink that much.  It was like my hunger had multiplied by a thousand, and soon I had resorted to my pizza burrito technique, audience be damned.  Amy was off giggling in a corner while talking to Ray, which I counted as my good deed for the night- although I honestly barely noticed the two chatting as I continued to plow through the pizza table.  At some point I became aware of a very tight feeling in my chest- and immediately let loose the loudest belch I had ever released in my life.  It was like the air had been sucked out of the party-  Only for a few \"Wooo\" shouts and some light applause to occur.  However, it definitely snapped me out of my drunken gorging- which made me realize just how full I suddenly felt.  I waddled slowly over to the nearest ratty couch and flopped down on it- it let out several cracking noises and I was sure I had broken it- something I confirmed when I saw that one side now rose slightly in the air.  Whoops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay had disappeared, and Amy wobbly walked over to me.  \"Thank you Mel!\"  She shouted- clearly, she was over the fence.  \"This is great, Ray went to get me another drink!\"  I tried to smile, but I was too full, so I just moaned and rubbed my bloated belly.  \"Yeahhh, you really went kinda nuts on that pizza...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I groaned miserably as I tried to calm my roaring gut- the fact that two different guys had brought me and Amy a beer in the past half hour really wasn't helping- and because I was a glutton  (both for punishment and in general) I couldn't just say <i>no</i>.  So I spent however long it was that we sat there belching as subtly as possible, eager to calm my stomach which was less than happy with the amount of gluten, cheese and tomato sauce I had crammed into it over the past few hours- and I doubted very much the booze was helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to feel as though I could actually stand again when there was a loud thud from the front entrance area, followed by a lot of shouting.  \"Oh man, I wonder if there's a fight?\"  Amy slurred, launching herself up from the couch- only further heightening my fear that she was going to explode out of her dress.  While her boobs were still oozing out of the top of the thing, her belly was bloating out further and further as the night went on- and if there wasn't so much noise coming from the front, I swear I would've heard a stitch or two tear.  Groaning, I slowly stood up from the couch, pushing down on the armrest, wincing as I heard the flimsy thing crack loudly from my weight being pushed against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe wandered out to the front where a small crowd had gathered- one guy sat, looking dazed, in the middle of the group, while Brock held back another guy.  \"That's Janus!\"  Amy gasped, dramatically, pointing at the sleezebag that Brock was currently holding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, FUCK you!\"  He shouted- his face was red and he clearly had had too much to drink tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even do anything, jackass!\"  The guy on the ground shouted back- his nose was bleeding.  This sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you, shut up!  Janus, go the fuck home- and you're not coming to anymore parties!\"  Brock shouted, before looking out the window and noticing a blinking blue light.  \"Seriously, someone called campus security?  Fuck!\"  He let go of Brock, who huffed off out the front door.  \"Alright, everyone out the back, I guess.  Party's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was slightly bummed out that I would no longer have access to basically unlimited pizza, I had to admit I was growing tired of the party scene.  I kinda just wanted to collapse on the couch, kick out of my now almost too tight sweatpants, and veg out for a while on one of the cartons of ice cream we had snagged from the ice cream shop up the street from our place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we walked home- well, waddled and weaved would be more accurate- I was stuffed, and Amy was drunk- we discussed the events of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really know how to pick 'em, Ames.\"  I pointed out as I slowly waddled back to our apartment, already huffing and puffing- my gut felt like a rock and I really didn't feel like moving as much as I was forced to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't- look, he was cute, right?  That's all.  Ugh.  I'm just... I'm like, <i>done</i> with guys, you know?  I mean, seriously...\"  She plunged her hand into her purse and pulled out- much to my surprise- a can of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!\" I gasped, in mock horror.  \"That's not very ladylike of you, to imbibe in the men's drink.  Why, I have half a mind to report you to the constable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, shut up.  I told you, I just wanted to get drunk and pretend all of... <i>That,</i> never happened.  Stupid jackass starting a fight in a party, no wonder he thought he could just grab a handful as soon as we were alone.  Blugh.\"  Amy pulled a face before cracking open the beer and chugging it- I watched in awe as she slammed the beer down in a few quick seconds before throwing the empty can off the path and into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, littering, stealing, and public intoxication!  It's like I don't even know you, Amy!\"  I jokingly punched her in the arm- the light movement almost sent her off the path- she stumbled a few steps before regaining her balance.  Letting out a belch, she pulled out her keycard as we approached our dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.  It's just been a bad night, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way to the room, where, once the door shut, Amy immediately began to struggle out of her dress.  Watching someone as top-heavy as Amy pull themselves out of a dress was a sight to be seen, let me tell you.  Free of the restrictive garment, which she chucked into the corner, I got a few moments of what I assumed every straight man's fantasy was- a topless Amy- before she disappeared into her room, appearing a moment later in a sweatshirt that I distinctly remembered being a <i>lot</i> looser a mere month ago.  \"Alright, what are we doing?  I don't wanna go to bed yet.\"  Unsurprisingly, Amy had procured yet another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of those things did you steal?  Damn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bag was mostly empty.\"  She shrugged, flopping down on the couch next to me.  I had kicked out of my sweatpants, and now sat in just my hoodie on the couch- while Amy sat in her own sweatshirt- the epitome of two lazy, fat college women.  \"I took like five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Can I have one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked at me, taking a long sip of her own beer.  \"Only if you agree to be on ice cream duty tonight...\"  I groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not worth it.  Have 'em all, drunky.\"</span></div></div>",

I try to extend that respect to everyone else around me. That being said, if <i>I</i> were Amy (no judgement, just a simple matter of fact!) I probably would have stopped after we left that night. And I definitely, probably, wouldn't have drunk all five beers in one sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, hey, don't get mad at me. I hit the sack <i>way</i> before Amy had guzzled her way through most of a six pack. I went to bed about the time she cracked her second beer and continued to drone on and on about what a shitty night that was and how stupid that party had been and blah blah Janus blah blah frat boys blah blah belch. My roomie was pretty fun all around for the most part, but she had been such a downer. I mean, I can't say that I blame her, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint is, Amy woke up with a <i>monster</i> hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URR-<i>RRRURP</i>!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne that actually sounded like a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up to this window-rattling burp that, normally, would have come from me. But instead it had come from the living room, where I discovered Amy passed out on the couch. In the sun. With a hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ christ fuggin' christ...\" Amy squeezed her eyes shut as tight as they would go and threw her arm over her face, \"Goddammit who turned the fucking sun on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I toddled my way over to my roommate, still half-dressed and still reeking of alcohol, I couldn't help but laugh. I'd never seen Amy... well, like this. I mean, I'd gotten plenty of time to see in her in her undies, and her cute little tummy rolling into her lap was nothing new either. But I'd never seen my roomie go on a bender like that. Last night was rough and all but... well, at least I got to see a new side to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ames.\" I said quietly, \"Amy? Amykins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your footsteps. Are so. Loooooud.\" Amy moaned as she flopped down on the couch and buried her head in the blanket, \"For the love of all things decent and holy, draw the fucking blinds please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a step forward<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Quietly</i>.\" she hissed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a big girl tiptoe forward. And then another, and another. The bright morning sun was reduced to a little gray hue in my room as I turned the blinds down. Not that it did much good for Amy. She kept her head buried in the blankets like a hungover ostritch. She laid on her belly, and burped loudly into the covers. She quickly threw them off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross.\" Amy's face twisted in disgust, \"Gross in there. Stay out here in the bright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, is that all you can handle?\" I did my best to keep my voice low so as not to upset her post-beverage sensibilities, \"Back at Buttercombe, we did this every couple weeks. I got in a fight with a girl twice my size and woke up to go to Ms. Holloway's class the next morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good fer you.\" Amy snarled, her eyes shut, \"Not all of us have all that fat to soak up the alcohol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was pretty skinny back then.\" I huffed, offended, \"I hadn't even put on my first fifty pounds yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't... don't care. No talk now.\" Amy grumbled, grabbing the blanket and snuggling up under it, \"Skipping class. Staying inside forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy come on, it can't be that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead inside.\"</span></div></div>",

Rise and shine!\"  I poked her in the boob, which got her to rise- sort of.  She flopped violently off the couch and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't want it.\"  She muttered, face down.  \"Head hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but sigh.  \"Look, first off?  You're not allowed to go with parties with me anymore if you're just gonna be a hungover brat in the morning.  And secondly, breakfast isn't all I brought! Look!\"  I shook a bottle of Advil loudly.  \"C'mon, take your medicine, and eat your breakfast.  We've got Economics in forty and I'm not going solo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, after a bit more coercing I got Amy up and seated, with a nice room-temp coffee, the largest cup of ice water I could wrangle together (Thanks, Avengers movie theater cup!  Fifty-four ounces of pure icy hangover cure) and a folded over paper plate from the cafeteria holding as much scrambled eggs and bacon I could manage to smuggle out in my oversized hoodie pouch.  With a few Advil in her, plus a rather modest breakfast, Amy was good as new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust kidding, she looked like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let her wear her sunglasses to class, with her hood pulled firmly over her head, because I'm a good roomie, but also because I sucked at Economics and I could count on Amy, hungover or not, to take pretty good notes.  Other than a wise-ass comment from our professor when we walked in about Amy partying too hard the previous night, eliciting a grunt from the offended party, class was fairly uneventful.  I couldn't help but be thankful that Amy and I had this class together- although Amy was usually the one dragging me to it, not the other way around.   And my hangover gambit paid off in spades- I managed to completely zone out fifteen minutes in, but Amy thankfully took somewhat studious notes- in between groaning or stifling belches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we made our way out of the classroom, Amy was acting more like herself- namely, she was ravenous.  \"I need like, a hundred cakes.  Seriously.  I'm starving, why didn't you bring me more breakfast?\"  I glared at her.  \"I mean, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, nothing.  Your hungover ass could barely scarf down the breakfast I brought you, you ungrateful cow.  But I agree, cake sounds good.  Maybe not a hundred...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gawked at me from behind her glasses.  \"Wow, I never though I'd hear Ms. Carlyle turn down a massive amount of carbs and sugar before!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be a glutton, but I'm not dumb.  That's like... Fifty pounds of food, dude.  Be realistic.  I could probably eat three cakes, max.\"  I wasn't usually this modest, but honestly, I wasn't feeling 100% after last night either, and the thought of shoveling fifty cakes into my fat face sounded... Not great.  Which was very out of character for me, but whatever.  Besides, I knew Amy was just talking out of her ass anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I</i> could eat three cakes in my sleep, Mel!  Don't tell me you're getting soft on me- well, you know what I mean.\"  She said, poking my gut.  I slapped her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we seriously doing this?  Are you challenging me, of all people, to an eating contest?  I think you're still drunk, Amy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think you're wussing out on me!   C'mon, we've got our eating clothes on, let's do this!\"  I shrugged.  I could eat, and she was right- we were both dressed in our stretchiest of sweat pants and loosest hoodies- perfect post party clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, fine.  This is a dumb idea, but fine.  Let's go.  If you puke on me because you suddenly feel too hungover to eat halfway through I swear I'm gonna smack your head so hard that all the Advil in the world won't fix it.\"</span></div></div>",

So, we slowly swerved our significant selves towards one of the half-dozen coffee shops littering the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have... Uh... Shit, what's that drink with the peppermint, and the chocolate, and the-\" Amy said, bouncing on her heels and causing her chest to wobble underneath her shirt- which went completely unnoticed by the bored barista.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pepper-Mocha Melt?\"  I rolled my eyes.  Just call it a fucking hot chocolate with mint and be done with it.  Coffee shops had the lamest names for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that!  But um, blended like a milkshake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One frozen Pepper-Mocha!\"  The girl screamed, then looked at me.  \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged.  \"Um, one of those, I guess.\"  The girl looked ready to strangle me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST KIDDING, TWO!\"  She shouted- the other barista stopped, sighed, and started adding ingredients to the blender.  \"Great, it's gonna be 11.55.\"  My eyes went wide- holy shit, coffee was seriously that expensive?  I almost never went into these places- usually someone else bought it for me- case in point, Amy whipped out her wallet and handed over a crisp twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I owe you for getting me up this morning.  Besides, the cakes are coming out of your tab, right?\"  I shrugged, again.  I wasn't really feeling the cake contest anymore- the walk to the coffee shop had taken out my fighting spirit, and I honestly just wanted to go and crash on the couch.  I was about to say such to Amy and just deal with her gloating about being able to eat more than me \"because I wussed out\" or whatever, when I spotted Milo sitting in the corner, looking incredibly upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's Milo!\"  I shouted cheerfully as I walked over to his table, where he sat looking at his phone, a frown etched into his (otherwise admittedly handsome) features.  It was funny- he barely fit on his tiny cafe chair because of his muscular stature, whereas I had to scoot two chairs together just to house my titanic ass- and I could feel my cheeks pooling off each side, anyways.  \"Why you lookin' all upset?  You drink too much, like Amy?\"  I asked cheerfully- Amy let out an indignant grunt from the counter, where she waited for our drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... No.  I got an invite to this thing, but um... I couldn't find anyone to go with me.  And it'd look dumb if I showed up solo, you know?\"  He glanced at his phone as it vibrated, perked up for a moment, read it, and slumped down even further.  \"Seriously, I've asked every chick I know!\"  I decided to ignore that- since I hadn't been asked.  Milo wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but I could tell that he- like most dudes- didn't really feel like showing up with a big, bodacious babe like myself when everyone else had brought a size four or below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at him, placing a hand on his, which got me a small smile.  \"Milo, there's no shame in going stag, dude.  I've done it plenty of times!\"  I shot him a grin, but his face remained glum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different, you're-\" I got ready to be pissed off, and pulled my hand back.  \"-a girl, that's totally allowed!\"  I faltered.  Milo was a blockhead, but he wasn't an asshole.  I genuinely felt bad for him...  Until I got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you haven't asked <i>everyone</i> you know...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amy liked cake and <i>cup</i>cakes and muffins and bagels and donuts and that cinnamon raisin bread you buy at the store...And then I introduced her to things like baked potatoes loaded with sour cream and bacon and butter. French fries, potatoes au gratin, the usual. And <i>then</i> I got her well-versed in the art of sandwich making. I didn't really even have to try that hard\u2014I just sort've kept doing what I was doing. Which was a total breeze for me, by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ability to just kinda go with the flow was <i>probably</i>, in retrospect, why I didn't notice that things were going a little <i>too</i> according to plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Mel, that's a lot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy, listen to me.\" I placed my arms on her shoulder and turned her forcibly towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're thinking with <i>these</i>.\" I said, stretching out my fingers and digging my palms deep into her tits through her sweater, \"You remember these? The things you're trying to counterbalance? Yeah, they don't like this stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just stared at me, wide-eyed, as I took my hands off of her boobs and grabbed her by the tummy. It was pretty grabbable by that point, with a nice little hang over her jeans. There was a distinct pooch, an obvious testament to my training and her newfound affinity for carbohydrates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to start thinking with <i>this</i>.\" I gave her belly a good firm shake with both hands, \"If you ever want to be able to <i>not</i> have to wear 'my eyes are up here' t-shirts, you'll have to make that change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, I don't have a\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's that Amy?\" I cupped my hand to my ear, \"I wasn't listening because I was too busy staring at your disproportionately big knockers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strong silence between the two of us as the rest of Cake Street purred around us. I saw Amy's expression harden from confusion to newfound resolution. I was never more proud of her than when she walked up to the counter and said, all by herself;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a whole sheet cake, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more of that.\" I slapped her hand away from her red Solo cup full of Lipton, \"If you want to put on the <i>right</i> kind of pounds, we're gonna put you on the good stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most college girls, I had an ample supply of beer. You can thank Milo for that\u2014he was more than willing to toss a couple of cans my way after a few good parties. I wasn't what one would call a \"heavy drinker\" (other than the fact that I was, you know, heavy and also a drinker) but I'd managed to amass quite the little cache of beer cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, it needed to be taken care of before dorm inspection anyway, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, all I can drink is beer now?\" Amy snorted, her double chin accentuated by her position on the couch, \"That doesn't sound very practical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, not <i>just</i> beer.\" I plopped down next to my officially tubby trainee, much to the couch's audible disdain, \"Lots of bubbles though. Soda, ginger-ale. Shit like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cracked the beer open, and then one for myself, and tossed my head back while Amy looked at me with a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about this, Mel...\" she said, scratching her exposed middle as it peeked out from underneath her sweater, \"That doesn't sound\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, have you ever heard of beer boobies?\" I raised an eyebrow, \"Shut up, no you haven't. Carbonated drinks stretch your stomach, babe! Known fact. Science 'n shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mel, how many of those have you already had?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know man.\" I laughed, my belly wobbling between my legs, \"Just... just truss me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>love</i> potatoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Mel, I <i>really</i> love potatoes.\" Amy gushed, taking a big girl swing from her Coke, \"I've lived my <i>whole</i> life without knowing that baked potatoes were a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a life wasted, if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and I had found this little hole in the wall diner near campus. It was <i>the</i> greasiest spoon I'd ever set foot in outside of Patrick's back home. Big greasy cheeseburgers, something called a Super-Sized corn dog, and more condiments than I could shake a tail feather at. The <i>small</i> order of fries came served on wax paper and most \"normal\" folks might have called it an entree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr Amy. At least, not by that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm! And these fries! <i>So</i> good!\" Amy rolled her eyes into the back of her head dramatically. As she leaned forward to grab a fistful, her belly cut into the table. \"I can't <i>tell</i> you the last time I had fries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday.\" I burped, biting into my burger, \"You had fries yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but like... before all this.\" Amy corrected dismissively, literally shoving fries into her mouth, \"<i>Mmmm</i>! It's like I've died and gone to <i>heaven!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can <i>do</i> that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just stared at me in awe as I watched, proudly, as my confection was created. We got our sugar fix from this little coffee shop called Mugshots, and somehow she had never once seen me order my usual; a Chocolate Blueberry Cheescake Frappe with almond milk. It wasn't on the menu, but let's just say that me and the barista had an <i>understanding</i> about us...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure can.\" I nodded affirmatively, my chins flexing, \"They put a whole slice in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The world we live in.\" Amy said, pressing her nose against the glass of the bake case, \"I wonder what <i>else</i> they can blend into a frappe...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched in abject horror as Amy did the unthinkable. She had her fries in her chubby little hands, as she was want to do, and I just thought she was gonna eat 'em, you know? But instead... instead she... she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dipped</i> them into her milkshake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just... she just stuck 'em in there! Got milkshake all over them! At first I thought she was just playing with her food but then she... she ate it! She ate that fucking nasty-ass combination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now that's just gross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Amy chortle thickly\u2014her laugh had changed as she had gotten fatter, to this sort of husky chuckle. Her belly jiggled in apparent amusement at my disgust. She licked her fingers of the salt and dairy and smiled at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she burped, \"Everyone does it where I'm from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's that? <i>Hell</i>?\" I gasped, \"Seriously Ames, I've eaten some weird shit in my life, but that's fuckin' nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your prep school privilege is showing.\" Amy said with a smile, \"Go ahead, give it a shot. I think you'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh, no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon...umph...\" Amy struggled against the swell of her stomach as it folded onto the table in front of her, reaching out with her pillowy arms and dipping (EW!) another three french fries into her milkshake before scarfing them down, \"S'really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too far, Amy!\" I took a sip of my own milkshake (LIKE A NORMAL PERSON) and pulled it out of her rapidly dwindling reach, \"Too far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I mean, I guess I just having fun.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thing I hadn't realized about Amy was what \"evening out\" was going to mean. Her breasts were SO big that by the time she was \"proportional\" she was still going to look pretty fat, and she never wasn't going to have big tits (unless she lost weight or something, but what are the chances of that?). The result was that when it came to balancing her out I may have... overshot a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's ass was big. I mean, it wasn't just big. I'd seen big asses before at Buttercombe. Hell, I sat on one every day. But this one had appeared so suddenly, and so rapidly outweighed its upstairs counterparts, that it seemed impossibly huge, and always getting huger. It spilled out of the top of the new but already ill-fitting black leggings Amy was wearing, with her ass-shelf, big enough for a full presentation set of the encyclopedia of gluttony, giving it the appearance of a pair of rising bread loaves at a bakery for giants. As she shifted from one plump foot to the other, a ripple travelled through her meaty thighs and reverberated from hip to jiggling hip, testing the seams and elastic of the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what do you think?\" Apparently Amy had been saying something the whole time. I jerked my head up from her mesmerising butt. \"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel,\" she said, turning around, \"did you hear what I said?\" This didn't exactly help on the distraction front, because Amy's breasts, as ever packed into an inadequate tank top, were now all that fit in there, and they rested on her bare and utterly outlandish belly, which flopped over the poor pitiable waistband of the leggings in two big rolls, putting her bellybutton at least a foot further forwards than her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um \u2013 yeah,\" I said, dragging my eyes up to her face (guess we didn't solve that problem). \"I mean, no. Sorry. What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighed, which sent a ripple through her whole pear-shaped form, and turned around again to look at the corkboard. \"Come on, focus up! We're supposed to be finding a place for next year, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and I had decided to live off-campus for the next year, since our room at the dorm was getting a little crowded for two bodies of our sizes. I wasn't slacking off in the gaining department either \u2013 in fact, having a roomie who was so committed to stuffing her face was making me an even bigger glutton than usual and I'd entered a bit of horizontal growth spurt myself. It was getting to the point where we couldn't easily pass each other between the beds and the door. Part the college's fault for packing students in like sardines, sure, but the food we were packing into our guts couldn't be entirely absolved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was proving tricky to find somewhere that met our standards, though: no narrow doors or small shower cubicles; within easy waddling distance of food, and lots of it; and NO WALK-UPS. We were determined to find somewhere at ground level or at the very least with a high-capacity elevator, because we weren't just thinking of an apartment for us, but for the Mel and Amy of a year later, and everything indicated that those girls were WHALES. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing we'd looked at so far had been suitable, but some new ads had just been posted on the campus accommodation board. Amy leaned forward to point at one, belly brushing against enough faded flyers selling lightly used musical instruments to stock a secondhand orchestra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this?\" she said. I peered over her chubby shoulder at the flyer, which was indeed advertising a first-floor, two-bedroom apartment in the old warehouse district which was quickly becoming a popular hipster living destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I don't really know that part of town, might be kinda far... did you see this one?\" I pointed to another: TWO ROOMS AVAILABLE IN SHARED HOUSE, CAMPUS-ADJACENT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wrinkled her nose. \"I don't know, do you really want to share with new people? They could be total weirdos... plus 'house', that kinda says 'stairs' to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tough decision, so we decided to do the sensible thing, and eat on it, so we waddled down to Cake Street. A few Deluxe Cupcake Selection Platters and a couple of sheet cakes later, we sat back with a creak of chairs and decided to go look at...</span></div></div>",

As much as I was against living in a house with two complete strangers in it, the ride over <i>was</i> pretty long. Online classes may or may not have been in my future if we decided to rent a room\u2014there was <i>no</i> way that I was going to be motivated to get up every morning an extra thirty minutes early just to sputter into my classes like an overworked engine. But it seemed like a nice place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment was actually one of the old warehouses, converted into something of a hotbed for hipsters. Appropriately, it had been renamed something pretentious, but Amy and I had already taken to calling it the Warehouse. All evidence that it used to be anything other than a swanky apartment building in a less-than-swanky part of town had been swept away, and whatever hadn't had been converted into a sort of a modern art theme throughout the complex. I wasn't really much of an artist, but despite Amy's trepidation at even giving this place a fair shot, she was pretty impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool.\" she whistled, chubby hand tracing an immovable support beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I guess...\" I puffed, looking around anxiously for the agent. My feet were getting tired from all this standing around, \"If you're a hipster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the hippiest.\" Amy said unironically, not catching the joke she'd made at her own wide-bottomed expense, \"I was looking at some of the features of this place, y'know? Some pictures online.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" my gut gurgled\u2014<i>god</i> how long was it going to take for this woman to show up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it looks right up our alley.\" Amy turned to me, her bare belly swaying with the motion, bouncing slightly once she stopped, \"They used to have to move shipping crates and machinery and shit so a lot of the doorways are built pretty wide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a plus.\" I laughed, may hands resting on my now 500+ poundage, \"Already like it better here than I do the dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's a pretty sturdy elevator for the same reason.\" Amy whipped out her phone and pulled up the page on Lofts.com, \"There's only two elevators on either side of the building though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh. Why would we even need to go upstairs, Amy?\" I rolled my eyes, \"I thought we agreed on a first floor apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, <i>duh</i>\u2014boys?\" Amy chuckled at my silence, \"Maybe some girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, point taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about that time that our agent showed up\u2014I liked to imagine that she rolled her eyes and groaned silently at the thought of having to deal with two overfed underclassmen like ourselves. She must have been pretty sick of dealing with our generation! But for what it's worth, she was very professional in dealing with me and my porky protege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There <i>are</i> a lot of kids your age here.\" she said suddenly, causing the two of us to whip around to the elevator, \"I was actually just showing a nice couple an apartment on the third floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur agent was a shorter woman with a rather full figure. Not as full as mine or Amy's but she was a bit plump, probably about thirty I guessed? She had straight black hair and wore black heels to match the stitching on her gray business attire. On the bridge of her nose, she wore red cat-eye glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ms. Duvall.\" she extended a hand professionally towards myself and Amy, \"I'll be showing you around today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy.\" my puckish partner in crime said with an arm-wobbling handshake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel Carlyle.\" my whole <i>body</i> shook with our handshake, \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit, Ms. Duvall didn't seem put-off at all by our incredible weights. And trust me, as our fat bodies grew and grew, we were hard pressed to find someone who didn't at least look at us funny at first. Not that I minded, but I found it odd. I chalked it up to her just being a good agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shall we get started?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Amy and I were sufficiently loaded up with enough calories to think more clearly on the matter, we decided that the apartment was the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after Amy and I sat there, packing away cupcake platters for the better part of an hour or two, we were just full enough to be motivated to make the drive back to campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the biggest selling points of this place was that it was near Stuffington U, which meant that there wasn't going to be this long commute to and from school. There were these quaint little houses near the campus that, students and non, found pretty comfortable. I had a couple of classes with a girl named Denise who moved in her freshman year, and she said they were nice enough. That and the fact that all the places I and Amy had grown to love were still very accessible to us, and that was all the recommendation we needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ad had told a sad story about four friends coming to college, being besties, and then splitting up after only a semester together. The lease was for two years, so they needed someone to help even out the rent. It was a four room house, which was good because Amy and I definitely weren't down for sharing close quarters any time soon, and they were pretty generously built. They reminded me a little of the teacher cabins back at Buttercombe Academy that littered the hillside of the campus, albeit a bit bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is nice.\" Amy said, almost to herself, as we huffed and puffed our way up the sidewalk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' parking spaces... could be closer...\" I wheezed\u2014<i>damn</i> why was it so hot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wasn't any more active than I was, a side-effect of being put on the Mel Carlyle diet, I suppose. But she was still light enough to gain speed on me. I was given a constant view of her big round mounds of butt blubber bouncing their way out of her leggings, her fat legs quivering with the exertion it took to haul her hugeness around. She tugged at the waistband with sausagey fingers in a futile attempt to keep herself decent from the back but, as I was one to know, it was a futile effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it's... it's pretty, y'know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's doubly-chinned face was blotchy and red. Mine was too. No more of this walking shit if we were going to live here! It's cars or nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... have you talked to them?\" I gasped, \"Like, e-mailed them? Texted them? Something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they know we're coming over.\" Amy huffed, stopping to tug at her waistband again, \"They said that it's... oh, hey, here we go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur goal in sight, Amy and I moved faster than we had in months. Nothing like getting out of the sun and off of our fat little feet to get us going into high gear. Our bellies wobbling, hearts pounding, and our thighs rubbing against themselves, we made it to our destination. A-2; the second house on the first row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... what are their names again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to Donna on the phone.\" Amy drummed her belly thoughtfully, \"Aaaand I wanna say that she mentioned someone named Kate? That's probably our other roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other <i>potential</i> roommate.\" I corrected, \"You're the one who doesn't want to live with strangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just... I don't know, ring the doorbell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I did. I extended one sausagey finger into the soft white button on the side of the wall. Within moments, I knew everything I needed to know about our potential housemates...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We caught our collective breath as we waited for that horrible buzzing noise to come back at us, signalling our entrance.  Thankfully, it took a moment- I made a point to say \"We gotta get our own keys, they take too long to answer\" to Amy before the door flew open...  To reveal a stick of a woman!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that was a bit harsh.  Maybe it was because I was staring at Amy's monumental ass too long, but Donna looked... Like, ridiculously thin.  If I had to guess... A size... Two?  Look, I couldn't remember the last time I had seen a pant size that was below twenty, so that wasn't the most accurate reading- but point was, she was thin.  Even by my standards.  Donna was a fair skinned lady, with a bit of a potbelly- I couldn't really judge if it was considered small or not, but it defiantly protruded outwards from her frame, pressing against her shirt.  The rest of her was pretty average- she had blonde hair, clean skin, and was wearing a white t-shirt with black yoga pants- typical college garb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Donna!  Hi, welcome to...\"  She gave Amy and I a look over, paused, and continued as though she hadn't noticed the 800+ pounds of women standing in her doorway.  \"-Our home!  Come in, come in!  You must be Amy and Mel!\"  Her grin faltered a bit, but she kept her pitch going.  I had to admit, I was impressed.  Unlike Amy, she failed to mention either of our sizes within seconds of meeting her- I guess that was a plus.  We staggered our way into the house- both of us were a little bloated from food, and our movements were slow, but Donna kept the pace going all the same.  \"So, this is kind of the, I dunno, living room?\"  She gestured outwards- there were two loveseats and a handful of beanbag chairs.  \"I know beanbag chairs are lame, so... I dunno, don't use them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a giggle at that.  \"I think if either of us sat on those, they'd burst.\"  Donna looked alarmed for a second- clearly, she wasn't used to fat ladies joking about their weight.  Eager to close the deal, I attempted to ease the tension.  \"Don't worry, we'll stick to the loveseats.  Nice set-up!\"  Donna looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we check out the kitchen?\"  Amy requested, and Donna's eyes lit up.  I started to get excited- no one gets excited about kitchens anymore... Could this place really be what we were looking for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, the kitchen was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have gas- it's cheaper, after all, and while I don't cook a lot, Kate absolutely loves to- She <i>INSISTED</i> we find a place with gas stoves, so... Yeah.\"  The kitchen really <b>was</b> incredible- they had an island, a nice two-compartment sink, and a dishwasher!  I'd never have to scrub down a sticky bowl of mac &amp; cheese residue again!  Also...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say Kate likes cooking?\"  Amy blurted out, opening the fridge without asking.   She looked impressed, and when I glanced at her, I could see why- the refrigerator was absolutely <i>loaded </i>with food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't get me started!  Look at this gut-\"  Donna patted her tiny midsection for a minute before her eyes shot wide- her rounder belly was noticeable on her otherwise thin frame, but compared to us she was a stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we know we're fat.  You don't have to act so humble.  Where is Kate, anyways?\"  I asked, throwing Donna a rope.  Amy had, thankfully, stopped digging around in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, believe it or not, she ran off to get groceries... She said she needed some stuff.  Let's, uh, look at your rooms!\"  Donna said as she began to walk off- Amy and I dutifully followed.  \"We, uh, have the rooms upstairs already, so you two will be down here.\"  Donna walked down a narrow hallway- I couldn't help but notice that Amy was mere inches away from her hips brushing the walls on either side of her- my thighs dragged against them already, but I knew from the past that my weight mostly went to my gut, so I wasn't worried.  She threw open two doors near the end of the hallway.  \"If you're serious about moving in, you can figure out which rooms you want later.  The bathroom is at the end of this hall, and-\"  Donna stopped as a slam echoed down the hall.  \"-Annnnd Kate is home, apparently!\"  I began backing up, as Amy swiveled around and followed, leaving Donna to follow in our fleshy wake.  We surged back into the living room, where Donna rushed ahead, leading us towards. the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Donna, check it out, I got-\" A voice rang out from the kitchen, before we emerged.  \"Oh- Shit, is that today!  I completely forgot!\"  We waddled into the kitchen, and Kate...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh shit, is that today?\" a voice rang out from the kitchen, before we emerged, \"Sorry--<i>total</i> brain fart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe came thundering into the kitchen just in time to see Kate plop a load of groceries on the kitchen counter. Six or seven plastic bags clacked into place as she set them down, the brown material crinkling as their contents settled. Kate turned her head to see us and, much like her roommate had before, responded more or less relatively well to the fact that her kitchen had gained almost a half-ton of weight since she'd last been inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was a little shorter than I was, and, I mean... I <i>guess</i> she was skinny? I don't know. Where Donna was about a head or so taller than me and a little lanky, save for her little pot, Kate was shorter and looked a little meatier. And when I say that, don't get excited. She wasn't, like, anywhere close to my size, or Amy's size (not like those comparisons held up for most normal folks though.) She was a couple inches shorter than me, and was a bit bustier than her taller, blonder counterpart. She was cute; long brown hair tied up in one of those lazy buns, a little stud in her nose, jeggings. She carried all those bags pretty easily too. I don't know, she just looked a little dainty somehow. I honestly would have helped her if, you know, I were anyone other than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Kate.\" she said with a little wave after she settled the cans and baggies and so forth on the counter, \"Are you guys... Meeeel? I wanna say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand you're... Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always a mixed bag of emotions whenever I interacted with someone less than a third of my size and they didn't react in the way that I expected them to. On one hand, it's always really cool to see who's size-positive and who's not. I'll say this, if Kate had pitched a bitch about my weight, I might have actually sat on her. She reacted even <i>less</i> so than Donna had, so this girl either had a generous worldview on size and my rights as an unabashed fat girl, or she had the best poker face ever. On the other hand... it was always a little nice to get <i>some</i> kind of knee-jerk reaction to just how big I was. I mean, I appreciate it but... you know, I wouldn't have minded a wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome, the sooner I learn your names the better.\" Kate laughed at her own expense, \"I mean, assuming you guys wanna stick around. I know it's kind've a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should see our dorm.\" Amy snorted, scratching her tummy hang as it oozed over her waistband, \"We are <i>not</i> tidy housekeepers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not.\" I crinkled my nose, mentally picturing Mt. Pizza Box, \"I mean, we're not <i>slobs</i> or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh...\" Amy teetered her chubby little hand, \"60/40.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no, this place looks great.\" I concluded, \"I <i>really</i> like this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome! We're happy to have you.\" Kate said as she started over, \"Do you guys wanna look around a little? I'm sure Donna wouldn't mind giving you a tour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually just finished, thank you very much.\" Donna stuck her tongue out at her friend, reached into a grocery bag, and pulled out a package of Hawaiian King Rolls, \"You're not the only roommate who does stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, I had to say that I really liked what I saw. The house wasn't too big, but it wasn't so small that I felt like I was gonna pop out of the drywall (yet, anyway.) A fridge full of food and two skinny roommates who were much more willing to get up and hand me stuff than Amy was? Sounded like a dream come true to me! Sure the hallways were a little small, but... you know, that was more of a problem for Future Mel anyway. And maybe Present Amy, if she kept scarfing down Hawaiian rolls like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, uh... well, do you wanna go pick rooms while I get dinner started?\" Kate shrugged, \"I mean, I didn't plan on cooking for four tonight, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of <i>course</i> we'll stay!\" my greedy glutton protege said, scraping a poor defenseless chair out from underneath the table and plopping down on it with the great force of her mighty ass, \"I mean, it's only <i>polite</i>, right roomie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Amy, tone it down a little.\" I scolded her while she practically licked her chops, sopping it up with another Hawaiian roll from Donna's bag, \"Donna, you wanna show me the rooms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Donna blinked, probably not expecting such a mobile response or suggestion from me, \"Oh sure! I'll just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna placed the baggie of rolls down on the counter, just out of Amy's reach, and lead me down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I could see myself living here. Donna was nice enough and Kate could cook. Neither of them seemed into making me or Amy feel bad about ourselves or our weight. Things just seemed pretty chill there! I mean, it wouldn't be a <i>forever home</i> or anything, what with my rising weight, but it would do for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be any worse than those friggin' dorms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, we shuffled our way into one of the bedrooms.  It was nice!  Honestly, living in a dorm with Amy made me miss my old bedroom- a feeling I didn't think I'd ever, well, feel- but at least at Buttercombe they <i>pretended</i> to try and care if you felt like you were at home.  Stuffington?  Fahgeddaboutit.  Plain white walls, semi-strict decoration rules (I mean, we still hung shit up anyways, but they tended to frown about it), no real kitchen... No roommate that wanted to cook?  Okay, that wasn't really on Stuffington, but still!  It just felt... Lacking.  And this place didn't!  Also, Donna said how much we'd owe a month, and like, I assumed she meant <i>each</i> of us would owe it, but she meant <i>all together!</i>  I wasn't exactly rolling in dough- nor was Amy- but with that big of a difference in payments?  Hell, we could eat like Queens- not to say we didn't already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I hate to be <i>that girl,</i> but the internet in the dorms sucked, whereas Donna casually threw out the fact that they paid for the nice, local internet companies business- which meant we had blazing download speeds!  No more Netflix buffering every five seconds because some asshole down the hall decided to torrent all of <i>Game of Thrones</i> or whatever... I stood and talked to Donna for longer than I thought, because it had gotten kinda dark out- the bright blue sky had given way to a purplish-orange hue, and I noticed the breeze coming through the cracked windows was slightly cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Kate's almost done with dinner, why don't we head back out?  I'm really glad that you and Amy are okay with this place!  Honestly, we had quite a few people come through already, but they were all... Well, <b>creepy</b>.  I mean, they were mostly dudes, so that explains that part of it, but...\"  Donna waved her hand in the air.  \"Whatever, it's all in the past.  Seriously though, I think I speak for both myself and Kate when I say we'd love to have you here.\"  We began our slow return to the kitchen- Donna happily walking in front while I awkwardly shuffled down the hallway... Only for both of us to pause when a massive belch echoed through the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that was my half, not yours.\"  I sighed... If Amy blew this deal out of the water because she couldn't keep her gluttony in check for a few hours, I'd... Well, strangling her sounded like too much effort.  Maybe I'd just give her a charlie horse or something.  However, we emerged into a kitchen that held two very happy women- One slightly sweaty Kate, who seemed to be using all four burners on the stove and making an absolute mess of the counter, and a clearly already stuffed Amy, who was reclining back on her stool- I was thankful that the back seemed to be holding up, since if Amy took a tumble to the floor, I doubted she'd be able to get back up.  Her shirt and her leggings had parted ways due to her bloated gut, letting a sliver of pale, pudgy skin peek outwards, and she currently was holding a pint glass of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MEL!\"  She shouted, taking a long pull from her glass.  \"Not only is Kate an <i>amazing</i> cook, she's like- super good at combining beers!\"  I shot Donna a 'Oh God I'm so sorry' look, but she was already walking up to Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow- You already started?  Sheesh, leave me and poor Mel to knock out the nitty-gritty of the place while you and Amy have all the fun!  I see how it is...\"  Kate finished up stirring whatever she was working on and spun on her heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I didn't already pour you and Mel some?  Don't even trip, girl!  I just- I was happy to have such an eager student, is all!  You're always talking about 'not drinking so much beer', or whatever- Amy was all for it!  Weren't ya, Amy?\"  She shot Amy a thumbs up, which was happily returned.  \"I've got you covered too, Mel!\"  She pointed to a pint glass that I hadn't even noticed among the various groceries that were splayed all over the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had already come back towards me.  \"I told you Kate likes to cook, right?  I hope that won't be an issue...\"  She shot a glance at Amy, who was scarfing down some nachos that Kate had apparently made for her.  \"She seriously buys so much beer... She's trying to figure out the perfect pairing for every dish, apparently.  She's a culinary student here...\"  My eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me I'm not dreaming, Amy.\"  I held an arm out for her to pinch, but she was too busy chowing down.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Look, I'm not one to complain about a foodie roommate. For God's sake, I'd been living with Amy for two semesters now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll admit that it was a little <i>different</i> to have a roommate that wasn't quite into food the same <i>way</i> that I was. Kate was closer in line to \"chick who really likes the taste of food\" and \"culinary student looking to justify her degree\", rather than \"fat chick who knows food is the prime instigator of weight gain.\" I hadn't ever really given any thought to the folks that outright enjoyed mixing and matching other flavors and seeing how they paired in my five year sprint towards the big five-double-goose egg, but if they were anything like Kate, I had been missing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' <i>this</i> one's just a little lighter. A little wheatier, less barley, you know?\" Kate monologued as she poured a glass of heady yellow bear into my glass, \"Should go <i>great</i> with your burgers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me just say this--I, for one, <i>loved</i> Kate already. That moment, that then and that there. Unlike just about everyone else I had ever met with an obsession with food, she was all about <i>me</i> eating it and giving her feedback. I could knock back burgers, fries, chips and hot dogs of all kinds of various flavors and makes while chugging back drafts from dark to light. And Kate was always spot-on, recommending that I try that beer with this, this beer with that. Who knew that I had such a refined palette?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I'm getting that you like this kind, right?\" Kate had asked me, her face flush with inebriation, \"You like the wheaty stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" I burped deeply, \"I really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Donna burped from her seat next to me, slouched back in her chair as she surrendered to the calorie onslaught of Kate's cooking, \"It's really bubbly and the taste isn't, like... it isn't too strong, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't overpower the burger.\" I added constructively, \"Or the barbecue sauce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Kate laughed a little as she topped off her roommate, \"I've trained you so well, Donna~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all threw our heads back and chugged the beer in our glasses. I was already toasted, and that wasn't an easy feat with me. Amy, next to me, had long succumbed to her buzz. And whenever we were drunk, my porky pal and I tended to indulge just a bit more than usual. We'd been hawking back burgers and fries for the better part of an hour, but Amy had been choking them down with such a speed that even I was impressed. Inebriated, but impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think m'gonna <i>like</i> livin' here...\" Amy burbled poetically into her fistful of sour cream and onion chip before tossing them into her mouth, \"All the cookin' I can eat an' the drinkin' I can drink... Why didn't we move out, like... <i>forever</i> ago?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you were still skinny enough to fit into the dorms.\" I laughed, my jowls quivering and my belly shaking jovially as I reached across the table to give Amy's belly a good bounce, \"Porky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kate and Donna were upset at all by Amy and I openly groping and fondling each other's voluptuous figures, they didn't really show it. Either that, or they were too drunk to care. Donna, by this point, was much more interested in filling up her hollow leg with booze than watching Amy's belly jiggle, and Kate was too busy tapping herself off with a particularly heady, frothy dark draft that she seemed fond of. I could have called Amy all the kinky fatty names in the book and I'm pretty sure neither one of them would have bat an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming from you.\" Amy burbled drunkenly as she lifted up my shirt, allowing all of my cuddle-fluff to eek out into the world, \"You were... the reason that we all had to take the stairs. Remember? 'Cuz you jumped up and down in the elevator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave my belly a few playful pats, and we both watched as it wobbled and shimmied between my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prolly burned, like <i>a bajillion</i> calories 'cuza your Melly Belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop...\" I huffed, begrudgingly hot and bothered from all this tummy talk, \"Amy you're being weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to my surprise (and relief, considering!) Kate and Donna were way too preoccupied to notice our little dip out of heteronormativity there. In fact, I think Donna may have been <i>way</i> too drunk to be leaning back in her chair like that. But before Amy or I could cop another feel, the doorbell rang. Apparently, that was enough to rouse either one of them from their stupor, but not Amy and I squeezing each other by the guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I'll get it!\" Kate laughed stupidly, stumbling up to her feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you get it.\" Donna slurred, \"Gonna just get me summore <i>beer</i> here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Kate got up, leaving us without a make believe bartender <i>or</i> waitress for a solid minute or so. I had actually only just realized the ramifications of my empty glass and plate when I heard her coming back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, great timing!\" Kate said, trying to sound more sober than I knew (and I'm pretty sure everyone knew) her to be, \"Amy, Mel, I just wanted to introduce you to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi!\"  I said happily, wiping my hand briefly on my shirt as I tugged back down over my gut and extending it outwards, which Colleen took happily.  \"I'm Mel!\"  She nodded and smiled.  \"That's my other half, Amy.  The lighter half.\"  I pointed with my free hand towards my roomie, who still had her tubby tummy peeking outwards for all to see-  apparently she didn't feel like being polite.  \"She's uh... A little over her limit, y'know?  Try not to judge her too hard.\"  Colleen shot me a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't dream of it.  Hi Amy!\"  She waved, which caused Amy to snap out of her stupor.  \"I'm Colleen, in case you missed that part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy attempted to appear sober, which made Kate's act, by comparison, look impeccable.  \"I'm Amy-\"  She slurred, standing up, belching, and stumbling all in one smooth motion, which caused her entire form to quiver wildly as she grabbed the counter to stabilize herself.  \"Uh... Look, your buddy Kate gave me too much to drink, I'm basically without fall... Without fa- fffffffault here.\"  She struggled back onto her stool as Kate loaded her plate back up with food, which immediately dmanded her attention again.  \"Nice t' meet ya, though.\" She managed to get out before going back for fifthsies or seventh-sies or whatever number she was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo Colleen, tell me about yourself.\"  I offered, limiting myself to eating my fries one at a time instead of chowing down like my cohort.  I mean, I <i>could have</i> absolutely destroyed the plate in a matter of moments, but I felt like at least one of us should probably be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  She said, stealing Donna's chair, who had snuck off to the bathroom.  \"I'm an Kinesiology major.\"  My face went blank, because the word she said honestly sounded... Well, like anything but English.  I tried to save face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, uh... Kinetic motion?\"  Her expression didn't change.  \"Uh... Kins... Like... Families?  Look, I've honestly never heard that word before.  I'm sorry.\"  Colleen laughed- she had this quiet, dignified laugh, which was a sharp contrast from Amy's boisterous guffaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not even close.  I just use that word to sound fancy and make my parents think I'm not wasting my life.  It's an Exercise Science degree... Basically human health in relation to exercise.\"  I tried to look interested, but I guess I didn't do a great job because Colleen immediately placed a hand on my knee.  \"No need to look so worried, Mel!  Look, I'm no health nut... I mean, look at me!\"  I did.  She looked like a health nut.  She was the skinniest woman in the room by far, wearing leggings and one of those form-fitting workout t-shirts.  She wasn't like, ripped or anything, but she definitely took care of herself.  \"I just... It's always been interesting to me, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I wasn't one to feel self conscious- but I also had... Maybe five conversations with someone who was fitness-minded in my whole life.  And my Mother counted for 2 of them.  So I wasn't quite sure what to say.  So, I said the default answer when I didn't know what to say.  \"Oh, that's really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen shrugged.   \"It's a living, I guess.  Trust me, I won't be a dick about it...  I'll have to talk to you about it sometime!\"  She turned away from me as Kate slid a plate in front of her.  \"Oh, shit yes!  You showing off for Mel and Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate rolled her eyes.  \"Yeah, right.  They're basically putty in our hands already, right Mel?\"  She winked at me and I shot her a thumbs up.  \"I just actually have an audience who actually <i>appreciates</i> my food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rushed into the room, sliding slightly on the wooden floor in her socks.  \"Hey!  I appreciate your food!\"  She shouted.  \"Aw, Colleen took my chair!\"  Colleen shot her the finger as she started eating her fries.  \"Wow... So much for my favorite neighbor...\"  Donna grumbled, before Kate pointed her towards the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the rules- I cook, you clean.  And I <i>meant</i> to say that they're an audience who appreciates my food <i>and</i> can handle more than one serving.\"  Kate clarified, before plopping a brand new pint glass in front of Colleen, snagging my glass along with Amy's and refilling them from a brown glass jug.  \"I filled this growler up the road- It's just an IPA, I'm too exhausted from all this cooking to pair anymore.  Just drink it and pretend the hops accent the flavor or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to train in the morning, you know this!  I eat my fair share...\"  She poked me in the arm.  \"Mel, trust me, I eat my fair share, honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw my hands up.  \"I'm didn't say anything!\"  She shot me a thumbs up.  \"And I'll be more than happy to eat whatever is left over, as will Amy, if you hadn't noticed...\"  My roomie was already done with her plate, and was chugging her beer, oblivious to the conversation around her.  \"Amy!  You gotta cool it with the beer, we still have to head home!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So Amy and I really liked the apartment. Donna and Kate seemed cool, they had at least one fun neighbor, and it was a lot cheaper than taking out a small fortune to live in an increasingly \"snug\" dorm room for another year. Splitting the rent not just two ways but four was reason enough to move out, and combined with the fact that we'd have at least one roommate who knew her way around the kitchen meant I'd finally be able to save a bit. Even if Kate only cooked us one meal a day, that's still one less meal that I didn't have to pay for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent the rest of the week packing up our things. There was an entire day dedicated to figuring out which clothes were still good and which ones we'd outgrown. It was like one giant fat girl fashion montage\u2014First Amy, then I would waddle out of our bedrooms into the living room, our bellies hanging out or our ass muffin-topping out from various waistbands. There was pizza, lots of soda, some beer... it was nice! We rolled up our posters, boxed up our furnishings, and got Milo to help us with the move. Donating/throwing out our outsized clothes made a <i>lot</i> of room, which meant less work for us in the long run, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, you'd think it would have anyway..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Gaaawd...</i>\" Amy whined as she threw one pale pillar of leg in front of the other, \"Moving's so hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost surreal to think that just a year ago, Amy was one of the thinnest girls I'd met since graduating from Buttercombe. The only challenge she would ever shy away from when I had first met her was a flight of stairs (because seriously, fuck stairs, right?). But after just two semesters of me and our little quest of evening her out (and getting her hooked on carbs!), Amy was almost a completely different person; one who indulged with increasing frequency and regularity, who got winded going up escalators, and moved only when necessary. I'd turned Amy into a regular porker just by merit of being there, and it wasn't always noticeable until we started doing something physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething physical like moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had pulled up in Milo's truck, Amy filling up the passenger side while I was poured into the back, and we were both already sweating. It was a hot day out, and we were both already well insulated. Amy, with her giant tits and fat ass, wasn't any better equipped for lugging heavy boxes than I was (with my giant-<i>er</i> tits and even fatter ass) and it showed. She was red-faced before she even picked up her first box; she bent over, giving everyone a good idea of just how <i>wide</i> her butt was, and heaved up a box marked MEL's JUNK that couldn't have been much heavier than a couple of choice items from my room. You'd have thought I'd had her move one of those old fat-back TV's by herself, with the way she huffed and puffed. Her chubby cheeks blew outwards as an unsteady stream of air escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want this one?\" she huffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just take it to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI repeat, Donna and Kate were pretty much the best ever. We were moving into a two-story house, and none of us were the kind of moderately wealthy college girl where we could get an elevator installed. Their old roommates, Kelsey and Haley, lived upstairs before they moved out. Forseeing that Amy and I might have some problems with this arrangement, Donna and Kate were taking this opportunity to move into the second floor so that the more easily accessible rooms would be available for the two of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo good news: I wouldn't have to climb any stairs ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad news: that meant Donna and Kate were busy with their own moving, and that Amy and I were kinda on our own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fffffiiiiiinnneeee.\" Amy blustered before she teetered herself towards the door, her gigantic cheeks swaying from side to side as she waddled towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a look in the bed of Milo's truck, wiping the accrued sweat from my forehead with one doughy arm. There were about fifteen boxes, minus the one that Amy was waddling into the house. I knew for a fact that a couple of them were what remained of our fashion expose, and therefore wouldn't be quite so heavy. But even still, I wasn't exactly in the best shape of my life. Amy, who was about two hundred pounds lighter than me, was having trouble. What chance did I have in the Summer sun, throwing boxes around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, neighbor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if she had been sent from above, who else but Colleen came bounding down the sidewalk\u2014our new Exercise Science Major neighbor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colleen!\" I threw my hands up in the air, taking two jiggling steps towards my new favorite person, \"Collie, Col, Colleenikins... would you mind, uh... giving us a hand here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that Colleen had partly expected the invitation. Something about the way she cut her eyes at the truck, then at me with my lowest belly roll hanging out of my leggings, then back to the truck, then back to me as I sweat profusely in the hot sun. She just sort've smiled and her pace slowed down until she was standing mere inches away from my belly. She wasn't as sweaty as I was, and she'd been jogging. Even I thought that was kinda pathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" Colleen said with a little laugh as she unplugged her earbuds and tapped on her phone, \"I was about to head in anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me just say, watching Colleen manhandle those boxes made me realize how lucky I was. Just standing out here on the lawn was making me tired. <i>Watching</i> Colleen was almost exhausting. As she wriggled one of the boxes from the pile we'd thrown into the bed and carried it like a pro, I knew she was a godsend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want me to put this?\" Colleen asked, no worse for wear, as she jostled a box labelled AMY'S SHIT...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh fuck, I knew what that was. That box had those big ass scrubs in there that I'd been bugging Amy about. That girl's butt was almost as big around as mine was, and they had that long drawstring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, put it in my room.\" I said, turning her around, \"Yeah, the one on the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen was in and out in half the time it took Amy. They actually came back out onto the lawn about the same time\u2014Amy squeezing her wide hips through the doorway with Colleen flitting easily behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got another box?\" Colleen asked me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked behind me. There was no way I was going to be able to get in there. I weighed five hundred pounds. I'd break the damn thing. Jumping up like Colleen did was an impossibility for me, and even if it wasn't, I had a sinking feeling that the sudden shift in weight would wreck the suspension even on Milo's burly compensation-mobile. So I lowered the lid, waddled to the side, and walked a box over to the edge of the bed, and hefted it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" I puffed, tossing it to Amy, \"I'll, uh... I'll just get the boxes from the truck. You guys can carry them in. Sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unf\u2014no.\" Amy winced as her flabby arms quivered in exertion, \"How come you get to be the box elf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, because I called it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is dumb. I'm gonna go take a break.\" she puffed, tottering back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left just me and Colleen outside. I'll admit, I wasn't really comfortable around her. I mean, she was nice and seemed pretty chill. But I hadn't had the best experience with Exercise Science-adjacent folks, especially since my days as a little porker in Buttercombe. My Mom had always been a real bitch about my weight, and that alone made me just a little uncomfortable just being around someone who felt like she could break out into fat-shaming me at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCall it irrational, but I'd been bitched at enough for one lifetime. I liked Colleen, but I still couldn't wrap my head around the idea that she <i>wasn't</i> gonna do that every other breath she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo... box elf?\" I offered weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still gonna help me, right?\" Colleen raised a knowing eyebrow, \"I mean, that's a lot of boxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lower lip in anticipation. Of getting health-freaked out on, of scaring her off and having to do all this myself, of literally collapsing from exertion. I was a big girl! A <i>really</i> big girl. I wasn't built for this kind of manual labor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Mel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, for the second time that day, the Gods of Displacing Labor answered my prayers. Headed out the door was Milo, my hunky ex-neighbor from across the hall back at the dorms. He was in a fraternity, had the still-chiseled body of a student athlete, and wasn't all that bad to have around. A little dumb, but pretty. Good for some conversations, a couple drinks, and (most importantly) when you needed something moved, he was there to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just finished helping your friends upstairs\u2014you guys need any help down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" I said quickly, whipping around and grabbing a box, thrusting it into his arms, \"Take this to my room, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, dude.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilo reached past me, grabbed another box and plopped it on top of the one I gave him (He grabbed one of Amy's by mistake, but in his defense, the label was on the other side) and hauled them both inside. As he walked away, I could see Colleen practically drooling over him. Or... wait, maybe literally drooling a little there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do literally anything you need me to with those boxes.\" Colleen said breathily, fanning herself for effect, \"If you hook a bitch up with that big piece of man cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, you've got yourself a deal\" I puffed in appreciation, waddling towards the door, \"My boxes go to the left, Amy's to the right. Have fun with your... uh... man cake.\"</span></div></div>",

Lots of bending over, lots of standing, waddling around my room. While I was happy that I wasn't crammed into one of those teeny-tiny sardine cans that they called dorm rooms back at Stuffington, that was a double edged sword. There was a lot of room for me to wobble around in, but I could no longer decorate everything by sitting down on my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping me, Donna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, I recruited Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no sweat.\" the taller blonde said, putting her shoulder-length hair up in a messy bun, \"I figured you'd need some help. And this used to be <i>my</i> room anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said earlier, Donna and Kate had been really cool about moving letting me and Amy move in. They both roomed on the ground floor of the house and, rather than let Amy and I exasperate ourselves every time we wanted to go to our rooms by climbing up a whole flight of stairs (<i>like animals!</i>) we swapped. Amy got Kate's old room and I got Donna's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me tell you, this girl was a godsend. I mean, I wasn't exactly doing nothing, but in the time that it took for me to decide where I wanted something, Donna had already unpacked an entire box. We threw everything onto my bed as an incentive for me getting this done in as timely a manner as possible. She'd hold something up, I'd say \"over there\" or \"no, put it over here\". She helped me hang up clothes, arrange my knick-knacks, the works. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod bless my new roommate. God bless her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Donna said out loud as she held up a pair of my favorite scrubs (the ones that I had stolen from Amy!), \"These things're\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held them out the length of her arms, stretching them to their fullest width. They were pretty big! Just big enough to cover my fat ass. Amy still had a lot of room on that draw-string when she wore them, but I had no doubt at the rate she was going that she'd grow to fit them in no time. I, on the other hand, was much harder to dress, and therefore deserve all the clothes that I could find. I'd tried them on before. My belly hung so deliciously over the waistband, and I filled those scrubs <i>out</i>. My big beautiful booty was <i>just</i> big enough so you could see the fold beneath my cheeks, but still look loose and comfy. Plus, I could always untuck my tummy if I needed more room. I could make those things last a <i>while</i>. That must have been one big nurse who donated those...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Donna said sheepishly as she withdrew her wingspan, the scrubs folding with her arms, \"I, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah it's cool.\" I snorted, \"No offense taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have thought that I'd have told her it was okay to make cancer jokes. As cool as my new social circle was, I knew it would take some time for them to get used to being around a girl as big as I was with just as thick of skin. Personally, I loved making folks feel not-so-but-kinda uncomfortable with the way I embraced my weight. Sometimes literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you wanna hand me those?\" I held out an arm. Donna tossed them my way and I caught them, folded them up, and opened one of what used to be Donna's drawers, \"I can't tell you how long it's been since I've had a friggin' drawer that could hold all my clothes\u2014now I won't have to hold the Hunger Games every time I get a new pair of leggings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God those dorms must've really sucked.\" Donna made a face, \"How little were they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So little.\" I rolled my eyes and stuffed <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Amy's</span> my scrubs in the drawer, \"Like, not just for me and Amy. You'd probably feel pretty cramped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> pretty tall.\" Donna snorted, rummaging through another one of my boxes, \"You like the doorways 'cuz they're wide, I like 'em because I don't have to hear \"oh hey Donna, keep growin' an you're gonna have to duck to get in here, huhuhuh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... get something similar.\" I laughed, my big belly rippling, \"Hey, any other lazy clothes in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just...\" Donna rummaged a little more, \"These. And these. And these and... wow, you have a lot of leggings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're a fat girl's best friend.\" I grabbed a three pairs of leggings and two once-flowy t-shirts and started folding them, shifting my weight on my poor fat feet, \"You'd think food is, but no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna giggled at that. I liked Donna. As cool as Kate was, Donna seemed really chill. Kate was kind've all over the place, darting around the kitchen and serving up food. I hadn't really had time to actually sit down with Kate, you know? But that's because I didn't think Kate ever sat down. Don't get me wrong, even then I appreciated the hell out of her dedication to playing chef and waitress. Donna was just cooler to me, I guess. Maybe because she was tall? I don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was organizing all my lazy clothes into one drawer (or doing my best to--it's hard organizing all your flop clothes into one drawer when you flop as much as I do!) I came across something that Donna had missed. When she was clearing out her drawers, she left a picture laying face down against the bottom. I saw it because, you know, it was white and I was looking, and I took it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you missed something.\" I said, looking at the photograph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognized Donna, despite the sunglasses and the distinctive lack of her pot-belly, and I recognized Kate, pre-stud and with black hair instead of brown. I <i>didn't</i> recognize the other two girls in the photo though. One blonde, one brunette, on either side of Donna with Kate in the middle, down in front. The blonde on the right was about my height, I guess. Her hair was long and up, and she had this friendly, round face. On the left was the brunette, who looked somehow more manufactured than everyone else. Lots of makeup, immaculate hair even though it was clearly windy that day. Something of a tan, probably natural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Donna put her hand over her chest dramatically, \"How could I have missed this? Oh this is my favorite picture of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us?\" I asked, taking this opportunity to get off my poor aching feet and sit down next to my roommate on (what was free of) the bed, \"You and your other roommates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, these are the girls we told you guys about.\" Donna said, pointing to the other blonde in the photo, \"On the right there, that's Nicole. And the girl on the left is Brooke. Uuuugh we were like <i>best friends</i> here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" I puffed, trying to catch my breath, \"So you, like... you never told me why they decided to move out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that.\" Donna made a face, \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

Honestly, I would've preferred that all my clothes burst off my bodacious bod than have made that faux-pas, but Donna let out a small giggle, which broke the tension, even when it rolled up into a gut-buster of a laugh that caused her to double over, her \"belly\" pooching over itself in a cute way that reminded me of Amy's earlier days on the chub-train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I haven't thought about that day in a while, honestly.  Since you and Amy decided to become our new bunker buddies I haven't even thought about them at all!  Gawd... I mean... That was a ridiculous night.\"  She wiped away a tear from laughing so hard- although to me, it didn't seem that she was all that giddy.  In fact, her tone had sobered up quite a bit since the laugh attack.  \"It still seems stupid, honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made a big show of folding up my clothes so Donna could wipe away the extra tears that had begun rolling down her face.  A few sniffles later, she started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lived here since day one- pretty cool, right?  A bunch of cool chicks living in a house together on campus.  But... Well, you've obviously met Kate.  And- if it isn't obvious from that photo- Kate, myself and Nicole, we never really were super serious about our looks, I guess.  But Brooke?  She was- well, she was the kind of girl who learned how to eat BBQ ribs without getting any on her face or fingers.  You know, that kind of girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes- she sounded like my Mother.  \"Yes, I know the type all too well, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna continued.  \"Yeah.  So we'd all fool around, like, 'Oh, Kate, you keep cooking like this, we'll all be 300 pounds!', y'know, stuff like that... Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna, dear?\"  I gently slapped her cheek.  \"Amy and I, believe it or not, don't mind being fat.  You don't have to act like you're being insensitive when you mention weight-related societal views.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blushed, but continued.  \"...Anyways, we all joked about it but Brooke.  She'd get- Well, bitchy about it.  'It's not a joke, you guys.' She'd say- and on any night where Kate went a little nuts with dinner, Brooke would end up going to the gym the next day for like, way too long- she'd come home dripping in sweat and could barely move the next few days.  But we all chalked it up to Brooke, well, being Brooke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.  Again, I knew people like that- too afraid of gaining a pound to enjoy even one meal.  I could respect someone who exhibited self restraint- I couldn't respect someone that hellbent on keeping a figure as to not enjoy any food... Ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways... It was all for naught, because one day Kate made like, the best brisket ever- seriously, I'm gonna ask her to make it again soon, so you know I'm not lying- and like, we all were drinking wine, chatting, and eating too much, and all of a sudden Brooke goes bright red, and goes silent in the middle of a sentence.  And we're all confused, and she stands up, and her size, I dunno, negative two jeans that she insisted on cramming herself into had popped open, and the button had come off.  And... Well, Kate, being Kate, and also kinda drunk, is like 'I call that a successful meal!'  And Brooke FLIPS OUT.  Seriously, she was screaming about how Kate was 'purposefully trying to ruin her image' and stuff like that, and Kate started crying and started shouting about how she wanted to be a chef, and that Brooke was being crazy- because she was- and it was this big thing, and the next day Brooke had packed up all her shit and said she was leaving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  Uh... Sorry to have brought up painful memories.  If it's any consolation, Amy and I probably won't leave if we gain any more weight... Y'know.\"  I grabbed my gut.  \"It's not like we would really notice anyways if we gained a pound or two.\"  That got a small smile out of Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you'll gain weight.  Again, look at me.  I try to stay in shape Mel, I really do.  <i>Anyways</i>, Brooke was super dramatic about, piled all her bags in the hall and was crying and had mascara running down her face and Nicole was hugging her and crying... Ugh.  It was a mess.  So Brooke told me and Nicole that if we didn't want to end up flabby balls of lard, we should leave with her, and I <i>may</i> have lost my temper and called her a conniving bitch and I <i>think</i> that kinda freaked Nicole out and made her side with her.  So they broke lease, paid up the 400$ a piece for doing so, and moved out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to feel a little guilty about the whole thing, honestly.  Sounded like we were moving in with two emotionally vulnerable roomies who just lost two of their closest friends.  \"I don't know what to say...\"  Donna sadly shook her head, folded up the photo, and tucked it inside her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, don't worry about it.  Honestly, Brooke has done this before.  I mean, they're not moving back in anytime soon, obviously, but I'm sure I'll hear from them sooner or later.  Don't tell Kate, but Nicole actually texted me a few times to apologize.  She's always been the more... Sensitive one.  Of course...\"</span></div></div>",

The four of us, we were all great friends in high school. I guess because we didn't have to live together. But living under the same roof, all the time... things can start rubbing people the wrong way, y'know?

Make <i>lots</i> of fat jokes. Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel... you're a wreck.\" Donna snorted, \"C'mon, let's finish up. Kate should have somethin' cooked up pretty soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Pizza?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so weird for me to be standing in a dining room that could be qualified as something more than just \"designated corner of dorm where you stuff your face more than normal.\" Like, sure it was part of the kitchen, but it wasn't just a little fold-out table and some bent plastic chairs. It was homey and there was a big picture of some generic fruit in a bowl. The table was scooted out <i>just</i> enough so as to allow us more generously proportioned roommates some wiggle room between the chairs and the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the little table, stacked up high, was a sight that I was quite accustomed with. <i>Boxes</i> of Little Caesars', one on top of the other, with two liters and paper plates. Well, Amy and I tended to forgo the plates, but still. Point made; I was already feeling at home. And hungry. So yeah, pretty at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I have spent <i>all day</i> helping everyone swap rooms.\" Kate said, more than a little sensitive at the lack of culinary flare of our first \"real\" meal in our new home, \"I cook for you like, every night, Donna. You can suck it up and eat pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not complaining.\" Amy purred as she lowered her enormous ass into two poor, unsuspecting chairs, \"Mel and I used to eat out all the time. Right, Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" I added confidently as I joined my ravenous, redheaded roommate as she popped the top on some cheesy, greasy pepperoni, \"Suck it up Donna, eat some pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or <i>I</i> will!\" Amy added giddly as a stretch of string roped between her mouth and her first slice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, I'll be the first to admit it, moving made me hungry. Like, in general, but this too. I had burned so many calories that it was stupid for me <i>not</i> to be eating something, even if I hadn't weighed a quarter ton by myself. I grabbed a box for myself and went to town. My great gut gurgled in appreciation of <i>finally</i> getting a good old fashioned takeout meal. We had been coming over and eating with Kate and Donna so often, I hadn't had an honest-to-god pizza dinner in... forever! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you know, when Kate pulled up a 12-pack and cracked open a cold one, sat down, and got herself some pizza, there wasn't much more for Donna to do but to sit down beside her. We must have been quite a sight, the four of us. Two huge heifers, eating with two girls half their size (at least, horizontally in Donna's case\u2014Twofold in Kate's!) straight out of the box. I was a wreck. I was so hungry, I didn't even care that this was my first \"official\" meal with my new roommates. I was rolling up slices into little burritos, making pizza sandwiches, and Amy was right there beside me! We were two fat chicks and we'd worked our proverbial asses off moving out of those dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were entitled to a little reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd our reward was pizza! And getting drunk for, like, the second night in a row. I mean, <i>buzzed</i> I guess is a more accurate term It's not easy for a girl my size to get more than a little toasted. Kate and Donna on the other hand, I mean... let's just say they were fun. Loud, but fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd meanwhile Amy and I just ate, ate, ate our way through Little Caesar's Mountain. Stuffing slice after slice into our growing, growling gullets. We turned on some music, did some awkward dancing (Kate and Donna had a <i>lovely</i> routine to Sugarhill Gang Apache worked out) and we just sorta... had fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long time since I'd partied. And I don't know if you'd call that <i>partying</i> but... it was nice! We had a great time. Kate and Donna got drunk, Amy and I got fed, and we all woke up and cleaned up the house like good roommates should... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we did, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is, and you probably saw this coming, the fun couldn't last.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So everything was peachy in our new digs.  Classes didn't start for a little while (thankfully) so we just sort of felt out each other's vibes and started all meshing together in a happy roommate mashup that would've made the cast of <i>Friends</i> jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was hilarious.  I mean, she had this perfect comedic timing that would send me into hysterics, and more than once I had laughed so hard that I had fallen off the loveseat.  On top of that, she had really good taste in shows and movies- she'd pull out some film that was subtitled, which prompted a \"I don't watch movies to <i>read!</i>\" from Amy, but five minutes in and we were absolutely <b>hooked.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, Kate- who's culinary prowess was already well known- was a serious bro.  Well, bro-ette, I guess.  In fact... She had actually (gasp) convinced me to <i>help her cook!</i>  As in, <i>I actually did something that could be considered minimal physical labor.</i>  I know!  I chopped some stuff with a real knife and everything, it was bonkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course... While I was ever so slowly increasing the scope of \"things I might do in my free time besides stuff my fat face\" -even though one of them was conducive to that exact thing- Amy was... Well, not doing that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was, Kate &amp; Donna's house- well, I guess <b>our</b> house- was definitely a college house.  Which meant we had a cabinet devoted to nothing but bottles of booze that cost less than 15$ a piece, and a constant flow of beer- Kate apparently was buddies with some dude from the liquor store who occasionally \"forgot\" a box of beer out back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while I was staying juuuuust busy enough to not gain like, a dozen pounds a week from the calorific onslaught that was Kate's cooking and non-stop beer, Amy was becoming a bit of a recluse.  I mean, she wasn't like, locking herself in her room all day or anything- she was more than happy to eat with us at any rate.  However, outside of that, the only time we saw her was when she waddled out to go to the bathroom, or steal a few bottles of beer from the kitchen, or snag her fifteenth plate of leftovers for the day.  And it was starting to show... And Kate was the first to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Amy okay?\"  She asked one day, after Amy had stumbled off to bed for the day, hiccuping all the way down the hall after devouring about three pounds of hamburger casserole and half a dozen beers.  \"I mean... Is she always quite so... reclusive?  She didn't really act that way when you guys first moved in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about that for a second.  I was used to Amy acting this way, honestly- but that was when we lived in a dorm together.  We actually had people to hang out with now, and while I was embracing it, it seemed Amy had just reverted back to her old, sloth-like ways.  \"I mean... Yeah?  When we lived in a tiny dorm together, she didn't really have anywhere to go.  I guess she just likes having her own room?\"  We all winced as a massive belch echoed throughout the house.  \"She's a bit of a loner, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded.  \"Nothing wrong with that!  I just was worried we offended her or something.  She'd tell you if that happened, right?\"  I, too, nodded, feeling my chins fold into themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  No, that's just how she is.  Is it a problem?  I mean, she's not like, freaking you guys out or anything, right?\"  Kate rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!  Honestly, as long as it stays drama-free around here, I could care less!  Oh, and I guess as long as the trash doesn't pile up.  Speaking of, who's gonna help me clean up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly guilty, I actually managed to shift my bulk off my stool and grabbed my plate.  Donna immediately clapped a hand dramatically over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it ain't so!  Are the stars in alignment?  Is Jupiter in retrograde or whatever?  Did radioactive dishsoap leak into Mel's room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lobbed a lofty punch at her arm.  \"Shove it, Donna.  Fat people can actually <i>do things</i> besides eat- I know your boney ass wouldn't understand, but...\"  That earned me a retaliatory punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know my ass is far from bony- speaking of, Kate, do you wanna go shopping this weekend?  I... Uh... Need new clothes for the semester.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed my plate in the sink and threw my hands in the air, milking the situation.  \"Oh, Donna, I forgot, fat girls and skinny girls can't go shopping together!  Oh, my stars and garters, what would society think if a beluga like me was seen with a stick like yourself?  The stocks in JC Penny would plummet!\"  She glared at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you can come too!\" Donna snapped jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI faltered. \"I... I buy my clothes online, thank you very much.\"  I grumbled, throwing my hands up in defeat- Kate had clearly called my bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even as I started putting away dishes, I couldn't help but feel a little twinge of guilt.  Honestly, I was a little worried about Amy too.  I mean, don't get me wrong- she learned laziness from the best of the best.   However, even at my laziest point, I wasn't so much of a recluse as to completely shun human interaction in any form- and Amy is/was one of the most social people I knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if I was being completely honest with myself, Amy was looking a little rough lately.  As Amy ballooned over the past year, I taught her the importance of keeping up appearances- Y'know, buying new clothes (stretchiest size that still stays on your body, loose fitting shirts, stuff like that) and not just bulging out of pants that should've been replaced two months ago.  Amy... Wasn't really doing that anymore.  Her outfit tonight was a pair of elastic booty shorts that had evolved into a borderline-thong and a shirt that several inches of her gut, splashed with stretchmarks, hung out of, wobbling wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, Donna and Kate were cool, but at this rate, Amy would be waddling around naked.  I think that was involved in our lease somewhere:  <i>If tenants get too fat for their own clothes and walk around naked, they have ten(10) days to leave the building, without their security deposit.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, I decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That being said, I decided to just let her be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was a big girl (a rather big girl at that!) and she could make her own decisions. I wasn't going to tell anyone how to live her life, even if I was a little worried about her. Sure she'd sequester herself in her room for literally a majority of the day, but it wasn't like she was bothering anybody. Maybe it was just the shift from dorm life to apartment life? I wouldn't know. I'd like to think that I was just as social now as I was before, but hey, people react differently to things. And that's okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore extra-special roommate bonding time for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, we still had a few weeks before we all had to go back to school. No one was exactly happy about it but, hey, it had to be done. So I decided that I was gonna go out and do at least one fun thing every couple of days until classes started up again. As you can probably guess, Amy wasn't exactly down for a lot of it\u2014she was much more interested in completing her transition into full-on Hermit mode\u2014but everyone else was pretty cool with the idea. Sometimes I'd go with Donna, sometimes Kate, one time I got lucky and Colleen showed up. That was fun. But I guess the point is this: I hate college, I really liked having roommates that were <i>into</i> stuff, and as it turned out even I could get bored of Netflix and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I wasn't exactly <i>not</i> snacking. But it was fun to get out and do things sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Donna and Kate were real lightweights and it was fun to make them skinny-girl nervous when I ordered half the menu at any given restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of course I was still going out and getting myself kicked out of this place and that. Just because I didn't have my saddlebagged sidekick to totter behind me didn't mean that I suddenly developed self control or anything. Gosh. As it turned out, I couldn't have asked for better, less judgmental roommates. It took me a good two weeks of going out with them to realize that none of my new friends really <i>cared</i> about how much I could eat, negatively or positively. They were content to let me eat my fill and talk or tap on their phones or whatever. Kate would chat me up about what I was eating, what it was made of or where it came from. Donna would tell me jokes or fun stories about her and her old roommates, and I had a great report with Colleen where I'd tease her about fat-shaming me. As long as I paid my own tabs and my quarter of the rent, I was good to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you don't care about that. Or maybe you do, you weirdo. I was doing stuff, you get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually on one of these post-move-in, pre-sophomore excursions that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I was attempting to educate Kate on take-out pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, Little Caesars?  It's pizza.  And they have one job, and it's to feed college kids for cheap.  Seriously, that's like... Their entire niche.  Look it up, or don't, I don't care.  But the thing was, after living with Kate for a short while, it was obvious that she viewed all pizza chains as being the exact same, so- in her own words- \"Why would I pay an extra few bucks for a pizza that's exactly the same?\"  And I'll tell you something:  I almost cried.  Seriously, I was sniffling, needed to excuse myself for a tissue, it was horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't get me wrong- this girl made a pizza and I just about died.  Well, three pizzas- one for each rack of the oven.  And they were perfection!  She made her own damn garlic butter for the crust!  From scratch!  I didn't even know you could do that, I always assumed garlic butter was just pure chemical magic made in a factory somewhere.  In hindsight, adding minced garlic to butter in a pan and then mixing in some parmesan made perfect sense and seemed pretty easy, but whatever.  Not the point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we were walking along in the local mall.  The kid hadn't even had an Orange Julius!  So we each got one, which sent Kate off on a tangent about how she could make a better one, which I welcomed her to try, as long as I got most of it, and then we went into a candy story, and she had never heard of chocolate covered potato chips, and then she started talking about how SHE could make chocolate covered ANYTHING, and then I started telling her-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, we spent almost forty minutes in a candy store.  That's all really needs to be said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, after getting past the point of no return on sweet treats, I decided I needed something a little salty to balance out the day, so I suggested we go to Sbarro- partially so I could hopefully prove that all pizza was <i>not</i> created equal, and sometimes you need to spend a little more on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we're sitting, because this Sbarro honest to goodness had <i>tables</i>, which was crazy in its own right, and also lent me several minutes to wonder if more of my ass was hanging off a chair, and in fact I was just about to scoot another one of their chairs over (look, they were small, okay?) and try to counter-balance my rear when Kate went white as a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.  Mel?  Do me a solid?\"  I was busy drumming on the table with some of the straws I had plucked out of the dispenser- look, sugar and me have a weird relationship, okay?  But I stopped when I saw how serious she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all ears, Katiekins.\"  She winced.  Bad nickname.  \"Er... Kate...Plus Eight?  Hey, remember that show? I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!  Seriously!\"  She was dropped low to the table, her brown hair trailing perilously close to the small puddle of Pepsi I had spilled earlier.  \"Look, uh, things might get a little weird, because-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Kate was going on about, I would never hear, because at that moment the loudest set of heels I've ever heard in my entire fucking life clacked up behind us.  Seriously, it sounded like someone glued tap dancing taps to the bottom of these fucking things, and they echoed loudly on Sbarro's weird linoleum/marble hybrid floor.  \"Kate?!\"  a high-pitch voice rang out, and Kate immediately sat up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygo-Nicole?\"  Kate stood up, shot me a weird look that I couldn't quite parse, and ran off.  However, at that moment, our garlic breadsticks showed up, and I kinda zoned out for a minute as the two girls talked.  However, after I had shoveled down half the order, I wiped down my face with a napkin and turned to see who I assumed was Nicole.  She was... Well, she looked exactly like her picture, other than a set of cute little glasses that rested on her face.  She seemed uncomfortable, and I soon realized why.  Standing next to her was Brooke- the girl who presumably broke up the party of four into two parties of... Well, two.  She looked even faker than before- her hair, still brown, had these weird streaks of blonde highlights, and was done up in a way that seemed <i>way</i> too fancy for a simple trip to a mid-sized mall that mostly consisted of fast food joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Kate were, thankfully, deep in conversation, ignoring Brooke who was busily tapping away at her phone- and I mean literally tapping, because this girl had nails that looked like talons.  They were long and painted this horribly gaudy shade of red that managed to hurt my eyes a little bit- of course, they matched her long-ass heels, which added at least three inches to her height.  I decided to be polite- at least to one of them, anyways, and waddled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm Mel.\"  I announced when they stopped chatting as my bigger form approached them.  I held a hand out, which Nicole took gently, shaking it happily a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Nicole!  Kate and I are best-  Er... Well... I used to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's my old roommate.\"  Kate said, shooting a glance at Brooke, who was  (thankfully) still ignoring everyone.  \"And one of my friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole lit up- I don't think she was expecting to be called a friend.  Of course, I had a part to play, and I dutifully played it, not wanting to betray Donna's confession to me about her ex-roomies.  \"Well, it's nice to meet you!  Yeah, I just moved in with them, it's... It's pretty great!  I can't believe how great of a cook Kate is!\"  Kate turned a nice shade of red, so I decided to continue.  \"No, seriously.  Like, me and my roommate lived on campus-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst!\"  Nicole giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-That's right, the worst!  So I hadn't cooked, in like... Forever, and, well, Kate is actually kind of teaching me!  I actually-\"  I leaned in low for dramatic effect, and so did Nicole, clearly buying into the hype.  \"-I actually chopped up a jalepeno!  All by myself!  It was nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate laughed at this.  \"I had to give you gloves, Mel.  But yes, she's a fine sous chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, however, was wide-eyed.  \"Do you still make those stuffed jalepeno chicken bites?  Oh man, I miss those so much!\"  I was nodding happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had jalepeno chicken bites, jalepeno poppers... Oh man, what was that salsa you made?\"  I asked.  I liked Nicole, she seemed very eager to be everyone's friend.  It's no wonder she chose the Alpha-bitch over Kate- much easier to win Kate and Donna back then lose Nicole, this much was apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that poblano corn salsa recipe, I think you gave it to me, Nicole!\"  Kate said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was yours?  Oh <i>maaaan</i>, I must've eaten like, a pound of that salsa!  You gotta stop by sometime!\"  I honestly blurted that out without thinking, and Nicole's eyes went wide, as we both comically turned in unison to face Kate, then Brooke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension was broken slightly by our server returning with like, three pizzas for our table.  I coughed awkwardly as he took way too long to set them up, before asking us if we needed anything, which earned a quick head shake from the two of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, Kate finally spoke.  \"I'd... Really like it if you swung by again, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost teared up, I swear.  It was such a beautiful moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course...</span></div></div>",

And everything was going really well\u2014I swear I hadn't seen an honest-to-God expression of emotion like that in <i>years</i>. Kate, in her teeny tinny voice, tells her long-lost best friend Nicole how she'd really like it if they could hang out, and Nicole just sort've looks at her, all doe-eyed and pink faced like someone had just told her she'd be going to college for free and was also getting a speedboat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that, a pause...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Brooke decided that she was just gonna put her big ol' Bitch Stick in the mix and stir the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Nicki? Sweetie? Are you almost done here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, I don't know <i>how</i> I knew that she sounded like this before she opened her stupid mouth, but I did. You know the voice. Nasal and a little screechy. Kind've like a harpy, I would imagine. She put down her phone and sort've snarled at the three of us, probably more at Kate than either Nicole or me. But she just had this <i>face</i>. Like, she was <i>not</i> well to do for any manner of social interaction with either of us, and Nicole was clearly just slowing her down from raining on everyone else's parade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah, I was just... you know...\" Nicole stiffened up a little, her shoulders resting high like she was trying to hide in her shell, <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"Talking to Kate...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo have you ever, like, seen someone look like they were about to explode? I mean, like really actually explode? The pressure from the sheer <i>rage</i> they were feeling inside of them was building up and they were going to go nuclear, blow up like a balloon before bursting and spreading pain and fire all over the place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Much</i> to my surprise, she actually handled it pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Brooke.\" Kate hissed like a squeezed balloon-knot, \"You look well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, because I moved away from you.\" tanned tyrant gave me a quick up and down, \"Unlike Tiny here. What have you been <i>feeding</i> this one, you weird little kitchen elf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2014!!\" Kate took a step twice her size towards her ex-best friend and looked like she was about to pop, her little finger poised and ready for some (assuredly) grade-A chest poking and a piece of her little mind, but I took care of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd... pretty much everything.\" I said suddenly, cupping a roll of my belly and giving it a good little bounce, \"Taquitos, we had enchiladas, taco night... <i>lots</i> of Mexican food, I guess, is what I'm saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave the skinny little bitch a quick up and down for good measure. I know she saw me do it, too. She wasn't a <i>bad</i> looking girl just... I could practically see the Alpha Bitch radiate off of her like gas fumes. From her dye-job to her expensive looking nails to her Basic Bitch fashion sense. Ugh. Nice girls though\u2014I had to give her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, <i>you</i> were Kate's roommate.\" I said with a sly little smile and a chins-wobbling chuckle, \"You know what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention momentarily distracted from ruining Nicole's reunion with her old friend, Brooke flashed the fakest fucking smile she could manage and actually <i>turned</i> towards me. Like, girl, I didn't even know her. <i>This bitch and I just met five fucking seconds ago</i>, and she was going to devote an entire motion of her body to putting me in my lowly, fat girl place. What. A. Cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, I really do.\" she said with a pseudo sincerity that wouldn't have fooled Marlee Matlin, \"And my best advice for you, sweetie? Is to get another roommate. Before Kate makes you into an even bigger fatass than you already are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh. That was cold. Again, five seconds I've known this bitch. And Kate's mad and Nicole's embarrassed as hell and they're making their way towards our confrontation. I'm <i>really</i> proud of myself for not just punching her in the face, because honestly this bitch would have had it coming if I did. But instead I smiled, that same kind of fake smile that she gave me, and I kept my cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I have put on some weight since I moved in with her and Donna.\" I curled my nose, my hands travelling to rest on either side of my gut as I fiddled with the hem of my top, \"Kate's cooking is just <i>sooo</i> good\u2014how did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, by not being a fatass?\" Brooke snorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean... how did you lose those first ten pounds?\" I smiled again, a little longer and a little more poignantly, \"They're always the hardest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me sweetie.\" Brooke scoffed again, looking to Nicole as if to ask 'did this bitch just ask me that?' before turning back to me, \"Did you say the <i>first</i> ten pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I mean, you look <i>good</i>, don't get me wrong. I know living with Kate can be a little fattening.\" I pat my tummy appreciatively as I watched Brooke bubble and boil beneath her makeup, \"Kate said you'd put on some weight after you moved in but... I mean, it's not <i>that</i> noticeable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Excuse me?\"</i> she parroted her eyes wide with the fiery passion of an upper-middle class white girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, hey, if you can do it, so can I.\" I said proudly, placing my hands on my hips and arching my back, my belly surging forwards and brushing Brooke against the hip, \"You're only what, ten, twenty pounds from your goal weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo have you ever, like, seen someone look like they were about to explode? I mean, like really actually explode? The pressure from the sheer <i>rage</i> they were feeling inside of them was building up and they were going to go nuclear, blow up like a balloon before bursting and spreading pain and fire all over the place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that was Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inhaled really sharply, her chest swelling like she was some kind of nasty little frog, and she whipped around and grabbed Nicole by the arm. Then she started storming off in the opposite direction yelling at Kate that she had a \"nice fuckin' roommate\" and that she should have a nice life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was this pause, this long sort've awkward pause, between Kate and I before she finally started to smile. And then laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucking great!\" Kate howled as she wrapped her little arms around the outermost crest of my belly blubber, \"Mel you're my hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shucks.\" I snort, making Kate bounce on my belly like a ship in the ocean, \"It was nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonesty, I would have done it just to see the look on that bitch's face when someone my size bucked back. I got the feeling that Nicole wasn't exactly the type to go challenging Brooke's authority, and Kate would have just gone apeshit and started throwing things. I mean, yeah, I hadn't exactly made a good first impression with Nicole but... it was worth it. So <i>totally</i> worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, our food's getting cold.\" Kate said as she walked me back to the table, \"Free refills on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have.\" I rolled my eyes, \"Honestly, I don't know how you used to <i>live</i> with her. She seems like such a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she is.\" Kate settled down across from me and claimed a slice for herself, before sighing, \"She's just so... <i>ugh</i>. You know? I'm glad she's out of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\" I claimed several many pieces for myself before pausing, \"Nicole seemed cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no, she's cool. I mean, I guess.\" Kate said flatly, \"But, you know, not as cool as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As cool as Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe</i> as cool as Amy.\" Kate held up her fingers in a little pinch, \"On a good day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd... yeah, that's the story (one of the many stories) I have about making a skinny bitch lose her cool. This one was in public, and Kate was there. So that was fun. Honestly, this was the first time I can remember actually <i>bonding</i> with Kate. Our mutual dislike of Brooke actually pushed us a lot farther in friendship than we probably would have been otherwise. Which was totally cool with me. The better I knew my roommate, and the more I got to dish about that bony bitch, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't taste the difference between this and Little Caesar's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lying fucking bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we ate our pizza, we laughed, had a good time...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When I lived in the dorms, I wasn't exactly paying rent\u2014the more money that could be spent on cheap pizza and booze for me and Amy, the better! My Dad was great and he sent me a little care package each month, and even my Mom wasn't content on letting me <i>starve</i>... even if it was only because I hadn't told her about what my Dad sent me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint was, I was living the college kid dream; all I had to do was keep my grades up and I'd keep the money coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I <i>didn't</i> factor in for was rent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the four of us, the house was pretty affordable! Kate working at the bar and Donna doing some on-campus paperwork, they'd done their best to keep the roof over their heads before Amy and I waddled in. But now that the two of us were there, we were... sorta kinda expensive to feed. And to house. And clothe and entertain... Amy and I didn't come cheap! Which was why we inevitably had to get jobs. And trust me when I say that I wasn't happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUGH.\" Amy moaned, even fatter and more out of shape than when we moved in, \"How am I supposed to find a job? Like, <i>nobody's</i> hiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you even looked?\" I rolled my eyes, \"Like, for real, have you even looked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, <i>no</i> but... aren't we still in a recession?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though <i>some</i> of my roommates weren't exactly what you'd call \"industrious\" (at least, not after two hundred pounds of fat ass found its way into her pants) I hadn't been so easily defeated. Just because I was a big fat blimp didn't mean that I couldn't put my mind to something and do it! How do you think I got so big in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have <i>you</i> gotten a job yet?\" Amy asked snottily from the couch, cracking open a beer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know, blubber butt, that I've got an interview in an hour.\" I raised my nose and carried myself out in faux indignation, \"So yeah. Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had gotten all dressed up for the occasion. I know it was counterproductive, but interview clothes weren't exactly on the top of my \"make sure you can fit into this\" list, so I had to go out and buy a new outfit. And trust me, clothes my size don't come cheap. I had to break out my non-pizza, non-boredom emergency fund that I kept stashed away in my dresser. But trust me when I say it was worth it\u2014I looked big and bangin'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bought a half-sleeve white top <i>just</i> the right size. It hugged my shape and size tightly, but it wasn't constrictive. You could see the various rolls and folds of my body as it struggled against the stretchy white material, and the outline of my tummy tiers were clear as day, you could even see them bounce when I walked. The frills around the low collar helped tone down the \"over-prominence\" of my girls, so hopefully I wouldn't scare my (hopefully!) future boss off with a perceived sluttiness or whatever. Down below, I'd squeezed my ass into some black flowy dress pants and crammed my fat little feet into the cutest shoes. I'd gotten my nails done, broke out every Youtube makeup tutorial\u2014I'd contoured the <i>hell</i> out of my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few finishing touches to my luscious blonde locks, and I was out the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least pick up dinner!\" I heard Amy holler, \"Kate's not gonna be in tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay!\" I hollered back rolling my eyes and shaking my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried not to pay Amy any attention. She'd get a job. She'd have to. Right now the biggest concern, aside from wondering if I'd even <i>fit</i> in my Uber driver's teeny-tiny car, was my interview at...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I don't know if you guys like coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, yeah, I like the kind you put in your cup in the morning. Folgers, Chock Full 'o' Whatever. But I really like the frilly, froufrou drinks popularized by Starbucks. You know the ones\u2014the fancy Italian names, the ones pumped full of various syrups. The big sizes, the high sugar, the <i>payload</i> of calories just in one Venti cup? I was <i>all</i> about some coffee. You can blame Hannah Hammond for that, back at Buttercombe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Colleen and I were in town one day I saw that Bean Machine (our local coffee shop, which was much more affordable than Star<i>bucks</i>) I mentally filed it away for future knowledge. I mean, I could see myself working back there. Couldn't you? I mean, people tell me all the time that they could see me working in food service. I'm pretty sure it's because I weigh about five hundred pounds, but I take it as a compliment. That means I'm friendly, cheerful, and cute enough to get tips. So fuck yeah, I'll work in food service. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd do it for the discount alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, arriving promptly at two in the afternoon, right after lunch (well, that's what <i>she</i> said\u2014I could personally have gone for another one) my Uber pulled up in the parking lot. Donna was gonna be off at about four, so that meant I had two hours to wow my interviewer and then stylishly waddle out, squish myself into Donna's car, and make a celebratory Wendy's run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBean Machine was this cute little shop in one of those outdoor centers. It was tucked away next to the GNC and some kind of computer repair shop. It wasn't exactly big\u2014the seating area was packed enough for me to consider it a hazard for a girl of my size. Surely once I started working here I could make some adjustments...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I walked up to the counter, told the barista that I was here to see Mo, and took a seat in the corner. A short woman, I would say late thirties, in a black t-shirt and a brown apron came to greet me. She sat me down, we talked, and got on with the interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be blunt.\" the woman, Mo, said with a wry cock of her eyebrow, \"We don't exactly have aspiring baristas banging on our door. It requires a lot of footwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, looking directly at my gut as it pooled onto the table in front of me. Honestly, I must have looked huge. The tables were so small and Mo wasn't exactly a giant. I was pouring out of both sides, and I had to resist the instinctive urge to grab two chairs for comfort. I tried not to move, or the poor metal seat beneath me would creak and groan. I really wanted this job, and I didn't want my size (of <i>all</i> things!) to be the reason I didn't get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you'll be able to...\" she flicked her eyes back up at me, \"...handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" I hoped I sounded convincing, \"I, uh... I'm pretty light on my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" Mo nodded, her lips pursed contemplatively...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the interview went on like that. She'd ask me a question, most of the time <i>hinting</i> that at my size I probably wasn't the best candidate, I'd lie my big fat ass off or at least stretch the truth a little, and she'd make that face. I did my best to not look like I was nervous, but I'm sure she could tell. I was shiny with sweat by the end of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everything seems to be in order here.\" Mo finally said with a click of her pen as she wrote something down in her notes, \"I think...\"</span></div></div>",

Whatever that means. You seem like you've got your head on straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww!\" I cooed, \"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank <i>you</i>.\" Mo shook my hand, my arms wobbling right out of my sleeves, \"Come back Wednesday\u2014wear black pants and a black shirt, we'll get you sized up for a uniform. Do you want a drink before you head out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, suffice it to say, yes I wanted a drink before I headed out. But I had long moved past the basic menu offered to me. There was a bakery in there, and I had what Kate had often called \"shit taste\". And my taste was shit enough to have experimented frequently in the past with the boundaries that baristas were comfortable performing. Turns out, there's not a lot of boundaries to be crossed\u2014they're really terminally bored people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got the barista\u2014<i>my fellow barista now, bitches!</i>\u2014to do me a solid and make me one of my old favorites. It's, like, one fifth of a vanilla bean frappuccino with white mocha as the base. Then you throw in a blueberry muffin. I know, hear me out. You pour in the milk, the vanilla powder, the cream syrup, and like triple blend that shit. It's amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!\" Donna said with a slurp of her straw, \"Mel what <i>is</i> this? Is this a new drink? Can they come up with new drinks by themselves? I thought they just ripped off Starbucks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a Mel Carlyle original right there.\" I clinked our cups together (Mo made me pay for the second one. Even with her discount it was expensive!) \"I call it the Blueberry Blast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the thing with the blueberry muffin in it?\" Donna made a face at the cup<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is, Donna.\" I said with a happy little slurp as I slid my sunglasses over my fat face, \"It sure is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Donna started slurping on her straw again, \"Not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it.\" I sucked an inch of my blue not-coffee down in one gulp, \"Now onward! A celebratory Wendy's run, in honor of my newfound employment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so yeah, it happened just like that. Donna and I sucked down our glorified smoothies, got a couple burgers, headed home, and ordered Chinese. Everyone was super excited for me and honestly, I was excited too! I'd never had a job before, and I was actually looking forward to performing a service and getting paid for it for the first time in my life. I couldn't ride those Buttercombe coattails forever, now could I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you know, since we had the next day off, Kate <i>wanted</i> to throw me a celebration in her own particular way, but I was pretty adamant about not going in on my first day with a hangover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, everything was great! There was just... <i>one</i> thing...</span></div></div>",

This place was kinda like that.  <i>Kinda.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, it wasn't massive.  It was small.  BUT-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't get a lot of customers.  The lunch rush?  Like five people.

It's super loud!\"  I pointed eagerly to the machine- Mo, who I was pretty sure either loved me or hated me, because my fat ass kept knocking things down and forcing her to pick them up out of the kindness of her heart, shot a weird look at me that was either a coy acknowledgement or silent hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>God,</i> it's true.\"  Now it was my turn to give ambiguous looks.  I wasn't quite sure if that was a happy exclamation or an upset one, and clearly, neither was Mo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, that someone else is working here?  I know, Ms. Triple Shot Red Eye, it must suck to know that your drink might not be made to your standards!  Oh, the horror!\"  I still think I liked Mo.  That was a pretty good diss- now that I actually knew what a Red Eye even was.  I giggled, but Colleen rolled here eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Mel.  Make me what she said.  Sixteen ounce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there awkwardly.  \"Um... Room for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel.  Do you <i>think</i> I want room for cream or sugar?\"  She gestured to her outfit- which I suddenly realized was what normal people would consider \"workout gear\".  She clearly was either on her way to or coming home from the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  I exclaimed.  \"Right.  Well, three shots of ex-spresso-\"  Mo coughed angrily from the her spot.  \"Ugh.  ESSSSSSSSSS-spresso!!  Coming <i>right</i> up!\"  I went for the espresso machine, paused, started to go for it, paused again, then side-stepped sheepishly as Mo stormed over and began pouring the shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only doing this today, Mel.  You can't stay afraid of this thing, it's pretty important to know how it works.\"  Mo grumbled.  \"Go grab more cups from the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyways, I hustled and bustled and did my job, which was honestly pretty easy.  While it DID require a lot of foot-work, it also, as I previously mentioned, wasn't exactly the busiest location on the planet, which meant a lot of down time.  There were these nice metal stools against the standing bar, and while they were a far cry from comfortable, they actually held my weight- for now- and let me rest my normally unburdened feet for periods of time.  Colleen even left a five dollar tip, and Mo- who I was now pretty sure liked me- let me keep all the tips for the day, presumably because she was technically the manager and probably got paid more than minimum wage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why my good mood felt so bizarre when I walked into the house that night.  Colleen, Donna and Kate were all sitting around the kitchen, looking like they cut into the booze a little too early and didn't feel like cleaning up for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who's home from their first day of work and already made 18 dollll-aaaaars!\"  I sang, waving my fat stacks like I was some hotshot- but the three girls drinking whiskey just shot me odd looks.  Colleen looked annoyed, Kate looked embarrassed, and Donna looked sheepish- she was the only one to immediately grab the bottle of whiskey and fill up her glass a tad more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.  Mel.  We gotta talk.\"  Colleen said.  My face fell.  I thought this was gonna be the 'First day of employment' party, not the 'Totally bummer house party' party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.  Did I not make your drink right?\"  Colleen sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, you can't really fuck up my drink.  Look, the problem is that... Is that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That place has a tendency of girls gaining serious weight while they work there.\"  Donna interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked in amazement.  \"Uh.  Have my fifteen jokes a day about being super fat and <i>perfecly fine with it</i> not made any sort of impact in this household?  Do I need to up my quota?\"  Colleen rolled here eyes, but laughed anyways, as did everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, no, it's just- Look, like, this one girl worked there and gained like, twenty pounds in a month.  It was the craziest thing ever, seriously!  And it wasn't the first time this happened to someone who worked there.  Look, just-  Ugh, I knew this was dumb to even bring up.\"  Kate moaned, punching Colleen in the arm.  \"I told you Mel didn't care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColleen rubbed her arm.  \"Fuck!  Fine, you were right, and I'm a dummy who worries about your new roommate gaining like a hundred pounds before the year is over- no offense, Mel.  I just wanted to say something, it didn't feel right if I didn't.  Goes against my code, or whatever, with the whole degree about doing the opposite of whatever the hell happens in that place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense taken.  Seriously, you guys are acting like someone died!  Give me some of that damn whiskey and a can of Coke and lets forget the whole thing, okay?\"  Donna dutifully did so, and I scooted up to the group to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... Try not to bring too many of those drinks around here, okay?\"  Kate asked, half kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that'll be a problem.\"  I grinned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Show of hands\u2014how many of you guys go to your local coffee shops?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you do, you'll notice that there are all kinds of different recipes and drinks that all follow a simple, basic pattern. The ingredients might change, but there's always milk (either almond, coconut, or soy, at your leisure!) and some kind of flavoring... <i>lots</i> of sugar. I mean, it's kind've inevitable. Be they blended, brewed, stirred or steamed, there's usually a certain science to it. But that's just the basic drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that set Bean Machine apart was that, unlike Starbucks, we had a rotating cast of \"special\" drinks that we kept on the menu, and were otherwise more or less always available. Certain days, the Seven Layer Frappe was the drink of the day so you could get a Superior drink for the price of a Supreme cup. Others it was the Marble Mint, the Yosemite Sam Frappe, or even (once I showed Mo the recipe) my Blueberry Blast Frappe. We tried to keep things interesting because, hey, we were a little more expensive and we didn't have as big of a name as certain other chain coffee bars. We had a small but loyal sect of customers who kept coming back because of the \"atmosphere\" or whatever; \"support local businesses\", \"big corporations are evil\", yadda yadda. I didn't really care, so long as there wasn't <i>too</i> big of a rush. Y'know? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy point is, things were steady. I got a half-off discount on just about everything I could my little heart could palpitate for. I liked it there, and my coworkers were pretty cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>damn</i> if I couldn't see how a couple girls put on more than a couple pounds working for Mo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean honestly, other than the morning rush and the lunch rush (there was a fabled after work rush, but I was still on Summer hours and had yet to experience such a mystical time) there really wasn't all that much to do. There was usually one, two customers in the store at any given time, and it was me and another employee. There really, <i>really</i> wasn't a lot to do other than experiment with coffee flavors and sit on our butts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I'll be honest, I was slowly getting hooked on these drinks. The caffeine, the sugar, all those sweet delicious flavors whirling around in the blender or frothing in the milk... and that wasn't even <i>counting</i> all those tasty calories that I was soaking up like a sponge. Seriously, I think I gained ten pounds after my first two weeks there. I was definitely doing my part in fulfilling Colleen's prophecy and thensome. Even if I hadn't been trying to gain weight, I don't think I could have helped it\u2014if I wasn't behind the bar, I <i>always</i> seemed to be sucking down something from the blender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMo honestly didn't seem to mind. I paid for it all, of course, and I was always coming up with new drinks ideas. Kate may have had the perfect beer-to-meal whatever, but sometimes it felt like I could throw anything into a blender and make a mean frappuccino out of it. Brownies? Done it. Rice Krispies? Done it. Cheesecake? <i>Overdone</i> it. I was a drink mixing machine, and the results were incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I've never seen that before!\" said a particularly pudgy-tummied teen as she pressed her budding pot against the glass, \"Do you like, really make it with cheesecake? No wonder it's so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know if it's possible sweetie, but can you make one of those <i>low-cal</i>?\" said one of three plumping office drones, her hands cupped over her mouth to one side, \"They're a little <i>rich</i> for my taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm!\" a jogger smiled as her lips parted, belly bulging over the waistband of her spanx, \"This Blueberry thingy gives me just enough energy to make it home. Thanks a bunch, Mel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, yeah, that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were making a lot of money. Once Mo advertised that we were adding new drinks to the menu, our social media followers went up by, like, twenty. You had our regulars giving us good press, my awesome drinks giving them something to gab about... it was nice! There was money in my pocket and my new boss really liked me! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where you've been all my life, Mel.\" Mo said with a slurp of her Black and White, \"But don't you ever fucking leave or I'll hunt you down and bury you in espresso beans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, everything was going great. I never imagined that working was so much... fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, uh...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, I mean, I was drinking an excess of a couple thousand calories a day, guys. With my employee discount, any and every drink that I could ever want was half off. And I wanted a <i>lot</i> of drinks. Not just because it was hot (it was actually starting to cool down outside\u2014time to switch to hot drinks!) but because it was pretty exhausting lugging more than a quarter-ton of me around even the tiny coffee shop. Seriously, between squeezing myself behind the counter, parting the tables with my hips, even just trying to tie my custom-ordered apron around my gut was enough to make me crave one of those sweet, thirst-quenching, dripping-with-calories panaceas that I pumped (blended and served) out almost every hour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich had the totally forseeable side-effect of making it even harder to do those things. A couple of my barista buddies could go for a coffee around their break. Maybe before they came in, or after they left if they didn't have to close. But me? I was drinking frappes like it was going out of style. On my breaks I'd order two, sometimes three or four, just so I could put them in the fridge in the back so I could help keep myself hydrated. I regularly made coffee runs for my friends, emptying out entire batches of blueberry muffins for my self-designed Blueberry Blitz Frappes. Whole halves of cheesecake went into me inbetween my already pretty regular indulgences on some days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had certainly created a monster\u2014and that monster was <i>me</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another day, and that meant (yes) another dollar, but it also meant that I'd just ordered enough lunch to make even Amy think twice. My orders had been getting increasingly complex since I started working at Bean Machine, but they'd also grown in size now that I could afford to indulge thanks to my discount. I had two trays of entrees; one in my left hand and the other nestled between my fluffy upper and forearm fat so I could carry my backup Blueberry Blitz. The one that I was drinking was nestled on top of my stomach, and I balanced it with the straw in my mouth. And yes, I <i>may</i> have been drinking it too. What's it to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk into the back and playing balancing act with all my food had left me beat. Like, sweating beat. I was getting fatter than ever, but the modest amount of standing and walking I did was enough to taper the weight gain slightly. No doubt at this caloric intake, if I moved as much as, say, Amy, I'd be a goddamn whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that would have been a bad thing. I'd thought about throwing in my hat with Amy or Donna and getting a desk job. That way I could just sit on my ass all day, squishing chairs and not burning precious calories. But then I wouldn't get to have all <i>this</i>\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo sandwiches, Turkey and Brie, two bowls of chili, two croissants, a red velvet cupcake and a slice of cheesecake for dessert. And <i>two</i> Blueberry Blitz frappes? Um, I think the discount that I got working <i>here</i> was way better than whatever perks Amy and Donna got\u2014which was <i>none</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd gained almost thirty pounds since I'd started working there, middling me out at just over 550. I was huge. So big that I might have actually had to cut back a little if I wanted to keep my job... the thought alone made my breathing quicken. I was really starting to get hooked on all this. I'll admit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least I wasn't the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mel?\" Mo said with a slurp of her own sugary drink, \"Think you pull a shift for Lena this Monday? I'll make sure your Saturday's covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy boss was leaning in the break room doorway, one of my frappuccino calorie bombs in a venti cup nestled firmly in her hand. She was sucking down one of my newer recipes, a Cheesecake Factory Sampler. It was basically like, a little bit of all our cheescakes blended in with white mocha and frappe base. Plus there was like these almond nuts and syrup. Mo'd made them do a caramel wall along the rim of the cup. Mm, that actually looked pretty good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'd started working there, Mo was a short woman with an average build. She was short, with box-dyed red hair, and in her mid thirties. But since I'd started bringing in so much money to the place and filling our recipe book with drinks of my own design (read: enough calories to send most girls back to the tailor) she'd been filling out. A lot of my fellow employees had, but Mo's gain was more obvious because of her height. Her belly rounded out in front of her, and pressed tightly against her black polo. Even beneath her apron, I could see where the waistband of her jeans cut into her gut, and it had started folding over. Add into that a modest set of hips and a noticeably flabby bust, and my boss was definitely getting bigger. I'd say she might have put on almost as much weight as I had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh... Saturday off?\" I panted, \"That sounds great. What time do you want me in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you do three?\" Mo said with another slurp, \"You'll be with me, and you're the only one I trust to get these drinks right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then three it is.\" I smiled, chubby cheeks bunching, \"You got it boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\" Mo finished off her frappe and chucked the cup into the trash, \"By the way, you've got like... fifteen minutes left on your lunch. So eat fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as my boss walked out into the larger store, her cheeks flaring out behind her and bouncing in her slacks, I looked back to all of this food I had spread out in front of me and actually thought, unironically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That shouldn't be a problem\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I started to dig in, I had a moment of clarity. I really had a problem. Like, I was seriously addicted to the food here. All the drinks and the sandwiches, soups, and sweets... I was completely hooked!</span></div></div>",

God I was getting huge. My arms swung from side to side as I tried desperately to keep a momentum going. My whole body ached, like it seemed to after every shift. Being my size was great and all until I actually had to get up and do anything. I was managing, barely, at the Bean Machine but only with the innovation of abusing my discount to extreme levels. But as I got fatter and fatter, I was going to have to make some adjustments soon... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe straps of my purse cut deeply into my fluffy elbow as it bounced against one pillowy hip. I had a drink container in one hand\u2014as much as they liked to bitch, I had done a pretty spectacular job of making regulars out of my roommates\u2014plus an extra special treat for Donna for picking me up. It was a hazelnut frappe with a caramel wall and marshmallow whipped cream; totally custom, and made to her exact specifications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ you are <i>so slow</i>.\" Donna teased as my added weight tilted the car to one side, \"You got my drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got your drink.\" I said, handing over the extra cup<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mm!</i>\" Donna took a sip immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All better?\" I panted, exhausted from my little stroll through the parking lot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.\" Donna sat the drink in her cupholder and extended her seatbelt over a budding pot belly, \"Next time, do you think you could score me some of that dark caramel sauce? That shit was <i>good</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway, we made our way home (I <i>may</i> have convinced Donna to stop for Wendy's\u2014just maybe) and we piled our way through the back door. I had been skinny enough to use the front door for maybe like, a month? But after that one time I got stuck, I just resigned myself to using the glass sliding doors around back. It was a little more effort to get to, but at least I could go <i>into</i> the house. Also, it wasn't too much effort if I had whoever drive me halfway there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna balled up the Wendy's bags and tossed them in the bin outside (Kate would <i>kill</i> us if she knew we spoiled our appetites!) and sucked heartily from her frappe, half-gone. I waddled inside and placed the drink carrier on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DRINKS ARE HERE!\" I panted, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI needed to sit down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I chewed loudly enough to make sure Colleen heard it, but not so much so as to risk waking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm eating...\" I said quietly, watching this dumb smile spread across Colleen's face, \"You hear me, Colleen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...\" the athlete panted, \"...mmmm.... eat <i>more</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who was I to argue with the woman?

And as I ate, Colleen seemed to grow restless in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't be happening, right? I mean, I knew lots of folks who liked fat girls. I knew plenty who liked fat girls who were, oh, say fifty pounds shy of the big 6-double-zero. But I had known Colleen for a while now. Surely she wasn't some kind of closet feeder? Not with her whole \"health\" thing going on, and all the hard times she'd given me about being lazy. Sure she never pushed me to exercise, but I always thought that was because she accepted the fact that I was a lost cause when it came to fitness. Could she really have been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop...\" Colleen burbled out, \"Want... fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, look, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't getting all hot and bothered from this. The mystery and the forbidden fetish aspect of all this alone were enough to get my chubby gears going. If Colleen wanted me to eat, I was going to eat. I arched my back and flexed my belly out until it was big and round. Then I lifted it up with my one free hand and sat it on the bed, right in front of Colleen. I could feel her breath on my gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but Colleen, I'm already <i>soooo</i> big...\" I panted, kneading my rolls with lust in my eyes, \"No more, Colleen, I'm already so fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to that, Colleen replied...</span></div></div>",

In fact, I would argue that if you were to look at the past weeks, day by day, hour by hour, you would see conclusively that I was literally at zero fault here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, <i>almost</i> zero fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was bustling around behind the counter, trying to figure out a good way to incorporate a bagel into a drink.  I was on the verge of pouring a drink <i>on top</i> of a bagel and eating it soggy, just for scientific sake, when Colleen busted in.  Unlike her usual athletic wear, she was just wearing shorts and a nice blouse, and looked pretty down in the dumps.  I paused momentarily from playing <b>Goddess of the Lattes</b> to talk to her.  I had really come into my own at this place, and Mo trusted me enough to run the shop while she did the books in the back- along with the promise of \"Steaming a Latte on my face if I mess anything up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, I loved that lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Colleen slumps in looking all morose, and I swear I could hear that sad piano music from Peanuts playing in the background.  \"Woah, Debbie Depressed, what's eating you?\"  I asked, slumping over the counter and forcing my titanic tummy to ooze over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel.  It's 'Debbie Downer'.\"  Colleen said, sounding like she just had to take her dog out back and shoot it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, semantics.  What's wrong?\"  I asked, buttering up the bagel and making a mental note to not dump drinks on top of baked goods, ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever... Well, I'm guessing not, but you ever had a workout buddy?\"  I coughed awkwardly.  \"Right.  No, you haven't.  Anyways, there was this cute guy who I had been working out with every now and then, from my classes.  And I asked him out to lunch, y'know, like... Well, I <i>thought</i> I was being clever and flirty or whatever.  And this dude brought his <b>girlfriend!</b>  Which, he's like, never even <i>mentioned</i> before.  And I guess they've been together for like two years!  Who the fuck even does that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged my shoulders awkwardly, because my 'cool relaxed barista' pose made it kinda hard to do that.  \"Sounds like a jerk, Colleen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's just it.  He's not.  Just dumb.  Boys are dumb.\"  Suddenly, I was struck with an idea.  See, I had been making this list of drinks in my head for every one of my friends, and Kate and Donna and Amy were all super easy- especially Amy, who's drink was more syrup than milk or coffee or espresso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Colleen had been a harder nut to crack.  I tried to analyze her choices at meals, and in her taste in beer, but I had really been struggling.  Until now.  \"That's true, boys <i>are</i> dumb.  But this drink sure isn't!\"  I said happily, running around behind the counter for a moment and the sliding the drink out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, I don't-  I don't drink this stuff, you know that.\"  I rolled my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just try it, and if you hate it, I'll make your usual drink.  For free.  Seriously.  But you gotta be honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, this is dumb, but fine.\"  She grabbed the cup- I only made a 12 oz., because honestly I was half convinced she WOULD hate it.  But, to my delight, she took a long sip, then another, and then finally put the cup down, more than half empty.  \"I... Hate it?  Make my drink for free now?  Please?\"  Colleen said, the burst out laughing.  \"Ugh, fine, you win.  It's okay.  What's in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winked at her.  \"I'll never tell.\"  It was dark chocolate and hazelnut.  Simple, but effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, but how am I gonna order it if you're not here?\"  This caught me by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna order it... Again?\"  She gave me a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been drinking the same drink since this place <i>opened.</i>  I'm allowed to switch it up every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough!  You want one to go?\"  Colleen downed the rest of the cup and threw it on the counter.  \"I'll take that as a yes!  You gotta pay for this one, though.  And I'll tell Mo about your new drink.\"  Colleen nodded appreciatively as she dug through her bag for some cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, <i>I guess</i> you could <i>maybe</i> make an argument that I kicked this whole thing off.  But honestly, I was just being a good friend for Colleen!   She was all sad about a boy, I did something nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I noticed some changes.  Like, one night I was helping clean up before taking off when I got a text.  From Colleen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey, you wanna make me one of those drinks?  ill pay you when you get back to the house and also ill love you forever.  thanks!\"  I rolled my eyes, figured it was no big deal, but as I started up the drink, Mo walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you making another drink for Colleen?\"  I was a little surprised, but guessed she recognized the drink as I was making it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMo narrowed her eyes.  \"That girl has already been in here twice today!  Sheesh, she's gonna make herself sick.  Whatever.\"  That gave me pause.  If Colleen had already drank two of these today... I dropped the line of thought immediately.  Colleen was arguably the only \"fit\" person I had ever met.  She was probably just indulging and then tomorrow she'd do a thousand squats or whatever it is people do at the gym.  So, I made her a 24 oz. drink, just excited to be done with work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it's not like things would just stay great forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came home to the house to find...</span></div></div>",

The general rule in the house was that, as long as Kate wasn't cooking, we could order whatever we wanted. I mean, we were grown/growing women so we could order whatever we wanted anyway, it was just a courtesy thing. So, since Kate would be covering her friend's shift at the bar, I should have probably guessed that I'd walk into some kind of good old-fashioned feasting fiesta. Neither myself, Amy, or Donna were exactly whiz kids in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was that I knew something was up from the minute I walked through the door. The smell of greasy takeaway food was <i>overpowering</i>\u2014I could smell the beer from our porch, and the air inside was thick and heavy. Was that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of...\" I puffed, shuffling my fat feet inside and hurrying the door shut, \"<i>Amy!</i> <i>Donna!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy pungent smoke loomed overhead, and I took an instinctive and appreciative inhale. Kate had this dealer friend at the bar (Kate seemed to know everybody!) and he tended to \"thank\" her for covering his shifts by sliding her a sample here or there. Like her cooking, Kate had never been stingy with her pot. Donna, Amy, and I were more than welcome to help ourselves at any point (\"It's not like he's <i>not</i> going to sell to me.\" Kate had said thickly one night as smoke poured out of her mouth), but there was an unspoken rule that we... you know... we at least liked to <i>offer</i> each other a seat in the circle. It was just... <i>rude!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy? Donna? Where the hell are you guys? \" I puffed, my fat feet aching after a long day of work. I dragged them through the living room and into the kitchen, \"I <i>know</i> you're not upstairs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they weren't in the kitchen either. Which is weird because, as far as my experience with Amy as a roommate went, she could <i>usually</i> be found in the same breeding ground as food when she was high. <i>Especially</i> when she was high. But her fat ass nor Donna could be found at the table, which was especially strange. They <i>couldn't</i> have been upstairs, at least not Amy. Being drunk off her ass (her great, big, disproportionately large ass) would have been enough to dissuade her from climbing stairs if Amy's natural inclination against stair climbing hadn't been enough. And Donna was a real lazy high\u2014I couldn't exactly see her lumbering upstairs after smoking a bowl of Keith's loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard a sound; it was far off, and muffled, but I could recognize it anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone just opened up a bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy?\" I called out again, tottering around until I was facing the hallway, \"Are you in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muffled giggling I heard carry down the hall, and the soft crackling of chip bag confirmed it. I had heard all that I needed to hear\u2014those two were in my room, and by the sound of it they were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" I said softly, my eyes wide with terror, \"No no no no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI probably moved faster then than I had in months. My fat feet carried me with the speed of someone half my size. No longer did my cumbersome corpulence slow me down, rather that it aided me in my assault on my room. It was no longer a belly, it was a battering ram. I pressed my gut against the door so hard and so fast that I heard it creak, I thrust my flabby arm towards the knob and started to twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy you fucking bitch I swear to God I'm gonna cut you!\" I shouted, genuinely unnerved, \"You better not, you hear me? You better fucking not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI twisted the door handle and barged my way inside. My gut fell back into place, rolling over my thighs as I lugged one heavy leg in front of the other. My footsteps boomed and my knicknacks shook as I made my entrance known. You'd think that, being my size, that wouldn't be much of an issue. But when you have two roommates, one <i>nearing</i> my size, giggling on your bed like a bunch of overfed teenagers, you'll find yourself hard pressed to get anything clear into their foggy brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey Mellllll.\" Donna said with a little wave, her fingers coated in orange dust, \"We, ummm... we don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Amy managed through a mouthful of ho-ho, while also unwrapping another package, \"No idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never had this kind of trouble with my own sister growing up. Alice had always been super sweet and respectful of my personal space. Plus I went to a private high school for four years, and that probably helped. But the point was, I'd never had anyone come into my room without my permission. Not even my bitch mom, if only because she probably thought \"fat\" was contagious. I wasn't quite sure how to deal with someone (<i>two</i> someones!) barging into my room, plopping down on my bed and\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are you eating my snacks?</i>\" I demanded with a stomp of my foot that made my blobby body quake, \"What the shit, guys?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014ohhh my God I was <i>beyond</i> words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, I do my best to keep my voluptuous, incredibly round and jiggly figure through ample snacking. For convenience, or when I'm having a particularly stressful day (or when I'm just bored) I bought one of those bed-under things that you slip clothes into. Except instead of filling it with clothes, I filled it with <i>all</i> my favorite junk food. I had crammed Doritos of every flavor, just about every Little Debbie variation known to man, a couple boxes of mini muffins, some cupcakes... <i>everything</i> a fat girl could ask for, and crammed it into a container about the size of a twin mattress that nestled quite comfortably underneath my queen sized one. I had <i>thought</i> that it was safe from prying fingers and greedy gullets (other than my own!) but I should have known that if anyone would have found out about it, it would have been Amy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't be mad.\" Donna slurred in a slightly stronger southern accent as she sucked the cheesy dust off of her fingers, \"Like we <i>weerrrrreeee</i> gonna do it in Amy's room but her fat ass broke the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned in shock, and some horror, as I caught sight of the bedframe buckling beneath Amy's superior posterior. I knew that she had only gotten bigger since we made the move (so had I!) but had she really gotten so fat that she was breaking furniture? Like, furniture that we got when we moved in? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her face\u2014it was definitely rounder and chubbier. Her chin was set pretty deeply into a plunging, swaddling second that had stopped bunching into a third one when she spoke. Her arms were all wobbly and they shook even while she calmed down from her laughing fit. Amy's gut sat heavily between her enormous thighs as her ass pooled and spread out behind her. Her long red hair was free, draping over her meaty melons as she choked down snack cakes and potato chips like a true champ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't....RRRAAAPP!\" Amy belched deeply, \"Don't listen to her, Mel. Like, it didn't break until <i>she</i> started jumping up and down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it broke where <i>you</i> were sitting. Donna punched Amy in her fat arm wing, \"That's what she gets for hogging <i>all the pizza</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's not like... RURRRP...\" Amy gasped, \"It's not like Katie isn't gonna cook when she gets home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's working late tonight, you dumb heifer!\" Donna laughed, her full belly shaking out from underneath her top as it quivered with mirth, \"Ohhh... you are so high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am not.\" Amy snorted, snack food tucked away in her cheeks like a squirrel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd already eaten all the pizza? Like, <i>all</i> those boxes out there? And then they had emptied out my snack drawer and... and probably the freezer too at this rate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Amy really getting so out of control that she'd eat us all out of house and home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean sure, I knew she was getting fat. We were both huge, but <i>I</i> wasn't about to go hog wild and suck down everything edible within a fwo-floor radius of myself. At least, not yet anyway. I was all for getting fat, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was just getting so big... so fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I know it was partially my fault. I introduced her to the way of the weight, and she took to it like a fish took to water. She'd been piling on the pounds like crazy since we started living together on campus, and once we moved in with Donna and Kate she'd only just gotten fatter and fatter... Amy was still my friend, and I wasn't exactly one to tell her to stop fucking eating, but I was starting to get worried!</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m not here to force anything on anybody\u2014except the realization that I\u2019m drop-dead gorgeous, despite my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when I say that I started to get worried about Donna, don\u2019t misconstrue me. I\u2019m a bombshell, and my size means that I\u2019m the biggest fucking bombshell around; I embrace it. Most people aren\u2019t quite like me\u2026 except for Amy, apparently, but that\u2019s different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Donna started getting fat\u2014and I mean <i>really</i> started packing it on, I started to get a little worried about her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that much longer after that whole snack stash fiasco, about a week or two, that I came home to find Amy and Donna vegging out on the couch like the spuds that they had so quickly become. Honestly, I\u2019d started seeing them camping out in the living room more often than not\u2014it was the room in closest proximity to the kitchen which meant that all of their basic primal fat girl needs were just a few labored steps away. Food, beer, soda, snacks; everything was just a few awkward toddles to the right, and they could still get the most out of our Amazon Fire stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should have seen the two of them. Happy as pigs in mud, and just as fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy I wasn\u2019t so concerned about. She\u2019d been filling out ever since day one with me, even if she had gone a little overboard. Her pale pillowy cheeks spread across the couch like an avalanche of freckled ginger blubber, but what else was new, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, Mel\u2019s home!\u201d Amy extended a lazy, expectant arm, \u201cHey, mind tossing those Ho-Hos my way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet \u2018em yourself, wide load.\u201d I snickered as I put my purse down, \u201cI just got off work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUUUUGH.\u201d Amy threw herself onto the arm of the couch, \u201cDonna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiiiiiine.\u201d The tall blonde rolled her eyes, \u201cBut one of these days I\u2019m going to get <i>you</i> to get up and get something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was then that I saw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tell-tale grunt as she rocked off the couch should have been enough for me to realize what had occurred, but I couldn\u2019t look away! Pressed against my roommate\u2019s snugly-fitting pink Southern Couture tee were two thick meaty lovehandles! Handfuls of tanned plush pudge pulling at the fabric from either side, leaving little to no room for that belly she\u2019d been growing. I could already see where it threatened to fold over itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was no belly, it was a full-fledged tummy! On my once tall, lanky roommate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked over, belly swaying from side to side with every swish of her thick hips, my mouth dropped. How long had this been happening? Since when was Donna our third fattest housemate? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar be it from me to judge but\u2026 damn Donna got fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shoot.\u201d Donna made a face as she dropped the Ho-Ho package, \u201cI dropped it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPick it up, five second rule.\u201d Amy waved her hand dismissively as she rubbed the summit of her own mountainous rolls and folds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bent over and\u2026 and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRRRRRIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose chubby buns of hers had definitely been growing too! They were just big and round enough to split her jeans right down the middle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDouble shoot!\u201d Donna frowned, \u201cI just bought these\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ, what was happening here? Was I just contagious? Was I so fat that I just\u2026 <i>made</i> everyone around me fat? That\u2026 was kind\u2019ve hot. But no, Donna! What had gotten into her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an old pair of sweats in my room, if you want.\u201d Amy offered helpfully from the couch, catching the package that Donna tossed at her and deftly unwrapping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Donna huffed as she cupped her meaty cheeks so as to blind us from her carnivorous crack, \u201cYou\u2019re a peach, Amy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time.\u201d Amy managed through a mouthful of snack cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, do you see what I mean? This kind of stuff didn\u2019t just happen. First Amy, and now Donna? Something didn\u2019t add up. Was Donna okay? Maybe I should go talk to her\u2026</span></div></div>",

It's KIND of your fault that I'm this big- but I mean, I didn't really have to do much 'persuading' to get Donna to plump up.  In fact, she took to the kind of gluttony that I thought only you and I possessed pretty quickly once we started hanging out more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eyeballed her suspiciously while she offered me a bag of Ruffles.  I, of course, immediately accepted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, look- Like, I'm not gonna be eating healthy anytime soon, but you aren't here a lot- and Kate is.  I mean, here more than you.  And I swear, ever since we moved into this house, she's like... <i>Quadrupled</i> the amount of culinary magic she pulls!  Every time Donna and I are crashing on the couch, in swoops Kate with some insane five course meal, paired with like, fifteen beers.  She <i>literally</i> texts us forms to fill out through some Google nonsense or whatever!  And I mean... It's never like a salad with a side of some healthy shit!  It's always like, Pasta topped with cheese, topped with more pasta, topped with some deep fried food, and then there's a side of some milkshake that's supposed to be made with some fancy Creamy De Mint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cr\u00e8me de menthe.\"  I responded almost immediately- Look, one of my cousins was French, alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever!  All I'm saying, is, well... Maybe I'm cool with her getting hella fat like us, but Kate is definitely the enabler.  Like, more enabler than me, because <i>I</i> happen to have limited funds for junk food, whereas Kate is willing to force feed us several meals a day to get some culinary experience or whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe she just found two willing gluttons for taste-testers.  Don't act like you're so innocent in this.\"  I said, but I couldn't help but giggle.  For some reason, the idea of Kate \"forcing\" meals on Amy- and now Donna- was kind of hilarious to me.  It also made me a little jealous... But I also really liked getting out of the house every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\"  Amy threw her hands up as Donna stepped back into the room, finally.  We had been talking for a while.  Donna let out a modest belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy- Saw that last Crispin Pear Cider in your room- You know, that one you said we were all out of?  Drank it.  Screw you.  But thanks for the sweats.\"  She grumbled as she flopped down the couch opposite of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh.  I was starting to see Amy's side of this...

As large as I was, I didn\u2019t really lose control around food the way that Amy did. But her big green eyes may as well have glazed over as the plump ivory sausages that she called fingers began to wriggle in delight. She leaned forward into the sea of stomach that held her pinned to the couch as Kate unfolded a TV tray and placed it on top of Amy\u2019s belly. Then mine, and then Donna\u2019s on the other couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Kate.\u201d Donna said breathily, her voice husky as her eyes lingered on the spread set out in front of her, \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for my two favorite customers.\u201d Kate\u2019s little nose wrinkled in delight as she laughed, \u201cYou too Mel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha\u2014sue me for having irregular work hours.\u201d I huffed, though I was a little itchy myself to get to work on Kate\u2019s newest burger/pasta confection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the only woman I knew who would think of something like a Ravioli burger. I have no idea how she did it, and honestly, I was a little afraid to ask. But she\u2019d somehow managed to get ahold of giant ravioli, stuff them with beef and cheese, dress them with garnish and ranch. Viola\u2014serve with a side of fries and marinara sauce and you\u2019ve got a first course in this house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus, no wonder we were all getting so fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting the pudgy plight of our newest inductee into the fat life, I allowed myself to get a little carried away in the first few bites. I leaned forward so as not to ruin the last good black polo that fit me (I had work tomorrow!) and bit deep into the cheesy, beefy, <i>glorious</i> concoction. Ranch dribbled down my chins as a familiar euphoria overwhelmed me\u2014<i>damn</i> that was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a great IPA to pair this with.\u201d Kate swelled proudly as all three of us enjoyed our burgers, \u201cIt\u2019s a microbrewery that isn\u2019t far from here and I managed to score some from the bar. Here, let me get it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother night of booze and dinner was upon us, alright. I could really see why Donna fell so fast to Amy\u2019s trickery. She wasn\u2019t nearly as big a girl as Amy and I were (at least, not yet!) so she probably spent most of her time at home buzzed and hungry.

Donna turning into a \"Tonna\" flabby fun through Amy's nebulous machinations was something else.  That being said, Amy kinda had a point.  Kate's culinary crimes had only ramped up, and the fact that I tended to be MIA meant they were directed at the other two members of the house- and it showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese \"Ravioli Burgers\" were literally a calorific onslaught in more ways than one.  First of all, I was pretty sure the burger patty itself was a half pound of meat.  The \"ravioli\" portion of it was basically a nightmare of ricotta and spinach (so we were about 1/5 healthy foods, hip-hip hooray), and the red sauce... Was really only red because of the tomato.  I'm pretty sure it was actually just melted butter with a hint of tomato mixed in for appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo look- I'm a glutton.  I munched down on two of these bad boys, and had several IPA's on the side.  But Donna was literally glutting herself.  I had learned to appreciate food.

You ever see someone actually <i>inhale</i> food?  I'm pretty sure I've done it more than once, but I swear to God that Donna opened her mouth, inhaled, and the burger disappeared.  And I thought AMY was quite the glutton.  But Donna was literally devouring everything in sight, and Kate seemed to love it.  Even when I tried to distract her with some bullshit compliments, she gravitated towards Donna and Amy, making sure both over-gorged girls got more than they truly needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weird thought hit me, just then: I was being out-eaten by my formerly scrawny roomie and a formerly apathetic taste-tester.

And, sure, at one point in time, that would have driven me crazy. Like, here I am a good three times the size of Amy\u2019s little pet project, and she was lapping over me like I was some kind of amateur! But ever since I got my job and started living on my own (well, with my roommates) I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019d matured a bit. I wasn\u2019t exactly <i>ready</i> to go for immobility yet. It was already a struggle just to get around at my size, and I wasn\u2019t exactly going to win \u201cBest Barista of the Month\u201d if I was too fat to leave the house. Or, you know, make enough money to pay my part of the rent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was only twenty-one, and I still had a lot of shit to do. Get a non-entry-level position, make enough money to support an incredibly hedonistic lifestyle, meet that special someone who wouldn\u2019t mind waiting on me hand and foot for the rest of my life\u2026 that, or marry someone rich enough to afford me all of those things. Which I wasn\u2019t going to be able to do if I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. So either way, instead of binging on Kate\u2019s calorie-bomb burgers (which were amazing and delicious) I decided to do the responsible thing and stop at seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, admittedly, still would have blown you out of the water. These things were amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let the little ones have their fun (little ones being Donna and Amy\u2014not quite so little anymore!) and bowed out somewhere around my third burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was admittedly a little pleased with how well Amy had coaxed Donna into the fat life. From that day forward, I was much more aware of the changes going on with my tallest roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy talked her into trying just about everything under the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery meal had an \u201cand\u201d\u2014nothing like burgers <i>and</i> pizza.

That\u2019s two for Katie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs our horizontally-challenged roommate high fived herself, I couldn\u2019t help but giggle. Her tolerance was through the roof\u2014she must have outdrank all three of us if she was this fucking buzzed. I\u2019d believe it too. That little leprechaun could drink the three of us and just about everyone else in the apartment complex under the table. It came with the territory of her obsession with pairing everything with alcohol, I suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man this is so good.\u201d She mumbled drunkenly as she bit into her burger, \u201cCan I cook or can\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou already said that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO YOU ADMIT THAT I SAID IT FIRST.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was, like, 5\u2019 flat. Most beer mugs were about the size of her head. She was teensy. If she were half a foot taller, at her weight, she\u2019d get blown away by the wind. Her hands were so small that she simply couldn\u2019t hold her ravioli burger one handed. She had to hold it into the back and catapult herself into it, only occasionally coming up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauce was all over her face. I don\u2019t know if it was because she had just let out a nasty beer burp or if she was full, but Kate\u2019s breathing was ragged. It was clearly a struggle for her to keep up with us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, is little Katie-Kate gonna need a box?\u201d Donna teased from her couch, scarfing down her third burger with ease, \u201cYou\u2019re so widdle and cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2026 I can do it.\u201d Kate burped, \u201cI just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRRRRURAAAAP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere.\u201d Kate smiled stupidly, \u201cHad to make some room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess it was because I hadn\u2019t been home as often as I should have been. Ever since I\u2019d gotten my job, I\u2019d been out at odd hours and I hadn\u2019t really gotten the chance to <i>see</i> Kate lately. And\u2026 was it just my imagination or was she getting kinda fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, okay, yeah, she wasn\u2019t exactly a stick before. It was kind\u2019ve hard to keep weight off when you were three apples high like a Smurf. But she just looked heavier. Like, maybe ten pounds. Nothing like Donna\u2019s impressive gain at the hands of Amy, but enough for me\u2014a trained professional of pudge\u2014to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHERE!\u201d Kate stood from her chair in the living room, her belly knocking over the tv tray, \u201cI FUCKING TOLD YOU!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d never seen anyone so proud of finishing two burgers in my whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Kate, you\u2019re loud.\u201d Amy whined, \u201cWhy do you always get so competitive when you drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd loud.\u201d Donna chided<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said I couldn\u2019t do it!\u201d Kate bawked, \u201cBut I did!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud gurgle of pain as Kat\u2019s gut churned in agony. Her face\u2014flush with booze\u2014drained of its color as her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now I\u2019m gonna lay down.\u201d She announced shakily as she struggled up the stairs of our flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, it just left Amy Donna and I in the living room. I had an early shift the next day, so I was about ready to turn in. But I couldn\u2019t help shake the feeling that maybe Amy\u2019s campaign to turn Donna tubby had left some unseemly side-effects on our teensiest, weensiest roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019m just gonna say it.\u201d Donna burped as she plunged her hands in a bag of chips, \u201cIs it me, or is Kate getting fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and I looked at each other and shrugged.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So by <i>that</i> logic, fat people are less susceptible to hangovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalse, and <i><b>false.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up feeling like shit.  I mean, drinking a lot in our household was definitely a thing, but after Kate trudged off to bed, and Amy and Donna cleaned and smoked a fresh bowl, shit got real- <i>real fast</i>.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at some point we wanted to build a castle out of beer cans.  Except we only had about 15 empty cans.  So, through some witchcraft (IE sending Amy across the street to that frat house that happened to be run by a dude who totally was into fat chicks whenever he had more than two beers), we ended up with two 24-pack boxes of some generic beer brand that I can't be bothered remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>then</i>, at some point, Donna found the following items in her room:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A beer helmet that held four beers (graciously given to me)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A beer bong<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-More beer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  So anyways long story short we stayed up until like 6 AM and I <i>think</i> at some point that frat dude showed up and... Well, I don't wanna know what him and Amy hypothetically did, since I might have been shitfaced by 1 AM and- look, it doesn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, maybe I take back that first point about it taking more booze to get fat people drunk, because I'm not sure slamming approximately 10 beers before you feel buzzed is normal.  But I digress.  The point is, I woke up feeling like hot shit.  Judging by the uncomfortable sounding belches by my longest-know friend in the house, emanating from her own room, I was going to go ahead and say I wasn't the only one.  Although, oddly enough, I didn't feel the need to let out an alarmingly loud belch every several seconds.  I glanced at my phone- it was well beyond noon, which meant I hadn't really gotten what most people would call a \"proper\" amount of sleep, but I was awake and my head was pounding, so it was as good of a time as any to stagger out of bed.  I glanced down and noticed I had fallen asleep in my clothes, which seemed appropriate, given the debauchery that happened the night prior.  That being said, my shirt reeked of cheap beer, and I quickly disrobed and re-robed into more appropriate attire, IE more sweatpants and another \"loose\" top that only let a few inches of my fat gut peek out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited for the more aggressive hiccup-belches to stop before gently tiptoeing into Amy's room.  \"Rise and shine, sweet-stacks!\"  I said in my cheeriest voice, yet somehow still managed to sound like hot death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuggin... I...  Ugh....\"  Amy grumbled.  \"No words now.\"  I noted with some amount of satisfaction, a pair of boxers on the floor.  One point to my drunken mental abilities, I guess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no words now, Amy.  But Mel needs fatty foods.  Will you pitch in if I order some?\"  Amy stuck out her thumb horizontally.  \"I was just gonna get like, fifty bucks worth of McDonalds.\"  The thumb shot vertically.  \"Great.  Pay me back later, if you aren't dead by six.\"  The thumb flipped downwards as another bur rattled out from beneath the duvet.  \"Wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled toward's Donna's room, before stopping.  Donna was <i>solely</i> responsible for this hangover, I decided.  <i>She</i> was the one who brought out those foul torture devices designed only to heighten hangovers, not to mention the extra beer.  Fuck her, she can smell the McGriddles and suffer in peace.  Look, I'm not normally that vindictive but my head felt like approximately ten-thousand bees lived in it.  I went back to my room, fuzzily fumbled with my phone for about ten minutes- I swear to God at one point the GrubHub app actually said \"Seriously?  You want all this?\"  But I chalked it up to still being kinda drunk on top of being so hungover that I was hallucinating things.  Finally, I managed to get my order in.  Next on the list: water.  I wasn't normally a water lady, but ice water somehow sounded even better than the fifteen thousand calories of McDonalds I had just ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI staggered into the kitchen, only to spy a plate holding a small mountain of bacon, a half drank beer, and a very chipper looking Kate.  \"Sup?  You guys sounded like you were having fun last night... Especially Amy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI staggered over to the kitchen and set about getting a glass of ice water.  \"Kate, I'm gonna need you to take it down about... Oh, ninety-five percent, okay?  Also are you seriously drinking already?\"  I grumbled, making sure to sit far enough away from her to not smell the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like, almost five.  Did you <i>seriously</i> just get up?\"  She giggled, chomping down on a crispy strip of fried pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not <b>see</b> our monument?\"  I grumbled, sipping my ice water.  \"The <i>Castle de La Calories</i>?\"  I gestured towards the other table, only to see it empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean the fuck-ton of beer cans that I had to pick up this morning?  That were scattered around like Easter eggs, only not as fun because instead of candy, they just had shitty, tiny bits of backwashed beer?  Because yeah, Mel, that was a real monument to perfection, or whatever.\"  She was grinning, which I took as a good sign.  \"Seriously, you guys got <i>real</i> rowdy last night, though.  If I wasn't too stuffed to move, I would've come and yelled at you or something.  But instead, I just turned on my white noise and passed out, so, I mean, you're <i>welcome.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced at her, and winced as she chugged the rest of her beer.  She was wearing a tank-top and some running shorts, both of which definitely weren't new.  Her tummy pushed the hem of her tanktop up, and her tanned pooch pushed outwards.  The shorts were too tight on her as well, giving her both a muffin top and accentuating that her thighs had been hit with some calories as well. Now look, I'm pretty blunt normally.  When I'm hungover/still drunk, apparently I'm <i>super</i> blunt and also not very good at being impartial with my questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, you been eating well?\"  I asked.  \"I mean, I, uh... Just mean-\"  Kate grabbed for the final strips of bacon.  Wait, she seriously ate all that bacon already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not oblivious, okay?  I know I've gained a bit.  It's kinda hard not to, with Donna and Amy constantly demanding 10k calories per meal.  But, I-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate.  I'm sorry, that was a bad way of phrasing that.  I just- I mean, Donna's really... Blimped up.  And I wasn't sure if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate threw her hand up.  \"Mel, I-\" She began, but paused as our doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!  I forgot I ordered some food.  Um... Hold on, and we'll get right back to this, okay?\"  I stumbled off my chair and wobbled my way towards the door.  After a really awkward exchange with the dude, who I'm assuming assumed that I was going to eat all of this, I made my way back to the kitchen, only to find Kate...</span></div></div>",

Had I done it again? Like, seriously, what was it about me that just seemed to bring out everyone\u2019s inner glutton. Kate was supposed to be the enabler\u2014not the enablee. But the way that her cute little brown eyes zeroed on all that fast food, her face hungry and lusting after all that sweet greasy meat, I could hardly stay mad at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d I sighed, \u201cI mean, even <i>I</i> shouldn\u2019t have too much grease on my stomach after last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Kate wasn\u2019t even listening as she went ahead and pawed a quarter pounder from my cache of calories, \u201cMmm\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s bad for your hangover, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it were late in the afternoon, it was clear that Kate hadn\u2019t been any more productive than the rest of us. Standing there in her tank top and her yoga pants, I knew that she hadn\u2019t so much as been out of the house all day. Must have called out sick so she could take care of our drunk asses when we inevidably woke up. With the way that she dug into her burger, I would have thought she hadn\u2019t eaten since last night\u2026 but I knew better than to assume that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting a little heavy. I looked her up and down (when I could stand the light) for good measure. She was a little softer in the belly, but that\u2019s about it. At her small stature, I couldn\u2019t have placed her at more than maybe ten pounds heavier. But that\u2019s a slippery slope, especially when I\u2019m involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched my ittiest-bittiest roommate eat stuff burger down her throat, I idly pictured her a bit bigger. It was something that I (don\u2019t like to admit) that I do sometimes. I tried picturing her in fifty pounds, with a round belly and full chest. Her face curving into a cute little double chin and her cheeks all dimpled. Then I added another fifty, and another. Her double chin got deeper, her arms got all flabby. Her gut hung lower and lower out of her pants, forming into good ol\u2019 fashioned fat girl rolls\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could definitely see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate would make a great fatty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, lots of people would look good with a few extra pounds. But some of us (like me!) looked better the bigger we got\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what my boozehound of a flatmate would look like as a cute little landwhale\u2026?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only available at 8 in the morning...every...goddamn...semester. But I had to take it. I had to take THIS class. Because to graduate, I needed to take a physical education class. And all of them required exercise...except this one: Introduction to Exercise and Dietary Science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>I had a grumbling suspicion they only offered this class at 8 in the morning because they were trying to get me to exercise. My doubts only grew when I realized the building it was in was built in the 60s. The chairs were all the little crappy wooden foldy ones with the armrests you can't move on the sides. I had no where to sit, and I was  going to be surrounded by people enthusiastic about losing weight. I was in fat girl hell. I was lost adrift in a sea of uncomfortable wooden chairs that wouldn't fit my fat ass, and then someone threw me a life saver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Colleen was here, and she was waving at me. That was unexpected. As I lumbered down the steps, she stood up and grabbed her shit and dashed up to meet me half way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Funny seeing me here, am I right?\" I teased. I knew I was the fat girl in the diet class. I wasn't going to ignore it. Especially since it excited me a little. I found my thoughts drifting to maybe I should take my breakfast here and pig out during class, and it was a little hard to pay attention to what Collen was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Yeah. We seem to be bumping into each other a lot, neighbor.\" She teased back. \"You...probably need help with seating here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Uh...yeah, how did you know?\" I asked, caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"I mean, come on Mel--\" She said, gesturing at my, I guess you could call it my bulk. She had a point, but most people didn't bother thinking about the needs of a girl my size \"It's kind of obvious. But they're required to provide you with seating to accommodate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>My eyes went wide. This was amazing. I mean, sometimes at Buttercombe they'd let me sit at the teacher's desk if the teacher was nice (and wasn't fatter than me, like that bitch Ms. Knight), but I didn't know they were like, legally required to. This was a fat girl trick not even I knew! \"They are? How did you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"It uh, actually came up in one of my courses on weight loss. I'm kind of enthusiastic about my major, so I actually skipped intro until now and just dove right into some of the more advanced course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Sweet. That means you can help me figure all this stuff out, real easy, right?\" I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Yeah, sure. And maybe a few other things.\" She said. Her meaning was opaque, but she quickly explained my rights to the professor when he finally came in, and she even sat next to me right at the front of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Once it got started, it wasn't too bad. There wasn't a lecture about the dangers of eating too much, and the fire and brimstone that would befall on any of us sinners who gave in to the evils of obesity. In fact, looking around, I didn't seem to be the only fatty who was eager to get out of a gym class. The whole class looked portlier than most, it almost reminded me of my Buttercombe days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Once we went over the syllabus, the content of the first lecture was nicely abstract. Going over calories, and proteins, and what vitamins are. It was like Cellular Biology but way, WAY easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Then, at the end of class, the professor revealed the catch. This was a lab science class. There as a 'hands on' portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"This semester, you'll be splitting up into pairs as lab partners.\" He began. \"Together, you're going to monitor the diet and excercise of someone, every day, every single day for the rest of the semester, starting next week. So it should probably be one of you, just to make it simple. Whenever we learn a new metric of diet and fitness in this class, that will be added to what you have to monitor. You have to start next monday, so you have until then to pick out partners. You'll have to measure the subjects weight and body mass at the start of the week, and daily caloric intake every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Colleen reached over and poked me in the shoulder. \"Mel!\" She whispered loudly. \"We should totally be lab partners!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>Immediately I was on the defensive again. Here it came. Colleen was going to use this class to put me on a diet, and make me lose weight. \"I'm not really interested in trying to diet, Colleen.\" I said, firmly, and simply. I didn't owe her any reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"The prof didn't say anything about diet, Mel! He just said monitoring. And since we're neighbors it will be way easier to meet up and for me to come over and keep track of what you're doing! You wouldn't have to even do any of the work! I could just come over and keep track of your day!\" She was trying to sell this idea really, REALLY hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Why are you so excited for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Too uh...can I be totally honest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>\"It's really hard to get accurate data on the habits of girls your size. They're usually really shy about it. And measuring someone more...usual in their habits it's way beneath me, I can do that in my sleep. But you, you're...interesting?\" She said.

She was struggling to pull something over herself, like she had been naked when we rung the doorbell and had scattered to find something to make herself look decent. Even after she covered up her belly and (what I assumed was) her bra, I could still see every curve of her figure. More specifically, I could see the distinctive crease where her top tummy folded over the waistband of her sweats, and bulged out underneath. You'd think that the next thing that I noticed would have been her smiling, chubby face as she battled with her double chin. But no, it was her giant chest. Those massive mams of hers plopped to either side of her billowing gut from beneath her tie-dye t-shirt, hastily thrown on prior to our entry. Her hair was up and her cheeks were red. She must have been coming down those steps pretty fast\u2014she was sweating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Donna! Hi, welcome to... phew...\" she puffed, breathing visibly labored as she greeted us in a majority of the doorway, \"Come on... in! You must be,uh... Amy and Mel!\" Her grin faltered a bit, but she kept her pitch going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, far be it from me to say anything about another girl's weight, but <i>damn</i> if my prospective new roomie wasn't fat. Like, we're talking she could have been a Buttercombe alum and I would have gone along with it. It wasn't often that I found girls my size around campus (most girls my size tended to do online college!) but I'll be dipped if there wasn't three... (I don't know, she looked pretty tall...) <i>four hundred</i> pounds of woman standing in the doorway, popping out of her top! And as she led us inside, I was given a marvelous view of her big bubble butt, bobbing behind her. Between her and Amy, I was really starting to question just <i>how</i> straight I thought I was. I couldn't stop staring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is kind of the, I dunno, living room?\" Donna spread her wobbling wingspan, exhibiting a well-worn couch and a nice-ish tv set, as well as empty but stained styrofoam plates suggesting that we <i>may</i> have interrupted a little meal time, \"I mean, it's kinda the dining room too I guess. Kate and I eat in here a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you eat a lot.\" I said with a little chuckle, nudging Amy in her fatty flank, \"I think Amy and I can handle that. Don't you think so Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for sure.\" Amy touched her tummy with her fingertips, \"In fact, I think I might be a little peckish right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna clearly wasn't used to this level of body positivity from two girls who had <i>so much</i> body to be positive over. I didn't know if she was just shy or we were offputting (probably both) but she just sort've gave us this look. Like this, what the fuck are you doing, look. Like she was trying to discern whether or not the 800+ pounds of woman in her kitchen were calling her out for her weight. But once she saw that we were earnest enough, and we weren't picking on her, she lightened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's the case.\" Donna said with a wicked smile as she lead us by the bellies, \"Why don't we check out the kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the kitchen was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't exactly have a lot\u2014the rest of our house is kinda crap\u2014but I think we've got the biggest fridge that doesn't have to, like, be built into the wall.\" Donna said with no small amount of pride, \"Of course, with the way me and Kate eat, it doesn't stay very full for long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the fuck-huge fridge Donna showed us a gas range oven, one of those big kitchen sinks, a garbage disposal... they even had a dishwasher! I eagerly awaited the day that I no longer had to scrub my plates like some kind of animal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you better stock up.\" Amy blurted out, \"Cause if we move in, it's only gonna get even emptier even faster. I can promise you that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy opened the fridge (without asking!) and popped her head inside. She looked impressed, and when I glanced at her, I could see why\u2014the refrigerator was absolutely <i>filled</i> with beers, sodas, snacks, and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably good.\" Donna snorted, her double chin flexing and her chest bouncing, \"Because with the way Kate and I keep this place stocked up, I don't think y'all will have to ever worry about going hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that.\" I said slyly, swatting Amy on her fat ass as she dug around in the fridge, \"Soo... are we ever gonna meet this Kate person? Or do you keep her away so you don't scare potential roommates off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean yeah, if you want to meet her, you can totally meet her.\" Donna snorted again...</span></div></div>",

You know, grilling really. That is not what I saw, when I came outside. Kate had apparently constructed some kind of pinewood box in the backyard that was letting out lots of smoke as she dove into the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Donna called her up out of...whatever she was doing in there. \"Kate!

Her eyes lit up, and she stretched her arms out, \"Great to meet you!\" She was a hugger. That was cool, I like hugs. In fact, I believe I give the best hugs. She couldn't get her arms around me all the way, so her hands just reached to my rolls of backflab. And then...it was really quick, so I wasn't sure it happened, but did she give my back rolls a little squeeze at the end? Did that mean something? She seemed to enjoy her hug with Amy too. But maybe that was just her being a hugger still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think they're staying for lunch so...you think there'll be enough to go around?\" Donna asked, licking her lips. There was a nervous glint in her eye, I knew that look from Buttercombe. A fatty worried she'd be getting slightly less food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate poked Donna in her flabby belly. Again with the physical contact of fats. \"I think so, unless you're ready to eat a whole pig by yourself.\" She smiled. Two alarms went off loudly in my head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><span class=\"clred\">FEEDER ALERT FEEDER ALERT FEEDER ALERT.<br>\r\n</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And second, hold up a second...Did that bitch just mention a WHOLE PIG?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did you say a WHOLE PIG?\" I said, my hands bunching into fat little balls in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Take a look \" Kate said proudly. She threw open the pine box for us to see. The first thing that hit me was the incredibley intense smell of spices, smoke and pork, a smell so rich I could taste it in my mouth and it was divine. When the smoke cleared, sure enough there was a whole pig inside the box, being smoked over a bed of like, dead wet leaves or something, and covered in sauce and I wanted to reach out and grab some of it and oh god, Kate was reaching out and she pulled a bit of meat off the cheek of it and held it up to my mouth and without even thinking about it I opened up and she fed me by hand and it was so good. SO GOOD. It was the best piece of pork I ever tasted in my life, and I think I was crying. It was then that I knew...</span></div></div>",

In that moment, I knew.  I knew everything and I knew nothing.  My emotions were like a waterfall, cascading down thanks to gravity and wearing away at the hard rock that was my usual <i>cool and aloof</i> demeanor that everyone probably loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate.  I love you.\"  Wait, what?  Oh fuck, how did I say that?  How did I say that out loud to the woman I literally just met who literally was just being friendly and literally just gave me a piece of pig and fed it to me by hand.  Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.  I love you too?  I guess?  And also, nice to meet you for literally the first time?\"  Kate grinned.  My heart fluttered.  What was going on?  Was it the pork?  It was probably the pork.  Definitely, super definitely the pork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew I was blushing.  I wasn't one for blushing, usually, but I knew I was right now.  \"Can I- uh, have more of that pig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate shot me a grin (so fucking cute holy shit) that just screamed \"I am super confident and awesome and also I'm so good at cooking.\"  However, her mouth said something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no.  This pig ain't quite done.  I promise, there will be more than enough.  Although... Actually, now that I look at you, there might not be.  Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\"  Amy shouted, reminding me that other people actually existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's grin grew wider.  \"Are you serious?  This is like twenty pounds of meat.

When I realized what was going on- and it was <i>very</i> obvious, here, that Kate was a feeder- I had decided to outdo myself.  It was easy when there was \"Like twenty pounds\" of pig meat splayed out over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had gone whole hog- as had everyone else, save Kate- so I had doubled down on my gluttony.  Now, between the five of us, only a measly bowl of shredded pork remained.  Kate had thought ahead and packed away a handful of meat before we all dug in, so we didn't each ingest four pounds of meat- although I'm pretty sure I came close.  And now, I was about to push myself beyond the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Mel.  Like, I love to eat.  But don't do this.  Please...\"  Amy groaned from her seat- she had a few specks of BBQ sauce splattered against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kate.\"  I groaned.  She snapped to attention, her hand hovering above the table, like she was ready to lash out and feed me the damn pork herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out an alarmingly loud belch, which did nothing to aid my groaning gut.  \"If I... Finish this... Will you... Go on a date... With me?\"  Kate's eyes grew wide- and now it was <i>her</i> turn to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Mel, I will anyways.  You don't need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted my fork and began to eat.  I could tell everyone's eyes were on me, and I dug in with abandon- and I really lived up to the phrase, as every inch of me fought as I devoured the pork.  Finally, without realizing it- I was practically blind from how much I had eaten, which I assumed meant my stomach was so distended that it was surging into my eyeballs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was done.  Kate was in awe.  Hell, everyone was- even Amy had moved beyond her own gluttony long enough to be amazed by me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Think...\"  I whispered- every syllable hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think what?\"  Kate whispered back.  It was very intimate, despite three other woman being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Can't... Move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I would think you can't.  And that date is absolutely yours.\"  Kate mumbled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well you sure move fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly when I see something I want to eat.\u201d I swear to god, when I blurted that out, there was no double-entendre in my head. There was just the single-entendre; me making a cheap fat joke at my own expense. It was only when Kate started blushing, and Amy joined in with a juvenile \u201cooooooooooooh!\u201d sound that I realized how impossibly smooth I made that sound. I decided to pretend that\u2019s what I planned, and looked around desperately for someone to break the awkward silence.

Rather then any laughter, that only got a wince out of Kate and Donna, and a twinge of jealousy out of me. If only it were that easy for <b>me</b> to still gain 150 pounds in a year. I guess it was my turn to break the akward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Kate, where do you think we should go for our \u2018first date\u2019 together?\u201d Not exactly an inclusive topic of discussion, but it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was thinking about going to <i>les Troise Osieaux</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI whistled appreciatively. \u201cFancy!

I don't think Kate COULD get up to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only clothes I could see on her was this tiny yellowed tank top that she probably hadn't changed in a few days, covered in food stains, an it only really covered her <i>relatively</i> small breasts. It did nothing to cover the biggest belly I'd ever seen. while she lay there with one leg up on the sofa, she took up almost the whole couch, and her belly hung all the way down to the floor. It hid any underpants she was wearing, if any. I could honestly believe a girl that size might not be able to put on underpants anymore (or get them off). She didn't seem to notice us at first, and so I could just take a bit to stare and boggle at her. Despite everything else, what I found myself staring at was her face. It was inhumanly fat. Like, literally, I was having a hard time believing that was a person's face. Her cheeks were so puffy that they were beginning to envelope like, her lips and her ears and her eyes. She had a big double chin (obviously) but then her third chin was just like, a <i>roll</i>, it hung down way lower down onto her chest, and it looked like her shoulders were getting so big she was going swallow up her head. At the center of this mass of fat was a ridiculously tiny looking nose piercing. Her eyes, obscured by those big cheeks, were glassy as she stared into a laptop screen, propped on this little like, tray thing on the side of the couch for her, one pudgy hand covering up the mouse, the other dipping into a family sized bag of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Kate.\" Donna got her attention. Kate managed to make turning to look at us seem downright laborious. \"These are our new roommates. Er, prospective roommates. Hopefully still prospective?\" Donna asked. I realized what she was doing, she was trying to see if we wanted to back out now. Well, I didn't want anyone to ever be able to say that they were too fat for Melanie Carlyle, and honestly this place still looked great so I reassured her with a smile. \"Oh yeah, totally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amy meanwhile, was staring at Kate, slackjawed.

Amy had no idea what we were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh good.\" Donna said, happily looking obviously relieved.

A box of cookies had been turned inside out and I wasn't sure that there weren't gnaw marks on the cardboard.

Given how fast it had grown (evidenced by the tiger stripes of crimson stretch marks), it barely sagged even when Amy stood.  However, when she sat, her legs pushed it up higher, into her rib cage, where it in turn push her hefty knockers up to nearly her chin.  Her belly was so disproportionately large on her that I couldn't tell from the doorway whether she had underwear on beneath it.  Her crotch and hips were completely obscured by the rolling folds of her massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Sinclair asked today whether my delivery date was going to interfere with finals week.  That's right - she thought this was a baby.\"  She slapped her belly, sending jiggles across her body and through her cleavage.  \"But the best part is that no one corrected her or even looked surprised.

Just ravenously hungry or slightly less hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tears started welling up again.  \"So, this is my life now.

Or maybe that was because I went to the fattest Prep school in America\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint being, Kim\u2019s friends were some twiggy chicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the right (Robyn) was this short, angular looking girl. Long brown hair, tannish skin, and a t-shirt straight from the Juniors\u2019 section. Meanwhile the one on the left (Britney) was this cute little Asian petite, swimming in a stylish sweater/polo combo while she munched complacently on fries and played on her phone. Their friendship with Kim\u2014I took a shot in the dark at this point and guessed that she was the group\u2019s resident fat girl\u2014must have numbed them to the sight of people that had reached my super-sized proportions because they barely batted an eyelash between the two of them as I plopped down. They were friendly, don\u2019t get me wrong. It just wasn\u2019t\u2026 I kinda wanted their eyes to get all wide with surprise, y\u2019know? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d I smiled through my disappointment, comforted by the juicy sliders waiting for me on the plate closest to my belly, \u201cI\u2019m Mel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Robyn.\u201d The itty-bitty brunette said with a more genuine smile, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBritney.\u201d Said the sweater girl on the left said tersely as she tapped on her phone, \u201cSame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t seen girls so skinny in person, like, since I\u2019d left for Buttercombe way back in Middle School. The poor things had no idea what they were missing out on, being so little. How could they? It was a shame, really\u2014I blame the media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAssuming we manage to get along as well as we have been, I forsee you having to put up with her a <i>lot</i>.\u201d Kim gave a belly-laugh that made her gut quiver, \u201cSo play nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was pretty much it, I guess. It\u2019s always awkward when there\u2019s an elephant in the room\u2014especially when <i>you\u2019re</i> the elephant in the room\u2014but we managed to get along without too many awkward pauses.  I guess I could bore you with everything we talked about, but the truth was that it was just that boring getting to know you shit. Robyn was an Education Major, Britney was an Athletics Major, blah blah blah, they lived on the floor below us, wah wah wah, they all met at Orientation. There, you\u2019re officially all caught up to speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want the truth, I just sort of auto-piloted my way through the whole conversation thing. Not that I wasn\u2019t happy to have made some potential acquaintances, but the food just seemed far more interesting to me. I managed to scarf down more than a few entrees just floating in and out of the conversation, picking up just enough to convince Robyn that yes, I really <i>was</i> listening to her talk about all the cool stuff on campus that I had already been informed of about a billion times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t really start to pay attention until...</span></div></div>",

All of the food I had was actually pretty good; it didn't taste the same as Buttercombe fare, but I could easily see myself subsisting on this stuff for a few years. I was feeling sated, but not full. So, I prepared myself to heave my bulk up and said, \"I'm getting seconds. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment after I spoke, Robyn jumped up. \"I was planning on getting some seconds myself, Mel. I'll get some more food for you. Anything in particular you want?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little surprised, but decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth. I knew from personal experience that having someone else get your food for you was one of the best things ever. So, I responded, \"Uh, thanks. I'll have a little bit of everything.\" Kim snorted in the middle of taking a sip of her drink, spraying soda out of her nose. After making sure that she was okay, Robyn headed off to the buffet table with both of our trays. She returned a few minutes later with only one tray, overflowing with all of the good stuff I had sampled. She'd somehow managed to pack it with more food than I had managed, an impressive feat. I spent a few seconds staring at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" I turned to look at Robyn, who was looking nervous. \"I didn't get too much, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I snorted, and flashed her a grin. \"The answer to that question is always going to be no.\" Robyn smiled back at me, and took a seat. I briefly wondered why she hadn't gone back to get her own tray, since she claimed she'd been going to get seconds herself. But, then  I started digging in and I use all of my brainpower to focus on my feast. I like to pay attention to the nuances of flavor as I eat; if you're trying to discern the motives of someone you just met, then you're not devoting all of your brainpower to experiencing your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobyn got up one more time in the middle of my eating to get some seconds for Kim. She really could put away about as much as I could. I filed away the idea of challenging Kim to an eating contest later, then returned to stuffing my face. Finally, I'd cleared away everything on my tray and Kim had done the same on hers. I was painfully full, massaging my gut and trying to relieve some of the pressure I was feeling inside it. It was glorious. It looked like Kim was doing the same. Meanwhile, Robyn was looking at the two of us while Britney continued to tap away on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you gals anything else?\" Robyn asked. I had to think about it for a moment.</span></div></div>",

That might work, at least until she could waddle her way to the store, although Kim's ass was REALLY sinking into the bed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec, I'll dig up some shorts.\" I chirped.

The shorts in question, a pair of cerulean denim shorts, were loose for me. But Kim and I had starkly different builds. My butt and Kim's weren't even in the same league of size. But I already told her I would lend her some and I wanted to make a good impression in this very unusual situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding over the shorts to Kim, she swiftly accepted and began to kick off her old, ripped pair to the side. Revealing a large tear at the seam of her old pants \"Biggest pair I have Kim. Hopefully they'll do 'till we get you to the store...\" I sighed with a great deal of uncertainty. While I had just met Kim, I could sympathize with the struggles of too-small clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting ready to pull the shorts up her thick thighs,  Kim breathed in \"Here goes nothing.\" She then clutched the waist and heaved them up, bringing them up and along her tree trunk legs with little problem until it came time to squeeze her pillowy ass in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nrghh! Almost... got them...\" Kim grunted, tugging at the shorts profusely as all I could do was watch the spectacle of her orb of a stomach wobbling along with her meaty rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few minutes, she did it. She got them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell barely...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had managed to get them over her large bottom, but she looked extremely uncomfortable in them. Just looking at her slightly scrunched up face was a give-away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to take you to a clothes store? 'Cause no offense, they look like they're gonna explode off of your butt.\" I mumbled, just staring at the image of a pair of jiggly butt-cheeks being crammed in a denim prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim quickly nodded \"I would appreciate that a million times over Mel. Thank you. I know a great place nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that we both loaded up in my car and Kim gave me directions to the store she had in mind. She explained it was a local plus-sized tailor that she had frequented for a while, which near our campus luckily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn into Taylor Drive and we should be right in front of the place.\" Kim eagerly stated, probably thankful to get out of her temporary threads and into some proper sized clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her directions, I turned right and drove along a narrow road to a storefront that read 'Eloquii' by the the double-doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the place!\" Kim exclaimed as I went to park the car in a space just in front of the store to minimize the walking distance. Mainly out of laziness but also so Kim's shorts don't give up while she shuffles in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking our way in the place and having a scan of the stock, I could work out that Kim would certainly find clothes that fit in here judging by the tent sized tees and the yard long sweatpants on display. Hell, I could probably find some shirts to contain my blubber sack of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of browsing...</span></div></div>",

Even though she'd probably stretched them something terrible. That left me to have a browse of Eloquii's selection of clothes in the mean time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told I was actually quite impressed. They had your typical fat people garbs, muumuus, sweatpants that could be used as a bed sheet, but I also saw what was basically medium-sized clothes you would find in any Kmart or other stores, just super sized! Jeans that were practically wider than curtains and tent-sized shirts were hung on display. Prices were fairly low to my surprise for non-designer ware. I'm only going to get bigger, so I'll definitely will be coming back here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done admiring the decent and in some cases, lovely clothes. I made my way to the front desk to see Kim chatting with the clerk. \"Hey Kim!\" I called while waving my chubby hand. \"Got those pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded with a smile. \"Yep check these out!\" She pulled the waistband to her new XXX-L sweatpants she was clad in to emphasize how spacious they were. \"Here's the pair ya lent me. I owe you big Mel, thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No biggie. What are roomies for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young clerk, who was a short, curvy raven-haired woman interjected. \"This your new friend then Kim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim whipped her head to the side, her doughy cheeks supporting a slight wobble. \"Oh yeah. Mel this is Emma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI extended a plump hand to her. \"Hey. You and Kim friends?\" I inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's face broke in a full grin. \"Yeah, practically BFFs with how frequently she comes in needing new clothes with how big she is.\" She explained while shaking my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes to me, Kim let a small belly laugh. \"You'll come to find that folks around her are pretty judgment-free when it comes to girls like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how those two were bantering off each other, I could of sworn Emma and Kim were childhood friends. Kim then got her bag full of spare clothes and was getting ready to waddle her out the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can do you for you then Mel?\" Emma asked in a eager to please way. Stroking my large belly for a second, I responded. \"Not today. But I will need clothes at some point. I'll catch you later.\" Bidding the clerk farewell, Kim and I made our way over to my car and buckled in. After fighting with the seat belts, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore turning the Key to start the engine. My stomach let out a heavy rumble. In all the commotion of Kim's shorts I guess that made me work up an appetite..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we grab something to eat? I'll pay for you driving me here\" Kim giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed however. \"I'd love to, but we still have our stuff to unpack.\" The notion of emptying my cases well into the evening was something I couldn't be bothered with doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shrugged. \"It can wait, we'll be an hour tops.

But trust me, it isn\u2019t something that I say lightly. My roommate was, hands down, one of the biggest girls I had ever seen; myself included. She was my height, my age, my <i>everything</i>, just\u2026 bigger and fatter than I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I should have probably noticed something was amiss when the floor started rattling and my belly started quivering in rhythm to small, mostly-controlled quakes that tremored down the hall. But by the time I realized that someone HUGE was coming my way, it was too late. The door opened to reveal this huge gut peeking out from underneath some poor understaffed t-shirt. The band logo painted across this broad gut was distorted beyond legibility thanks to two meaty melons and a gut that practically rammed the door down. I was so alarmed that I wriggled my way to a seated (mostly) position and watched as this big blimp struggled to fit herself in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little\u2026 huff huff\u2026 help?\u201d she whimpered, \u201cI think I\u2019m\u2026 think I\u2019m stuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened incredulously as I rocked myself to a standing position. Slowly but surely, I found myself on my feet as I waddled over to the doorway to face my new roommate head-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had big blue eyes, framed by thick-rimmed glasses, and a stylish undercut that really served to slim down her face (as much as possible, anyway). Her hands were chubby and her fingers sausage-like as I wrapped my own around them, pulling fruitlessly on her superior swollenness\u2014and then I realized the issue\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was <i>huge</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike\u2026 stuck in the doorway huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lots of pulling and burning far too many calories, we eventually managed to pry her out of the doorframe. I silently wondered if this was what it was like for other people to see <i>me</i>\u2014just a regular old fat girl. But this girl, she was a <i>blimp.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we\u2019d gotten her unstuck, the heifer turned to me and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was jealousy, awe, a strong-yet-restricted feeling of lust and curiosity. So many questions, I didn't know where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her question about food was easy to home in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm starving. I think the dining hall is open.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d She spotted the free bed and plopped herself onto it. I swear I could hear the splintering of wood. \u201cI'm not walking any more for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had missed that she had a book bag slung over her shoulder, because her torso was so wide that rather than let the bag rest against her hip it was tucked between her arm and the rolls of fat along her side. She pulled an iPad out of it, a deluxe model, and turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of Chinese food do you like?\u201d she asked. I wondered if having food delivered to the dorm was really more convenient than just walking to the dining hall 50 feet away. She'd have to get off her feet either way, going down to collect the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, I had enough spending cash to chip in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I really love sweet and sour pork,\u201d I began, \u201cAlso mushroom chicken, sesame chicken, pork fried rice, pork buns, General Tso's, Beijing beef, walnut shrimp. Any of that is good. Do you not even want to unpack first?\u201d It was then that I noticed she didn't have any boxes or bags with her, except the one for her iPad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnpacking can wait. My clothes aren't going anywhere. But I'm hungry now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim spent so much time tapping I started to think she was ordering some of everything I had listed. Or maybe she was getting plenty for herself. I wondered how big her appetite must be; how long could she sit at a table and gorge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she ordered, a few men dressed like butlers came in and out of the room, depositing boxes marked 'Clothes' or 'Computer.' The way they silently acknowledged Kim's presence, and she theirs, implied they were servants of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was wondering about this development Kim, eyes still fixed to her iPad, asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what do you like on your pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm ordering some pizzas. What kind of toppings do you like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was off-center again, but sitting there staring at her made me look stupid, so I answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHam, definitely, but also mushrooms and red onions and pepperoni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tapping, then Kim put her iPad away. She looked at me, suddenly startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't introduce myself, did I? I'm Kim Privette.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel Carlyle,\u201d I responded, something tweaking my brain. \u201cPrivette? Isn't there a bank with that name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's my father's company. One of them, at least.\u201d She shrugged, not embarrassed in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess you guys are rich.\u201d I mentally smacked myself. I must have sounded like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are. I can't deny it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis raised more questions, but before I could continue someone stood in the doorway.</span></div></div>",

My ass was parked on top of two chairs and because of my belly I was sitting a little far from the desk. My flab began to rhythmically wobble before I noticed the all too familiar quakes on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" I closed my laptop and slowly stared the arduos process of getting my fatass up.

I swear it was a little smaller this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes before grabing her hands.

At least I could use my weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Mel stop!\" she yells at me. I let go and stumble backwards, I barely managed to grab the door.

Kim let me take whatever I wanted; she wasn't greedy with her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were halfway down into the box when a man knocked on our (still open) door. He had a stack of a dozen pizzas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here,\u201d Kim waved her hand. Passing the box of treats to me, she held out her blubbery arms like a needy baby. She put the stack down on the floor in front of her, signed the receipt for the delivery man, and then checked the first pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHam and mushrooms. Here.\u201d She handed the pizza to me, then checked the second one. It was sausage and red peppers. Placing it on her stomach, she picked up a slice and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't know the delivery guys came right to your door,\u201d I said, tentatively taking a slice of my pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo talking. Eating.\u201d She was curt but not rude; I learned quickly this was her normal mode with food. If there was something in front of her, she was eating, and doing nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly she didn't want to do anything else. She ate so ravenously, going through two bites for every one of mine. When one pizza was done, she placed the empty box on the ground and found another one. The delivery man came back shortly with a few 2-liters of soda; Kim grabbed one of them and chugged straight from the bottle, emptying half of it in one go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese delivery came a few minutes later, several bags filled with quarts of rice and entrees (and more soda). Kim did the same thing with the Chinese that she did with the pizza, checking each carton and handing me what was mine or devouring what was hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast went on for an hour, my belly happily swelling until it reached its limits. I had to slow down as I ate, but Kim was still going strong. When I had to finally yield, too bloated to eat another bite, Kim unceremoniously claimed my share for herself.

When me and Alice were kids, I always looked out for her and we did almost everything together. Even after I went to private school, she waited up for me every Christmas break and every Summer. So yeah, we're pretty close. It really helps that she's probably the only one besides Dad who's never hassled me about my weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since I got home though, we've been pretty much inseperable. I parked my fat ass on the couch on Night One and ordered four large pizzas for myself it's been nothing but Netflix marathons and a steady diet of your standard Millenial hiked up to about a billion with my favorite little sister, and it's pretty much been the best week of my life. You could call it making up for lost time, but the truth is that I'm lazy and deep down I know that Alice is too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom might not like how much time she spends with me\u2014something about me being a \"bad influence\"\u2014but that didn't stop us from knocking out Dexter in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you can probably guess, a week of nothing but pizza and flash-frozen food products does an awful lot in the ways of a girls' waistline. Especially when it's in abundance. I'm wearing my fat pajamas, which I was pretty much exclusively wearing before I got home anyway since they were the only things that fit me comfortably starting two weeks ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy belly is warm and full as it sits lazily on top of my fat, bloated thighs. It's full of leftovers from last night, and breakfast from this morning. Dad made a run to Krispy Kreme for his two favorite girls, and I may or may not have taken the lion's share of the donuts. I burp, rubbing the flanks of my distended stomach with round, chubby hands in an attempt to ease the digestion of my sizeable snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must look like a mess; half-dressed with my gut hanging out, no bra, too-tight pajama pants and my hair looking like a mop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, it's Summer, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mel?\" came the sweet voice of my little sister from the kitchen, \"Did you eat all the donuts that Daddy brought us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" I burp unconvincingly into my hand, my cheeks inflating with the distinct scent of pepperoni and apple fritter, \"Did you look in the box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, my little sister, comes into the room holding the empty box. Her own jammies are looking pretty snug around that little potbelly she's been growing since Christmas. I guess maybe the poor thing <i>does</i> spend too much time around me. I know this might sound terrible, but ever since Alice started putting on weight we've never been closer. It kind of helps that she's been a total slug lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" she hooked her eyebrow playfully and put her hand on her hip in a stealthy impression of Mom, \"Forgive me if I don't exactly believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're forgiven.\" we both laugh as she heads back into the kitchen...</span></div></div>",

The lottery ticket I'd bought had been crammed down between all the snacks, and now that they were gone, I could see the cheesy black and yellow graphic on the scratch off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" I pick it up out of the bag, \"Hey squirt, do you still have the change from breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Alice's cheeks were inflated with donut stick, and her lips were dotted with glazing, \"Yeah, shure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped all of thirty seven cents into my chubby hand. I picked out a penny and let the rest fall into my console. I placed the lottery ticket on the steering wheel and leaned in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEEEEEEEEEP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nearly jumped out of her seat, and she dropped her wrapping paper into the passenger side floorboard of my car. My gut was so big that I couldn't actually lean any further in than I already was, or I'd honk the horn with the my upper belly. Which was, admittedly, a pretty big turn on. Just the thought of me not fitting into this old car anymore was enough to get me a little... distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" Alice yelped, breaking me from my trance<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu-what?\" I snapped back to attention, \"I was, um, trying to scratch this lotto ticket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a lottery ticket?\" Alice asked, seemingly amazed by the mere prospect of it, \"Won't... won't Mom be mad? You know how she feels about...\" she gulped, \"Gambling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but like I said, she's <i>always</i> mad at me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to put the ticket on the middle console beside me, leaning over and folding my side-fat into three distinct tiers of flabby rolls. I wasn't used to such feats of athleticism, and the position was incredibly uncomfortable. But I managed to scratch off all the little squares on my ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you know if you've won?\" Alice asked innocently, wiping off her mouth, \"All I see are a bunch of numbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got three 7's, so I know we won something!\" I said proudly, \"So now we see what three 7's gets you...\"</span></div></div>",

It was a fun mental image for me, alright? But I'm realistic, and even by 'erotic fantasy' standards, I knew that one was never gonna happen. I never doubted my ability to get fat as hell, but I also knew it would probably be a pretty glamor-free BLUE-COLLAR fatass life for me. I'd accepted that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut NOW? I was RICH!

I just...look, I KNOW you're excited to finally be able to eat as much as you want with NO concern for being able to to pay the bill, or finding somebody else willing to pay the bill, or whatever. I understand. And a million dollars is a ton of money, but it's not INFINITE. I just don't want you to end up being one of those lottery winners who blows all their money and ends up in debt. I don't want you to waste it and have nothing to show for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off Alice, I guarantee I will have PLENTY to show for it...\" I paused to jiggle my belly for emphasis, but realizing that it was already too full to jiggle properly, I just drummed on it meaningfully \"...and as long as it adds PLENTY to my waist, it won't have been a WASTE.

Winning that lotto ticket was a once in a lifetime opportunity, which I then used to beget <i>another</i> once in a lifetime opportunity\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHillary Heart tickets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my God, <i>right</i>?! I was so excited when I saw that she had started touring again\u2014it had been <i>so</i> long since I picked up her first (and only) album. Heartbreaker was unstoppable back when I was in middle school. For real, I played that CD so much that I actually wore it out. I took it to Buttercombe with me and blared it through four years, pretty much making it my unofficial soundtrack, along with the sounds of my incessant eating and various furniture creaking beneath me. Her songs were\u2014are!\u2014so beautiful, and they inspired me to be true to myself. I firmly believe that, if it weren\u2019t for Hillary Heart telling me that she wanted me to Be All I Could Be, I wouldn\u2019t be the great big wonderful whale I eventually turned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, long story short, I was just lounging around in my jammies (like all us massive millionaires are wont to do) when Alice looked over at her new laptop (courtesy of yours truly, since Mom raised the poor girl as a Luddite) and saw an ad on one of those trashy gossip sites that the HilHeart was coming back to the States after more than, like, half a decade. I flipped my shit, rolled off the couch, and bought two tickets right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you blame me? My childhood idol comes within, like, an hour of my hometown <i>and</i> I had enough money to buy out the whole stadium if I wanted to?

Seriously, I was still in that \u201cobvious\u201d form of lotto-winnery, and I\u2019m pretty sure that everybody knew it. On top of the rented stretch Hummer, I had probably already packed on another twenty pounds just from eating out as much as I wanted, as often as I wanted. Which made it super hard to fit into the concert clothes that I had bought a few weeks in advance of the event\u2014making this probably the <i>only</i> time in my life that I was upset to outgrow clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped out of the car, causing the whole thing to tilt slightly to my side with all my weight gathered in one place. When I managed to heave my fat ass out of the seats, it actually groaned in relief. My body wouldn\u2019t stop wobbling as I poured myself onto the pavement, shaking and jostling itself free of the tight Hot Topic tee that had begun to fail in covering me. It wrapped all the way around me, sure. But it was so constricting, and it cut into my tummy really noticeably around the waist. The shirt was made for girls about my size, and who happened to be Hillary Heart fans, but it didn\u2019t seem to be up to the challenge of covering up my big fat tits <i>and</i> my big fat gut. The pink heart logo was stretched and distorted with all my titflesh, the outline of my bra very visible due to the pressure I put it under. The collar felt so tight around my neck and chins that I constantly kept adjusting it, which meant that I caused the hem to ride up on either one of my lovehandles. I\u2019d tucked my gut into the waistband of my reinforced, custom-ordered jeans, but I doubted they would really last the night. One good meal in those, and I just knew that the button would give out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice came tumbling out after me, dressed surprisingly casual for the first time in, like, ever. She was wearing one of my old tees from like <i>Sophomore year</i> at Buttercombe, the one she and Mom got me for Christmas. Naturally, I had outgrown it by the time Christmas rolled around, but it looked to fit Alice pretty well. Her long blonde hair curled over the shoulders, and the sleeves cut a little into her soft arms. Actually, it looked a little tight. Hanging out with me, and all my money, had already started to make my poor little sister a little chunky. But she looked good, dressed like a skinny mini-me\u2014I almost believed she was a normal teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we jiggled our way onto the sidewalk up to the convention center, the stretch pulled out behind us and went to park\u2014it\u2019d be back by the time the show was over. It\u2019s not like I was planning on going anywhere; I wasn\u2019t going to miss a <i>minute</i> of my time with my teenaged girl crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 um\u2026 where do we go from here?\u201d Alice whimpered, unaccustomed to life after dark like I was, \u201cWhat do the tickets say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell squirt, we go up there, flash our tickets, and then we go get our front-row seats!\u201d I said excitedly, my tummy gurgling in agreement, \u201cScratch that\u2014go up there, flash tickets, <i>grab some snacks</i> and then we get our seats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached into my purse\u2014I\u2019d broken out my old pink-and-black bedazzled one from eighth grade just for the occasion\u2014and whipped out our tickets. I gave them to Alice, considering that in all likelihood she\u2019d be the first one to reach the hub area, and started puttering forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me just say that it should have been <i>really</i> obvious how much I was looking forward to this show by the fact that I was <i>walking</i>. Like, up steps and everything. My slow, pathetic waddle was only slower and pathetic-ier by the fact that I hadn\u2019t done shit in about a month. I\u2019d spent the past few weeks lounging around being big and beautiful, stuffing my face with anything I could get my hands on or pay people to get my hands on for me, pretty much making me as slow and useless as could be. I would have been embarrassed if I weren\u2019t so into that. And it would have made me horny if it didn\u2019t <i>also</i> make me incredibly tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice pretty much just walked at a modest pace (her little lovehandles making her own top ride up in the back) and did exactly like I told her. She went up to the guy, showed him we had tickets\u2014probably with lots of stutterings and ums because, y\u2019know, it\u2019s Alice\u2014and then walked right back to me before I was even halfway between where we\u2019d been dropped off and the ticket house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe says we\u2019re clear to go through.\u201d Alice said brightly, \u201cWe just need to get some wristbands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool.\u201d I puffed, \u201cYou\u2026 You \u2018xcited?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah! I am!\u201d Alice smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s my first concert, and Mother\u2019s even letting me go without getting mad at me. How could I not be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd yer\u2026 phew\u2026\u201d I wheezed, my entire body from my chins down rippling as I struggled to heave myself around, \u201cYou\u2019re with yer\u2026 super cool\u2026 big sister\u2026 right, Al?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Alice said sweetly as she wrapped her arm around one of my skinny-girl\u2019s-waist-thick upper arms, probably getting a little damp in the process, \u201cYou\u2019re the best big sister ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 know it.\u201d I puffed, plodding along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two of us waddled along, passing through the archway and actually getting inside the stadium\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I didn\u2019t realize it <i>immediately</i> because I was sort of preoccupied with lugging all my largeness around. I was too out of breath to really think straight for the long (long long <i>long</i>) walk that I hadn\u2019t entirely been expecting to seem uncharacteristically quiet. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until I made it all the way to the little metal gate where the security guard stood to check my ticket and wristband that I realized we had gotten in <i>entirely</i> too easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I\u2019d caught my breath, I looked out into the seating area. It was this ocean of hard, uncomfortable looking plastic green seats that stared lifelessly back at me, twinged silver by the trim and armrests that shone slightly in the vibrant blue lighting. Even the mosh pit, where you had to (ugh) stand the whole time was empty. <i>Nobody</i> had shown up to the concert except for me and Alice, and I\u2019d waddled away the minutes until it was just ten minutes til showtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Mel?\u201d Alice whispered, as if not to offend the guard, \u201cWhere are all the people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this be?! Hillary Heart was like\u2026 was like\u2026 the <i>Madonna</i> of my generation. I mean, she only had ten songs out, but they were <i>so</i> good! Who cared if it took her seven years to come out with a new one? They were worth every year and change! At least they were to me, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d I puffed, \u201cUghh\u2026 come on, let\u2019s go get our seats\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the two of us got our wristbands (mine was tight enough to cut into my fat every time I bent my wrist) and started shimmying through the empty seats, looking for our designated spots in the empty auditorium. My underbelly, tucked beneath my jeans, brushed against the back of the chairs as it oozed over into what would have been someone\u2019s personal space. My ass was so fat that I could feel the chairs <i>behind</i> me scraping against it. Seriously, if I wasn\u2019t so confused, this would have been a <i>perfect</i> time for some immodest abuse of my generous size. But, since I was so distraught, I decided to just get to my seat and plop down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA-24 was near enough to the center of the row that I didn\u2019t care to bitch. But I actually wound up taking up both of A-24 <i>and</i> A-25, with some room to spare. My ass had been growing non-stop lately, and it didn\u2019t look like the disinterested security guard was going to say anything about me taking up somebody else\u2019s seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, where <i>was</i> everyone? I know I didn\u2019t accidentally spent half my million buying out the auditorium like I\u2019d joked about doing. Why was it just me and Alice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we sat there for a minute, both a little huffy and puffy from all the walking we weren\u2019t used to, Alice and I quietly speculated the suspicious lack of spectators amongst ourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re all together?\u201d Alice whispered behind her hand, \u201cLike some kind of fan club?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would have known if there was a fan club.\u201d I whispered back, \u201cAnd they would have been here hours ago\u2014it\u2019s almost showtime, why are we still the only ones here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe waited. And we waited. And we waited. I had never been so anxious to share something like this with a screaming crowd before in my life, and nobody was showing up. Which was weird because, when she went on her hiatus, Hillary Heart had a pretty decent sized following back here in the States. I mean, just because my old friends from middle school weren\u2019t as obsessive as I was didn\u2019t mean her music wasn\u2019t <i>good</i>.

The completely silent auditorium echoed with the booming announcement of her triumphant return, and yet only Alice and I were there to cheer for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real kicker was that not only could I see her down on the stage, I could make out every second of heartbreak in Hi-Def on the big screens that hung above the railings. Her perfect, freckled face fell miles to the floor as her brown eyes watered pitifully. She just looked around, confused at first but eventually she just sort of settled into an intense sort of visible sadness. Her eyes glistened in the lighting\u2014I could swear she was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn\u2019t stop me and Alice from giving her the greeting she deserved. I used more energy cheering her on\u2014waving my fat arms and shaking my enormous tits\u2014than I had in months. Our voices carried through the bleachers, replacing the dying echo of Hillary\u2019s booming voice. We cheered for probably a minute straight before I finally got tired, nestling back into the tight confines of my seat(s), panting and wheezing up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t look to have done much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026\u201d the British pop (former) idol\u2019s voice cracked audibly as she spoke into the microphone, storming up to the edge of the stage as if to get a better look at her biggest fans, \u201cAre you the only ones who showed up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Um\u2026no?\u201d Alice hollered down, \u201cThey\u2019re, uh\u2026 in the\u2026 um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are!\u201d Hillary\u2019s face curled up, her lips stretching into the biggest frown I\u2019d ever seen in person as tears rolled down her cheeks, \u201cWh\u2026Why didn\u2019t anyone show up?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really didn\u2019t figure that to be a rhetorical question, but it may as well have been. She bolted off the stage, sobbing so loud that she didn\u2019t need the microphone for us to hear her bawling all the way back to her trailer. Alice and I just sort of sat there, exchanging awkward glances of equal parts pity and sadness over the fate of my fallen idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould we\u2026 should we do something?\u201d Alice finally spoke up, her chubby cheeks flush with embarrassment, \u201cI feel pretty bad for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d I said, still a little winded from flailing my fat limbs around, \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be the <i>only</i> ones to show up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and I debated silently on whether or not to get involved.

With Alice tagging along behind me, apologizing to Not-Steve quietly, I stepped up to the door so closely that I could have used my belly as a battering ram if I needed to. I rose one flabby arm and knocked as gingerly as I could on the crappy hollow door.

You looked pretty down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>We</i>?

So my sister and I, we\u2026 wanted to come cheer you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Hillary huffed and leaned against the doorway, sniffling down snot as she wiped her eyes with the back of a thoroughly mascara soaked hand. She crossed her arms defensively against us, lowering her head down slightly as she stood there, battling my belly for space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t rightfully see how that\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d she harrumphed, \u201cBut that is awfully sweet\u2026 and, let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019ve got about four hours to kill, don\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my very best not to smile at that\u2014it would have made me seem like a terrible, awful human being\u2014but I couldn\u2019t exactly help it.

There was one right off the interstate we had to take to get home, so it seemed like a natural choice. Me, Alice, and Hillary friggin\u2019 Heart piled into the back of my rent-a-limo and sputtered off towards the Awful Waffle\u2014singing her songs from <i>Heartbreaker</i> along the way to help cheer her up. So fucking cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother so fucking cool moment? I got to roll up to Waffle House in a stretch Hummer limo. Seriously, try it sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so we went inside and scored ourselves a table by the window (I had <i>long</i> known that this particular chain of restaurants\u2019 booths were not Mel-Friendly) and went right to work. It was a pretty dead night\u2014just a few interchangeable rednecks spitter-spattered here and there, but it wasn\u2019t late enough for the weirdos to start showing up\u2014so we were seen pretty quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have three All-Star Breakfasts.\u201d I said confidently to our waitress, \u201cOne with bacon, one with sausage, and one with ham.

I\u2019m kinda hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I gave a superior pat to my gut as it beached itself on the table in front of me. Our server\u2019s eyes looked like they were going to pop out of her head as I smirked proudly at my massive order. When I asked for a Diet Coke at the end, I thought she was going to lose it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just have the Texas Chicken Melt\u2026 no onions please?\u201d Chubby little Alice said softly, \u201cAnd, um\u2026 c-can I also get a waffle with that? I kind\u2019ve want a waffle now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to Hillary, who seemed hardly phased by my ridiculous order. In fact, she seemed to be off in her own little world. I couldn\u2019t tell if she was staring at the menu trying to figure out what to get, silently judging my sister and I for being such fatties, or if she was still getting over her no-show of an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got my answer when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It kind of both hit us at once. There were a lot of fat people here. A Lot. Everything from chubby bunnies to massive whales, all shuffling about carrying piles of vendor trash food for which....there were also a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRows upon rows of the most fattening greasy sugary country fair bumpkin fast food lined the stadium walls. This place was HEAVEN. Or Hell for mother. But all the same to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this...normal?\" Alice paused, scratching her neck as we both waddled through a throng of swollen concert goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I remember..Might just be the place..\" I puffed. God everything looked so good. And everyone looked like they were enjoying it! Multiple chins jiggled and chewed, lines of fatties wobbled as they waited their turn for funnel cakes. There were multiple people leaning against pillars and walls rubbing overstuffed guts, already having their fill before the music even started. If this was what Heart concerts were going to be like from now on I just might have to follow her entire tour! \"Come on...let's stock up..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time to spare, Alice and I went to work. Corn dogs, pizza slices, fried ores, funnel cakes, you name it. My sister and I piled it high. Waddling with a leaning tower of fattening foods we eventually met back in the middle where we admired each others respective haul. Obviously mine was bigger, Alice had held back as usual. But I was determined to make a fatty out of her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go find out seats.\" Alice beckoned, her arms stuffed with food and drink as we made our way with the crowd. Step, by step, by step. This was exhausting! My desire for front row seats was suddenly being tempered by the knowledge that I had to WALK there, carrying about 20 pounds of food, being tugged along by my sister a quarter of my size. After what seemed like an eternity of endless walking I suddenly felt Alice elbow me in the gut. \"Mel...check out these seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUuuuuggghhh...I had a feeling what I was supposed to be looking at. For a long time now my ass had been inflating like a hot air balloon. And seating had become a...challenge. Sometimes I needed two chairs, sometimes I needed a bench, and suddenly I was realizing that I probably should have bought three tickets. One for my sister, and one for each of my cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet...to my shock and surprise...they were massive. At least for concert seats. Easily enough to seat me with some space, Alice was rolling around in space and comfort in the massive chair. So much so we sat all the food between us in the space she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, THAT problem solved, we both started munching as the show rolled on eager to finally see the main attraction.. As the lights dimmed a voice rang over the loudspeakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello loves\u2014it\u2019s been far, far too long!</i> a familiar voice came over the P.A. system.

It was a present from my Dad and I loved it and I'll never forgive that bitch Rachel Elvers for getting mustard all over it. It was a picture of Hillary Heart, circa my seventh grade year, laying sensually on top of two neon H's, enclosed in a bright pink neon heart. She was all decked out in her best Euro-punk gear, with her long beautiful red hair and her freckles all photo-shopped and prominent. I remember she had on a tie and it dangled over the little x between the H's. She was what a lot of people would have considered beautiful\u2014and the reason I bugged my Mom for two years straight to let me dye my hair red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman on the stage, slowly being unveiled by the collapsing curtains, was decidedly not the same girl that I remembered from my bedroom or dorm. In fact, she may have been three...<i>four</i> times the woman that I remembered from my first concert experience!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright lights outlined her shape spectacularly, her mighty weight eclipsing her from the crowd. She was <i>big</i>\u2014maybe bigger than I was. She was vaguely spherical in shape, with the distinction of two definitive bulges on either side of her, just below her head, that were no doubt her legendary breasts. Surely enough as the lights dimmed and more of her could be looked at directly, Hillary Heart's heaving hooters of her youth had absolutely exploded into two massive milky mams, speckled with freckles and resting on either side of an impressively immense gut. It rested against her pillowy thighs and folded into two very distinct tiers as it sagged under its incredible weight. She took a slow, thundering step forward and it caught against her knee, wobbling and rippling with the impact. Her legs alone may have been as wide around as Alice was... or rather, Alice had been before I got a hold of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so confused! I looked into the multiply-chinned face of my enormous idol as she smiled and waved at the crowd, her armwings rippling and wobbling with the motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat couldn't have been...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely it wasn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it <i>was!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't, um...\" Alice bit her bottom lip, \"I don't remember her looking like that on your poster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-She didn't!\" I blinked, staring my big beautiful idol up and down, up and down over and over in hopes of registering what had happened, \"I guess I wasn't the only one who went and got fat after seven years, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, that really did a bit to explain the sudden surge of fatass fans in the crowd. Myself excluded, we were a rather <i>large</i> group, and I couldn't quite place why. When I was in middle school, <i>everyone</i> liked Hillary Heart. I mean, some of us did. My friends and I did. But we weren't all fat (at least, I wasn't. Not then, anyway). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't like I was upset or anything. Seriously, no, go Hillary! But how had something like this slipped through my fingers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad I missed something? </span></div></div>",

It squished against the cold glass of the window as I sandwiched myself into the booth, waiting for Alice to return with our greasy brunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order up.\" Alice said excitedly as she placed the tray down on the table...</span></div></div>",

Bacon, beef, cheese, empty carbs and grease-- the five major food groups of every fat girl's breakfast all sandwiched into a burger the size of my chubby fist. I've basically been living like this ever since I got home from Buttercombe, and it's been great. They had really nice, fancy food for every meal. But you can't beat an old-fashioned American burger straight from the King himself. But as much as I love me a good cheeseburger, I love my sister more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil said sister encroaches on said cheeseburger. Then things get a little complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, I'm not <i>anyone</i> to criticize anyone's eating habits. Mine are atrocious. But then again, I'm actively trying to put on as much weigh as possible by cramming food into my stomach in an efficient time so I can get back to eating sooner. I've gone whole hog many a time in public places. There are times (more than I'd like to admit) that I've lost myself in gluttony, eyes glazed over and everything while I ate just about anything within line of sight. And that's totally cool because it's (usually) my food that I'm eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when my sixteen year old sister is doing it, it looks a little strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, my eating habits may have rubbed off on Alice just a little bit since about Christmas or so. And yeah, she might have put on a little weight since then. But I'd been home for about a week, and I'd never seen Alice just... stuff food into her mouth like that. Her little pink lips separated and she just started shoving food into her mouth like a regular pro, never really stopping and picking up momentum on the way! Pretty soon she was halfway done with her own rations..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and <i>that's</i> when she tried to make a grab at my bacon double cheeseburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey squirt, mind your manners!\" I snapped, smacking her hand away from my sloppily wrapped grease burger, \"Jeezus Al, what's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" she whimpered, rubbing the back of her little hand, moving quietly back to grazing on the mountain of fries we had whittled down into a hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool, just... ask first, you know?\" I take a big, greedy bite, \"I mean, you probably won't get any. But asking helps. What's gotten into you, anyway? You never eat this much. At least, not in such a small stretch of time. Usually you kind of graze instead of stuffing it all in your face at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice turned to me and answered...</span></div></div>",

I've pictured it in my head... being as, um... <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">as big as you</font>, and it um...\" she laughed nervously as her face turned a darker shade of crimson, \"I'd really... <i>really</i> like to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I could do was stare at my sister, my mouth hung open and my fries untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I don't know.

It was last Summer, right before my Senior year at Buttercombe. I came back a good seventy pounds bigger than I had been at Christmas, and I was so fucking fat that I broke a chair in the dining room with my massive ass. My Mom bitched at me and sent me to my room, and Alice came in to check on me and I told her everything. About Buttercombe, about getting fat, and about how much I loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just... I had no idea that one day we'd be having the same conversation, just flipped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mel?\" Alice squeaked, sniffling up nervous tears, \"D-Do you think you could...</span></div></div>",

For as long as I could remember, Alice had been this quiet, mousy girl who could barely raise her voice if she tried. I mean yeah, she'd been a lot more confident lately, but this seemed like a hugely out of character moment for her at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I mean... you're the only person I know who wouldn't think I was a...\" Alice shrunk into her shoulder, \"...a freak. You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did know. I remember when I told my roommate back at Buttercombe Academy about my epiphane about my weight, and she just laughed at me (didn't stop that preppy bitch from gaining another fifty pounds that year, though.). I knew I couldn't exactly run around and tell everyone that I got off on being fat, but I distinctly remembered being able to trust Alice. She didn't tell Mom or Dad, and she never brought it up unless I did. She covered for me when I snuck snacks out of the fridge, and always played lookout when I was hiding from Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why did all of this feel so... weird?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I wanted to be fat. I wanted to be so big that I couldn't get out of bed. In fact, the very thought of being pinned down under my own blubber, stuffing myself while someone else took care of me was enough to make me physically aroused. But I didn't know if I wanted that for Alice, my sweet little sixteen year old sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Alice...\" I started, crumpling up my wrapping paper, \"This isn't something to be taken lightly... obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled up my t-shirt over my belly and untucked it from my pajama pants, letting it flop out into the empty space provided by my tree-trunk thighs. It gurgled and churned as it processed my greasy, fast-food breakfast, rounded and a little firmer than it had been this morning. I caressed it with both hands, jostling it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? All of this? It's a huge commitment.\" I said softly, \"I'm fat. Really fat. And I'm only gonna get fatter. And I'm okay with it, even knowing that there are all kinds of nasty side-effects. I just don't want you to gain fifty pounds and realize that you hate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" Alice blinked her big blue eyes at me, a familiar fire burning bright behind them, \"It's just... I've been trying so hard for so long, and all I have is this little pot-belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rolled up her own shirt and showed me the damage. She'd been lugging around this round, swollen belly ever since I got home. It was soft and pale and jiggly. There were other areas of gain too--I noticed Alice wasn't wearing the new jeans she got for Christmas at all. Her hips had put some on too, and I noticed her picking at her bra strap a lot. But more or less, she was right. Alice was definitely belly-heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? All I have is a tummy...\" Alice said dejectedly, a hint of desperation in her voice, before she looked back up at me, \"You're the best gainer I know... and I'd really appreciate your help.\"</span></div></div>",

Show me what to eat, when to eat and how to eat. If nothing else works stuff my face full. Please, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... fuck, I don't know what to say.\" I started putting my t-shirt and pajamas back on just to get some time to think this through. \"You're absolutely sure about this, sis? Living your whole life as a fat gal? People staring at you all the time, not being able to find any good-looking clothes anywhere, being too fat to walk to food or even struggling to get up from bed for breakfast...\" As I listed the downsides I noticed that Alice was slowly rubbing her belly and his lips were parted as to let out a silent moan. Damn, was my little sister getting turned on by this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, please.\" Alice interrupted me. \"I know what I'm doing, alright? I've been dreaming about the things you listed for months now.\" Alice replied while hiding her belly underneath the tightly-stretched shirt. \"I've been thinking about asking you for weeks now. I woudn't've gotten you involved if I wasn't so desperate. Please, please help me Mel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, this is weird. Look, I... I'll.. I'm not sure how to help you. I mean I just, you know, stuff my fat face when I feel like it, which is.. all the time, basically. There are no secret tricks or anything like that, Alice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I said this Alice lowered her head and started to sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, don't do that to me Al.\" I started massaging her hand, hoping that she would not not cause a scene. \"I'll.. Alice, I'll help you.\" She looked up at me. \"I'll monitor you and tell you what I'd do if I were you, alright? Give you tips about what to eat and stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't remember if I've ever seen Alice change mood as fast as she just did. She looked like she'll start dancing any second now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, thankyouthankyouthankyou Mel. God, I'd hug you to death if this table were not between us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al please, try to stay in your pants. People have been looking at us since I walked in and ordered table full of food at us, and now you're causing a scene. Soon I'll be too embarrassed to walk in here and this place is one of my favorites.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice calmed down and we started our journey back to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, mom will kill me for doing this.\" I sighed as I opened the car door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about mother. She already hates you so nothing you'll do will change that. Just... if she starts blaming you just tell her it's all my doing and you got nothing to do with it.\"</span></div></div>",

Luckily for me she seemed to know the basics already, so the only thing I had to do was encourage her to eat the crucial last bites at every meal. I even took her to the nearby bakery for a small snack, just to make sure she doesn't start telling me to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night I decided to visit her, ask her how she was feeling about this one thing. \"Alice, are you still awake?\" I asked as I pushed her door open. She motioned me to come in and I followed, closing the door behind me. She lifted herself to a sitting position, allowing me to sit on her bed next to her. The bed creaked loudly as I placed my fat ass on it, causing Alice to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what does my feeding coach recommend now?\" Alice teased me. \"Oh stop that, Al. This is awkward enough without you teasing me like that.\" I said as I adjusted my tight pajama top. Oh god, this fit better few days ago. Had I really gained that much so quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But in the evening, I just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of my nightly activities flooded my mind: Undressing myself and caressing my folds in front of the mirror, telling myself how fat I was and how fat I'd get before moving to bed and moving my hands below my belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... I check my progress, eat some candy and sleep until breakfast is ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, where did you find the candies? I checked everywhere in kitchen, there's nothing good anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just take some fr..\" I managed to say before I realized what's up. \"Wait, you don't have a stash of goodies in your room? You're trying to get fat with mom's food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've tried to bring some but mother takes everything away from me.\" Alice stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because mom doesn't want you to get fat! You need to sneak in as much as you can and stash it away for later.\" With a loud THUD I pushed my fat body from the bed and started waddling towards the door. \"Come on Alice, we have to fix this right now. Get dressed and meet me at car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly threw something on and then sneaked outside as quietly as I could. Well, as quietly as girl this fat could. Luckily I didn't wake anyone up and made it to the car where Alice was already waiting for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see the look on his face?\" Alice said, giggling wildly in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he couldn't get his eyes away from my belly and the junk I'd stuff it full with. And then he realized you had another basket full of snacks and the whole load was just for me!\" I added, laughing with Alice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That poor boy just the night shift of his life! I can't wait to get as fat as you, the way people stare at you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have no idea how amazing it is! And don't worry sis, just keep munching those and refilling the stash as needed\" I switched to a more serious tone. \"Just make sure mom doesn't see that stuff, she'll take it all away and figure a way to punish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI parked the car and we slowly sneaked back into our own rooms, both carrying plastic bag full of snacks. I emptied the bag on my bed and filled my stash, placing one bag of chips aside for tonight. I grabbed the bag and headed towards Alice's room, wanting to check how she's handling all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I approached the door I heard Alice moaning and munching on something. Her door was ajar, which allowed me to see her laying on the bed. She had already managed to slip out of her clothing and was only wearing panties and a bra. Her left hand was busy emptying a large bag of gummy bears in her mouth while the other...</span></div></div>",

I figured she had an itch or something. But then I recognized the familiar erotic noises Alice was making beneath her multi-colored midnight snack, and the breathlessness that the act left her with. She ground against the bedsheets, thrusting her crotch into her hand and pressing her belly against her wrist while a slick sound played underneath her heavy panting. I slowly realized that she didn't have an itch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister was masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI practically jumped out of my skin the second I realized it, and pushed myself away from the door as quickly as my pathetic underworked arms could manage. Seriously, I was so shocked I dropped my bag of chips. All I could think about was how my little sister--my sweet, timid, innocent little sister--was choking down gummy bears while rubbing one in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, it wasn't like <i>I</i> didn't do... that. Come on, how could I not? But something about catching Alice doing the deed just made me feel all uncomfortable on the inside. I didn't really realize it until then that Alice had changed a <i>lot</i> since last Summer. While I was at Buttercombe, stuffing my face and putting on another eighty pounds, Alice had been through a lot without much to distract her. The divorce, putting up with Mom. More importantly, somewhere along the line, Alice had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe learned how to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe learned what... went where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, good for her. Seriously, if anyone could have benefitted from some sexual release, it was her. And I mean, at the time, I couldn't really call her out for doing anything. Sure it made me uncomfortable that she was so... <i>into</i> herself. But then, I guess that's how she felt about me. I couldn't go twenty minutes without copping a feel on my own hot body, why should I have gotten upset when she did a little exploration of her own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, I still felt pretty dirty. And not the fun kind of dirty; the not-masturbating-tonight kind of dirty. I took my feelings of sexual frustration and guilt out on my own body, and managed to scarf down half of what I'd picked up at the gas station that night before falling asleep in a cute little food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried <i>really</i> hard not to look Alice in the eye the next morning.</span></div></div>",

Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a full thirty seconds to realize what I had just said, and another thirty to rectify it. She grabbed the curve of her swollen tit and hefted it out of the box. Her t-shirt's chest was stained (probably ruined) with orange pizza sauce and cheese. Alice's new sweater-puppies had probably been smothering that pie for a while now. The edge closest to Alice, balancing on her belly bulge, looked flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" she said sheepishly, taking a piece of tit-pizza and lowering it into her mouth, \"Guess I'm still not used to these things, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the past few weeks, against my own better judgement, I'd been helping my sister pack on weight. And I was proud to say (in a weird way) that by following everything I told her to do, Alice had eaten herself into quite the little chubster. Forty pounds in two months--on top of the twenty-ish or so she'd put on while I finished out my last year at prep school. That meant that, with my help, Alice was a whole sixty pounds heavier than she had been this time last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a bad gain for a girl with almost no head start, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... this pizza's good.\" Alice said thickly, scarfing down the greasy slice of empty calories and grease, \"Maybe my boobs <i>should</i> be toppings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be weird, Al.\" I nudged her in the arm, using my superior fat girl strength to make her rock slightly in her seat, \"And don't hog all the pizza either. <i>I</i> paid for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Summer, I'd had Alice doing as I did. Eating what I ate, when I ate, and matching me bite for bite. She'd been laying out on the couch with me for hours on end, vegging out in front of Netflix while she grazed on some of my high-cal snacks. Basically, Alice had been playing monkey-see monkey-do with me, and all it had done was turn her into a lazy chubster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face had become round and puffy, and it got red at even the slightest amount of exertion. Her little double chin had sprouted and then bloomed into a full-on jowl that wobbled whenever she spoke. Alice's arms had become useless and soft, and her ass had become fat and wide. Her chest, as you've probably already guessed by now, had fucking ballooned though; and I didn't quite get that. We Carlyle women tended to be pretty bottom-heavy (citing myself, my Aunt Rhonda, and my Mom's pregnancy photos as sources) but Alice broke the mold with her big fat tits. Sure, her gut was getting pretty big too. She was up to wearing some of Dad's old clothes. But her breasts were just... well, big enough to fall into some pizza and her not know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd turned my sister into a bonafide fat girl, alright. And judging by the way she happily ate her boob pizza (and the fact that she had started locking her doors after big meals) I could only guess that she was only just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was, my own gain had more or less halted. I was so used to stuffing my face at Buttercombe's expense that there was no way my (Mom's) wallet could keep up with me. I'd only put on about five pounds this Summer, thanks to my Single White Female mom only having one source of income. Ugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Alice said as she stared unblinkingly at the television screen, \"You want to grab me some Cheezits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" I burped, palming the box with my hand, \"Save some for me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff.\" Alice snorted, \"No way. These are my <i>favorite.</i>\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tossed the Cheezits back to me, and ran, or, I guess, waddled off to her bedroom to get ready to head out.<br>\r\nGod, my sister got <b>fat</b>. Looking at her round the corner to the hallway, I noticed that there was a 4 inch tear in the back of her sweatpants. Her stomach stuck out in front of her shirt, making it look distended and warped. At least, when it wasn't looking like a belly shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of belly shirts, she actually came out of her bedroom wearing one, with some shorts that were begging for mercy. That button was threatening to pop right off and shoot an eye out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go, Al?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Where are we going to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought, since you've been doing so well with your weight gain, I'd test out how you do with your stomach. Welcome to your second lesson: always feel full. We're gonna hit downtown hard today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving in the city, we parked up and started walking towards the food district. This place was packed with as many restaurants as the eye could see. Buffets, fast food chains, sit-downs, BBQ, burrito shops, family diners, and, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>PIZZA!</b>\" Alice charged toward Sbarro's with a burning passion that couldn't be stopped with a police blockade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too deep into that pizza, Al! You've still got at least 3 more places to eat today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God Mom gave her an allowance, otherwise, today would have been a bust. I had $20, but I just ate a bit of Taco Bell while waiting for her to finish her pizza. 20 minutes later, I walked over to the Sbarro shop, and found her getting a refill on a large Mountain Dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so, where to next, Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Ah! I've got it! Next up on your plate is some Famous Dave's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButtercombe was big on the meat stuff. Lunch ladies made a mean brisket when Fall came. So, I took her over there, and she got a full slab of ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down on the food, Al. You gotta learn to pace yourself. Plus, it's not even 1 o'clock yet. Tell you what. After <i>we</i> eat this slab, I'll take you over to Forever 21 and get some new clothes for your pre-dinner meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sounds good to me. How about a little contest to test myself, though? Split the slab in half, first one done has to buy our dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about this, Alice? You think you're ready to tackle me in a eating contest? Remember, I beat Rachel Elvers in an ice cream eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, are you too big of a chicken to take me on in a food contest? Afraid you're gonna lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat set off the instinct in me to never back down from a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a little smoked meat won't hold me down. So, sure. You're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur waiter set down the slab, Al cut the slab, and I counted us down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...3, 2, 1, GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe began tearing at the ribs like wild animals. I had my method of splitting the ribs first, and then pulling the meat onto the plate, tossing the fat and bones to the side. Alice took the method of pulling the ribs one by one and gnawing at the meat until picked clean, then rinse and repeat. My method was a bit slower at first, but that was no matter. But, as we were both at the end of the meat...</span></div></div>",

But I really would rather not be a part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that Alice's eyes got wider than I'd ever seen them in my entire life. I don't know if it was shock or anger or she was holding back a psychotic rage manifested from all the years of Mom telling her what to do or what, but I just remember her being more than a little scary at the moment. Of course, it didn't register to me at the time, and she wasn't saying anything, and I really <i>really</i> hate awkward silences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... y'know, I don't think you're really doing this because <i>you</i> want to.\" I continued, \"I think you're trying to gain weight... to be like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked flatly, her little voice shaking \"Why would you even say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like... you always do what I do.\" I said matter-of-factly, \"I get it, I'm your big sister and you love me, but you can't just do... <i>this</i> on a whim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my stomach for emphasis, upsetting the natural balance of food in my belly and causing me to burp very loudly. Alice didn't look any less pissed at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a whim!\" she said little louder than she probably would have liked, \"And I do <i>not</i> do everything because you do it! I... I... I just want to be fat, okay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez squirt, calm down.\" I looked around, and we were attracting some stares, \"Look, I didn't say you couldn't gain weight on your own.

She'd kick me out on my big fat ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're not going to do it because <i>Mother</i> wouldn't approve?\" Alice snarled back at me, uncharacteristically angry with me, \"Since when has that ever stopped you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's just... I said no, okay?\" I stood my ground (figuratively) and cross my arms beneath my huge tits, \"I love you a lot, Alice. I missed you while I was away, and I've had a lot of fun this week. But I'm not going to help you get fat. I'll still lay around on the couch with you, and I'll still front the bill for pizza, but that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But... but Mel!\" Alice whined, tears welling up in her eyes, \"I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" I restated, \"I'm not going to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long, awkward pause between the two of us. Which was weird, because we'd always been super close. I wasn't quite capable of fathoming that Alice might have developed some kind of problem with me after that, because she'd always been my little sister who followed me around and did whatever I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me say it again, what I did was out of love. I didn't want my sister turning eighteen at three hundred pounds like I did, not because I wasn't a bomb-ass bitch, but because that's my sister. I got lots of stares, yeah, but most of them weren't positive. I mean, people acknowledging how fat I was, positively or negatively, was basically my #3 turn on (behind food and belly-rubs) but Alice was a real sweetheart. She freaked out when someone told her she had big feet, and she was talking about being bigger than I was. All those nasty catcalls would have killed her. Plus, if anything ever happened to her <i>because</i> of her weight, I'd never forgive myself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" I ended the silence after everyone in Burger King had gone back to not staring at the four hundred pound white whale and her chubby little sister, \"We cool, Squirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Alice spat, \"We're cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had <i>no</i> idea that after that day, my relationship with Alice would never be the same again.</span></div></div>",

I couldn\u2019t care more, either way because now I get to be the cool Mom and do stuff with my baby girl again! In fact look what just got in the mail today!\u201d My Mom\u2019s voice was in a sing-song pitch I\u2019d seldom heard.  She reached into her pocket and retrieved an I.D card, complete with Alice\u2019s picture and information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still speechless, but Mom didn\u2019t miss a beat, savoring this new turn of events. \u201cWe both just got new gym memberships at the local Rec Center a little ways down the road. You\u2019re free to come with us anytime you want, it\u2019s a family plan so your names listed\u2026You <i>know </i>how often I want us to try new things together as a family...\u201d Mom raved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was enough to bring me back to my senses. \u201cFat chance.\u201d I spat arms akimbo and toes tapping, sending jiggles up my flabby legs and thighs. I was trying my best to look unaffected by the news Mom had just sprung on me, no matter how shocked and sad I felt on the inside. \u201cNow, can I get some privacy, or do you want to frisk me too chairwoman Mom Zedong?\u201d I lifted my hands above my head, purposely jutting my stomach out further towards her in a way I know she hated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom flinched but only for a moment, she quickly recovered with a catty smile\u2026\u201dOh you\u2019re fine, in fact we were just about to leave for the gym, you can still come with us if you want\u2026But before I go,  you know I was thinking about it\u2026When\u2019s the last time we decorated this side of the room?\u201d Mom slowly paced about my room and then towards my dresser. She slowly scooched the wooden monolith just over towards the right\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened as I realized with horror, why she was doing this doing this sudden and odd bit of redecoration\u2026 I mad two thunderous steps towards her, but was too late to keep her from finding my secret snack stockpile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAha!\u201d she shouted with delight as she found my hidden fat-cave of cave of treats. \u201cHow appropriate, a slop pile of snacks for my hog of a daughter. Unbelievable\u2026You know you\u2019re going to thank me for getting rid of this stuff one day\u2026\u201d she continued droning on about what was \u201cBest for me\u201d as she began picking up Cookies, Snack cakes, and other such sweets from my miniature mountain of morsels.  She grabbed a laundry hamper and loaded them all up perfectly fine with trashing the entire harvest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, those are mine!\u201d I argued at the sight, a large part of me knowing it was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell they\u2019re under <i>MY </i>roof missy and unless you want to live out on the streets, there will be no snacking in my house. Understood?\u201d adults never wanted a reply, after asking a facetious question like that, but Mom added a bit more just to rub salt and lemon into this surprising hurtful turn of events. \u201cBesides if you want to be angry at anyone, talk to your sister. <i>SHE</i>\u2019s the one who told me about your little rats nest here.\u201d And with that she continued slogging my snacks out of my room, satisfied she\u2019d finally turned sister against sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinge hit me and I froze. Alice had snitched on me! I\u2019d felt so\u2026betrayed! What else had she told Mom? We-we\u2019d just been so cool a few days ago\u2026 How could this have happened?  I figured I\u2019d better go talk to Alice right away, but Mom said they were leaving for the gym in a few minutes...I suppose that a trip to the gym was the quickest way I'd get to talk to Alice and see what was up, then it was trip I was willing to make...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another part of me just wanted to\u2026wanted to\u2026BREAK BAD! I was done apologizing. If Alice and my Mom were against me now\u2026FINE! I\u2019d eat double at dinner; sneak double the snacks, whatever it took to keep the pound piling on.

Nope to all three!  In fact not a Twinkie had been touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually I wasn\u2019t seeing more of Alice; I was actually seeing <i>less </i>of her... so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery other day or so, it seemed from sun-up to sun-down Alice was out of the house most of the time.  She said she was either taking a walk to the park, or biking down a few blocks to the library, even, ugh, jogging a around the block. Admittedly, bias couch potato that I was, a large part of me did want to pull my sister in and just chill like we had before, but she seemed happy enough doing this new independent and out of the house thing, so I didn\u2019t say anything, and as much I loved spending time with her I wasn't going to be joining her\u2026Jogging around the block wasn\u2019t as highly ranked as the block of shows I had on my Netflix que, and let\u2019s just says me and bikes no longer \u201chang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain though nothing too out of the ordinary, in fact I felt it only proved that my choice to not help Alice on her brief flight of fancy towards getting fat was the right one. So with fears of my sister swing binging assuaged, and Alice and I back to normal speaking terms, I could focus back on me, <b>ALL </b> of me, and how Mom was till practically starving the two of us on her new fad Paleo-diets.  I mean hello! Mom, if prehistoric humans had invented microwaves and deep fryers I\u2019m sure they WOULD have used them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was too busy planning my own secret snacking schedules to notice when my sister started wearing newer loose fitting clothing, in fact it wasn\u2019t until she asked to wear some of MY old clothes when I knew something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hoodie?\u201d I asked splayed in my usual position on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they-uh, have the AC on full blast at the library\u201d alleged Alice as she spoke from behind her bedroom door. \u201cMine don\u2019t fi-eh, I think mine are still in the attic with the rest of my school clothes. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,no problem\u2026\u201d I said shouting down the hall so I wouldn\u2019t have to get up.  \u201cIt\u2019s hanging back in my closet all the way to the left.\u201d It was a bitchingly awesome hoodie that I had gotten my Sophomore year of school. It was bright yellow, warm, and sported the Buttercome logo right on the very front; I loved that hoodie, I mean when it used to fit me\u2026 \u201cIt might be a little big on you though squirt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe-he squirt, yeah\u2026\u201d breathed Alice, \u201cWell anything to stay warm, thanks sis\u2026Umm did you have a pair of sweats out somewhere too?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure- let\u2026me\u2026just...\u201d I heaved myself off from the couch in order to find where I had placed my old pants.  I was curious at first but this was enough to gain my attention, even if the pants were from just my sophomore year, like the hoodie, I figured Alice would have practically drowned in those! But I was about to find out I was wrong I was damn wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo-it\u2019s okay-I found them-never mind\u201d Alice was trying to say hurriedly before I had opened the door to help my little sister\u2026Er little in the symbolic sense it would seem. Standing in the center of my room, in my hoodie, but still sweatpants less I realized\u2026Somehow, someway Alice was getting <b>BIG</b>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood her lower half exposed, her eyes like a deer in headlights, realizing I could see how her once elegant thighs were now more like elephants thighs, and even with the hoodie on, her once paltry pot-belly paunch had grown into a much larger gut which hung freely in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice what\u2026?\u201d I gaped a bit, before she quickly shot a mean look back at me, the fire in her eyes returning. She quickly covered up her bulky body as best as she could, her flesh jiggled and wobbled as she quickly stowed it away before I could catch any more details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-If I remember right you said it\u2019s none of your business\u2026\u201d she spat taking the long way around me, and grumbling something about another pair of pants. I went to go after her, and get some answers out of her, (you put your +400 lbs in front of a doorway and see if you don\u2019t get some answers,) but she\u2019d already slammed the door closed, heading out the back door of the house all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind reeled! Alice hadn\u2019t given up on gaining like me! In fact she was doing a damn good job of it! It took a second, to realize how she'd done it, I\u2019ll be the first to admit it\u2019s a lot harder to gain at home under the strict watch of Mom but it wasn\u2019t impossible, but to do so <i>and </i> keep it from me, who practically never left the house unless it was to go eat out, it was a shock! I thought things had been cool between us, but I suppose my sister is nothing if not strong-minded and she\u2019d obviously found a way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few seconds for me to figure it out. My sneaky sister must eating all the while she said she was exercising! That was just\u2026just <b>SO </b>wrong on <b>SO </b>many levels! Like mixing dark matter, and anti-matter or something, two forces of the universe are the opposite side of the scale (<i>literally</i>!)

She was sort of my roomie my Senior year in Buttercombe\u2026And while It took me a bit to realize Hannah Hammond, is a notorious obesophile\u2014she absolutely loves anything and everything about people getting fat. So the two of us, we were a match made in heaven! The thing was though, she didn\u2019t live anywhere near where Alice and I lived, but now she was here, hanging out with my sister and something was up, well other than my sister\u2019s weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car pulled away I immediately hurried back home, ready to punch up her contact info as soon as my fat fingers got to my phone\u2026I wouldn\u2019t have too though as it Hannah was already calling me\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah!\u201d I began, trying to remember why in fact I\u2019d gone zero contact with her\u2026.\u201dWhat are you doing with my sister!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, Mel\u2026Four months and not a single call? Mel, I\u2019m <i>hurt</i>!\u201d said Hannah from the other end, her tone speaking of feigned sorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Hannah I know things between us didn\u2019t end so well\u2026\u201d I began vaguely recalling some unfriendly memories towards right around graduation time... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI MADE YOU!\u201d she wailed unexpectedly, her voice going from controlled and cool, to piercing and scratchy.  \u201cI did everything for you for a whole school year, made you into the beautiful hunk of lard you are today, and what\u2019s the thanks I get come graduation? \u201cI didn\u2019t say you could grope my butt Hanna, I\u2019m not your plaything Hannah, let\u2019s just be <u>friends </u>Hannah \u2026\u201d she said her voice growing more mocking with every imitation she did of me, in the background I could hear faint chewing noises, assumedly Alice was already eating in the back of Hannah\u2019s limo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Right. Her controlling psycho bitch side\u2026that was why.

I\u2019ve got a whole wonderful new Carlyle to stuff to my heart\u2019s content. I mean imagine my surprise, when I happened to get a poke online, and then a note from Mel Carlyle\u2019s sister. Of course I had to give her MY number, and well my family does have a hotel chain in just about every tri-state-area so of course it was not trouble to drop on by for a few weeks I mean I  just had to\u2026\u201d her flirty voice oozing over her own heinous plot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Hannah you\u2019re crazy.\u201d I spat, jolted by my jilted roomies plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Mel, <i>you\u2019re </i>just jealous!

Here Alice have another milkshake before it gets warm-\" *<b>click</b>.* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathlessly, I collapsed back onto the couch, letting my phone fall down uselessly to the side, collecting my still scattered thoughts. I mean it\u2019s totally not because I was jealous or anything, even the slightest bit. I mean the idea of Alice getting  spoiled rotten and eating whatever she wanted while in France  while I was stuck doing double the chores here on the ever watching eye of mother\u2026Nope I pushed the thought from my mind\u2026No there was no way would Mom let her do something like that! <b>No Way! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn\u2019t like it was because Alice was getting fat; I mean she was just better at sneaking it then I was, and, come on, if I did squeal to Mom that would make me some sort of big fat hypocrite\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand Hannah was in the nicest of words; downright crazy town banana pants, and was also very good at hiding it. I didn\u2019t want Alice getting mixed up with her<u> AT ALL</u>. I took a deep breath and decided that night I would do everything I could to make sure Alice did not go on that \u201cEducational Trip\u201d to Paris\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Mom says\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Present company excluded, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she took us out to Patricks\u2019 Diner, Alice favorite place, to celebrate and they just spent hours gushing about how much fun France was going to be. How much it would broaden her horizons, how much she would learn about fashion. Just every fucking thing. Mom didn\u2019t even <i>speak</i> to me until I had the audacity to order another plate of onion rings\u2014which she confiscated, by the way! Threw them in the fucking trash! Seriously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this entire time, Alice is giving me these really snotty looks. It was so unlike her to act this way, I had no idea what had gotten into her\u2026 other than maybe a few dozen cupcakes. She was always the sweetest girl, and Mom never seemed to pick up on it either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she taunting me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she gloating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she basically going \u2018nyeh nyeh, I\u2019m gonna get fatter than yoooooou\u2019 with every little bitchy face she\u2019d make?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably, yeah. Which was why, for the next week before departure, Alice and I barely spoke a word. I stayed in my room, stuffing my face and fondling myself, and Alice probably did the exact same thing in her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt so weird to know that beneath the sister I\u2019d always known and loved was this\u2026 jerk! I still couldn\u2019t believe that they were the same person. All I\u2019d done was say that I wouldn\u2019t help her get fat (which, yeah, kinda hypocritical, but you know my reasons!) and she just flies off the handle and recruits one of the most dangerous feeders I\u2019d ever had the displeasure of meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so a week later we were at the airport. Hannah, disguised as the chaperone for whatever illustrious bullshit school she\u2019d made up, shook my mother\u2019s hand (who wept a single dramatic tear from her eye as she watched her little girl go) and did the same thing to me\u2014making incredibly uncomfortable eye contact with me all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake care of my sister, Hannah.\u201d I said flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry sweetie.\u201d Hannah\u2019s face twisted into an evil grin, \u201cI <i>will</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, they were off. Mom gave Alice a last little hug, an emergency cell phone, and told her to be good and to learn a lot about fashion. And that was just sort of it. My Mom was really upset by it all, I could tell. She actually let me stop and get Burger King on the way home, which was fun. But that should tell you how depressed she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like she was that sad when <i>I</i> left for school, but whatever.</span></div></div>",

Mom had me under her thumb at home, but I wasn\u2019t off course without tricks of my own. Having to get an \u2026ugh...job at Patricks\u2019 Diner wasn\u2019t the highest on my summer to do list. But it wasn\u2019t all bad if you didn\u2019t mind coming home smelling like grease (trust me not as appetizing as it sounds.) I could eat all the food I could after hours and I was able to get away from mom, as well as make some money. I did wince every single time I had a customer order a basket of \u201cFrench\u201d fries though\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all I did end up still putting on 20lbs over three months, which wasn\u2019t exactly losing weight, but this was me we\u2019re talking about, that was practically pitiful! What could I do though; I wasn\u2019t exactly ready to move out (Though I was on my way! Slowly but surely!) So I had to settle for scarfing at work whole getting scraps at home. All the while in my head I could just see my little sister, who was literally on the other side of the world, doing who knew what with notorious obeseophile: Hannah Hammond. We didn\u2019t exchange a single text, although Alice would call mom every so often and I\u2019d be forced to exchange niceties such as the usual \u201cOh, how are you?\u201d which Alice would always answer with something boastful like \u201cGood. Very good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really was a Dickensian best of time, worst of time situation here. Eventually the summer had to end, and Alice was set to arrive home. Mom had instructed me to come with to the airport, AND of course had me be the one to actually pick up Alice when she arrived at the gate, while Mom sat with the car in the parking lot.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSo begrudgingly and in a huff, I headed off into the airport and Gate24-Air France. While wondering what I\u2019d say to my sister when she returned home, (and wondering why everywhere didn\u2019t have these moving walkways they\u2019re awesome!) I worked my way to where I\u2019d have to wait for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever down the walkway first, strutting picturesque as if it were a catwalk was Hannah Hammond, a smile a mile wide on her face, towing two large cases of luggage behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBonjour, Mel. Comme ca va?\u201d she asked, malicious intent behind the kind words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, let me guess, that's French for \"I'm done brainwashing you sister?\u201d I said my tone cold and stodgy, \"Or is it French for \"I'm a stupid skinny bitch who learned how to say this one thing while I was over in Paris.\"?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, we both had a tr\u00e8s grande time in France. Emphasis on <i>grande</i>. You know me I just love love love making people happy and your sister loved every second of it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHar-de-har-har, that\u2019s new Hannah\u2026 fat puns. Seriously do you ever get bored of those?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d she said flatly seeing I wasn\u2019t entertaining the idea of chatting with her at all. \u201cHere\u2019s her luggage by the way.\u201d She said handing me the handle to one of the two rolling suitcases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you carrying her luggage?\u201d I asked, never knowing Hannah to lift a finger she didn\u2019t have to or wasn\u2019t in some way foodie related. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, the gorgeous thing she is now, I wouldn\u2019t make her carry her own luggage\u2026Oh look her she comes.\u201d Boasted Hannah, as we both turned our attention to the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around through the exiting crowd and didn\u2019t see my sister\u2026.Wait\u2026Was that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair I should have been more prepared, three months\u2019 vacation with Hannah Hammond at her size would do wonders to anyone\u2019s waistline, but even with what I had imagined, Alice had gone and exceeded my imagination/worst fears! This blubber ball was not so much walking as bouncing with every step off the plane, she was my once sweet little sister ALICE!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing makeup, and donned in a luxuriously looking large French top that would have been classified beyond merely plus size, Alice was gigantic planetoid in the sea of tiny stars that were the other plane passengers. I could still see Alice\u2019s body fat was mostly front loaded. Her gut had grown surging outwards and forwards dominating her midsection. Just below her top, but just above her jeans, (only Hannah would go to such lengths to bother to find them in such as size) her belly so big and obvious now it would bounce against her thighs with stretchmarks accompanying her muffin top of flab telling of the sudden swiftness of her huge gains. If I had to roughly guess, she weighed maybe less than 100lbs less than I did at this very moment. I was shocked to see my sister in such a new look for her, I was angry at Hannah for being such a jilted former devotee of mine she\u2019d gone through my sister in a way to get back at me, but above all else\u2026I was awestruck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear Hannah licked her lips while reveling in the shocked look at my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, well Alice and I already said our \u2018personal goodbyes\u2019 \u2026for now. I\u2019ll let you two catch up\u2026 Au Revoir, Alice darling!\u201d shouted Hannah as she blew a kiss to Alice who mimicked catching it, and rather than return the act, instead mimed eating it in saccharine manner. \u201cThat\u2019s our thing.\u201d Said Hannah cutely as she turned on the ball of her foot, and disappeared into a crowd, the grin never leaving her face the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the pudgy person worked her way up to me, already bit winded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBonjour ma soeur!\u201d she greeted as if nothing had incredibly changed. I knew she was baiting me to bring up her weight, but I was still so dumbfounded I still ended up uttering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice\u2026you\u2019re\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know great isn\u2019t it? You know I never knew Hannah was such a giving person, not a stuck up brat like you made her out to be, I mean she really gets me. Shame you two couldn\u2019t work things out.\u201d I sighed and started automatically heading for the car, Alice\u2019s suitcase in tow just to get away from my sister, knowing that this bragging was only beginning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEiffle tower\u2026blah blah blah\u2026French bread and duck fat for breakfeast, blah blah blah, Chocolate Milkshakes there are so much better than milkshakes over here\u2026\u201d that sort of went on for a good two minutes until she ended it with a phrase that always perked my ears\u2026\u201dYou hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow let\u2019s get this straight. I\u2019m 99.9% of the time always hungry but, this was the rarest of rare occasions where I had something I\u2019d rather do than eat. I just wanted to get home and get as far away from Alice as I could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice, Mom\u2019s waiting for us.\u201d I insisted to my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just this change in attitude about her as a whole, no longer shy and sweet, she was sour and\u2026just the way she acting now it was\u2026I searched for the word\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m hungry now!\u201d said Alice with an actual stamp of her foot. \u201cI\u2019m going to get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice!\u201d I started sternly, but she\u2019d already taken off to the airport\u2019s Burger King. Brat was the word I was looking for. Hannah had spoiled Alice to her hearts content and now she was a full-figured, full-blown brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made it to B.K and now that I knew what she looked like it easy to pick out her fatty frame at the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA number four and a number six.\u201d She stated, casually picking a $20 bill (hey this was an AIRPORT Burger King) from her wallet\u2026woah! Hannah had obviously given her a good-bye present of cash to make sure Alice stayed well fed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if anything, I figured I could at least sneak in a bite to eat before getting back into the car with Mom, (notice I said quick not small there\u2019s a difference.) I reached for my wallet\u2026only to remember I left it in the car. FUUUUCCCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrily I was forced to sit down, empty handed and watch my sister enjoy her first meal back here in the states. Her new poundage had also brought along new appetite as she tore into the four burgers and fries with such ferocity we only sat for what couldn\u2019t have been more than 5 minutes. Alice was not intent to share a single crumb it seemed, I was her sister, her best friend! Her eyes seemed much to focused on the greasy feast in front of her, she didn\u2019t eat so much as inhale the food. How could this have happened?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"My sweet baby!\" my mother yelled, her arms thrown up in the air, \"You look so... healthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice dropped her bags like it was this big important moment in her life, finally reunited with our mother dearest, and waddled full speed ahead until they collided in this big fleshy hug. My Mom's skinny little arms could barely wrap around her sweet, super sized baby as she tipped the scales at... god... three hundred pounds. My little sister weighed three hundred pounds. She was bigger than I was at sixteen! She was bigger than I was <i>this time last year</i>! And my mom... she was okay with it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, this was the same woman who had scolded me just that morning for sucking the frosting off my fingers. The same woman who never let me live down an extra portion or another slice. The same woman who had been fat shaming me and criticizing me (and in doing so, inadvertantly fueled a very satisfying fetish for me, but that was beside the point) for the past four years of my life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Alice comes home, <i>twice</i> the size I was when I was her age, and all my Mom has to call her is \"healthy\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat. The. Fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you so much, Mommy!\" Alice's voice did a quick flip back to pre-Hannah tones, expertly harkening back to the times when she was genuinely so sweet and demure, \"Hannah and I had such a good time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... can see that!\" for what it's worth, it wasn't like my Mom was blind or anything. She could clearly see that Alice had packed on some serious poundage while she was away, \"Oh, come here sweetie. I missed you <i>so much</i> while you were away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere my mother turned to me, expectantly, and urged me silently to come in for a hug. Or to say something. It was pretty hard to tell with her sometimes; especially when her eyes were wide with confusion over the sudden expansion of the \"good\" daughter. But with my overall size and <i>her</i> overall size, and the fact that I didn't exactly feel like hugging the big bloated brat that she'd turned into while she was away, I figured that phoning in a generic comment or two was my best way at playing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's <i>real</i> good to have you back.\" I said dryly, \"Sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's only response was to sway her butt tauntingly in my direction. Her massive ass swung playfully from side to side for a moment, jiggling for a few moments after. I could just picture the shit-eating grin on her face while she did it. Waving it in front of me that she wasn't in trouble, or that no one suspected a thing. Slowly but surely, Alice unwrapped herself around our mother and took a few steps backwards, her enormous stomach sinking lower over her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I really hate to ask, but you think we could get something to eat on the way home?\" Alice asked in that pathetic little voice, \"The plane food was really gross...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course we can, sweetheart!\" my Mother was all to pleased to dote over the prodigal daughter as she broke out into a sweet little smiled that belayed her newfound manipulative side. She turned to me expectantly, \"Mel, get your sisters bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a short, curt look at my sister, who took the same opportunity to look at me. She laid her hands on the flanks of her belly as it billowed out in front of her, folding distinctively beneath her tight European clothes. It growled at me, menacingly, to while Alice placated it with some quiet little pats on the top of her tummy. She looked back at me with a nasty grin and pressed oh-so-much deeper into the sides of her stomach. Her fat yielded to her touch as her chubby fingers sank into the sweater by just a little bit further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she gave me this shit-eating grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\" my mother urged, snapping me out of our staring contest (and making me lose), \"The bags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling my eyes, I struggled to bend my knees ever so slightly the small angle required for me to grab all of my sister's luggage. I didn't understand it. I had a hundred pounds on that girl, and <i>I</i> was the one who was forced to exert herself because <i>Alice</i> had had a long trip. Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprise surprise, Alice's time in France had done little to expand her culinary pallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had gotten in the car, driven a little ways down the road, when my Mom noticed the extra hungry, extra longing looks that Alice had been giving a McDonalds. She longed for good old fashioned American fast food (not that I could blame her) and, for the first time in forever, my Mother relented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut boy oh boy would she regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice racked up quite the bill at the golden arches, and she did it in such a way that even I had to be a little proud. She ordered almost exclusively off the dollar menu. Rookie mistake to think that bigger prices meant more calories. Three double cheeseburgers were more calories than one double quarter pounder, and at about the same price. A large fry, a few apple pies, and one refillable large drink to go with it made for a pretty solid meal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, that was <i>my</i> order. (which I had to pay for out of my waitressing money, thank you very much!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice may as well have bought the dollar menu. Mom loaded her up! A welcome home present consisting of burgers, chicken sandwiches, nuggets, fries, drinks and pies. Anything Alice wanted, my mother saw fit to give her! And boy oh boy, Hannah had left her wanting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Alice saw fit to say, between her noisy, foodgasmic bites...</span></div></div>",

Ever since <i>I</i> had enrolled, all Alice had wanted to do was go where her big sister went. They were a top-knotch academy, and had plenty of opportunities for a higher education better than anything in our little cow town. My Mom nearly spit out her burger (which she was pretty close to doing anyway) when she heard what Alice had to say!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, sweetie?!\" my mother choked, \"I-I thought you <i>wanted</i> to go to Buttercombe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. All this sweetie talk was killing me. Ever since the divorce Mom had tried to mellow out. Just a year ago, she might have tried to literally choke my sister if she said something like that. But now that she was \"nurturing\" and \"caring\" (at least to <i>one</i> of her daughters) she was a lot more leniant. And apparently, blind. If I had tried to pull this shit, she would have seen through it in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, I suppose, we hated each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know, but... I don't think I could spend that much time away from you!\" Alice's big blue eyes got all watery, \"This Summer was really hard on me. I don't know how Mel did it for four years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother shot me this nasty look. Like 'see? it's just you. nobody <i>else</i> wants to get away from me.' Fuggin' little bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alice, come here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom actually got up, out of our side of the booth, and walked over to give her youngest daughter a side-hug from outside the booth. Her youngest daughter that, might I remind you, barely stopped herself from eating during the entire duration of the hug. Alice might have been able to fool my mom, but she couldn't fool me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to enroll back into public school?\" my Mom did her best not to look too terribly pleased, \"Because I can arrange that for you if that's what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here, for just a minute, Alice's facade faltered. Her smile went from this grateful, chubby little princess to this greedy little glutton who had just gotten her way. Little did I know that I would be seeing that smile a lot more in just as early as the coming weeks. Her cheeks creasing and her second chin bulging. That evil little twinkle in her big blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Alice began, regaining herself, \"That girl I was with? Hannah? <i>She</i> studied at Buttercombe. And she's a certified home schooler, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeeease?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice clasped her chubby little hands together, inadvertantly causing this ripple effect to flow throughout her entire body. Everything from her tits to her belly to her chubby little double chin wobbled suddenly. She was breathing heavily, no doubt from the furious rate at which she'd been wolfing down burgers, and her cheeks were all rosy. She was so big now that her belly folded onto the table in front of her. Alice was so fat now, I barely even recognized her! And here she was trying to get even more time with the woman who had spoiled her rotten and turned her into this big, bitchy brat! Surely my Mom would see the connection. Surely there was <i>reason</i> in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGODDAMMIT MOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose... since she took such good care of you over the Summer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom you can<i>not</i> be serious.\" I bawked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Mel, just because <i>you</i> went to a private school doesn't mean that Alice has to.\" my mom did her best to expertly mediate between her own conflicted feelings and Alice's wants, \"Maybe it'll be good for her. A big school like that. You know how timid she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Mel.\" Alice bit into a burger, her jowls jiggling, \"I'm timid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievable. Unbelievable! My Mom was actually <i>considering</i> this! She was falling right into Hannah's trap--I'd seen it more than enough times at Buttercombe. And this time it was all to get back at me. I wouldn't be her fatty fuck toy, so now she was going to do it to Alice! Private tutor--pssh! That was the lamest excuse I'd ever heard in my entire life! And this was coming from a woman <i>made</i> of lame excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Hannah was doing, I wasn't okay with it. Her influence on Alice was... terrible! Horrifiying! She'd turned my sweet, quiet little sister into this manipulative brat who was just out to get her gut filled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, if you're sure her credentials are good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they are, Mommy they are!\" Alice jiggled excitedly in her seat, the supports creaking as she bounced, \"I'll give her your information. Oh this is going to be so much fun! Thank you thank you thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I'm going to come right out and say that I was <i>not</i> looking forward to spending the rest of my time alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had pretty much spent the last few weeks going throughseperation anxiety as I realized that my sweet little sister was a) a lot more like me than I thought b) getting herself involved with one of the most dangerously fattening women I knew and c) physically capable of  actually lying. To <i>me</i> of all people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's just say that I was more than prepared for this Summer to be the shittiest time of my life, and that was <i>without</i> factoring in the fact that my mom and I were now stuck, alone, in a house with someone that we both couldn't fucking stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the first week, I just went about my business as normal. I ate, I watched TV, and when Mom got home from work, I either went into my room or went out on the town--where I usually ate some more--before going to sleep and doing it all over again.It wasn't the best routine, but it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can imagine my shock, one day, when my Mom out of the blue asks me:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, would you like to go shopping with me this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just sitting there, scarfing down donuts like the good little whale I was. I hadn't spoken to the woman all morning; she was getting ready for work, I was gearing up for another day of being a useless sack of lard, we just never really crossed paths. So when she spoke to me--in the form of an invitation rather than an insult, no less-- I almost choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked stupidly, my eyes wide with terror and wonder, \"Like... with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah.\" she said to me flatly, no detectable sarcasm or snarkiness beneath her make-up, \"I mean, you've been wearing the same outfits for a while now, and they're looking pretty tight....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fully expected that to go into another anti-fat, weight-shaming tyrade that my mother was so keen on doling out whenever she felt that I was a little <i>too</i> in love with myself (which, let's face it, was always). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure?\" I swallowed my donut dumbly, \"Is, um... is this Saturday good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" my mother said with a little smile, \"We'll make a day out of it. You can't just spend all Summer laying around in your pajamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. My big double-belly had already outgrown the Buttercombe Athletics t-shirt that I had brought with me back from the Academy. The gray material wrapped tightly around my lower roll of belly blubber and cut deeply into my sides, giving me an extra muffin top as I sat squeezed into my shorts. The straps on my bra were so tight that I had honestly just started to go without, letting my big round girls hang freely and fabulously. Even the neck was tight. And my shorts were hanging on by mere threads; one good arch of my back and those things would be goners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure...\" I stammered awkwardly as my Mother hung in the doorway, \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in awe. Dumbstruck. My mother and I hadn't spent any quality time together since my first Holiday Break home, when I had put on my first forty pounds and ate the entire Thanksgiving Turkey by myself. The fact that we had spent <i>years</i> at each other's throats after that certainly hadn't helped matters any. I'll be the first to admit that I suspected foul play, but I decided to give my mother the benefit of the doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, all throughout that week,  my Mom didn't stop with this whole \"treating me like a human being\" thing she'd picked up after Alice left. And it was really starting to freak me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she got home from work, she called me. It started out as just telling me that she was on her way home, but it had evolved in the past few days. Now she asked me whether or not I wanted anything to eat, and if she'd like me to stop and get it for her. Friday night, she actually talked to me about her day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Right</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom was the biggest bitch on the planet (metaphorically speaking, of course.) and had hounded me about my weight as an excuse to continue exercising that bitchiness. Once Alice had left with Hannah to spend a semester in France, she had done a complete one-eighty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she offered to buy me new clothes, and I wasn't in any shape to decline. I had outgrown almost everything I'd owned at the time, and it didn't look like I was hitting a steady plateau any time soon. My belly was getting so big that I couldn't wrap even my sweats around it without working up a decent sweat, and my tits were so huge that there wasn't a bra in the neighborhood big enough to fit them.  I'd squeezed myself into the biggest, baggiest clothes I'd owned (a shirt my Aunt Rhonda had sent me from this bakery called Apple Dumplin's) and a pair of shorts that were downright scandalously tight. My legs were locked in a war of cellulite and thigh dimples as they fought eachother for space in the shorts, as well as the encroaching third party of one of my tummy rolls. Fuck, my feet were getting so chubby that none of my old sneakers fit me anymore, so I had to wear flipflops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, even my Mom had dressed down in anticipation of our day out. She had this loose-fitting orange and white sleeveless blouse, and a pair of mom jeans with some sandals that looked pretty cute. She had on some sunglasses, and her makeup was done to a minimal. If I didn't know any better, I would say that she had dressed down so I didn't feel like such a slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would have been an awfully human thing of her to do, so I dismissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe pulled up to this little outlet store, the only place in town that could even hope to adequately clothe my colossal corpulence. Mom put the emergency brake on while I still came to a rolling stop, my body still jiggling from the slight motions of the vehicle beneath me. In my hand, the debris from our trip to McDonalds (she got me fucking McDonalds!)  crinkled slightly. I put it down and braced myself for the herculean effort that was to be hefting my four-hundred-plus-plus body out of the relatively low vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, here, lemme get out and help you.\" My Mom said nonchalantly as she opened the driver's side door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What</i>?\"I shot back, my eyebrows raised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"she answered, seemingly genuinely confused, \"I know you have some trouble getting in and out of my car.I figured I'd go over and help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mom, what gives.\"I demanded, jiggling into a more intimidating position while still remaining seated, \"You've been a total bitch to me for as long as I can remember, and now that Alice is gone, you're acting like a perfectly rational and normal human being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, I <i>am</i> a perfectly rational--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No excuses!\"I put one pudgy finger in the air, \"Come on Mom, fess up. What's got you acting like Mother of the Year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother sighed and said...</span></div></div>",

She shoveled more crisps into her mouth irritated by how novice she was to feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey its okay, you're new to this, we'll put a bag of snacks in your room and whenever you look up and dont see food, you pull out a snack. When I first realized I wanted to get fat this was the trick that finally made some noticeable changes to my body, this way you can eat 4000 calories a day without even noticing it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my belly, it was soft and pale like hers, but much bigger. It hung in the gap between my tree trunk thighs and I couldn't help but wander what Alice would look like with this belly. Perhaps I might one day find out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't mom find out about the snacks in my room? I don't want her to know, she already pretends you don't exist half the time Melly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously you hide it doofus, if you cant wait to go to college to get fat like I did then eventually she is gonna figure out something is up when you start bursting out of your clothes, but until then just act like nothings different\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her pudgy belly roll in her hand, while the other absent mindedly pawed at the crisps<br>\r\n\"Alright I get it, graze all day long, hide my snacks, anything else I should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's lesson 2\" I said ominously \"What are your plans later... ?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let me flag down a waiter. Hey, you! Yeah, me an' my sis would like another order of supersize cheeseburgers. Oh, more fries and... a milkshake would be great!\" I say, and give a wink to Alice, her face adorably happy. \"Oh my gosh! T-thanks Mel! You know I was thinking... we could, like, team up and become fat together! Like the fattest sisters in the world or something! I just, I really wanna gain! And I know you do to so...\" she says, happily. \"Aw that sounds amazing sis! You know, I started a GoFundMe so that people can donate so I don't get broke buying food. We can split the profits 50/50.\" The waiter brings our fat filled feast, and Alice nod while greedily halfway through her burger already. We talk and she give <i>me</i> the rundown. Currently, she weighs 164 pounds, but her dream is to weigh 600 or more. She pulls up here shirt a little, exposing an adorable beginner potbelly. She's wearing shorts for a reason, and shows of her thick, buttery thighs, and plump ass. She contorts her face a little bit, giving her a double chin. We get up out of the booth, after eating and talking for hours, with way more than two burgers in our bellies, we spontaneusly  go to the store, and buy 12 tubs of ice cream, 6 each. We go home, Mom being fast asleep and having work very early, we praticilly have the house to ourselves. WE gorge the tubs of ice cream, and after that Al raids the fridge. She comes to with cupcakes and leftovers and says, \"Another binge, Mel?\" I'm far from full, but decline saying \"Aw it's ok sis. You need to catch up to me anyway, you skinny thing!\" We laugh because that is <i>far</i> from the truth. Alice's potbelly is twice it size, nice and bloated. She has new thunder thighs, and from what I can tell, a double chin that's here to stay, no matter how she moves her head. After she's done stuffing herself silly she says, \"Ha, getting plump now, right Mel?\" I can tell she's really trying, working for the fat. \"Oh yeah, juicy as ever!\" I say. Al heads back to the kitchen, hoping to find anything fattening in the near empty fridge. As she turns, its hard not to notice her jiggly ass, where most of the fat has gone. I check my phone, and I see a text from Mark, my secret boyfriend. He provides A LOT of cash, really supporting my weight gain, paying for almost all of the food. The text says: <br>\r\nhows my fatty doing??? belly any bigger? if so send pic, love to see that big tummy of yours \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0d \ud83c\udf69\ud83c\udf69\ud83c\udf69<br>\r\nI giggle, he's soooo cute. I'm like the feedee to his feeder. I go to the camera app, pushing my stomach out and taking it from an angle that makes me looks huge. I hit send, and 3 seconds later he responds: <br>\r\n\ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0d omg babe! your huge! missing that belly tonight... looks like it needs some belly rubs!! \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude0d FaceTime?<br>\r\nI text back: yes please! And call him right away. He says, \"Hey babe! I miss my plump princess so much! Gained anything back home?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, like 10 pounds just today haha! Trust me, I'm really fattening up!\" <br>\r\n\"That's amazing! Well I gotta go, sorry this is so short... miss you! Happy eating!\" <br>\r\n\"Bye!\" I say and the screen goes dark. I heave myself onto my feet and waddle into the kitchen. Alice is there, deep in some kind of gluttony trance, gorging on what looks like an extra large pizza that she just got delievered. \"What? Al! Why didn't you tell me that your ordered pizza? Did you at least save me a slice?\" She doesn't respond, so I sit my fat ass down on the kitchen floor and grab a slice. When she's devoured it all, she snaps out of the trance and leans against a cabenet. \"Oh, hey Mel. God, I'm full.\" She pats her stomach. She sits there, digesting, before she decides to try belly rubbing. I can't help but be transfixed. Her fingers glide across the smooth, huge, round belly. She seems to have a mastery of techniques, from kneading, to jiggling. She moans a little bit, invoulinterily. Though her shorts are supposed to be rather loose, her thigh poke out of them helplessly, and her streched elastic creates a noticable muffin top. She leans foward a little bit, because her shelf-ass is so huge. Bigger than mine already. I reach out and say \"Here's how you do it.\" I rub her soft, full belly, watching it wiggle with the slightest touch. I notice she loves how it feels, so I begin to knead. I knead harder and harder, as she mumbles things like \"Nice and plump...Ugh... so much fat...\" He phone lights up next to her, and she's deep in a food coma by now, so I sneak a peek. Its a text from her boyfriend, Joshua. I don't see it all but it says stuff like, 'hey babe. love you. send pic?' just the basics. I know from what Al's told me that Josh is kinda clingy. I quickly grab phone, slowly position her to look real cute, thicc and sexy, snap a pic and hit send. i'm sure she won't mind! <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We had the TV turned on, all ready for the latest installment of our summer-long binge watching marathon. But before we queued up Netflix, Alice and I were getting into a long philosophical discussion about just what was going to be for breakfast considering that I ate all of the breakfast. And it was during that little argument that a commercial (one of those offputtingly loud, crappy local broadcast kind) for a new Greek/Italian restaurant in town popped up with just enough obnoxious loudness and tempting pictures of food to distract us both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as soon as I had convinced my stick-in-the-mud sister that maybe we could play food critic for the day (which was getting a lot easier to do, btw) and check this new place out, we got dressed and piled into my car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too far, but that didn't mean I wasn't still starving by the time we made it there. I practically ran-waddled my way up to the entrance, with poor Alice straggling behind me because I was so hungry I forgot to shut my freaking door. It was a rinky-dink little place. I didn't really notice it because I had tunnel vision at the time, but we were pretty much the only other car in the parking lot. I waited up for my sister, and we went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were greeted by this old guy, probably the owner. He was swarthy, short and stocky with a mustache straight out of the seventies, and he just happened to be near the front door. I saw his eyes widen in terror as my great big body wriggled into his itty-bitty restaurant, shimmying and shaking my way slowly out of my tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Acropolis, ladies!\" he did his best to hide that fear and channel it into customer service, \"H-How many today? Two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just little ol' us.\" I said cheekily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed nervously, probably wondering how I managed to fit \"little\" into a sentence describing myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right right, would you like a table or booth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booths are kinda small...\" I grumbled as I pushed against the table for the millionth time, barely managing to get any leeway for my largeness, \"Gawd... have you even <i>seen</i> our waitress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop complaining, they just opened.\" Alice dunked a breadstick in a tiny dish of olive oil, \"Besides, they were nice enough to give us each a basket of these breadsticks while we waited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they should have brought <i>three</i>.\" I huffed, my stomach gurgling longingly as the smell of Greek meats wafted through the restaurant and into my nostrils, \"If we don't get into second gear here, I swear to God we'll go to that Jack-in-the-Box we passed on our way over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so we might still do that even if I get great service, just on the way home. I was pretty sure that they brought the double order of breadsticks in hopes of sating my ginormous appetite while they got their slow asses moving, but they didn't count on Alice being able to pack it away too. My basket was long gone, and so was the buttery residue left on my chubby little fingertips, and Alice was almost done with hers. Seriously, what was the hold up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally I see someone in the distance. A plump Greek woman about my Mom's age in a yellow dress and an apron. She's got a notepad and a dumbfounded look on her face as she comes closer to me, so I can only guess that she's our waitress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning ladies.\" her accent was about as thick as her figure, and I could tell that she was doing her best not to stare at me, \"What can I start you off with this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... How big is the Turkey Gyro pizza?\" I asked, holding out my doughy arms about two feet apart, \"Like, this big? Because that's how big it looks on the menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took my waitress a second to register what I was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, it's only... one foot.\" she struggled with the imperial measurement, \"Personal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll have three of those.\" I said nonchalantly, \"And an order of baked spaghetti.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For both of you?\" she looked at Alice and back to me, \"Okay, and to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, that's all for me.\" I said proudly pointing to myself, \"And I'll have a Coke. Refills are free, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur waitress' eyes widened in astonishment of how huge my order (and my appetite) was. I saw her scribble it down on the notepad, looking back up at me in-between every other word. God I loved to freak people out like that. To order so much. It made people so nervous for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, um... I'll have the Greek Yogurt pancakes.\" Alice finished pleasantly, \"And I'll get a Sprite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you think we could get some more breadsticks over here too?\" I tack on, \"We're starving over here.\"</span></div></div>",

Like I eat a lot, that much is clear, but the portions here are huge. When she said the pizzas were one foot I knew what I was getting, however, what I didn't, no, couldn't predict was how gigantic the baked spaghetti would be. Seriously I expected something like a plate topped with a small portion of cheesy cooked pasta, instead, the waitress brought over an entire casserole dish that was half as wide as my belly and set it on the already crowded table. Even Alice's pancakes were as big as my pizzas, and she had five of them. All this alongside another two orders of breadsticks, I felt a little intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished setting our food down and brought us our drinks, the plump waitress told us politely to enjoy our meals and walked back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the spread in front of me, unsure of where to start, and before I could make my decision I saw Alice began to dig into her pancakes with feverish haste.

Plus these pants made my ass look great. I almost had to fight this really beefy heiffer for them right there on the sales floor, but it was so worth it. My nails look awesome, my hair looks <i>great</i>, and I'll be the first to admit that I would fuck myself so hard right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slip on this cute little black jacket to complete the whole \"look\" I'm going for.

Me, Mel Carlyle, nevous? It's been <i>so</i> long since I've been on a real date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so I told Alex to pick me up at my mom's house at seven.

He\u2019s about a head taller than me, and really skinny. His hair was the first thing that really caught my eye, if you can believe it. He sort of looked like a brunette Harry Potter, the way he kept it in the prefect balance of messy, yet still controlled. His square black glasses helped further the Potter comparisons. He was gazing back at me, looking me up and down in possible delight as he takes me in. ALL of me in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from what I could tell, he certainly didn\u2019t have any complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t have to tell you about how four years at an all-girls academy can lead to some\u2026experimenting. Lots of experimenting. But here in front of me was a boy, who wasn\u2019t my father, a distant relative, or a vaguely familiar son of a neighbor.  He looked to be right around the same age as me, he had an attractive sense of style, and if our conversations online were any indication, we really got along. Why the Hell not go out on the town with him? He\u2019d already earned a few points in my book by offering to pay for dinner, but it was still pretty obvious that he was a little jumpy about this whole first date thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026You\u2019re Melanie, right?\u201d He asked, his high voice sounding a bit unbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHi! Yeah\u2026 You\u2019re Alex then I take it?\u201d I answered back teasing a bit of my hair back behind my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned broadly, putting any fears that he might have freaked out at seeing a girl of my incredible size in person at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yep!\u201d he corrected himself eagerly, \u201cA-Alex Macdonald but uh\u2026 you uh, already knew that I guess\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did, we\u2019d only had a few conversations online but our full names had been one of the topics we covered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelanie Carlyle,\u201d I said in return before adding with a wink \u201c\u2026But let\u2019s keep it short. Call me Mel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out this fake sounding bark of a laugh, adjusting his starchy posture, still managing to look all stiff and tense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, my cars right over there!\u201d  He shouted and pointed with an indifferent wave of his hand in the general direction of his hatchback, his eyes though never left me.  Clearly he was even more nervous about this whole date thing than I was, but was there really anything wrong with that? I\u2019m pretty fucking huge! That\u2019s something to be intimidated by!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d I hummed as I slowly stepped forward, my thick thighs and hips barely inches from filling up the front doorway of my house.  \u201cWell, as much as I like standing here and looking at you Alex\u2026I <i>am </i>getting a bit hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I always have this little test to see if a guy is \u201cinto\u201d me (and by that, I totally mean how fat I am). It sounds weird, but trust me, I always get some sort of response. As the word \u2018hungry\u2019 leaves my lips, I start to rub my belly through the thin fabric of my top, pressing it out a little further as I make long seductive strokes against my gut. Nothing too weird, right? Okay, pretty weird. But it works. Alex\u2019s eyes very quickly dropped from \u201cawkward amounts of eye contact\u201d to staring almost directly at my belly. Yeah, total chubby chaser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded \u201cRight. I-er-uh\u201d the poor guy didn\u2019t even get to finish his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that English?\u201d I teased, purposely adding a bit more \u2018body language\u2019 to my waddle than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was eating it up, in fact it took him a moment to snap out of the daze he was in, but he rushed over and met me at the car, gentlemanly holding the door open for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, h-here lemme get that for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled back, before grimacing at the task before me. Cars and I don\u2019t really\u2026 get along very well. Awkwardly, I clamber into his Hatchback, doing my best to keep my badonkadok behind bumping into anything OR accidentally flashing Alex a look at any of my supremely fat ass.  Somehow I managed, the car dipping noticeably under my weight as I plopped myself into the passenger seat. I also somehow managed to slide the seat back enough to buy my big belly some breathing room, so he at least had one thing going for him: this car of his can handle a girl as big as I am, at least <i>for now</i> anyways. Alex had already quickly slid into his seat behind the driver\u2019s wheel. Meanwhile, I, only after holding my breath and stretching far more than I was comfortable with, managed to get my seat-belt secured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhew! Phase one complete! Onto Phase two\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, for dinner tonight\u2026.\u201d Began Alex starting his car, and turning back onto the main streets, \u201cI thought maybe\u2026 <i>you\u2019d</i> like to decide?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumph\u201d I snorted. Alex was already dancing around the topics of food, my giant stomach, and my giant stomach being filled with as much food as it could possibly handle and he could afford. And as far as topics of first dates go I wasn't exactly sure if I should let him know just how much of a <b>BIG </b> foodee I was, and all about the, you know, still trying to getting bigger everyday part, but I wanted him to loosen up a bit you know? So I decided to make him to play his hand, and see what he had in mind... \u201cYou\u2019re driving, so I do believe that makes <i>you </i>in charge for tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex grinned, showing he might have already had a back up plan in mind just in case I gave such an answer. \u201cWell\u2026.\u201d  </span></div></div>",

He had brought up the little place called Mug Shots, and his job there in every conversation we\u2019d had online. The familiar topic seemed to relax him a bit and he began to open up more as he drove. \u201cWell, it's not just coffee shop, it's more sorta like a bakery-caf\u00e9. It\u2019s really just an awesome place. We\u2019ve got this brand new espresso machine that looks like something out of the terminator, and we\u2019ve got a whole bookshelf of free books we take from anybody who wants to donate, a mini stage where people-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds\u2026nice\u2026But you know\u2026 <i>dinner</i>?\u201d It wasn't too forward of me, right? I mean, he\u2019s got to know that when a girl my size says she\u2019s hungry, she means it. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right! Well we do food too! Nothing super fancy, but big bowls of soup, and tons of fresh baked bread and all that sort of stuff, in fact we make so much of it some days we end up throwing some of it out. You\u2019ll see when we get there\u2026.\u201d He made a right turn effortlessly clearly excited about where we were headed, his mouth going on as fast as the car, not that I minded, I was glad he was getting over any shyness he may have had. \"-and we really  didn\u2019t do the full menu stuff till after I started working there\u2026Actually BEFORE I started working there, there was this girl named Laura who was always super nice when I\u2019d get a coffee there.  In fact you two met you\u2019d probably be good friends, but she\u2019s usually works the morning shifts now, at night\u2026\u2026..Oh, shit.\u201d He said suddenly pumping the breaks on the car, a block away from Mug Shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d I asked breathlessly. Something sour had clearly come over Alex as his mood had changed completely. He\u2019d pumped the breaks so hard I seriously thought my belly was going to break the seat belt, and those were not the kind of stretch marks I was interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nevermind.\u201d He said calmly, ripping the steering wheel in the other direction, \u201cWe can just, uh\u2026 eat somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You can tell me. Is it something to do with Laura?\u201d 95% sincerely interested and 5% because I did not want to endure another lengthy car trip, without getting something, ANYTHING to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it's not her, <i>Laura</i>\u2019s great. It's....R-Really Mel, it\u2019s nothing. I just- I wasn\u2019t thinking\u2026\u201d he sighed, readjusting his wheel, and shifting back onto Main Street. \u201cI just kinda\u2026 forgot is all. There\u2019s sorta been a, uh\u2026 schedule change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the illuminated MUGSHOTS sign faded from you, I had to wonder what the actual fuck did <u>his </u>schedule change have to do with <u>my </u>appetite?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-It\u2019s kind of why I have Friday nights off now\u2026It\u2019s because\u2026My last girlfriend is working right now\u2026\u201d he grimaced heavily as the words fell out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!...<i>Oh</i>\u2026\u201d Now I  could see exactly why he was suddenly so freaked out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean I guess that\u2019s why they tell you don\u2019t date your co-workers, things with me and Danielle...\u201d he said, his throat sounding a bit clogged, \u201cThey didn\u2019t really end up on the happiest note. But, hey... Life goes on right?... Sorry, I freaked, I\u2019m just being stupid...Let\u2019s just go back to Mug Shots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spun back around and drove into downtown. Finally, after about twenty minutes since the whole date had started, and with my stomach about to collapse on itself, we arrived at a dinky little coffee shop, the aroma of the mornings baked goods still wafting through the rafters, sprinkled with the sweet smells of roasted coffee beans and vanilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Mug Shots!\u201d a decidedly feminine tone came from the cash register, \u201cWhat can I do for you toda-Oh\u2026It\u2019s you. Hey Alex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s when I saw her; Danielle, Alex\u2019s ex-girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Not at all. This girl was absolutely massive. She was bigger than I was, and it wasn't even close. I don't think I had ever felt so small in my entire life, and I made it through Buttercombe. I couldn't help but to just stare here up and down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long auburn hair fell in locks to her shoulders, framing her fat face perfectly. Her cheeks were so chubby that her bright green eyes were pushed slightly closed. Her jowls cascaded down the sides of her face, past the cute little button of her actual chin into the second, third, and countless other chins beneath. The lowest of these chins fell into the crevasse that was her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown apron, probably large enough to cover four fully grown men on its own, and the maroon polo behind it were no match for the boulders hanging off of her chest. Easily twice the size of my own titanic titties, her breasts were trapped in an obviously too small bra, pouring over the top and bulging into the relative freedom of her unbuttoned polo. The freedom inside the shirt wasn't enough though, as they squeezed their way free upwards through the collar's opening, bubbling up slightly, forming a long canyon of tightly squeezed together cleavage that rose and fell with every breath. How she could even reach the register with her flabby arms stretched out from her apron was beyond me. Her upper arms folded over at the elbows, making rolls that would make some girls stomachs jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly hid below her tits. And when I say hid, I mean hiding in the way a kid covers his eyes and says \"you can see me.\" Her belly extended far enough in front of her to create a small shelf, making a crease in the apron that was trapped between her massive boobs and that giant gut. Though the apron hid them slightly, you could see the edge of at least two rolls making there way through her belly. Her ample love handles were on full display, flying out from the sides of her apron. They poured over the sides of her pants, creating countless rolls piled up over where the waist would have been. The lowest of these was bare, as the poor polo she was wearing had been stretched well past its furthest limits containing even the higher handles. She could only imagine her bare belly hanging out behind the apron, quivering with every little movement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counter was low enough that you could see her hips just below her copious love handles. The seams on her pants were stretched and seemed to be whining with every movement, just waiting to blow out catastrophically. The fabric was stretched so tightly that I swear I could see through it, not that any underwear would be visible behind her countless rolls. Mercilessly, the counter blocked any view of her thighs and below, though I know they had to be quite beefy to support all of the lard weighing them down. My angle also blocked any chance to sneak a peek at her ass, though I can only assume it was ample. Based on how she was standing, It almost seemed as though she was leaning on the wall behind her, even though it was feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was awestruck. Here I was, on a date with some guy that seems to be going well, and I'm hit with this! Fuck me right? I didn't know if I was turned on or jealous. I mean, she made me feel... skinny. I wanted those rolls on me. I wanted all that fat weighing me down. I wanted my god damn tits to be so huge they were literally popping out of the biggest shirt I've ever seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you came here for drinks and food. Can you just ring yourself up? It's dead and I need a break,\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... uh, ya... I can do that. See you Danielle.\" I'd never tell him, but thank god he said yes! As she waddled around the counter and out through an alarmingly large set of double doors, her ass came into full view. It was beautiful. Two globes, each the size of a beach ball, fighting to free themselves of the tyranny of pants that were way to small. The tops of each cheek poured over the waist of her pants, pushing her exposed back rolls higher. She didn't even try to fix her polo, just letting it ride further up her rolls with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed her way through the double doors, and suddenly it was just Alex and I again. I had just sat there for what seemed like forever, gawking over gluttony made incarnate, and suddenly I realized I was supposed to be on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex slipped behind the counter, apparently deciding not to mention my obvious lady boner for his ex-girlfriend. He simply asked, \"So you said you were hungry?\" He sheepishly grinned and motioned to the largest pastry display I had ever seen, let alone ignored, in my whole life. First a girl who makes me feel small, and now a pastry display that Zeus himself would struggle to fully comprehend. What could I possibly say?</span></div></div>",

I gotta give it to him, even in the face of a ridiculous situation he kept his eyes on the prize and brought me more food than I thought any coffee shop could ever hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly my normal dinner fare, but I'm not going to complain about more fattening food!

Walking away, her massive ass jiggling and wobbling. I lusted for that.

Anywho...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know who I said it ended badly?\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do... recall...\" I snorted out between mouthfuls of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You see...

On one hand, I couldn't have been more turned on if I was being funnel fed the most decadent milkshake in the world while an army of men, hell throw in a few women even, massaged every inch of my ever growing fat.

Anyway, I just thought I'd warn you - when we first started dating, I was a lot smaller than you are, and Alex managed to double my weight and then some before I dumped him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you dump him?\" I asked, playing naive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious?  Would you want to be my size, let alone bigger? I've spent the last four months losing weight, trying to get rid of this,\" she gestured to her stupendous gut, \"and it'll take years to undo the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'd LOVE to be your size!\" I replied perkily.  \"To be big like you has been my dream for years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

I look forward to finding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drop my 'dainty' tush onto the passenger seat of Alex's car, and he snicks the door shut. \"OK,\" he says, \"that was my choice for the start of our date - now tell me where you'd like to go for the rest of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now, those pastries were a good appetiser, but really, I need a real dinner.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think we should hit up Chow's!\" I suggested happily. Chow's was a local buffet known by all fatties for its generous all you can eat option. Unlike most other buffets where \"all you can eat\" was said with a wink and a waiter bringing your check after trip number two, the Chows almost seemed to encourage you to keep going. The owner had to be a secret feeder. Besides, it would be a relatively inexpensive way to see what kind of feeder Alex really was to deserve that warning from Danielle. What can I say, I can be a generous goddess at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ya, Chow's! That's a great idea, I haven't been there since... I mean... It's been a while since I've been there.\" Oh ho ho, seems like I wasn't the only fatty who craved the greasiest chow mein known to man. So, I'd have some expectations to live up to. All the better. As if to punctuate my thoughts, my stomach decided to join the conversation with a loud grumble. I mean, come on. A tray full of pastries was great, as an appetizer, but I was ready for an actual meal. \"It's been a while for me, too! They've got the best chow mein I've ever had. And I can never get enough of those deep fried cream cheese wontons!\" Switching topics to food seemed to have been a good idea. We talked about our favorite foods and restaurants around town as he drove the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the talk was just making me hungrier and hungrier though. Luckily, it was a fairly short trip to Chow's. He was going to let me off at the front, but there was a spot literally three steps away. We walked in and were quickly seated, the somewhat chunky hostess taking us to a booth just across from the first buffet table. I know what you're thinking, aren't booths and fat girls essentially mortal enemies? Maybe in some places, but another point in the Mr. Chow is totally a feeder column was how roomy some of the booths were. I guess \"roomy\" was a better description, considering I could make anything (well, <i>almost</i> anything it seemed now) feel small. Plus, I always enjoyed providing a jiggly show as I scooted my way across the bench. Judging by how quickly he sat down, I'd say Alex enjoyed the show as well. As my jiggles slowly came to a rest, my belly made solid contact with the table, forming a small roll. My ass oozed out under me, filling a good portion of the bench. Another plus for booths and fat girls: not having to ask for two, occasionally three, chairs to fit my fat ass. Though the responses to that question could always be fun...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will you two be having tonight?\" The waitress's question broke through my personal revelry. Alex was prepared though, replying \"We'll have two of the Best Buffets please.\" Oh boy, Alex was coming in hot. The Best Buffet, despite its corny name, actually was the best. It was all you can eat, duh, plus it included the dessert bar, endless drinks, and samples of the chef's specials brought to your table fairly often. Even I didn't splurge on it very often. \"Of course,\" the waitress said with a wry smile for Alex. His confident smirk faded to sheepishness just slightly at that. \"So what drinks can I get started for you?\" was next, with the little smile still plastered to her face. As she was still looking at Alex, he replied, \"After you Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, let's see... I think I'll go with the creamy frozen green tea to start.\" As the name might have given away, this was really a milkshake with a hint of green tea added. It tasted like a liquefied version of one of those mochi treats. \"Good choice! And for you?\" the waitress said to me before swinging her attention back to Alex. \"I think I'll stick with just the plain green tea for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, I'll be sure to get those right out for you. Feel free to start on the buffet whenever you'd like and I hope you enjoy your meal!\" And with that, she spun around and headed off to the kitchen. If I hadn't been showing a canyon of cleavage out of my little green top, I'm sure Alex would have enjoyed seeing her plump little rump swaying as she walked off. I know I sure did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to bring my attention back to the important things, Alex chimed in \"I don't know about you, but I'm ready to get started on that buffet,\" with a little wink to me. Look at that, get this sheepish little feeder into a buffet and suddenly he's bursting with confidence! My stomach groaned in answer for me as I said \"You have no idea!\" maybe just a hair too eagerly. With that, I got the jiggle show going again As I scooted my way back out of the booth. He came over to help me up, which would have been really sweet if I wasn't sure it was mostly just for the better view. I took my jacket off to make some room and noticed all of the jiggling had some side affects. My shirt had pulled itself free from my pants and was beginning to make its way up my rolls. I debated leaving it, and I'm sure Alex wouldn't have minded, before quickly tucking it back in and quickly adjusting my bra. What, it was still a first date! I couldn't let myself just completely go. That, and it gave me a good excuse to get some quick fold fondling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe led me to the first island of treats, the smell of greasy Asian food filling my nostrils and making me waddle faster. We grabbed our plates and started loading up. I started with a good carb-y base of half chow mein, half fried rice all mixed together. With that filling the first layer of the plate, I moved on to piling loads of sweet and sour chicken on top, making sure to ladle on plenty of extra sauce. I continued piling with General Tso's chicken, Mongolian Beef, Beef and Beef (ok, maybe a couple pieces of broccoli snuck their way on too), and anything else I passed by. Eventually I ended up with  a plate that looked straight out of a cartoon, piled with food until it it reached the top shelf of my tits. Pleased with my work I began my slow, careful waddle back to our table. Alex was there waiting for me with his normal looking plate. Our drinks had also arrived, his in a cute little teapot and mug, mine in a cup that would rival a big gulp from 7/11. I was also greeted by the smells of our first sample: Peking Duck. Continuing the \"Mr. Chow is absolutely a feeder\" trend, the sample would have passed for a serving for two in any other establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gently set my plate down before plopping my fat ass down and sliding along the bench. Good thing my plate was piled high enough to impede Alex's view, as the canyon atop my chest became just a bit deeper with the maneuver. Readjustments could wait though, there was food in front of me! \"That's a pretty impressive piling technique,\" I heard from across the table. I looked up to a smirk across his face before answering, \"What, you expect me to keep up this dainty figure with anything less?\" gesturing to my ample form for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying even a NASA engineer would be proud of such an impressive structure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I can't have both brains and beauty?\" Now it was my turn to wink back at him. His smile was broad and he was clearly loosening up a bit. A growling stomach reminded me that charm doesn't fill bellies, so I reached for my fork and began digging in. You might not realized it, but there's just as much art to devouring a piled high plate as there is in constructing it. It's like playing a delicious game of jenga, pulling out just the right morsel before stuffing it in your mouth. Not letting my glorified milkshake go to waste, I alternated bites of beef with slurps of shake. It was a struggle to keep from simply double fisting the fork/cup combo. And don't think I forgot about that luscious fatty duck sitting in front of me either. The dish was mostly crispy, fatty skin with a bit of meat. With every bite, crunch, and slurp I swear I could feel my pants getting tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made it about halfway through my pile, crumble covered tit valley fully exposed to Alex again, before I realized neither of us had really said anything since my feasting began. I looked up from my delicious conquest and he had barely touched his own food. He was just sitting gawking at me, with a smile that couldn't be any bigger. I took a quick chug of my milkshake as he said, \"Damn, you can put it away just as well as you can pile it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had plenty of time and practice. Skills like these don't just appear overnight!\" It was true, it took plenty of hard work and dedication during my time at Buttercombe to build up this appetite! Little had I know all of my stuffings there were just the preview...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sure. And I'm sure with a little more time and practice...\" He tapered off with a wolfish grin now covering his face. \"I mean, I'm just impressed. I haven't seen many girls able to pack it away quick like you. I'm just glad you seem to enjoy it.\" Awwwwwww, that was sweet of him. I gave him a big smile between bites of sweet and sour pork. What, you thought I'd stop eating just to start a little conversation? Even on a first date, priorities people! \"Let me go grab you some more, wouldn't want you to run out while I can help it,\" was his response to my smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so sweet of you, thanks Alex.\" I mean, I still had a good third of my first plate left, but no way was I turning down someone else bringing me food. He scooted himself out of our booth and walked over to the buffet, hunching over slightly. With no more distractions, I set myself back to the work in front of me. Quicker than I would have guessed I reached my carby base layer, now soaked in all of the sauces that had been loaded on top of it. You wouldn't think sweet and Tso and mongolian would work, but it was always the best part of any plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I was just getting to the last bites of rice with the leftover duck skins sprinkled on top, Alex returned with a plate nearly as impressive in height as my first one. As he set it down I was shocked that it may have actually had more food than the one I had gotten for myself. Before I could start my attack though...</span></div></div>",

I guess it was partially my fault, after all, I had <i>kinda accidentally but not really accidentally </i> tapped the \"Girls\" button on my dating profile...  And this one, she was something.  Her long, brownish-red hair had only drawn more interest towards her frankly perfect face.  Straight white teeth, a decent tan, gorgeous eyes, and subtle dimples?  Count me in... I mean, kinda.  I guess I <i> kinda </i> like girls.  I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <b>ANYWAYS</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She was seriously hot.  She was squeezed into a simple blue dress, but it didn't leave much to the imagination.  Her breasts were giving off a fair amount of cleavage but still maintaining moderation, her midsection was clearly defined- as in, it was obvious that she worked out and kept her weight down, but not muscular, and her legs... Well, let's just say they weren't <i>too</i> exposed, but... I liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And judging by the way she was giving me the stare-down, I was guessing she was somewhat impressed.  Not to be too blunt, but I stopped caring about fashion as soon as I was unable to wear anything that wasn't sweat pants, yoga pants, or super stretchy jeans.  Having a fat ass along with a fatter gut, meant most fashionistas couldn't give me a better recommendation than a Muumuu.  So my outfit was less impressive than hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And while I was somewhat interested in investing into an inevitable relationship, I wasn't averse to a fling.  And this girl, Alexis, well... While we had a lot in common, she certainly screamed of a fling.  She liked bigger girls, and had a lot of cash.  A LOT.  And so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Hey yourself, cutie.  Where do you wanna go?

I am fully aware that I eat a lot--a <i>very</i> lot--and sometimes that doesn't agree with people's wallets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why it surprised me when, out of every place in town, Alexis chose Patrick's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, don't get me wrong, I <i>love</i> Patrick's. My dad used to take me and Alice there when Mom wasn't watching and let us get all the unhealthy crap we wanted, a tradition he continued to do even after the divorce. Seriously, whenever he wanted to spite mom, he spoiled us. Which was, in a word, fantastic. And this was his idea of spoiling me; the greasiest spoon in town with prices that reflected the quality of the food with which you put into your body. I hadn't been here since I moved out, and honestly my mouth was already watering at the prospect of stuffing my face with those gi-fucking-gantic onion rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just kind of weird that out of all the places she chose to go to, she had to pick the one where me and my <i>Dad</i> used to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoo... half a point for her on the good date scale?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, if it ain't Mel!\" came the familiar voice of the owner, Patrick, as he came out to walk us to a table, \"I haven't seen you in a <i>minute</i>, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mr. Hines.\" I smiled warmly, a little weirded out that he was seeing me here on a date. With a girl. \"Can we get a booth for two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure you can, sweetie, lemme just go wipe one down for ya.\" he smiled, grabbing two menus and heading off into the dining area, leaving Alexis and I alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>know</i> the <i>owner</i>?\" Alexis sounded so pleased with the fact that me, a fat girl of extraordinary calibur, was on such good terms with the owner of a restaurant, \"Is that how you got so... mmm...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe just a little.\" I winked, patting the side of my gut playfully as it wobbled beneath my top.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of my favorite things about Patrick (well, along with the greasy menu) was that the booths didn't have stationary tables.  I assumed it was for larger parties, so they could snag a table or two for longer setups, but seeing as I had never seen a party larger than 3 (albeit usually weighing enough for a party of 4 or 5- Patrick's didn't attract the healthiest crowd), I had never seen them moved out of a booth.  Still, when wiggling my way in, I apologized briefly as I scooted the table towards Alexis and squeezed myself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, it's... it's kinda <i>hot</i>.\"  Welp, that cemented it.  This girl clearly didn't hold reservations in regards to subtlety.  I barely refrained from rolling my eyes- I hope this night didn't turn into nothing but throaty whispers about how large I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anyways, what made you pick this place?\"  I said nonchalantly as I pondered over what flavor of malt to get- I already knew what I was getting off the menu, especially if Alexis was paying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis blushed a tiny bit, clearly staring at my gut which was pressed lightly into the table.  \"I, uh, read a review about it being really good?\"  I had my doubts.  As far as I knew, there were only two Yelp reviews, and my Mom had written it after a particularly belt-busting day, leading to a large fight between her and Dad.  As far as I recalled, the term \"Despicable, unhealthy, and frankly, grotesque\" was her tagline, followed by her rambling about how many calories the menu probably had.  Frankly, I thought it was a bit of a low blow, even for her.  The other review was very positive, but went on to say that they ate 2 servings of fries, and a triple cheeseburger- my guess is the person was probably slightly smaller than me, so it stood to reason they'd dig the place.  I only had to guess which one she read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the review was right, whatever it was.  This place is pretty damn good.\"  I said with a smile.  No point in being bitchy about her transparent love for my body- hell, I loved my body too.  Just hoped she wouldn't be too aggressive.  \"Anyways, you haven't even looked at the menu, aren't you gonna check it out?\"  I asked, noticing she hadn't touched it.  She awkwardly stared at it for a minute, before picking it up gently.  I almost felt bad, this girl clearly was in over her head.  I mean, I had made it pretty clear that I was a big girl, but she seemed shell-shocked a bit.  So, when Patrick strode over, I decided to put on a little show for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, Mel!\"  He said with his usual gusto.  \"Whatcha thinkin' for starters?\"  The man knew me well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think, since I can't pick, I'm going to get a chocolate malt AND a strawberry shake, along with an order of onion rings, and a double side of honey mustard, if ya please, shugah.\"  I threw on a <i>terrible</i> Southern drawl on the end, which got a chuckle out of Patrick and a giggle out of Alexis- although I couldn't tell if hers was from my stupid attempt at humor or at the fact that I just ordered 1200 calories worth of food before the main course.  \"Oh, Alexis, you want anything?\"  I asked innocently, just to drive the point home that I wasn't sharing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.  Just a water, thanks.\"  She said quietly, and Patrick gave a quick affirmative before whisking off behind the counter.  \"Holy <i>shit</i>, that's a lot of food.  Do you really think you'll still-\"  She said quietly, eyes wide over the top of her menu, but I cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm kinda... Fat.  And I need a lot of food.  So yes, I'm pretty sure I can finish it all, and still get a burger.\"  I gave her a wink, which sent her hiding under her menu again.  Damn, for a girl that apparently lived in a veritable mansion, who owned fucking horses, and drove a brand new car that probably could pay off our house mortgage, this girl wasn't exactly too keen on conversation.  Still, she was footing the bill, I guess I could give her a bit of a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the appetizer round came out, along with our drinks, Alexis had set her menu down, so Patrick took our orders.  I let Alexis go first so I could slam down one of my drinks, because my stomach was rumbling something fierce by now and I couldn't quite concentrate.  She ordered a chicken salad- of course, with her skinny figure, I'm sure she didn't realize that it was covered in chicken tenders and absolutely drenched in ranch dressing, but I'm sure she would be too busy staring at me to notice, since when Patrick got to me, I was down one malt but still starving, and so I said- \"I need a triple cheeseburger deluxe, with fries, of course, an adult grilled cheese, with bacon, of <i>course</i>, and, oh, I dunno, why don't I get a side- no, scratch that, an order- of the mac and cheese.  And a Coke, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis had turned bright red.  Damn, this girl was really transparent about her preferences.  Patrick, of course, didn't miss a beat.  \"Just like the old days, girl.\"  He said with a grin as he scooped off the menus and made his way to the back.  Alexis had slouched slightly and her mouth was open.  Shit, was I the first girl she ever saw do this?  I almost felt a little bad, and so, with all of my social grace, I asked-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, have you never been with someone who eats like this?\"  Her face got even redder, if such a thing was possible.  She awkwardly stuttered for a bit, and then said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually.  You, uh... I mean, that is to say, I don't really, leave the house much.\"  I could tell.  \"I mean, if we're being honest about it, I, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cut her off, I could only take a guess at what she was going to say.  \"Look, Alexis, let's just take this one thing at a time.  Tell me a bit about yourself, yeah?  I mean, I'm still gonna pig out, because that's just what I do, but don't think this is a thing- not yet, anyways.  I barely know you!\"  I felt a little bad, but put it the best way I could.  She didn't seem too defeated by the comment, which was good.  I mean, I may come across a little bombastic, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna rush into something with someone I don't know.  Anyways, we got to talking, and-</span></div></div>",

He made the look work somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mel, it's nice to finally get to meet you.\" He spoke in a deep baritone, that sent shivers down my spine, and stuck out his hand for a handshake. Deciding to be a little more forward, I instead opted for a hug, feeling my huge belly and breasts mush against him. \"It's nice to meet you too, Alex!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, he was a total hunk, and best of all, he was into fat chicks.

From his descriptions of his favourite foods, I had hopes he would have about my appetite, too, but it's hard to judge on-line.  The massive mound of man-meat at my door certainly met the age and weight description - he was huge, and handsome!  His polo shirt covered all of his gut, and looked neat and tidy even as it stretched around a gut bigger than mine - though I hoped the khakis below had a stretch rugby waist, not a belt (couldn't tell, gut overhang, you know).  His shoulders were much broader than mine, and his arms ditto - and my arms are impressively big and fat!  His face - well, it was handsome, big cheeks, nice nose, big mouth, broad smile, warm twinkly eyes - and he had clearly spent some time on his hair, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel?\" he asked, standing there, looking delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Alex?\" I replied.  \"Ready to show a big girl a good time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that big girl is ready for a big boy to take her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready; let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waddled my massive self out the door - putting on the fat girl slow strut for my hunky date - and looked to see</span></div></div>",

I said some things, she said some things, Dad said some things, and long story short, I decided to take my residence elsewhere. How could I be expected to live in a house with that woman constantly nagging me to eat right and exercise when I made it <i>abundantly</i> clear by how freakin' fat I was that I would be having absolutely none of that? I had my pride, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...okay, she kicked me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her defense, I guess I kind of am hard to live with. I mean, I weigh four hundred pounds. Like it or not, shit <i>is</i> going to get knocked over by my ridiculous badonkadonk. Or get crushed underneath it. Whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hey, silver linings, right? I was given a week to get out and find a place to stay on my own when, in a moment of the most pure unadulterated kindness that my fat ass had ever been shown, my Aunt Rhonda offered me a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started out as your standard auntie-niece phone call. Seriously, she called me to tell me congratulations on graduating and it eventually led into what a bitch my mom was being. Except, you know, I couldn't use the b-word because that was kind of her sister. So, long story short, she told me that if I didn't have a place to go by the end of the week, she'd pay for the trip down to her house and that would be the end of it. And since all of my friends were kind of scattered across the country or taking residence in boarding school, I wasn't going to be able to move in with them any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how Aunt Rhonda became my favorite aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, we were pretty close before. As close as two people could be being on different sides of the East Coast. She lived down in South Carolina, which meant that our bonding had been somewhat stilted before all this happened. But since she was fronting the bill <i>and</i> a month's rent at her house, how could I say no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom didn't like it, but what did she care? It was my car, my decision, and my life. And she made that abundantly clear when she bitched me out for crushing the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...shit, did I forget to mention I did that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Aunt Rhonda never really got to see anyone on this side of the coast, so it was a really rare treat that any of us ever got to see her on the off chance that we actually got to spend any time with her. She and my mother always had some kind of beef between them. Probably because my mom was a controlling pathologically manipulative bitch. She had that effect on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a long drive down south and what probably amounted to at least two hundred cumulative dollars in impromptu drive-thru binges, I finally made my way to my new home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter my Aunt Rhonda\u2014</span></div></div>",

I mean, to me she was always my Aunt Rhonda. I didn\u2019t really see her enough to register similarities, let alone differences. But even I had to admit that my Aunt had picked up a lot more than an accent over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel!\u201d my Aunt squealed as she wrapped her arms around me as best she could, \u201cC\u2019mere sweetheart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt the shape of my supremely svelter aunt press deeply into the folds of my gut, which gurgled and churned approvingly as if to say \u2018hello\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom my understanding, my Aunt looked more like Grandpa than Grandma. Whereas me, my mom, my sister, and all my cousins were all short-to-average height, blonde and pie-faced, Aunt Rhonda had a much more statuesque appearance. She was tall, and had her thick black hair cut in this retro 50\u2019s \u2018do that I thought did her angular face a lot of justice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squeezed her back, wrapping around her waist and enveloping her motherly frame with my doughy arms. She let out this happy little noise of approval, almost like a little giggle, and gave me one last squeeze before I let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow don\u2019t say another word; <i>yes</i>, I can tell yer just <i>starvin\u2019</i> ain\u2019tcha?\u201d my Aunt said with a not-so-subtle glance at my gut, incompletely covered by my increasingly lack-luster t-shirt, \u201dNow you go right on inside\u2014don\u2019t worry about these bags or <i>nothin</i>\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave me an affectionate little kiss on the cheek and pat my shoulder pitiably<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor thing. You\u2019ve just been through so much, haven\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>so</i> have.\u201d I pouted, sticking out my lower lip as I leaned into her hand as it cupped my fat cheek, \u201cThank you so much again for letting me stay with you, Auntie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt shut the car door behind me with one expert kick, and stood proudly with her hands on her wide birthing hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP\u2019sshaw. Your mama can talk about how \u201cbackwards\u201d and \u201canti-progressivist\u201d we are down here, but at least <i>we</i> know how to take care of our own.\u201d My Aunt said with a definitive huff, \u201cNow c\u2019mon inside; you\u2019ve got great timin\u2019, dinner\u2019s almost done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I trudged my fat ass up the concrete walkway to their impressive ranch-style home. It was a lot nicer than I\u2019d expected. I mean, not that I was expecting anything <i>bad</i> but, and this might have been my Mother talking, South Carolina didn\u2019t exactly inspire images of picturesque typical suburban homes like this one. White picket fence, porch with rocking chairs on it, USC flags flapping in the warm summer night air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I wasn\u2019t exactly paying <i>attention</i> to any of that crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, my mind went straight to food as soon as I stepped out of the car. My Auntie hadn\u2019t been lying about dinner being almost ready\u2014my expertly trained nose could smell an old-fashioned country dinner from outside the house! I lumbered greedily towards the front door as soon as I was given the clear, feeling the frame brush lightly against my ample side-fat. My gut entered my new home first, already roaring and commanding to be fed. A few more steps and I was inside, smacking my lips and breathing heavily in a mixture of anxiety and exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I was safely inside and following blindly the smell of freshly-made biscuits, my Aunt Rhonda tumbled in after me:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetheart, Mel\u2019s here!\u201d she hollered up the stairwell (ugh. Stairs.

It was sort of hard to recognize him beyond that, because his face  was round and full with... two, maybe three chins? It was sort of hard to tell as he tumbled down the stairs. He had very large saggy moobs he had pretty wide hips for a man. His butt was large enough to eclipse whatever view of the hallway that his belly didn't. I'll admit that I felt a little weird looking at my uncles ass, but <i>damn</i>. I mean, you don't blame me, right? His arms and legs were large, but strong like tree trunks. His gut bounced as he lumbered downstairs, hanging a good four inches out of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Melly honey, good to have ya.\" Uncle Ted wheezed in his thick accent as he hugged me, our bellies touching<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trudged over to aunt Rhonda, and she wrapped her arms as far as they would go. I watched my aunt grab my uncles, managing to grab a fistful of booty flab. They shared a very passionate kiss before Ted waddled to his spot at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sweetie, me and your uncle get carried away sometimes.\" Aunt Rhonda said with a wink, getting our places ready. </span></div></div>",

She was my aunt and uncle\u2019s only daughter and, from what I understood, the only grandchild on my Uncle Ted\u2019s side. I guess this was sort of the natural progression to not having any siblings to compete with. When we were kids, I just sort of wrote her off as a little sheltered.

Well the roast is done, let\u2019s say we eat.\u201d Aunt Rhonda suggested quickly, clearly seeing the tension already building already between her niece and her own daughter. We moved to the large kitchen of the house, I waddled last out of the room, my big stomach bouncing out of the room ahead of me, the smells of a southern feast filling my lungs, and my gut, with the hint of the tasty feast to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda\u2019s cooking did not disappoint. Even with the fact it was the first real home cooked meal I had in days it was fantastic! My aunt was more than happy to pile my plate high with everything she had whipped up, and apparently seemed more than happy to do most of the talking, while I did most of the eating, although I manage to not completely forget all my manners as I was able to give a two syllable answer or a simple grunt now and then between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Ted, I mean well your Uncle Ted, I\u2019m sure you remember him, hair in a buzz cut? Glasses?\u201d  Asked my Aunt, done with her meager meal, and now eyeing me attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph\u201d I affirmed with my mouth full. God this gravy was delicious! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, he\u2019s away on another one of his business trip.

Her voice dropped an octave lower before she added \u201cThough I don\u2019t really get ta\u2019 cook that much now a days.\u201d giving me a knowing nod to Krystal. I glanced across the table, Krystal looked to have picked through the paltry portions that been on her plate and was now currently buried into her phone. I only continued to gorge myself on warm cornbread, hot ham, and biscuits covered in gravy by the ladleful! Truly I was the jealous one, why had her mom been the great chef?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was working through my plate of thirds of everything, when Krystal, gave a flick of her long dirty-blonde hair and got up from the table. \u201cMom I\u2019m headin\u2019 ta Lindsey\u2019s. I\u2019m probally\u2019 gonna\u2019 stay the night. So\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOhh, sweetie ya don\u2019t want to at least be here for yall\u2019 Cousin Mel\u2019s first night?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal shot a mean look to her own mother and gave a small equivalent of a shrug, as if to say, \u201cWhy are you even arguing with me about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant I could tell who was used to having their way around here as her mother quickly backed off the issue.  \u201cOk, well\u2026at least text me when you get there Krystal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gave a minor nod at this show of power, seeing things weren\u2019t going to change all of a sudden just because her nearly four-hundred pound cousin had crashed into their place like a fleshy wayward meteorite. <br>\r\n\u201cSee ya cuz\u201d I cut in as she got up from the table. We locked eyes, and I quickly grabbed the brick of cornbread on my plate and wedged as much as I could into my waiting gob as I eyed her back, in a way affirming that; Yes, this was how much I ate as a regular meal, and that, No, I would not be stopping or changing my fattening ways any time soon. Krystal\u2019s mouth opened reflexively out of shock at the sight.  Mel 2 \u2013 Krystal 0 as far as I was concerned, she managed to eke out a dim \u201cBye.\u201d before turning in disgust and heading out the front door happily away from what she saw as her embarrassment of a cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for me, Krystal\u2019s mother didn\u2019t happen to catch sight of my little stunt, before she turned back around to face me again, (I\u2019d had managed to chug down my second glass of milk to avoid choking.)  <br>\r\nMore time passed, and my aunt and I caught up some more, and let me tell my stomach felt perfect.  Not completely \u201cOmg so full I can\u2019t stand, my gut is at maximum capacity\u201d but I was happily content, in fact maybe a bit too content as I let a tiny burp slip, (okay it was a belch, let\u2019s be honest I was beyond tiny anything anymore.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I uh\u201d I said my face immediately reddening, after I literally burped in the face of such hospitality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, nothin\u2019 to worry about Mel, I\u2019m just glad you liked it. Heck\u2019 ya ate so much I don\u2019t even gotta worry about takin\u2019 care of the leftovers!\u201d My aunt gave a short laugh, and then seemed to catch up on what she just said, her face now reddening a bit.  \u201cOh, I mean, uh, it\u2019s not a bad thing-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean\u201d I assured her, giving her my patented winning grin, and insisting that keeping the kitchen left-over free would be my pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow seriously Mel, about earlier\u2026Don\u2019t pay any mind to what your cousin Krystal said. She\u2019s still a teenager, well, I mean, not like you aren\u2019t either\u2026She\u2019s just been stressed out lately, now that she\u2019s gotta take an online math course over the summer for school or she\u2019ll get held back as a Senior, and there\u2019s boy troubles\u2026Course I can only find out what I can in bits and pieces, she\u2019s over at our neighbor Lindsey\u2019s so much Krystal and I barely have a chance to have heart-to-heart like this now a days. Keep this hush between you an\u2019 me but I think that Lindsey girl is a bit of a bad influence on he. I remember when Krystal would love to\u2026Oh that reminds me! I got something special for dessert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heartbeat quickened and my eyes lit up, Aunt Rhonda clearly knew how to treat her guest\u2019s right, as I\u2019d almost forgot about dessert after that monstrously sized meal. Then my heart sank as I recalled what my aunt had considered a dessert from the few family get-togethers we\u2019d had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJello! Jello! It was almost as bad as nothing! No, it WAS as bad. I mean the stuff is like literally water and bones; sure it was as wobbly as I was but that\u2019s where my empathy ended. Don\u2019t get me started on people who try to hide it by calling it knocks blocks or *ugh* stuff it with vegetables, or *gag* buy it in sugar free variety! Just by pudding and call it day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bought ice cream!\u201d sang my savior Aunt Sally, pulling out a brick sized carton of double chocolate chunk. I gave a sigh of relief. \u201cKrystal\u2019s not one for sweets anymore, but I thought it be the perfect treat for the hot summer nights ahead.\u201d  She set the carton on the table and returned armed with two spoons in hand. Holy-ee Shit! She was going to eat right out of the carton with me! Oh, I wanted to whip out my phone and send my mom a text right then and there <i>soooo </i>bad. But I didn\u2019t and instead I enjoyed the first of what would hopefully be many a night of just hanging out with my awesome Aunt. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh my god Mel! It's been forever!\" my cousin squealed, before bounding across the room to give me a hug. Her arms, naturally, didn't reach all the way around me, but she didn't seem to care. I heard her murmur \"Mm... soft...\" as she squished up against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn right I'm soft! I give the best hugs in the world. One of the perks of being me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she broke off the hug, but she looked at me with sparkling eyes. I suddenly remembered that we <b>had</b> had some good times together during family reunions and such. It had just been, as Krystal had said, forever since we had seen each other (and unfortunately, that had been during those dark days where social media hadn't really been a thing). \"You were going to that fancy bee school, right Melly? You gotta tell me all about it!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, causing my everything to jiggle. The two of us sat down on a nearby sofa, and I regaled my cousin Krystal about my time at Buttercombe Academy. I mentioned the friends, the hardships, the unending struggle of keeping one's uniform updated. And, of course, I talked about the food. Krystal giggled when I talked about that. \"Well, that explains <i>this</i>,\" she said, poking me in the belly. She said it in a teasing, but not hateful, way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This</i>,\" I responded, patting my belly, \"Was going to happen regardless of where I was. Buttercombe just made it easy for me. Anyway, how are you doing, Krissy?\" My old nickname for her slipped out without me thinking about it. Damn, it was good to see Krystal again! She talked about her school and her friends, and was in the middle of a tale involving a boy who had tried to impress one of her friends when the both of us heard the front door of the house open and close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Aunt Rhonda say \"Evenin', Hon,\" to someone who obviously had to be my Uncle Ted. Krystal quickly sprang up and ran off to give her Dad a hug. It took me a moment to lift my considerably bigger ass off of the sofa. I'd forgotten how flighty my cousin could be. Still, there were worse people I was related to. I headed into the dining room myself, and said hello to the man. Uncle Ted was a husky man with muscled arms and a paunchy stomach; he was obviously the kind of guy who worked hard and partied hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, it was time for dinner. Which was, needless to say, excellent. My Aunt Rhonda could have outcooked any of chefs back at Buttercombe, and I say that with only a slight bias. There were biscuits, fried chicken, potatoes, and I even got to try grits for the first time. I liked 'em! There was no conversation over dinner as everyone ate with a gusto that I had only before seen in fellow Buttercombe students. Even Krystal wasn't holding back, which made me wonder how the hell she stayed so thin. She must have had one of those super metabolisms that I was glad I didn't possess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner ended with hearty belches from everyone around the table. I was feeling very happy and very stuffed. These were my kind of people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious as usual, Darlin',\" Uncle Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good, Mama,\" Krystal said, patting a stomach that I could swear was still as flat as a board. Where did it all go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was wonderful Aunt Rhonda. Thanks!\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that weren't nothin'\" Aunt Rhonda replied with a modesty that <b>had</b> to be false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mel, got any plans yet?\" Uncle Ted asked me, reclining in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was plannin' on taking Melly with me to the mall tomorrow!\" Krystal said brightly. She hadn't run the plan by me yet, but what the hell? It wasn't like I'd had tomorrow figured out anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Krystal and I set out in the hybrid car that Uncle Ted and Aunt Rhonda had splurged on for Krystal's 18th birthday. I wasn't jealous at all that my cousin's awesome parents had bought her a car and my hard-ass mom had gotten me a diet book. Yup, no envy here. Anyway, Krystal explained the plan on our way over to the mall.</span></div></div>",

We embraced, as well as we could, then she backed off slightly and said, \"We're going to have such fun together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon girls, supper's on the table in two minutes,\" Aunt Rhonda said, and Krystal turned to follow her into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Mel, we all help out,\" Krystal said, noting my non-following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" I replied, and put my massive booty into motion.  To tell the truth, I'd been slightly distracted by Krystal backside when she turned - she was bigger than I thought at first, because there was more in her booty than I'd expected from the front view.

But I realized very quickly that she was just winded doing from one end of the hall down to the next. As she came down the stairs, it became very clear to me that Krystal was anything but twiggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I knew it had been a while since I\u2019d seen her and all, but I just didn\u2019t expect Krystal to be so\u2026 to be so <i>fat</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, she was huge! And this was coming from a girl who had spent four years <i>getting</i> huge and being around girls of similar sizes! Krystal was about my height, with a belly that blocked the stairwell and tits that blinded her from the neck down. The bottom of her belly rolls were outlined by the thin grey leggings she\u2019d heroically managed to put on, and cute little dress\u2019 pattern had been completely distorted by the rampant growth of her rolls. Her face was round and swaddled in a thick double chin, her cheeks overly appled and creasing along the corners of her mouth. Her saddlebags brushed against the stairwell, slapping thickly against the little columns between the railings as she huffed and puffed herself down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m comin\u2019\u2026\u201d she puffed pathetically, \u201cMama...Don't start... without me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was, in all honesty, fucking flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I always remembered Krystal being a little spoiled when we were kids. A little whinier, and a little chubbier than everyone else at the time. But I never imagined that she might have grown up to be (almost!) my size. Seriously, I had spent so long being one of the biggest bitches in Buttercombe Academy, I downright <i>forgot</i> what it was like to see someone that close to four hundred pounds. Maybe <i>this</i> was what it felt like to be my Mom, watching me get fatter and fatter every time she saw me\u2026 except, y\u2019know, all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it, baby.\u201d My Aunt Rhonda said with an affectionate kiss on Krystal's puffy cheek, \u201cBut while I finish up in the kitchen, why don\u2019t you get a little better acquainted with your cousin Mel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess I'm not the only girl in the family with an appetite. Never would have figured your mom for much of a cook. No offense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d I fought back the ire that came from thoughts of my mother. \u201cBut she wasn't responsible for all this. If she had her way, I'd be a size 0. No, I got this at school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I told her about my time at Buttercombe; about my gains, my friends, my growing pride in my growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut really, it was just a lot of eating,\u201d I concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d Krystal said, patting her belly. \u201cMama's always been a great cook, but for a while now she's been real into trying out new recipes and then improving them, giving 'em a personal touch. I'm like her personal taste-tester, which suits me fine. I'd be stuffing my face all day anyway, but I love that Mama's finding new things for me to try. Though she can be a little pushy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, but the answer was made clear shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinnertime!\u201d Aunt Rhonda called, and I followed Krystal into the dining room (more than a little proud that she didn't have the magnificent ass that I did). The dining room table, a long, rectangular piece, was filled with dishes and bowls. I counted at least three entrees (catfish, fried chicken and pork chops) and several sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it just the three of us?\u201d I asked, looking at the settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTed is away on a business trip,\u201d Rhonda explained, referring to her husband and Krystal's father, \u201cSo it's just us ladies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really went all out,\u201d I said. Looking closer at each dish, I couldn't tell which looked more delicious. They were all so tantalizing, as if they had been made specially for a magazine shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is normal for her,\u201d Krystal replied. \u201cIf she'd outdone herself there would be more waiting on the kitchen counters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Rhonda said, \u201cI have a ham still in the oven, but you two have enough time to clear some of these plates and make room for it. So dig in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Krystal's lead, I started loading my plate with as much food as I could get. From the first bite (creamy mashed potatoes with butter and sausage gravy) I was in hog heaven. Everything tasted as good as it looked, Krystal's comment about her mother refining the recipes proven to be more than talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched my cousin for a couple minutes to gauge just how... unabashedly voracious I could be. There had been times when I would be eating and I would get into the zone, scarfing down my food as fast as I could, not caring about whatever sounds of eating or moans of pleasure I was making. This being my first meal in my new home, I wanted to make a good impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I saw how greedily Krystal was eating, and how Aunt Rhonda was not the least bit bothered, I started to loosen up. I began taking bigger bites, or pushing more food into my mouth before I was done chewing what was already there. When I loaded up my plates with seconds, thirds, fourths, I took bigger portions, going less for variety and more for quantity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda finished well before either of us, and she just sat there smiling contently as the two fat girls before her kept chowing down. Her attempts at small talk were either yes-no questions to us (that we could answer without pausing in our eating) or her talking at length about something. She mostly talked about her cooking, about the changes to each recipe she made, and about Krystal's favorite dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have to make them all for you. Get your thoughts on them as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the eighth course I was starting to get full, and after the drive down I was feeling sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d I said, pushing my plate away. I leaned back, hitching my t-shirt up and rolling the waistband of my pants down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can't be done yet,\u201d Aunt Rhonda said, shocked and a little bit offended. \u201cYou've barely tried the fried eggplant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't at max capacity yet, so I took some more and kept going, albeit a little slower now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I suppose Krystal didn't explain to you,\u201d Aunt Rhonda continued, \u201cthat we have a special rule in this house: we don't do leftovers. I know it's probably different from at your house, but down here we don't take food for granted. A lot of love goes into these meals, and I like to know it's appreciated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk about a guilt trip. After I was done with the eggplant I moved onto the sweetbread. I saw most of the table had been cleared, Krystal and I doing a number on the small feast already, so the thought of finishing what was left wasn't terrible. It's not like I was against the idea of eating more, but being pressured into it and going beyond what I wanted to naturally... that was a little weird. Still, first impressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were done Krystal and I were both slouching in our chairs, our bellies rock-solid and jutting forward. We were having trouble breathing, our eyes glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d Aunt Rhonda clapped her hands. \u201cI feel almost blessed to now have two hungry girls under my roof. I'm going to have so much fun feeding you gals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started cleaning up the table, while Krystal and I sat there immobilized by our packed guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDessert will be ready in about an hour, so don't go far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the table was cleared Aunt Rhonda sequestered herself in the kitchen, Krystal and I slowly reclaiming mobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll show you... to your... room,\u201d Krystal huffed. As we shuffled to the stairs, ponderously mounting each step, I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite a... meal. I haven't... eaten like that... since... Buttercombe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you... Mama... loves to cook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I ate like that... all the time... whew... I'd be twice as big... within a month.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Hope you packed stretchy pants, because your ass is going to get a lot bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure if Krystal was teasing or not, having fun with me as the newcomer unfamiliar with the family's customs. Could Aunt Rhonda really be cooking that much at every meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, she could. Dessert that night was pecan pie, Krystal and I each getting an entire one of our own, with whipped cream and doughnuts fried in lard on the side. Just a couple doughnuts, but the next morning at breakfast we each had a full dozen sitting at our places, along with the bacon, eggs, waffles, sausage, biscuits in gravy and hashbrowns filling the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen lunch was a parade of cold cut subs and chili, simpler fare which, it turned out, gave Aunt Rhonda more time to concentrate on dinner, another gut-busting avalanche of dishes that left Krystal and I stupefyingly stuck in our chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the tone for every day I was with Aunt Rhonda. It took more than two weeks for Krystal to show me around the town because we were expected to take every meal of every day at home, leaving us only a few hours in each day to venture out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that there was much to do in town. There was a pretty large mall, built just a few years before and still shiny and new, and a movie theater. Plus some stuff that didn't interest me, like a hunting lodge and paintball course. No, once I knew my way around town I found little reason to leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMade it easier for Aunt Rhonda, definitely. In addition to breakfast, lunch and dinner she was pushing a bevy of snacks on us. Most parents would lament their children spending all summer indoors, binge-watching Netflix, but Aunt Rhonda welcomed the chance to keep us glutted on goodies in the convenience of her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd don't go thinking I was an unwitting victim in this. I was still the fat-obsessed, gluttonous girl I had been when I got here, without a single qualm about taking advantage of Aunt Rhonda's generosity. I accepted every tray of snacks or plate of food happily, devouring it and eager for more. And Krystal was just as bad. She was more familiar than I how enabling her mother was, so she had even less reservations about spending all day either at the dining table or the couch in the living room, vacuuming up whatever food was in reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs comfortable with the set-up as she was, my cousin didn't have quite the same knack for eating or gaining that I did. My first month at Aunt Rhonda's passed with her swelling up fatter, reaching the size I had been when I first arrived at her house, but I had already left that number on the scale behind before then. My body had adapted to the abundance of food at Aunt Rhonda's by becoming even more demanding and even more frightened that a great famine was on the way. My stomach cried out for more and more food, and my body stored ever more fat all over itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ass was the main recipient; it wouldn't be much longer before Krystal and I together would be too big for the couch, and I had already outgrown the recliner next to it. Soon I'd have the couch to myself, my hips and thighs spreading across the cushions and, one day, reaching both armrests. Whether I was sitting or standing you could see a shelf of fat rolling out behind me, joining with my hips to create a crescent of fat surrounding three-quarters of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy belly was getting stretched out every day, yet it still claimed some of the new poundage for itself. Completely empty (something you would only see when I had just woken up and without my breakfast yet) it sagged over my sex and halfway down my thighs. Full, it could exceed the reach of my arms. My breasts looked like small potatoes next to my belly and ass, but they were more like small pumpkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp a little higher I had grown a fourth chin, even more of my neck now obscured by the cascading fat-falls of my face. Unless I raised my head it looked like I was sinking into a sea of fat; a wonderful image, and one I would work to bring closer to reality every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of my first month I had gained close to a hundred pounds, the milestone of weighing a quarter of a ton within my chubby-fingered grasp. This was more than I could have hoped for, but it was just the beginning. Aunt Rhonda was hooked on feeding me, and I was hooked on eating. Give it time, and I could be the fattest woman on Earth.</span></div></div>",

me, by the look on her face, she was just as surprised as i was by just the amount of food on the room, but after the initial shock we realized, this food looked even better than the usual (which already was insanely good)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls i hope you enjoy this, i worked very hard on it\" as soon as auntie finished talking i started stuffing my face with everything on the table, it was so... so... incredible, as if you feel like something can't get topped, but then you find a whole new level, it was imposible to describe, after 10 plates (I stopped feeling the time after the 6th plate) i wasn't even filling my plate, i just grabbed every food item my flabby arms reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only moment i stopped was because midway through the meal i suddenly can't reach the middle of the table, that was due to my stuffed belly hitting the edge table, but Aunt Rhonda quickly realized this and placed the plates and bowls closer to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours Krystal and I had made our way through what I would calculate to be three quarters of the feast, my face was red, glistening in sweat, my belly was tight and incredibly swollen, it would be holding me back of what had become at this point just stuffing myself blindly with every meal infront of me, but many other feelings and sensations kept me going, the fact of how delicious the food was, how horny i was of getting so stuffed and the idea of being even fatter, and a slight rivalry with Krystal over who was the bigger eater <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more hours later, we had finished the impossible meal, I had food leftovers all over my face, my clothes were covered in food stains, my face was beet red, and i was sweating bullets, my belly was rock-hard, pulsing at the beat of my heart, painfully full, and it had gotten so big that it pushed my breast close to my face, i also felt really light headed and my vision was even blurry, but i could see Krystal had a similar experience, her belly (while not as fat as mine) looked just as stuffed and painful, she had entered a food coma like status, she didn't talk any more and the only thing to come out of her mouth were some grunts and moans, we weren't getting up anytime soon so we just laid back and waited.<br>\r\n\"Did you girls enjoyed it?\" asked Aunt Rhonda \"it... was... *huff* amazing.... *hic* Auntie... you... *buuuurp* outdid... yourself...\" i told her struggling to get the words out of my mouth without feeling like i was going to explode, i was so full that it was even hard to take breaths. \"How about you sweetie?\" She looked at Krystal expecting an answer <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... *BWWWUUAARP* Uuuugh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter that Aunt Rhonda just chuckled and said \"glad both of you enjoyed it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround midnight, me and Krystal help each other walk to our rooms, we both spent the night on my room since Krystal would have to walk a whole walkway, we both squeeze together on my king size bed and we sleep, but i still heard some moaning out of Krystal, the next day we both woke up at 11am, still half full from the night before, and we decided that this would be as good a time as ever to weigh ourselves, i opened the package and there she was, our brand new scale (I call her a \"She\" since only other girls are supposed to know a girl's weight, no matter how proud of it they were.), she had a 1200 pound max capacity, steel frame, and even came with a tiny wireless screen, that would be of HUGE help since neither me or Krystal can see past our bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, i'll go first\" I said almost giggling to myself and feeling really excited, i place one foot on the scale and heave myself in order to raise the other one, \"can you recall what you weight was before you came here?\" Asked Krystal while looking at the weight reader, \"Sure, 409\", i was quite proud of that number but i was sure i would leave it behind real soon \"Well big girl, your weight is... 516 pounds\" WOW!, just WOW!, that i had gained 107 pounds in just little over a month!, next was Krystal, i stepped off the scale and she gives me the reader and she steps in it, \"what was your last weight at?\"<br>\r\n \"I'm not sure, but somewhere around 320\"<br>\r\n i looked at the screen \"416 pounds!\" Krystal was amazed when she heard that number her eyes widened, she was just as surprised as i was, she had gained roughly the same amount, but we knew that this was FAR from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAUTORS NOTE (AGAIN)<br>\r\n*I just realized that I might have ruined someones plan for this story, and for that im really sorry (mostly for not being on pair with the original) I have also tried TRIPLE checking everything so there are not that many spelling errors, I'm

She never said anything outright, but I knew enough about my mother to know that she just didn\u2019t really like anyone who was different than her. Add into the fact that she never really called Sally my Aunt Rhonda\u2019s wife\u2014things more along the lines of \u201cpartner\u201d, \u201cspecial friend\u201d, and \u201croommate\u201d\u2014 while bashing their home life at every opportunity, and it became pretty clear early on that I could add \u201chomophobe\u201d on the list of things that I didn\u2019t like about my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, they were always super cool with me and the rest of my family. My aunts always gave the best gifts at Christmas time, sent us care packages from time to time, and (let\u2019s be honest) were letting me live with them because my Mom was such a bitch. I think because they could never really have kids of their own, my aunts sort of looked at me, my sister, and all my cousins like their own kids\u2014except they only saw them once a year sometimes and didn\u2019t have to deal with them when they were bad. Which probably explains why Aunt Sally was so cool with me moving in with them and imposing my immensity on both of them, and the fact that I probably hadn\u2019t seen either one since I was shipped off to Buttercombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I understood it, my aunts had met on the internet when I was little. They dated for a while before taking the plunge, where my Aunt Rhonda moved down south and my Aunt Sally became my Aunt Sally. While my Aunt Sally worked a white collar job at some vehicle manufactoring company, my Aunt Rhonda got to stay home and play housewife while doing odd jobs here and there. I guess, between the two of them, they could support me. So I guess I didn't feel <i>too</i> bad about imposing myself.

Tall, long red hair, and looks that could kill. She always wore these three-piece ensembles with tight little skirts. Big breasts, a strong but not overly masculine jawline, a contender for a real life Wonder Woman. The fact that she towered over the rest of us, even the adults in the family, certainly helped my then little mind build up that image. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman who came down the stairs, however, wasn\u2019t really what most would consider Amazonian material. She was just as tall and her hair was just as red; it was literally almost everything else that had changed. Namely that her features, once strong and proud, hadn\u2019t so much <i>softened</i> as much as they had inflated. My Aunt Sally had been voluptuous all my life, no doubt, but never quite so dangerously so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Mel I hear?\u201d she huffed and puffed as she came down the stairs, gripping the guardrail with one hand as she gingerly lowered herself down one step at a time, \u201cHold on sweetie, lemme\u2026 lemme get down there first\u2026 phew\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly descended the stairs, my attention actually managed to shift to something other than the heavenly smells filling the house. She was even bigger up close\u2014something that, at least, had stayed the same. At such a huge height to begin with, I had no idea how much my aunt could have possibly weighed. She was at least a head or so taller than I was, and we looked to be almost the same amount of fatass. Her belly strained the buttons on her blouse and her fupa pressed tightly against her tentish skirt, managing to hold such a gut perfectly still as she lumbered down the stairs with all the grace of a Buttercombe graduate. Her features\u2014high cheekbones, strong chin, firm jawline\u2014had all been buried under pound upon pound of facial fat, framed by a Daytime-TV-Perfect hairdo of orange brown. Her chins touched the swell of her chest, leaving her no neck to speak of as she wrestled two ripened melons that even now threatened to pop the buttons on her blouse right at my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a second to catch her breath, gripping the column at the end of the stairwell tightly, before waddling closer towards me and wrapping me in this big, flabby, titteriffic hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d my Aunt Sally wheezed breathlessly, \u201cOh you got so <i>big</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 you too?\u201d I answered a little flabbergasted before I attempted to hug back, \u201cThanks for letting me stay with you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t mention it, sweetie. We\u2019re family.\u201d Aunt Sally said as she broke away\u2014I could see that the climb down the stairs had left her damp with sweat\u2014and gave me another look at just how closely this family was beginning to resemble me, \u201cWe\u2019d do it for ya anytime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven standing a few feet apart, our guts were still getting acquainted. They brushed up against each other as Aunt Sally fidgeted in place, sniffing around like I\u2019d been for the past few minutes before I got so seriously distracted. Somehow, Sally had been fattened up into a prize-winning porker\u2014and judging by the overpowering aroma of home-cooked kitchenry, I could only begin to guess the culprit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 smells good Rhonda.\u201d She turned her attention to my other aunt, \u201cIs that\u2026\u201d her voice fell as she let out a familiar noise of guttural satisfaction<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure is, sweetie!\u201d Aunt Rhonda said with a pinch of Sally\u2019s overly appled cheek, \u201cYour favorite\u2014meatloaf, fried chicken, and spaghetti casserole served with mashed potatoes, green beans, creamed corn and <i>lots</i> of macaroni pie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI practically started drooling right there as my suspicions were confirmed. My Aunt Sally held no such reservations and actually started smacking her lips before waddling towards the kitchen, a hungry glimmer in her eyes as she inadvertently gave me a great view of her ass that was easily the size of the broad side of a barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf my Aunt Sally was anything to go by, moving in with Aunt Rhonda was definitely the right decision if I wanted to fatten myself up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ushered me into the room, pulled a chair that was just big enough to support someone of my size and weight (or, rather I should say my Aunt Sally\u2019s size, since they were probably made with her in mind), and gave me a little napkin to put in my lap while she went to work on plopping a little bit of everything onto my plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pieces of country-fried chicken, a fat thigh and a juicy leg respectively, a mountain of mashed potatoes with a lake of gravy inside, three slates of meatloaf doused in ketchup to make a meaty slab of the stuff next to a serving of spaghetti casserole with so much meat and cheese I had trouble picking it apart from the equally enormous helping of macaroni pie were all plopped onto my plate with the tender love and care of a southern hostess, all served to me on what couldn\u2019t have been anything smaller than a platter. She set it down in front of me, gave me my silverware, and told me to dig in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo dig in I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I just fucking dove into my plate. Face-first, probably; my excitement sort of blurred my memory. But what I <i>do</i> know is that that was some of the best fucking food I\u2019d ever had in my entire life. The potatoes were buttery and flakey, the casserole was meaty and just the right amount of saucy, and the meatloaf was so fucking perfect that I only regret I couldn\u2019t have made a sandwich out of it. Seriously, my Aunt Rhonda had every lunchlady back at Buttercombe beat by a wide mile when it came to cooking up fat-girl feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was just the first plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I continued to stuff\u2014no, <i>gorge</i> myself on all of my aunt\u2019s dinner delicacies, my mind started to get fuzzy. This food was so good, so delicious, I honestly don\u2019t think that I would have stopped eating it if I didn\u2019t have to. Even as my gut grew round and firm, its malleable massiveness growing hard in the middle as a food baby slowly expanded it outwards, all I could think was that I needed <i>more</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through, I fussed with the button on my last pair of jeans; undoing them so as to allow my great big belly to seize forward and unzip them for me, and all bets were off. My stomach completely unencumbered, I ate and ate and ate and <i>ate</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it now, I probably gave a really shitty first impression. I mean, here my aunts were giving me a place to live for free, and then I go and eat the fuck out of most of their food. It was probably good that I gave them a good idea of what to expect from me now that I was squatting there\u2014ie; eating the fuck out of most of their food\u2014but I guess I sort of feel bad about it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ate for hours. Dinner lasted until dark in my aunts\u2019 home, something that I hadn\u2019t done in a <i>while</i>. Not since Thanksgiving at Buttercombe Academy, actually, when my roommate had to get a trio of other girls to drag me back to our room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat at the head of the table, the guest of honor in this little celebration, panting and wheezing up a storm. My face was beet red, and I was sweating so much that I must have been shiny. My poor belly was so big that I\u2019d had to scoot back from the table about an hour beforehand, and it <i>still</i> wasn\u2019t enough. My eyes were just barely focused, but I could very clearly see that between Aunt Sally and I, we\u2019d pretty much decimated the dinner table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to illustrate to my aunts how completely stuffed I was, I let slip the biggest, angriest burp I\u2019d ever given\u2014releasing some of the PSI in my dangerously overfilled gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Ah\u2019ll take that as a win for me!\u201d Aunt Rhonda said with a proud smile as she started to clear the table, \u201cHow\u2019d ya like yer first meal in yer new home, Mel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS\u2019good.\u201d I burbled stupidly, \u201cS\u2019<i>real</i> good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood to hear.\u201d Aunt Rhonda said with a pinch of my cheeks and a pat on my shoulder, \u201cAlso happy to see that this whole thing with mah sister hasn\u2019t put a damper on yer appetite because, if ya couldn\u2019t tell before, I like to cook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed weakly, the action hurting my belly so badly that I honestly thought that I was going to barf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over to the panting, sputtering whale seated at the other end of the table\u2014my Aunt Sally looked to be in a similar state as I was. At some point she\u2019d popped a breast button on her blouse and I could see the crest of her valley of cleavage\u2014as well as the skimpy black holder she\u2019d shoved those boulders into. If I had to guess, my poor aunt got a little too excited herself at seeing all her favorites spread out before her\u2026 I know I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean seriously, fat girl gastronomies aside, I had really overdone it. I had been subsisting almost entirely on junk food since I\u2019d graduated from prep school. My tummy was in no way ready to deal with the heavy onslaught of calories that my Aunt Rhonda had prepared for me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved a good meal as much (probably more) than the next fat chick, but I was seriously considering retirement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we sat there for a while, Aunt Rhonda cleaning up while Sally and I digested\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had almost fallen asleep in my chair when the smell of various pies woke me up. \u201cWake up Mel, Sweetie ah cooked y'all some desserts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes to see a massive spread of pies, at least eight different kinds, along with at least two tubs of ice cream, one chocolate and one vanilla. I looked over to Aunt Sally, who had clearly done what she could to make room, but most of that was adjusting her posture and unbuttoning most of her blouse to let her gut hang over her skirt, which it did, making Sally look a hell of a lot fatter than she did when her belly was tucked in. It was then I realized I had already done all I could to make room during the meal proper, let alone have room for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm, Rhonda?\u201d I asked sheepishly, \u201cYou don't happen to have any tums would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up from the pie she as cutting, a gorgeous smelling blueberry, and said, \u201cof course darling give me a minute to serve these up and I'll see what I can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs so after a few seconds of plating half a pie with two scoops of ice cream each to both me and Sally, she apparently would not be having any, she rummaged through her purse and tossed me a container of brand X antacid to hopefully release pressure on my poor bloated tummy. I popped a few in my mouth and let the bubbles do their magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute I had let out the biggest burp I head ever heard, and I'd had some pretty intense soda chugging experience in Buttercombe. But despite it making room for quite a bit more food it still wasn't enough to fit the platter she had spread in front of me. I had gotten through most of the pies she had given me, and we were on our second to last plate when I finally gave in. I was stuffed. I could eat no more. It had been a while since I'd been able to say that. But now I had to admit it. And on top of that I'd have to admit defeat while so stuffed I could barely breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-Aunt *huff puff* Aunt Rhonda?\u201d I said pushing my chair back to give me room to breathe<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mel?\u201d She said turning to look at me from staring at her wife<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I, uhh..\u201d I put my pudgy hand behind my neck and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I put the rest of this pie up for later, I'm stuffed to the brim.\u201d I finally let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Mel, I'm gonna tell you this once, this is not a leftover house. I expect those who I cook for to eat what I make for them.\u201d she said in a shockingly stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not trying to sound ungrateful here, It's just that I'm as stuffed as a turkey on thanksgiving here Auntie, I'm about to pop.\u201d I explained, doing my best to not sound like a whining child<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell just try a bit more and we'll see about how you feel. Alright?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed around the pie for a few seconds, before shoving a few bites of ice cream in my already tight belly. I managed to get the rest of the plate I had into me before she finally decided to have mercy on my poor fat tummy. I looked over to Sally for the first time since I started dessert, and she was stuffing her face like a pig, I'd not seen anyone eat like that. I made a mental note to ask her how she eats like she does later. But for now I just had to figure out how I was gonna get to my room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed myself up out of the chair, something that was normally a mild struggle turned into the most physical exertion if had to do all year. I huffed and puffed my way to where Sally has sat on the couch to ask where my room was, and she led me back through the kitchen into the guest room, my new room, and showed me around bringing in my stuff for me. As I lay on the bed I didn't know if I wanted this to be the norm, on the one hand if I ate like that every day I'd be immobile before the end of the summer, but on the other hand, if she cooks like that every day I'd die of a burst stomach before I got through lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed my poor bloated tummy, letting out small little burps as I slowly fell to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a suitable amount of time had passed, and I managed to digest at least some of the monster meal that I\u2019d happily endeavored, I figured that it was about time that I got to bed. We were getting on into the wee hours of the night, and honestly after a meal like that I figured that I may as well throw in the towel and call it a day. With no small amount of exertion, my Aunt Rhonda helped heave me up to my feet. I said my goodnights to Aunt Sally\u2014the embrace forgone on both parts due to the sheer exhaustion of wrapping our arms around one another\u2014and I was ushered out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, my room was to be on the bottom floor. Apparently the only rooms in use upstairs were Aunt Sally\u2019s office and another bathroom; most of our time would be spent downstairs, which didn\u2019t surprise me one bit. I couldn\u2019t imagine my fat ass climbing stairs every day just to flop down on my bed, and that probably meant that Sally faced a similar predicament. With Aunt Rhonda leading the way, I trotted heavily behind her as we came to a pause in the surprisingly spacious hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2019ll be yer room, sweetheart.\u201d My aunt gestured to the door, smiling that perfect housewife/surrogate mother sort of smile as she twisted the knob, \u201cFeel free to make it your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuffing appreciatively, I waddled beyond her and through the doorway into my new room. It was nice enough; nice curtains, a desk with a woefully undersupported chair (I\u2019d get my aunts to replace that later) and a closet that looked up to the task of holding my backlog of outgrown ensembles. The most important and appealing part of it though, was definitely the bed. After an entire afternoon spent at the dinner table, stuffing my fat face until I could barely see straight, nothing sounded better to me than crawling under the covers and falling into a nice little food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Auntie.\u201d I smiled weakly, \u201cThis is great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m happy it meets your approval.\u201d My Aunt\u2019s voice was much more firm than mine, a consequence of having gotten the scraps between the two hottest hogs in the house, \u201cHow was dinner\u2014did you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was <i>also</i> great.\u201d I said with a little more fire in my belly, subconsciously coming to rest my hands on the flanks of my gut, \u201cBest dinner ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear it, Mel.\u201d My Aunt pat my tummy approvingly as it gurgled in ecstatic agony, \u201cNow get your rest. You\u2019ve had a long day drivin\u2019 yourself up here and I want you to sleep <i>at least</i> \u2018til noon. Y\u2019hear me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am!\u201d I agreed all to eagerly, receiving another placating belly pat as my aunt walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was alone, I stripped down as quickly as my sluggish enormity would allow. It was an awful lot of work getting naked at my size\u2014especially when I was over encumbered by more than a few heaping helpings of southern home cooking. My belly was so bloated that I could bend over even <i>less</i> than I normally could, which meant lots of pulling and wriggling to get my jeans off. I plopped my fat ass on the bed, making it groan and squeak as I burdened it with what was likely the biggest butt it had ever met. When I was down, I kicked my flabby legs sporadically in an attempt to coerce the skin-tight denim past my saddlebag thighs; eventually settling on just coaxing them down the old fashioned way and kicking them off the rest of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh damn.\u201d I whistled, noticing the busted zipper and the fraying strings around the button, \u201cThese things\u2019ll be done by tomorrow if I keep eating like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought\u2026 <i>excited</i> me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came to rest my hand on my fupa as it bulged out against my lap, cupping my big belly roll with two chubby hands ill-equipped for anything other than feeding myself and fondling myself. I pressed slightly into the surface of my great gut, eliciting a sharp wincing pain and another hot burp as I relieved some pressure on the inner contents of my gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fell backwards onto the bed, my legs dangling off as I tested the springs\u2019 integrity in the poor mattress. My belly stuck high into the air, a towering monument to my commitment to indulge myself and reaffirmed by a night\u2019s worth of hoggish indulgence that surpassed even my usual feats of fatgirlery. As I continued to grope myself, my breathing growing husky and terse, I felt my food baby churn and bubble beneath the skin of my fat, kicking me as I rubbed and poked and prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first night was\u2026 a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s just leave it at that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two, I was having my recurring dream about the cast of <i>Supernatural</i> pamper me and feed me until I couldn\u2019t move, and I didn\u2019t exactly ever get to finish the part where Dean ventures between my legs and underneath my belly. Three, the lamp just fucking <i>turned on</i> right in front of my face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I groaned in agony, whining because it couldn\u2019t possibly have been morning yet and I had a lot of fat girl sleep to catch up on, my Aunt Rhonda perched herself merrily on the sliver of bed edge that wasn\u2019t taken up by one of my flabby limbs or my acre of belly. She had changed into a pair of pajamas not unlike what I liked to wear; a cute little tank top that hugged her full chest and waist, and a pair of pink plaid sleep pants that were incredibly cute and I totally would have stolen if I had any hopes of fitting into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand, a platter of brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, a goddamn <i>platter</i> of brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAunt Rhonda?\u201d I managed sleepily, rubbing my eyes with one chubby hand, \u201cW\u2019time izzit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little past midnight.\u201d She said in a matter-of-fact sort of way, \u201cAh was making brownies and Ah figured that you\u2019d like to have some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered the platter in front of me and, of fucking course, I accepted them readily. Eagerly, even. My immediate response to any type of food these days was to cram it into my mouth\u2014<i>especially</i> brownies and <i>especially</i> if they surprise brownies. I was sure that I had to be dreaming, but when Sam didn\u2019t come in shirtless with the chocolate syrup, I begrudgingly accepted that this must be reality. My sweet, chocolatey reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmrm\u2026 they\u2019re good.\u201d I smacked my lips as I took another brownie off the platter, \u201cBut\u2026 mmph\u2026 midnight brownies, Aunt Rhonda? Seriously, do you have the munchies or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt placed the platter down on the table beside my bed, well within my reach (and I continued to reach for them even as she spoke, slowly dwindling my stack of chocolate squares one or two at a time) and sat back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, your Aunt Sally likes to have a little midnight snack every once in a while.\u201d My aunt said with a smile, \u201cAh figured what the hell and made another batch just for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww.\u201d I said with a mouthful of mush before swallowing, \u201cLove you too, auntie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt\u2019s smile grew wider as she pat my cheek, tussling my long blonde hair as she reached over to the other side of the bedside table and moved a glass of milk within my reach. I grabbed for it immediately and slurped it down; relishing every sip of its cool, creamy texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetcha never got midnight room service at that school a\u2019yours, didja?\u201d she added wryly, \u201cAnd you <i>certainly</i> didn\u2019t get it at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I never did.\u201d I wiped a pretend tear from my eye (it <i>may</i> have been a brownie crumb), \u201cI\u2019ve been so deprived.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt chuckled at the thought, probably amused by the notion that anyone could have called her four-hundred pound heifer of a niece \u2018deprived\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Ah\u2019ve gotta get back to your Aunt Sally.\u201d She said to me as I continued to scarf down sweets, \u201cShe gets a little grumpy when she\u2019s hungry. G\u2019night, Melly. Sweet dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night Auntie!\u201d I said as she shut the door, still battling the invading army of brownies with a dwindling reserve of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, I was back to bed; the brownies defeated, my tummy topped off, and back to my dreamworld where the Winchester brothers worked to keep me satisfied, armed with nothing but bricks of brownies, gallons of milk, and their own lack of shirts\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t exactly live up to my promise of sleeping until noon, but only because the sweet smell of pancakes filled the whole house and got me all excited. That being said, I had <i>no</i> idea what I was waddling into; led by the nose via the intoxicating aroma of blueberry flapjacks, bacon, and eggs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, I would come to find out, more. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was some kind of welcoming breakfast to go along with the feast that had been my welcoming dinner or if I\u2019d actually died and gone to fat girl heaven; I could have checked either box and not known the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunts were right where I\u2019d left them last night, Rhonda at the oven doting over Sally at the head of the table. And, just like last night, there was so much food on the table that I doubt that I could have made out a single grain of wood. There were stacks of pancakes on a platter, a super-sized serving dish of scrambled eggs, a brush of bacon, thick pink slabs of ham open for grabs, practically a whole fucking loaf of toast\u2026 I had to stop myself from throwing myself onto the dinner table!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, you\u2019re up.\u201d My Aunt Sally said in her deeper voice, chowing down on some bacon from her fat grip, \u201cJust in time for breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yeah</i>!\u201d I said excitedly, ignoring the protests of my still taxed tummy as I waddled towards my seat, Aunt Rhonda pulling it out for me as I plopped myself down, \u201cDo you guys do this every morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery morning; bet you\u2019re not used to <i>that</i>, huh? Normally Ah try not to spoil your Aunt Sally\u2019s appetite so much, but we both figured that your bein' here was calls to cut loose a little.\u201d Aunt Rhonda gave a wry little crinkle of her prominent nose towards her breasty behemoth of a wife, who let out a sultry laugh as a sign of approval, \u201cNow eat up\u2014I don\u2019t want those flapjacks getting cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI vowed not to let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning a breakfast-meat remix of last night, I found myself drawn to Aunt Rhonda\u2019s exquisite cooking. It didn\u2019t matter that I still hadn\u2019t managed to digest last night\u2019s dinner <i>or</i> the brownies she brought me; my complex relationship with food and my desire to see myself grow even bigger and fatter than I already was aside, I probably still would have kept eating. Her food was that good, no lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was obviously still sluggish from waking up and having a half-digested food baby in my belly, I was surprisingly quick for being Morning Mel. I managed to hold my own against Aunt Sally at least, who seemed hardly bothered by all that she\u2019d eaten the night before. Must be how fucking tall she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree plates of pancakes, more strips of bacon than I probably should have taken, and a mountain of eggs later, and I was about ready to throw in the towel. My gut was still so round and fat from last night, I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d be able to get up after refilling it up; even if I did have my aunts\u2019 help. At least this time I was in my jammies, which meant that I didn\u2019t run the risk of sending a button across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was\u2026 <i>so</i> good\u2026\u201d I panted, clutching my gut at both sides, \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 eat another bite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, what was wrong with me? I mean, I <i>always</i> loved to stuff my face. Always. And for a four hundred pound heifer like me, \u201cstuffed\u201d didn\u2019t come easy. But I\u2019d just been bottomed out by Aunt Rhonda\u2019s all-star cuisine twice in a row now. It was like some sort of switch flipped on in my head and I <i>had</i> to eat it. I might have been worried, if I could have thought straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hmm, glad to hear it.\u201d My aunt pat my cheek approvingly as she cleared the scores of vanquished plates from my sight, \u201cNow that you\u2019ll be stayin\u2019 with us Mel, I ought to get used to cooking a little extra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a thick noise of approval escape my Aunt Sally, who was picking her teeth decadently on the other side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could get behind that.\u201d She purred, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you, Mel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d I wheezed, smiling weakly, \u201cTotes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t know any of the channels, so I was happy to flip through them until something familiar came along to distract me from the ache in my ample inches. I hadn\u2019t quite figured out their cable box (seriously, switch to satellite.) but the welcome tones of the <i>Friends</i> cast and the cute little candy dish by my side were enough to keep me company as I dozed off, sprawled out on the couch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up later, how much later I didn\u2019t know, to the familiar smell of sizzling meat. It must have filled the whole house; the strong and undeniable scent of cooking pork products meant that I woke up with my lips smacking. I had been drooling in my sleep, and now I knew the reason why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly rocked myself to a seated position, my size and current level of fullness governing my speed at heaving myself up even with incentive, to get a better picture of what was cooking. I now smelled potatoes, with an undertone of something bready, as well as maybe\u2026 maybe something sweet? I don\u2019t know. But my mind was racing. I grappled the armrest of the couch and struggled to push myself up, my unused muscles quivering and shaking in strain as I eventually poured myself into a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed my nose to the kitchen, where I was greeted with the welcome sight of the dinner table\u2014filled yet again with a smorgasbord of down-home delights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Auntie.\u201d I burbled confusedly as I scratched my tummy, \u201cDinnertime already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner?\u201d my Aunt turned from her covered countertop, \u201cMel, sweetie, it\u2019s just about time for lunch. Y\u2019aint been sleepin\u2019 that long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026 hadn\u2019t been? Sure felt like I had. But I guess she was right; my stomach wasn\u2019t <i>nearly</i> as empty as it would have been if it were dinnertime. Even still, the sight of all that food on the table, those delicious smells wafting over me in the air\u2026 I could afford to make some room, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow c\u2019mon and sit down.\u201d My aunt said in a matronly manner as she went back to her cooking, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you woke up\u2014I don\u2019t think Ah woulda had the heart to do it. You were so cute, layin\u2019 there on the couch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d Ugh. She already did Mom-stuff. Like, normal people mom-stuff, not my mom\u2019s mom-stuff. I scooted back one of the massive Sally-sized chairs and plopped down in it, seemingly making the whole kitchen quake a little, \u201cThanks for letting me crash on the couch like that, Auntie. I don\u2019t think I would have made it back to my room after breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothin\u2019 of it at all, Melly.\u201d My Aunt turned around and smiled, armed with a pan of\u2026 cornbread? Yeah, cornbread. \u201cIn all honesty, Ah should be thankin\u2019 you\u2014it gets a l\u2019il lonely around here without mah Sally, an\u2019 if yer Mama doesn\u2019t want you around then <i>Ah</i> do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt set me up with a mountain of this\u2026 mixture. Corn beef hash is what she called it. It didn\u2019t look really appealing (my city-girl instincts were showing, as my Aunts would later put it). Sizzled brown meat littered with chunks of potatoes thrown into the mix\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe it was a little appetizing. But not the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started out with no less than a quarter of the pan of that stuff, plus a little building-block set of cornbread, a harvest of green beans, flaky buttery biscuits, and two cobs of corn that had been loaded with salt and butter to top me off. I appreciated the enthusiasm, but I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t worried about not being able to finish my plate. Let alone the mini-Thanksgiving that my Aunt Rhonda had prepared for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever the less, I started shoveling it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Ah like t\u2019see\u2014a girl with an appetite.\u201d My aunt said pleasantly as she pat me on the padded shoulder, \u201cNow you eat as much as you want Mel; Ah made plenty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmphm\u2026\u201d I swallowed nearly choking on my hash and Aunt Rhonda\u2019s encouragement, \u201cWhat about Aunt Sally? Shouldn\u2019t we save some for her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh no, sweetie, Sally doesn\u2019t come home from work \u2018til five!\u201d my Aunt laughed, \u201cShe eats lunch with the girls\u2019n her office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2026 was worrying. Even for me. Because, as I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve said to you before, there was a <i>lot</i> of fucking food set out in front of me. I wasn\u2019t even sure that I had completely digested last night\u2019s dinner, let alone breakfast. I was all for pigging out\u2014it was kind of my whole schtick\u2014but Aunt Rhonda couldn\u2019t have honestly expected me to eat all of this, could she?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How could she honestly expect me\u2014expect <i>anyone</i>, even someone my size\u2014to have room after not one, but <i>two</i> of her super meals? I mean, I was a fat girl through and through, but this seemed downright impossible. I had stuffed myself to more than four hundred pounds over the past four years, but I had never had to eat so much. I could only wonder how I could have possibly been expected to eat all of this, fearing that I might actually explode if I managed to do it if not before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if I wanted to get fatter, eating a shit-ton of food was going to be my best route of doing it. I did my best to bear through it, scarfing through my pile of corn-beef hash (which was <i>very</i> good, btw) and taking little bites of cornbread  as I whittled it away. Soon they, the corn, and the greenbeans were all gone. I was munching on my last biscuit, breathing heavily as the cracks in my solid stomach were filled with my top-off, when my aunt began to refill my platter. My eyes widened in surprise and, honestly, fear as she just happily piled more and more onto my plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie\u2026\u201d I gasped, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can eat all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow sweetie, Ah made all this for <i>you</i>.\u201d my Aunt Rhonda said in the most stern tone that I\u2019d heard since I moved in, hands on her hips and everything, \u201cYou\u2019ve done eaten some of it, there ain\u2019t much more to go. I don\u2019t know how they did it at that Academy, but we don\u2019t <i>do</i> leftovers in yer Aunt Rhonda\u2019s house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back over to the counter, hopefully fixing herself something so I wouldn\u2019t have to eat literally <i>all</i> of it, and left me to my own devices. And since the devices were the fork and knife she gave me, I decided to at least put them to good use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst my better judgement, I continued to let my Aunt Rhonda guilt me into eating. After every plate\u2014it seemed like after every <i>bite</i>\u2014she would give me that same look that told me I wasn\u2019t done. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I was happy to eat my weight in food, but I preferred to limit such feats of gastronomy to maybe one meal a day, with several \u201cnormal\u201d sized meals to keep me full. Aunt Rhonda, apparently, didn\u2019t see it that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter maybe two hours of stumbling through my epic lunch, I had almost come to its conclusion. I was so full that I was shaking, like a bomb trembling before it exploded. I had bypassed the \u201cI\u2019m so full/horny\u201d stage and moved right into \u201coh my god this woman is trying to kill me\u201d one. Seriously, I had never been <i>forced</i> to eat before. It was exciting at first, but it quickly lost its appeal once I realized that leaving the dinnertable was right up there with blasphemy in my Aunt Rhonda\u2019s house. Fetish be damned, this was the first time I hadn\u2019t enjoyed eating in a long time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone.\u201d I said thickly, my voice heavy and slow as I struggled to keep consciousness, \u201cM\u2019done\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt Rhonda smiled at me from across the table and looked over at my plate\u2014like she was inspecting to see if I\u2019d actually finished. Once she saw that there were merely crumbs left on my plate, she looked up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl\u2014clean plate!\u201d she said in a motherly tone, \u201cYou wanna go take another nap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned back into my chair, flailing my arms out behind me as my gut surged out in front of me. It was so stuffed, so fucking <i>full</i> that I could barely see straight. It was hot to the touch and tight as a drum, aching and throbbing with my heartbeat. I didn\u2019t want to touch it\u2014I <i>couldn\u2019t</i> touch it, for fear that I would literally break apart into a billion little pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-Kay\u2026.\u201d I stammered, unable to lift myself, \u201cC-Can\u2019t\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt came over to shush me, stroking my back lovingly while I sat there, pinned down into the chair by my own overindulgence. I was sweaty and damp, sputtering like a steam engine as I struggled to discern what was going on around me. But my Aunt\u2019s hands on my back felt good. She rubbed my tense muscles in a circular motion. It didn\u2019t make the pain go away, but it lessened it slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh\u2026 it\u2019s alright sweetheart. You just sit there for a minute and rest.\u201d She said in a comforting, hushed voice, \u201cI\u2019m gonna start on dinner\u2014you just sit there and look pretty, m\u2019kay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded stupidly as she left my side, huffing and puffing and wheezing as I struggled with consciousness. I was so full\u2014so <i>fat</i>. I didn\u2019t want to do anything other than just sit there and hope that there wasn\u2019t any more food on the way. Just like Aunt Rhonda said\u2014sit there and look pretty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did she say \u201cdinner?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAunt Rhonda?\u201d I cried, panting a little. I had just chugged a two-liter of cola, and before I caught my breath I was calling to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM'out of soda! And ice cream!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't out of ice cream yet, but the way I was scooping the creamy peanut butter treat to my mouth with an oversized spoon it was only a matter of time. It was my last carton from second breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a sec. I gotta finish frying this chicken,\u201d Aunt Rhonda called back. My stomach, already containing several plates and bowls of food, grumbled eagerly at the thought of fried chicken. The skin crackling and shiny with grease, the meat so juicy and succulent, tearing apart in my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ate the ice cream faster, looking forward to the chicken. It would be just another course in the almost endless stream of them, my days now nothing but eating and sleeping, but Aunt Rhonda's cooking was so good, and she knew so many recipes, that even if I didn't love eating for the sake of eating I wouldn't want to do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I hadn't, not for almost five months. Through the summer and into the fall now I had spent most of my days at home, gobbling up anything and everything Aunt Rhonda made for me. It might sound selfish, but my aunts were all too happy to spoil me. Aunt Rhonda loved having someone to cook for all day long, and Aunt Sally loved having a food buddy to binge with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe? I was happy to be spoiled. When I left my old house I wanted to seize my dream of being the fattest girl around, and when it was handed to me on a silver platter like this? Damn right I took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was I doing, you ask? How does 800 pounds sound?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. I had doubled my weight. I was 800 pounds of pear-shaped, couch-filling beauty. I had four chins, a 60-inch belly, 100-inch hips and my arms and legs were rolls of fat, one piled atop another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why I wasn't in the dining room. Waddling all the way from my bedroom to the dinner table was too much, so in the morning I would get up and make my way to living room, settling on the couch (my ass had already made a permanent indentation in the cushions) and spending the day having Aunt Rhonda bring me carts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't go out, I didn't travel into town, I just sat and ate. I would have the TV on as I kept my belly filled \u2013 Aunt Sally had replaced their old 35-inch with a 55-inch smart TV and set me up a Netflix account back in August \u2013 but really I was concentrating on my food. From those early days of being overwhelmed by how much food I was being given, I was now a bottomless pit, always ready for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda came into the room, wheeling a cart filled with chicken, biscuits soaked in gravy, bottles of soda and tubs of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for more?\u201d she asked. Her tone was eager; far from exhausting her hospitality with my unremitting gluttony, she had continued to step up her game, always ready to feed me more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d I said, leaning back and shaking my belly. \u201cThis thing won't fill itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not too warm in here, is it?\u201d she asked, pushing the cart closer to me and handing me a tub of ice cream. \u201cI can't remember the last time we had an Indian summer last like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure? You don't need another fan, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmf.\u201d I swallowed my ice cream. I had one fan with me, sitting on the floor and pointed at my belly's underhang. Plus, I was mostly naked, wearing only a spaghetti strap bra. \u201cNope. But if you make any more shakes, that's be great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing. Mocha or strawberry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have both?\u201d I asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Aunt Rhonda almost practically cooed. \u201cYou can have anything you want, just ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. Life with Aunt Rhonda was nothing like life back with my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only at dinner that I would get up \u2013 needing help from Aunt Rhonda at this point, her pulling me forward so I could lift my boulder-sized butt off the couch and get standing upright \u2013 and go to the dining room. Aunt Rhonda insisted we eat dinner as a family, but as long as there was enough food I was fine with anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was seafood night, Aunt Rhonda filling the table with fried catfish, butterfly shrimp and jambalaya, plus several sides. Hours passed as I ate, cleaning all the plates and bowls after Aunts Rhonda and Sally had their fill. I didn't waste any time with filling  a plate; I just grabbed a dish and shoveled the food directly into my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner was dessert, entire pies and more cartons of ice cream finally filling my belly to full capacity for the first time today. I leaned back, content, drifting into a half-dreamy fugue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you get enough, sweetheart?\u201d Aunt Rhonda asked. I didn't doubt that if I asked for more she would be able to produce something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough and then some, Aunt Rhonda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really packed it away today,\u201d Aunt Sally said, impressed. \u201cI thought I was a big eater, but you've put me to shame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love to eat,\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAnd I love being fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. In fact, there's something I want to talk to you about...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Five weeks. That's how long I was living with Aunts Rhonda and Sally before I actually left the house and explored my new hometown (and with how quickly and deeply I had fallen into the way of life with them, it wasn't hard to think of this as my new home). For over a month I would do little besides eat and sleep, and I'm not exaggerating to sound lazy. I would literally wake up, go to the dining room, stuff myself on my aunt's irresistible cooking, waddle to the living room and pass out on the couch, wake up for lunch, sleep most of the afternoon, glut myself at dinner, and retire to my bedroom for the night. And then I would be woken up around midnight by Aunt Rhonda, with a tray of some treat or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I was a big eater before all this, a dedicated glutton who wanted to stuff her face more than anything. But there was something about Aunt Rhonda \u2013 her cooking, her eager attitude, her refusal to let me leave the table when I was less than completely full \u2013 that made every meal for me a full-blown production. Snacking was becoming a memory; if I ate, I ate to the limit, not passively while doing something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days I expected this to ease up. Once I was acclimated and they were used to my presence my aunts wouldn't feel so compelled to spoil me. The opposite happened; the more she learned about my capacity, the more Aunt Rhonda wanted to push it. Aunt Sally said it was her joy at having another mouth to feed, implying not-so-subtly that she was a born mother who never got the chance to express her nurturing nature. I don't know if it was really that simple, but the cause wasn't as important as the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Aunt Sally was enjoying herself more fully at mealtime, gaining a few pounds herself if her straining three-piece suits were an indication, I was showing the most growth. Small wonder; I was effectively housebound, present for three meals and a midnight snack every day. And it showed. In a little over a month I had jumped to over 475 pounds. I would have liked to have charted my growth as it happened, but it wasn't until a couple days ago that I thought to even ask if they had a scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI loved the look of the new weight on me. My butt looked the best, all bubbly and jutting out behind me, and when I sat down you could see it and my hips forming a ring around me. It's more obvious today, of course, but when I was taking some selfies to send to my friends from Buttercombe it was a new experience for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy boobs and belly were also bigger, and my upper arms jiggled and shook at the slightest jostle. My neck wasn't completely obscured yet, but my second chin was thicker and would form a third any day now. Even my cheeks were plumper; they looked like I was eating all the time, even those rare times when I wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one downside to hog heaven: clothing. I had packed what I could before coming down to Carolina, lucking out with a wardrobe that provided me enough cover and breathing room that I was decent, but that was at an end. For weeks my collection of clothes that fit me shrank two or three pieces at a time, and now I was getting desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally came to some rescue, as her clothing was tailored to her much taller height, which balanced out with my now wider body. But she and I had different tastes in fashion, and I wanted less things that flowed over me and more that showed off all my well-earned curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouple that with the monotony of bedroom-dining room-living room, and I was in need of a trip to town. At the start of the summer the shock from the change in temperature (good lord, how hot did Southern summers get?) was as much an incentive as anything for me to stay indoors, but it was the middle of July by now, and I felt I was as comfortable with the heat as I was ever going to get. And as comfortable with the daily stuffings. I hadn't let on yet, but my belly's capacity had grown pretty quickly under the flood of food Aunt Rhonda was forcing on me, and I was at the point now when one of her breakfasts wouldn't put me right back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked one of Aunt Sally's few dresses, lifting the hem and keeping it up with safety pins; it was sleeveless and roomy, breathing well in the heat. With Aunt Rhonda's gift of some money (and the promise I would be back in time for lunch) I went out to the bus stop, hoping to hit the mall, get some new leggings and shirts, and maybe see a little of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven under the shade the air was stagnant and humid, and I was flushed by the time the bus pulled up. Sweet, sweet air conditioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heaved myself up the three steps, paid the fare, and took one of the open benches near the front. My ass spread across two of the seats, making me even hotter than I already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus was almost empty, it being after rush hour, and it wasn't until I got to the mall that I made my first real impression on the local population.</span></div></div>",

When I waddled through the doors (I pushed the automatic doors, not trying to squeeze through one of them) they all noticed me, some glancing up and others looking right at me, but they all had the same reaction: bland indifference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, I was a little disappointed, I admit. It's not that I wanted taunts and sneers, but I always love when people see me coming and forget what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thing happened as I walked across half the mall to the Torrid shop, passing people who noticed me but not my size. What was up with this? There were some other fat people, quite a few of them younger people, but it's not like this was Buttercombe and someone my size (or near my size; I had left the school one of the biggest girls around) was considered 'average.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have loved to chat up the salesgirl, get to know something about the town and what there was to do, but I was already feeling my stomach start to empty, and I didn't want to spend too much time away from home. I found some clothes that were stylish and sized right, paid for them, and headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got home just in time for lunch, and the sight and smell of all that food pushed from my mind any thoughts about the people's reactions to me. But later that night, when Aunt Sally asked me how I liked the mall, it came back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was one thing I thought was weird,\u201d I said. \u201cA lot of people noticed me, but nobody seemed to react to how big I am.

The name sounded familiar, but I couldn't pin it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was big several years ago,\u201d Aunt Rhonda explained. \u201cHad a talk show, a couple bestsellers. Then it all imploded. Nutritionists and dieticians pounced upon her, saying her cooking was unhealthy, too fattening. She tried to fight back, said fat wasn't unhealthy, but it didn't matter. Her show was dropped, her publisher found a new young face, and she moved out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe locals loved having a celebrity in town, and welcomed her with open arms. She originally didn't want to much except be alone and work on her recipes, but the town took to her so well she opened a restaurant. Italian menu. It was such a hit she opened another one, Southern cuisine, and then she started teaching classes at the learning annex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty soon half the houses in town had Roselli's recipes cooking in their kitchen, including this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour cooking was already fabulous,\u201d Aunt Sally said, making mushy eyes at Aunt Rhonda. Aunt Rhonda did an 'Oh, go on,' hand thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut yeah, her recipes aren't exactly health food, but they're so good nobody cares. Not everyone has gotten fat, but enough have that everyone has just taken it in stride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're pretty big even for this town,\u201d Aunt Sally said, \u201cbut I know there's some people as big as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs big as me, I thought. I had to meet these people; my pride as a fatty wouldn't let me be anything less than the fattest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know any of them?\u201d I asked.</span></div></div>",

Well, uh\u2026\u201d my Aunt Rhonda\u2019s face turned pink as she looked to Aunt Sally, who looked to be more than a little peeved at her expertise on the subject, \u201cI-I, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t really\u2026 um\u2026 I-I mean, I don\u2019t <i>know</i> these people, sweetie!

My aunt loved to serve food to anyone who would eat it, but I don't think she knew how much I loved being fat and getting fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she grabbed her purse and car keys, \u201cI'll drive you over there. Your aunt Sally will love some treats for dessert tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mathis bakery was in a two-story building trapped between two other businesses. The windows on the second floor led me to assume the family lived above their business; lucky break for Brooke if she was my size, having all those sugary treats in the same building as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed aunt Rhonda inside. The dining area was pretty small, just a few tables, but it looked like most of the menu (displayed on a chalkboard suspended over behind the counter) was full-sized desserts. There was a selection of coffees, espressos and the like, plus snack-sized portions, so there was some diversity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Just give me a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on a stepladder, writing on the chalkboard menu, was the widest ass I had ever seen. OK, there was a person attached to the ass, but that was all I saw at first because the woman had her back to me and she was standing a few feet off the ground. Those twin boulders of fat were directly in the path of my eyeline, how could I not stare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the woman slowly made her way to the ground, folded the stepladder, and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must have been Brooke. She looked to be my age, with blonde hair, three chins, and that aforementioned booty. It was her defining feature. Her belly and boobs were large, and her upper arms squeezed against her chest when her arms were at rest, but her hips and butt swelled out almost twice as wide as her torso. A definite pear, and a definite fatty. I couldn't tell for certain, but she weighed about as much as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I get you two, today?\u201d she asked. She was wearing a button-down shirt and vest, and a pair of black leggings that couldn't do anything to make her look slimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any of the turtle pies available?\u201d my aunt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrook frowned apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don't at the moment, but if you'd like to place an order we can have one ready later today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds fine.\u201d Aunt Rhonda turned to me. \u201cI've got some errands to run in the meantime. Would you like to grab a snack and come with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually...\u201d I wanted to chat up Brooke, find out her story. \u201cI'm having a hard time deciding. Can I stay here and just hang around until you come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda placed her order and left, leaving me and Brooke alone in the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what would you like?\u201d she asked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know. What would you say is the best thing here?\u201d I had to be cautious. Brooke could be cool with her fat, or maybe she was self-conscious about it. Maybe she loved to eat and was open about it, or maybe she blamed working in a bakery for ruining her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything we make is awesome,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I'm biased, but look at me. I know what I'm talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, yeah. This girl was a proud fatty. But just to make sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sold me. I'll have one of the chocolate banana nut muffins, one slice of red velvet, one slice of salted caramel cheesecake, half a dozen of those peppermint bonbons, two apple fritters and what's left of that plate of lemon bars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just ordered as much food as most people would eat for dinner, all of it sugary junk food, but Brooke didn't bat an eye. She just asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like it for here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I'll eat it here. And can I get some hot chocolate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paid, she slid the tray of food across the counter, and I found a seat at the table closest to the register. I positioned myself so I could see her and she could see me, and I dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmmmmmmm... It was all so good. Brooke wasn't lying about that. As I ate she pretended to wipe the counter and arrange the display case, but she always had one eye on me. Was she watching to see if I ate everything? She must have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I finished I returned the tray, looking over the display case and considering a second go-round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren't kidding. Those were some of the best treats I've ever had. I could probably go for some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't let my mom hear you say that,\u201d she laughed, \u201cor she'd be filling a bag for you to take home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she the kind of woman that's always pushing food on people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely...</span></div></div>",

Speaking of,\u201d she motioned to the display case, \u201cwhat else would you like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour we ate and gabbed; well, I did most of the eating, as Brooke needed to make the pie for Aunt Rhonda. But once that was in the oven and she was sitting across the table from me, she tried to make up for lost time, catching up with me dessert for dessert. I took the competition a little too seriously, and before long we were both cramming Danishes and slices of pie into our mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooh,\u201d Brooke moaned at the end of our impromptu gorge. Both of our bellies were pretty swollen, and I was waiting for one of the buttons on her shirt to give up the ghost. \u201cI haven't stuffed myself like that in a long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's pretty normal for me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou'll regret offering me that discount before too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it's fine. I like the thought of having a food buddy. All my friends have other stuff going on during the summer, and my brother's always playing his video games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to learn more about her elusive brother, except Aunt Rhonda chose then to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I had a standing offer to return, and I now knew where the bakery was, so the next day after breakfast I lumbered my way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat didn't take long,\u201d Brooke said as I came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreakfast is over, so now I'm ready for some dessert,\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have dessert after every meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI treat desserts like meals themselves,\u201d I replied, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like the sound of that. But do you mind waiting a few minutes? I have a half-shift on Thursdays, so we can go get lunch when my dad comes back from the post office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said 'get lunch' I thought she was thinking of going out, but instead Brooke led me through the back of the dining area to a set of stairs. Upstairs we found her mother, a hefty woman of about 400 pounds of pear-shaped corpulence, in the kitchen, cooking up a storm. It smelled divine: lasagna, garlic bread, fried calamari and angel hair pasta in alfredo sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mom. This is Mel. She just moved to town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke's mother turned around, smiling warmly at first and then even wider when she got a good look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to our house,\u201d she said, \u201cI wish Brooke had told me we'd have another person at the table. I hope there's enough food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like there's plenty,\u201d I said. Even by my gluttonous standards the spread on the dining room table looked like more than enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere mom is concerned, 'plenty' is not enough,\u201d Brooke said to me aside. Her mother brought the last dish \u2013 a bowl of fist-sized meatballs in marinara sauce \u2013 to the table and called down a hall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael! Lunch time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I found my seat and got comfortable I grew anxious. Here it was. How much bigger than me was Michael?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear his footsteps as he left his room and came down the hall, the floor creaking ominously. Casually, I turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I turned towards the hall, and the source of the focused tremors that made the house quake, only to find that Michael was much bigger than I had expected. He was bigger than me\u2014hell, he was bigger than <i>big</i>! I\u2019d never seen anyone so\u2026 huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I saw as he lumbered down the hall was his belly. He practically eclipsed the hallway all by himself, but his gut was so big and round that it was hard <i>not</i> to stare. It swung at his knees, barely covered by his N7 t-shirt as it wobbled and flubbed with every pathetic step. As he slowly, awkwardly made his way into the kitchen, his features became more clear. His face was round and soft, with three chins to eclipse his neck and chubby cheeks to bunch into his field of vision. More impressively, he seemed to follow the same figure as his mother and sister. Michael\u2019s ass was enormous; bigger than his Mom\u2019s and even Brooke\u2019s. He was dressed in stretchy pants\u2014maybe <i>maternity</i> pants, judging by his size and their transparency in some places\u2014and his fatty thighs rubbed together so loudly that I might have heard him coming if it weren\u2019t for his thudding footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he plopped down into two of the family\u2019s chairs next to me, sweating and exhausted from such a minor trip, I could only guess that he weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred. Maybe seven. Fat guys with big butts always threw me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d Mrs. Mathis said excitedly, scooping up the plate in front of her piggy son and whisking it away to load it up, \u201cMichael this is Mel, Brooke\u2019s new friend. She\u2019ll be joining us for lunch today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d He puffed in a noncommittal tone as his mother loaded up his plates for him, \u201cPhew\u2026 sorry, just\u2026 y\u2019know, long walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made modest to awkward small talk as Mrs. Mathis took our getting-to-know-you session to load up our plates for us, like she had for Michael. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEating lunch in your jammies again, Michael?\u201d Brooke teased her enormous brother with a pinch of his arm fat, \u201cDon\u2019t you know people used to <i>dress</i> for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t tell me. I\u2019m still waiting on New Semester Clothes money from Grandma.\u201d He swatted her hand away, making his meaty arm wobble beneath his sleeve, \u201cNot unlike some <i>other</i> people I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat<i>ever</i> wide load, just make sure my friend here actually <i>gets</i> some this time.\u201d She referred to me, \u201cJust because you\u2019re Mommy\u2019s Little Piggy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to pig out on <i>everything</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, can you <i>please</i> not call me th\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, kiddos. No fighting at the dinnertable.\u201d I heard the Mathis matriarch say sternly as she returned with what looked like enough food for all of us, but that I quickly realized was just for Michael, \u201cMel, sweetie, hand me your plate. I\u2019ll get you next\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me tell you, it was no mystery how Michael and Brooke were so fat if how her mother fed them was any indication. Seriously, I think during the first course I had an entire plate of pasta. Like, the whole plate was just full of angel hair, meat and sauce and alfredo sauce, topped with those fist-sized meatballs, to go in tandem with the matching plate of lasagna <i>and</i> the half-a-fuckin\u2019 loaf of garlic bread that came alongside it. And that was just the first course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean\u2026 did I overdo it? Yeah. You bet I did. But can you really blame me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had spent the past few years purposefully ballooning up into this big bodacious blimp, thinking I was hot shit for weighing four hundred pounds, and then I come to live with my Aunts (one of whom had come to even outweigh me since I had seen her last!) and I find out all these other fatties have done it with almost no effort! Of <i>course</i> I overdid it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n We ate for\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 an hour? Maybe two? I seriously have no clue how long I spent at that dinner table, wolfing down food like it was nobody\u2019s business. By the end of it all, I was stuffed like a turkey; my belly was so swollen that I had to scoot back from the table and it <i>still</i> bunched up against the edge. But as much as I had eaten, Michael had easily lapped me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew\u2026 oh wow.\u201d He said with a pat of his gut, \u201cThat was really good, Mama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Mom\u2014<i>urp</i>\u2014good job.\u201d Brooke burped, rubbing her belly, \u201cWay to lay it on thick for Mel, here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m no stranger to a good meal.\u201d I laughed weakly as I shook my tonnage of tummy, an action that I quickly regretted, \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to impress me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s good to hear!\u201d Mrs. Mathis said contentedly, laying back to relax her own bloated belly, \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll all have room for dessert? I have a pie in the oven that\u2019s open for grabs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, wow\u2026 no. None for me, thanks.\u201d Michael gripped the back of his chairs (his arms shaking with effort) \u201cI\u2019m stuffed. I got a text from Joseph, so I think I\u2019m gonna play some Battlefront back in my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me either.\u201d Brooke rocked herself to a standing position, \u201cNat and I were going to go hit up the mall\u2014Mel, you wanna come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile I was <i>way</i> too full to really think straight. I mean, on one hand, I could have stayed at that kitchen table for hours. Mrs. Mathis was a chef par excellence, right up there with my Aunt Rhonda, and I definitely wouldn\u2019t have minded staying and having a slice of (or the whole) pie. But on the other hand, I really wanted to get to know my competition. Michael was a hog, easily one of the biggest people I\u2019d ever met. If there was anyone who could give me insight on how to eventually outweigh him, it\u2019d be the man himself. But then there was Brooke, someone who I\u2019d already found that I had a lot in common with and was another fatty of my caliber. She seemed more social than Michael, and I\u2019d learned in Buttercombe that fatties usually travelled in packs. Maybe if I followed Brooke, I\u2019d get a better (and bigger) picture of just how fat-friendly this town was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I decided to hang out with Michael. My mind was made up as I stared at him waddle heavily down the hall and back to his room, observing his mountainous self wobble with each house-shaking footfall. Brooke had mentioned something about Michael being the family's taste tester, but there had to be more to it than that. There just had to be. How else could the youngest in the family get to crest comfortably at what, six to seven-hundred pounds? I had to get to the bottom of this for curiosity's sake and, most important of all, so I could catch up and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Michael being a gamer meant I had a chance to play some wonderful video games. It had been quite a while since the last time I played those, mostly thanks to friends, because a game console, at my house, with my mother? <i>No way</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that left me with a teeny problem. Brooke was still awaiting my answer to her offer to go to the mall. I felt a bit bad; Brooke is great, and I wanted to get to know her better so when I call her my best friend it sounds legitimate. Eh, I can already see myself becoming a regular for the Mathis' bakery business, especially given Mrs. Mathis' rather hospitable nature. I'll make it up to Brooke next time we hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mall sounds fun, but I don't think I wanna get up right now,\" I smiled apologetically and winced, my hands cradling my belly. Man, I'm still feeling that epic meal. In fact, as though to make a point, my gut let out a pretty audible gurgle, followed by gas travelling up my throat until a loud burp came out. \"Sorry. Next time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww!\" she pouted in mock disappointed, but then gave me a grin. \"Alright, but you owe me one!\" she raised her flabby arms and gestured grandly. \"Feel free to make yourself at home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wouldn't wanna impose--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel,\" she cut me off flatly. \"You just had lunch with me, my mom, and lil bro. And you and I seem to have hit it off pretty good, if me saying I've found a new food buddy in you doesn't stand. S'far as we're all concerned, you're one of us now. Isn't that right, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh absolutely!\" Mrs. Mathis chirped from the kitchen, one hand using a wooden spoon to brew something in a pot while the other cradled her overstuffed middle. \"The more mouths for me to feed, the better! Especially because any friend of Brooke's is extended family in my book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was genuinely moved by that, and would've put a hand to where my heart is if not for, y'know, my belly currently being a mini-volcano churning with one hell of a molten food baby and thus needing both my hands to soothe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Brooke smiled widely as she waddled over to the stairs that lead down to the family bakery part of the building. \"Anyway, gotta run. I'll see you later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds cool!\" I gave a mock salute. \"And try <i>not </i>to run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, I took an extra moment to catch my breath before rocking myself into a standing position. I winced as the movement sent me into a jiggle fit that really affected my belly most of all. Luckily, my stomach had digested a fair bit of that epic lunch, and so I felt better. Still full, but room opening up again. Score one for extended stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough about that. Time for the main reason for which I sacrificed hanging out with Brooke for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, would Michael mind if he got an extra, ehh, game partner to play games with him, maybe?\" I queried the Mathis matriarch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an innocent question. Just me asking for permission to play with her youngest. I certainly didn't think it would warrant said mother snapping her attention to me in an instant, looking at me like I was a godsend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mel, you big, absolute sweetheart!\" Mrs. Mathis actually sounded emotional, plump hands clapped together as she stared at me in a somewhat revering light, which was kinda weird. \"I already liked you just from being Brooke's friend and having a healthy appetite to match, but to want to be little Michael's friend, too? It's like my prayers have been answered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I was moved, although I felt sheepish about her excessive praising. \"He doesn't have many friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, he does!\" she clarified cheerfully. \"He and his group just don't socialize so much. They're more of the texting, video chatting, and video game playing sort. Not one to really to go out and enjoy the day like Brooke, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Mathis proceeded to pivot herself around, lumbering over to reach for a <i>big </i>bowl. Seriously, really big, like it was as wide and deep as a jumbo-sized popcorn container. She grabbed these double family-sized bags of chips and proceeded to just empty them into the bowl, humming to herself as a steady mountain of mixed cheesy cheddar and sour cream n onion chips rose up. With a satisfied, singsong \"hmm!\", she grabbed the bowl and approached me. She must have waddled a tad excitedly, because as soon as she was within reach of giving me the bowl, her gut bounced against mine, creating an ocean wave ripple-like effect as our fat sloshed from the tiny impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she handed me the bowl. \"His regular batch of chips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegular? There were enough chips in this bowl for a group of <i>ten</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to take some!\" she cooed motherly-like at me. \"I'll send in more in a bit. Gotta do something about that pie in the oven, first. You sure you don't want a slice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later,\" I smiled kindly. Seriously, snacks like chips were the only thing I felt like stuffing down my gullet. Such was how heavily my normally-bottomless appetite was trounced by the Great Mathis Lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waddled my way down the hall leading to Michael's room, taking a moment to marvel at the incredible width of the doorway. Even with the mega-wide space, I could still picture Michael having to squeeze his way through; seriously, guy had a butt that could occupy an entire couch. Which is why I knew I shouldn't be, but I still was amazed at the fact that I could go through the doorway no problem. No need for turning sideways, or sucking in my gut. This all served to further reinforce my goal to outweigh him someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what awaited me inside was another matter. The room was huge, obviously, very spacious with every super-fat friendly application to it. Super-wide, steel-reinforced computer chair near a study desk that provided enough room for a massive belly to spill down between the legs without swallowing the desk. A king-sized bed on floor level for easy access and plenty of space for one of so much girth. An incredibly wide set of closet doors, and I could only imagine the palace of organized clothes that awaited behind those doors. On the walls there were various posters of various media, from music bands, TV shows, and video game character posters. On the wall in front of the bed was quite possibly the biggest, widest flat-screen TV I had ever seen, which at the moment was displaying a colorful battlefield of lasers, spaceships, and other certain familiar aspects of a certain space opera franchise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, right in the middle of this fat-friendly haven, lying like a king in a humongous beanbag chair was Michael himself, his meatiness melting onto the beanbag like a blob as he stretched comfortably. His piggy eyes were glued to the screen, fat hands gripping a PS4 controller resting on his monumental gut as he played. His fat face was creased in concentration as he belted out commands to other players via his headset. He was the epitome of anti-physical activity, and I felt my determination at surpassing increase a hundredfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Michael!\" I made my presence known by speaking up loudly and stepping right by his side-glance line of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy announcement had the desired effect. Michael let out this tiny, high-pitched squeak as he realized there was someone else in the room. A girl that was neither his sister nor mother. I could only imagine how small he must be feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey!\" he quickly yanked down his headset, which made his flabby cheeks and chins bounce and sway. \"Uhhh, M-Mel, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Michael may just have surpassed my sister Alice in the social awkwardness department. Clearly, he's never been alone with a girl that wasn't his mother or sister. Well, time to go into Cool Big Sis mode and put him at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup, yay, you remembered!\" I beamed at him, holding out the big bowl of chips prominently like an offering to a god. \"I come in peace! As a gesture of goodwill, I bring to you, the man of the house, a bowl of delicious chips, courtesy of the boss lady herself!\" I said in a deep, hammy tone, and believe me, as soon as I was done, I was just about ready to bust a lung laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy geek talk had the desired effect as Michael laughed a little, now looking much more chill as I placed the bowl right next to him. \"I accept your offer, fair lady!\" he wasted no time digging his hand into the bowl and dumping a fistful of chips into his maw. \"Mmmm, your offering pleases, so you're cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" I stuck my fist in the air, my arm wobbling. I then brought my arms behind my back as I struck a schoolgirl pose. \"So Michael, got an extra controller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! But, you play?\" he looked at me in surprise. Definitely never came across a gamer girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe it,\" I grinned. \"So, may I join your campaign, or am I not cool enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool--er, yes, go ahead! You can use my computer chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat!\" I brought the chair forward and allowed myself to collapse on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt squeaked loudly, but held out well. I was even more impressed that my ass was not spilling over the edges. I felt like I was sitting on a throne. Michael gave me the extra controller, and I decided to get comfortable by kicking my sneakers off, enjoying the feeling of my bare feet on the carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Michael grinned, slipping his headset on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" I smirked, making fists with my toes a la John McClane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both took a handful of chips, stuffed our mouths, munched, and just like that, the game was on!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I eventually decided to go to the mall with Brooke and meet up with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, okay, hear me out. Yes, Michael was easily one of the biggest people I'd ever seen. The sight of him, just smothered in rolls, round as a beach ball and struggling to walk, was enough to make me cum a little. I didn't know people <i>could</i> get that fat, and here he was a couple years younger than me and almost twice my weight. I would have <i>loved</i> to have gotten to know him a little better. But if I knew one thing from living with my Aunts, it was that high-caliber feeders like Mrs. Mathis weren't going to just let me and Michael sit idly by. And even though I wasn't exactly shy about stuffing my fat face, I was stuffed. Like, actually stuffed. If I had so much as a biscuit before I left that house, I would have ralphed up everything I'd just eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, side note, it would have been weird for me to hang out in a 17 year old boy's room while his Mom was in the other room when I came over to eat lunch with Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd besides, I didn't really do video games. Shopping I could do. Plus, I knew Brooke a little better, y'know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we packed ourselves into Brooke's minivan. I saw a lot of these around here, but I just figured that there were a lot of soccer moms, this being the South and all. I never made the connection that behind each and every one of those extra bulky vehicles were extra bulky drivers like Brooke, who was so suffocated by her weight that the lowest tier of her gut squished against the steering wheel. Her fluffy thigh practically popped the door open as soon as she pulled the latch, and we waddled inside the Greenville County Mall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you know, it was typical mall stuff. Dying economy, some closed stores. We walked into the food court and it seemed busy enough. Lots of chain restaurants were built into the walls, plenty of tables. I noticed a couple of fatties rolling through the atrium, but nothing like mine or Brooke's sizes. There was a Chic fil a, a Smokeyz Wingz, a Big Burger... the usual fair. I had just eaten, but living with my Aunts had turned me into something of a glutton. My rock hard gut was already gurgling for more in anticipation of all the sights and smells that this dumpy little place had to offer. I rubbed along its dimpled fleshy surface with both of my chubby hands without even thinking about it. No way I was gonna get stared at for rubbing my gut in a town like this, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside me, my big bootied escort was tugging at her heroic leggings as she hoisted one heavy pillar of leg over the other. Her distribution was a bit more bottom-heavy than mine, so I'd finally met someone that I could casually outpace without putting in too much effort. Her face, thinner than mine, was flush and her forehead was damp as her flabby arms shifted from side to side in an attempt to keep her momentum going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Brooke!\" a voice rang over the mall's white noise of customers as a hand extended upwards, \"Over here, I got us a table!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice belonged to who I assumed was Nat. She was a pale brunette with vaguely Russian-esque features, maybe just shy of two hundred pounds. She kept her fudge-brown hair back in a ponytail and wore a cute little top with half-sleeves. She was pretty thick\u2014even from here, I could see where her belly was eeking over the waistband of her jeans, and the little cut where the swell of her upperarm bulged a bit more than the rest of it. Her brown eyes were deep set behind her fat cheeks, and her nose was prominent but flattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke looked at me, smiled, and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Nat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I didn't know any better, I would have sworn that Brooke's pace picked up. But I did know better, because there was no way that her big ass was going to move any faster than it already had been. She wiggle-waddled her way behind me as I bobbed belly-first up to the table that Nat had scored for us. Rather tables. She had gotten four or five of them and scooched them together, presumably because she had eyes and knew that Brooke could eat a table's worth of food in one sitting and not bat an eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had known that <i>I</i> was coming, she may have grabbed a couple more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe big blondes grabbed a chair or two to ourselves and plopped down into jiggling, quivering piles of plumpness. We were both out of breath by the time we had made it there, and getting off my feet felt great. Even if it was only momentary. I hadn't been in this mall for more than five minutes, and I was already starting to forget that I was full...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the girl I was telling you about.\" Brooke said breathlessly, extending a wobbling arm in my direction across the tables, \"Natalia this is Melanie, Melanie Natalia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends call me Nat.\" the (comparatively) smaller girl said with a smile as she sat down next to Brooke. She spoke with a hint of an accent<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my friends call me Mel.\" I snorted, my jowls quivering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job grabbing us a table, btw.\" Brooke gestured to the assorted surfaces we had been granted, presumably for when we inevitably decided to start stuffing our faces, \"You're learning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's either do it now or listen to you bitch about the tables squeaking.\" Natalie said, checking her phone idly, \"Now are we going to get some food, or did I just steal all these tables for nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really <i>are</i> learning!\" Brooke clapped her chubby hands together, making her gut ripple in delight, \"I'm going to make you into a regular Greenville Native yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd things just sort've continued like that. They'd go on back and forth, I'd try to enter without seeming too awkward because I literally just met these people today and despite the fact that I was outgoing as fuck, I didn't want to be rude. We all ordered (I whipped out my Aunt's credit card! Thanks Aunt Rhonda!) and we all pigged out. Hey, this was how I made friends back at Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as our time together wore on, I couldn't help but wonder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had spent a lot of time in Greenville, and I was already beginning to understand that things weren\u2019t exactly \u201cnormal\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI weighed more than five hundred pounds, and I could barely scrape by with so much as a surprised raise of the eyebrows from some of the locals. Brooke and the rest of her family were <i>huge</i>, and this food court in the mall may as well have been its main attraction. My Aunt Sally had gotten enormous since the last time I had seen her, and I was pretty sure that my Aunt Rhonda was as much a chubby chaser as her wife was chubby. There were <i>so many</i> fat folks around here, and it was hard to wrap my head around, but I was doing my best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Brooke\u2019s constant encouragement of Nat was a bit much. Even for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you look like you\u2019re running low.\u201d Brooke would say as her friend scraped the last bit of her fries, \u201cYou want some more? Why don\u2019t I get you some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you gonna let a newbie show you how it\u2019s done?\u201d Brooke laughed when Natalie put her burger down on the wrapper, \u201cLike, come on, don\u2019t be a wimp.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy baby brother can eat more than that.\u201d Brooke rolled her eyes, \u201cGod, it\u2019s like you just like to waste money on food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so hear me out, I was totally okay with Natalie joining us. Moreso, I was totally okay with eating even more, despite having just gotten stuffed by Mrs. Masters. But I never expected Brooke to be like\u2026 well, this when it came to eating. She was a big girl like me, sure. But she seemed so\u2026 I don\u2019t know. In control of it all. Like, I figured if she didn\u2019t live in a house with meaty-ass Michael and her food-crazy Mom, Brooke would probably shrink down in no time. This was the most \u201cfoodie\u201d I\u2019d ever heard her be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, I hadn\u2019t known her long, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird, okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I waited until Natalie had excused herself to the restroom. The rotund-bootied Russian had just waddled out of earshot when I leaned over, my belly cutting into the table, and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Brooke, what the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the big blonde girl just sort\u2019ve looked at me like she had no idea what I was talking about. Which was total bullshit because she hadn\u2019t spoken to me once since we sat down and started eating (which was fine by me. I was too busy stuffing my face to really care whether or not I was being addressed in conversation!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, whatever do you mean, Melly?\u201d she bat her big green eyes at me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatalie. You. Food.\u201d I said, a little smile on my face, \u201cAre you\u2026 <i>trying</i> to make Nat fat?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s when she looked at me, dead in the face, and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How can she have room left for a jelly bean let alone another round of Aunt Rhonda's breakfast, jeez,  I know I couldn't go another round and I pride myself on how much I can put away not only that I could've sworn me and Aunt Sally went plate for plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really had me thinking if I was a real life giant like Aunt Sally would I be able to put it away like her,dumb I know, but still it had to be a factor...right...or it could be that she was just used to it by now (lucky).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda smiled clapping her hands together as if she was about to get to work, I guess in her case feeding Aunt Sally's hungry belly is her job and she was damn good at it. This bodes well for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now you just relax I'll be back in a minute or two\" with a kiss on the Aunt Sally's cheek she left for the kitchen leaving me and Aunt Sally alone at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally leaned back in her chair causing an audible groan from the poor piece of over worked furniture in the process. The look on her face was something that I know quite well, the sweet satisfaction of a good meal.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" so Mel how did you like your new room hope you slept well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at my overstuffed Aunt \"very well thank you. Its been a while since I've gone to bed with a full stomach\"  To emphasis my point I gave my poor tummy a light pat and a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally just gave a heavy sigh \"I bet. your mother is.... quite the women *sigh* I really don't know what your Dad sees in her. I know shes your mother and Rhonda's sister but your Dads a really nice guy and you know. I mean I'm pretty sure that if it wasn't for your Dad you and Alice wouldn't have been allowed to attend me and your aunt's wedding\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh Dad, he really was a very kind man but his passive nature meant that he easily lets mom run the show, what she says goes (god shes a bitch). But my dad didn't let her get away with everything he would often sneak me snacks behind moms back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah my dad is pretty great. He and my sister are the only thing's that I'm gonna miss about that hell hole\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally who by now was idly rubbing her belly awaiting her fourths or was it sixths..I don't remember there was  a lot of food on hand sue me. \" Come on Mel was she that bad. I know that I'm never going to win her over but your her daughter, she may have some backwards views but do you really think that she would let something so trivial like your weight  drive you apart\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that she was trying to do the right thing and be nice but she didn't have to live with her,god she would hate that, a mindbogglingly tall, immensely fat <b>lesbian </b>living with someone like her would drive her crazy.  \"you would think\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation didn't go on for much longer,thank supernatural for that, with the re-arrival of Aunt Rhonda with what could only be described as a feast more then small amount of leftovers she made them out to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are sweetheart\" Aunt Rhonda placed the small family platter on the table and to my surprise or pleasure she placed a plate in front of me full of bacon, eggs, pancakes sausages, hash browns..etc covered in syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must of looked confused because Aunt Rhonda spoke up \" well my sally sure is a big eater\"  Aunt Sally smiled at Aunt Rhonda with her mouth full of food \" but it would of been selfish of me to ignore your needs so I put together a little something for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still feeling quite full from the large breakfast I just ate not even 10 minutes ago but the fat girl that I am never turns down food. \"Thanks Aunt Rhonda\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no problem dear now eat up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwith the food set out in front of me and Aunt Sally we dove in with out abandon with Aunt Rhonda looking on with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- many calories later----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod that was a real bad idea, oh it hurts, god why did I do that I knew it would do this to me. I had managed to devour every last scrap of food that had been laid out in front of me and I was a complete mess my pj's already tight on my huge 400 pound frame were surely close to ripping or tearing apart at the slightest movement,huh movement something I had no intentions of doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't the only one felling the effects of pushing the limits of gluttony. Sat a cross from my own overstuffed frame sat Aunt Sally clutching the sides of her massive belly breathing heavily as Aunt Rhonda wiped any mess from her face and sweeping up any unwanted crumbs from her person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you did a good job sally you to Mel\" Was that pride in Aunt Rhonda's voice? \"there's no better way to start the day than a good breakfast\" she stated matter-of-factly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff*....T..thanks...*pant*...Rhonda..*huff*...that was ..*burp*.. that was definitely the best way to kick off the day ..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Aunt Rhonda and Aunt Sally started to laugh, not really sure why but I guess its a couple thing it was kinda cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally's laughter must of jostled something deep in side her because the next thing I knew she let out one hell of a burp<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BURP</b>...oh excuses me\"           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Bing</b></i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Riiiipppp</b></i><br>\r\n        <br>\r\nI watched as Aunt Sally's already taxed outfit could no longer hold out against that last bout of gluttony and that belch was all her already undersized outfit to simply come undone. Aunt Sally's skirt button flew straight across the room landing on the floor by my chubby little feet.I would of bent down to pick it up but you know that meant moving.The look on Aunt Sally's face as she realized what just happened was something I knew well, a look of relief and frustration. The relief came from the sweet release from the claws of constrictive clothing. The frustration came from ruining another set of clothing something that just thinking about sent tingles to my private parts, I wonder if my aunts share the same turn on's as me. By the looks of it Aunt Sally didn't share those feelings but  then again they do seem to fall in to the standard feeder-feedee relationship. moving here was such a good idea.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Arg, Dammit ....*urp*....not...a..again..that ...*urp*...was my last good work skirt \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her seat next to her Aunt Rhonda  leaned over and started to slowly rub the underside of Aunt Sally's now exposed stomach soothing her worries and aching gut,it was almost mother like. This was the first time I actually got a good look at Aunt Sally's huge belly. Aunt sally's belly unlike mine that was made up of two fat rolls or a double belly if you will. Aunt Sally's was one huge mound of fat that seemed to both stick out in front of her deifying gravity whilst having a decent hang at the same time. If I haven't said it yet I will say it Now Aunt Sally is one unique lady. I also noticed some stretch marks around the sides of her belly some faint light pink and some a deeper red. I assume they where like mine, pink ones are old and the red ones are new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well to be fair Sally your wardrobe needed to be updated anyway your clothes were getting...a tad outdated\"  That was a nice way of saying <i>you were getting too fat for them</i> but either Aunt Sally didn't notice or she didn't care if I had to guess I would say it was the latter .\" And beside now you have an excuse to blow off work have fun, go shopping and spend the day with me and Mel\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally closed her eyes as she relaxed enjoying the soft touch of Aunt Rhonda's hands soothing her taxed belly \"hmm, I guess your right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm right. Now go get changed and head down to the mall and take Mel with you it would be nice for her to spend the day with you getting to now the place a bit. Right Mel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up in surprise at the mention of my name and my aunt putting me forward for going to the mall like that. Now I had no problem spending time with Aunt Sally but I was still feeling the effects of breakfast but then again like Aunt Sally my wardrobe was in need of an update. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"urm, yeah sure sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now go get dressed while I help Sally get ready\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Well at least I wasn't alone suffering this problem Aunt Sally looked to be having a little bit of an issue in the ole standing department as well. She had to use the the table and Aunt Rhonda to stand up and waddle off to their room to get ready leaving me to struggle on alone, poor me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a steady rocking motion, and a couple failed attempts, I finally managed to get up off my fat ass and on to my fat feet but all the effort to get up off the my fat ass mixed in the fact that I was still digesting a heavy breakfast left me feeling a little worse for wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly waddled my way back to my room to pick out an outfit that still actually fit and was at least half way presentable to be out in public. Hey just cuz a girl likes to show off her fat doesn't mean she doesn't want to look good doing it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling past what I could only gather was my Aunt's bedroom,I guess stairs are a bit much for Aunt Sally now, I overheard some very familiar sounds coming from the inside. Its not what you think,jeez, It was the sound of Aunt Sally &amp; Rhonda struggling to try fit Aunt Sally in to her clothes. Full of curiosity Mel placed her ear against the door to hear what was going on of the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------- The other side---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stood in front of Rhonda, her beet red and sweat forming atop of her brow  \",ugh, come on...you son of a....jeez I don't remember it being this hard\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Sally was in the midst of a losing battle with a pair of black jeans, no matter how hard she pulled she just couldn't get the button in the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda sat on their bed next to a pile of discarded clothes that clearly no longer fit Sally's larger frame. Rhonda smiled as she watched her Wife huff and puff and jiggle all over the room trying in vain to find a pair of clothes that still fit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up, sweat dripping down her face, this was the most exercise sally had in years, she struggled to catch her breath. \"*huff*...Jeez...*Huff*.....R..Rhonda...*Puff*...did you shrink all my clothes. I mean this is ridiculous how can everything be so tight. I mean I know I've put on a few but come on \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Rhonda just sat on their bed looking up at her fat wife and frowned, <i>did she really not know?</i>, but her smile quickly returned as she stood from the bed craning her neck up to meet Sally's eyes  \"Now Sally quite cha bellyaching will ya\" reaching forward she took hold of the two flaps of material feeling the softness and weight of Sally's huge belly as she had to lift it up to get to the button and the button hole. \" Now Sally I want ya to take a deep breath..and.......  \" With a grunt from both women and a bit of herculean strength from Rhonda she managed to fasten the clearly undersized jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling quite proud of herself Rhonda smiled up at the sweaty giant that was her wife \"There you are, see that wasn't so hard now was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally could feel how constrictive her jeans were right now but she didn't care what that truly meant she just cared that her jeans still fit. looking down at her smiling wife Sally making her double chin stand out even more than it usually dose, and couldn't help but smile herself  \" Says the women who only ever wear's dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda couldn't help but pout and gave a twirl showing off her powder blue floral design sun dress. \"what you don't like it? I thought I looked really cute in this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally chuckled herself at her wife's child like antics \" awww y'all know I think your the cutest thing I ever did see. But you know better then anyone how hard it is to find decent clothes for women of....*cough*...my size \" Sally's voice trailed of at the end, old insecurities about her larger then normal size seemed to have flared up within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing Sally's unease Rhonda quickly reached up with her left hand and stroked Sally's chubby cheek lovingly \" Hey hey now, ya know I love you for you, we've been together for 10 amazing years and in those 10 years my love for you has only grown stronger. your size is... well lets just say I never found you more attractive then I do right Know\" <br>\r\nWith her right hand Rhonda began to slowly and lovingly massage Sally's massive gut. Which in turn caused Sally to softly let out moans of pleasure.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----- Back on the right side ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel quickly pulled her ear away from her aunts bedroom door upon hearing Aunt Sally began to moan in pleasure. \"Whoa ok time to pull back and make my exit, Jeez I might have a curious nature but I ain't no perv\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mel made her way to room she couldn't help but smile, her aunts really did have a loving relationship, <i>Huh I might be a wee bit jelly right now</i>. Plus as wired as it sounds I kinda like that my Aunt suffers from these kind of problems,not the whole lacking in self confidence thing,<i> I'm a glutton not a monster</i> but the whole, too fat for your clothes thing. I knooow it sounds soooo wrong but hear me out. Ok, Its nice to now that you live in a house where your not the only one who.... lived a certain life style and dealt with the consequences of said life style If you catch ma meaning. Now I'm not saying I enjoy my Aunt's troubles,I'm not really, but it's nice to have things in common with someone close to you.Anyway enough standing around listening to my Aunt's, I was starting to feel  wired that I was even doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Mel long to find a outfit that she liked. Unlike Aunt Sally,who had outgrown her clothe's, Mel was just in the midst of outgrowing her clothes. Having yet gained enough weight to have actually outgrown them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in simple black jeggins a black and purple striped long sleeved t-shirt, that clung to her plump body like a second skin just the way Mel liked it. with the sleeves actually rolled up and a pair of white converse Mel's outfit was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel waited in the living room for a couple of minutes for Aunt Sally to finish getting dressed, idly munching on a bag of chips she found laying on the small table that was set out in front of the couch. So she didn't notice Aunt Sally now fully dressed make her way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you ready to go and spend the day with your favorite aunt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally's voice and sudden arrival caused Mel do jump \"wha?!\" Mel blushing ever so slightly from embarrassment quickly regained her composure \" I..I mean yeah sure\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt sally just stifled a giggle feeling quite proud of herself. I mean its not every day someone her size can sneak up on someone.Standing up Mel was  able to get a good look at the outfit that her aunt had chosen to wear, or better yet the outfit that she could actually fit in to.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally was wearing a pair of dark blue jeans that looked like they were painted on and the  slightest misstep would cause them to tear a few seams. To accompany the Jeans Aunt Sally wore a simple burgundy blouse that showed of her amazing cleavage,unfortunately her cleavage wasn't the only thing that the top showed. The blouse was stretched so tight across her body that it left nothing to the imagination. Every fat roll on Aunt Sally's torso was on show for all to see,her back fat, love handles, her belly button, It outlined perfectly the shape of her huge belly. On her feet she wore a simple pair of pink flip flops that matched the colour of her toenail polish. what a cute colour I might have to borrow it sometime Looking at Aunt Sally's feet for a moment Mel noticed that even Aunt Sally's shoes were on the small side as her toes hung slightly over the edge enough to actually touch the floor. Looking at this Mel stated to feel a little sorry for her sweet giant of an Aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez is there nothing that can fit her?\" Mel mumbled under her breath. Mel wasn't a idiot she new from first hand experience that the bigger you are the less likely you where to find decent clothes. But still she couldn't find flip flops in her size?.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Sally oblivious to Mel's thoughts clapped to her hands together in glee ready to spend the day with her niece. \" Ok if y'all are ready then lets hit the road\"<br>\r\n          </span></div></div>",

She was supportive, friendly, and probably the best example of a \"cool aunt\" I could have ever asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what I understand, she looked more like Grandpa than Grandma.

She was a lawyer for some firm in town and lived in a nice apartment, but it's in the downtown area because she liked to go out and party. Seriously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it, maybe I <i>do</i> know why she and my Mom never got along--they had absolutely nothing in common!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie Rhonda!\" I squealed in the car as I saw her waiting for me out on the apartment's stoop. I wriggled my way out of the car with surprising speed, considering I'd spent the whole ride over with my gut wedged underneath the steering wheel. A flood of McDonalds' wrappers cascaded onto the pavement, but I didn't care. I heaved myself up and waddled over to wrap my favorite aunt and new roommate in a big, fleshy hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I've missed you so much\" she sounded so happy to see me as I pressed her tightly between my breasts, trying in vain to wrap her arms around me \"Let me get a look at you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last time my Aunt Rhonda saw me was last Christmas and about fifty pounds ago. She was over for the holidays with my Aunt Frieda, and it happened to be the Christmas that Mom decided that I was too fat for a real Christmas dinner so she made all this \"healthy\" crap. Nobody liked it. Rhonda was actually the first one to suggest pizza, and got me tickets to see Hillary Heart in concert. Seriously, coolest Aunt ever or what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotten so... big!\" I could tell she was caught off-guard by how much of me there was to go around, considering I had only gotten even fatter since the last time she'd seen me, \"What did they <i>feed</i> you at that school, Mel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything, mostly.\" I rubbed the incredible swell of my stomach as it jutted out from underneath my t-shirt, \"But hey, it's my fault for going back for seconds, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda laughed. She had always been a really good-looking woman. Where my Mom was built like a beanpole, Aunt Rhonda had the curvy figure (and something of a reputation) of a seductress. Full round hips and a big butt with perky breasts. Is it weird that I've paid that much attention to this? She'd picked up something of a slight accent since moving down south too. Nothing really noticeable, but enough to make me feel even more... at home. Y'know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know what I can do about 'everything', but mi casa es su casa.\" Rhonda broke away from the hug and pat me on the crest of my belly, \"What do you say...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Best aunt ever, or what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe hopped into her little luxury car and drove to a little pizzeria further into downtown, her Lexus leaning dangerously to one side as I clogged the passenger seat and then some. My last stop was at a Burger King about an hour ago, and since I was scraping the bottom of the barrel in my travel fund I couldn't exactly splurge on the triple Whoppers like I liked to. Needless to say, pizza sounded pretty good right about now. It didn't help that all the way over, Aunt Rhonda wouldn't shut up about how awesome this place was and how it was locally owned and how it was like some kind of \"dive-bar-meets-Dominos.\" I was smacking my lips all the way over, my gut gurgling as loud as the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe pulled up and parked (thank GOD we found a spot nearby, because she wanted to park down the street and walk the rest of the way) after about ten minutes of slow traffic. I heaved myself out of her shiny black car and slammed the door shut, already lumbering my way towards the entrance. I could smell the heavy aroma of cheese, sauce and deli meats and it was driving me wild. I paid no mind to the infinite amount of people on the sidewalk, or even the hipster I bumped into. All I could think about was pizza, and how much of it I could fit in my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo my aunt and I got a booth and some chubby girl took our order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rhonda, good to see you.\" the waitress smiled at my aunt and I, \"The usual, two slices and a Dr. Pepper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Marianne, that sounds about right.\" my aunt smiled back, \"And I'll be taking care of her too. Mel, do you need a minute to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a large pepperoni with olives.\" I said greedily, my hands on my rumbling belly as it touched the lip of the table, \"And a Coke. Refills are free, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so yeah, in retrospect it might have been a little rude of me to get a whole pizza to myself. I <i>probably</i> should have asked if that was okay, considering my aunt offered to pay and all. But dammit I was hungry! Surely this was something she saw coming. I mean, come on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay... one large pepperoni with olives and a Coke.\" the waitress chirped as she wrote the ticket and gave it to my aunt, \"It'll be just a bit on your pizza, and I'll be right out with your drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away, leaving us alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Mel, you really <i>are</i> starving.\" Aunt Rhonda snorted, \"Don't hold back on my behalf or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" I said bashfully, \"It's just... you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no, I get it. I wouldn't offer if I didn't want you to get what you wanted.\" she got a couple of napkins ready, \"Besides, it's your welcome party! You should get to indulge a little, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever tell you you're my favorite aunt?\" I asked longingly from across the table, \"Because if you're serious, I'll take you up on that offer right now. And I'll like... go buy you a trophy that says #1 Aunt on it, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, go all out.\" my aunt laughed, \"My treat, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt my stomach kick and a familiar tingle in my crotch. My stomach RSVP'd my aunt's invitation with a hungry growl. I resisted the urge to touch it, to feel its soft bloatedness between my chubby fingers. Just as the words left her lips, our waitress returned with our drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marianne right?\" I asked her as she put the glasses on the table, \"Do you think maybe we could get some breadsticks or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure.\" she nodded happily and scribbled something else down on the ticket, \"Do you want the personal order or would you like to split--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get the biggest size.\" I cut her off, already a little overstimulated, \"And I'm gonna need to make that <i>two</i> pizzas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, Aunt Rhonda said she was paying <i>and</i> told me to go all out. It would be rude of me not to.</span></div></div>",

It's actually kind of a turn on to know that, for whatever reason, they can't stop staring at me just as much as I can't stop eating. Whether they love it or hate it, I can't get enough of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, I didn't partitucularly mind that my aunt was my audience of one for the night. Not that I was actually cognizant acknowledge that fact for longer than a few seconds before going back to stuffing my face. At first she tried making conversation with me, which I almost kinda reciprocated. But eventually as my mind grew hazy in gluttony and my answers grew shorter and shorter, Aunt Rhonda sort of got the picture and kept quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a machine, having gone back and doubled my doubled order as soon as Marianne came back with the breadsticks, <i>and</i> ordered an extra two rounds of breadsticks. I was shoving half of the sizeable slices in my mouth at a time, chewing and gnashing noisily as I let out throaty, husky moans. I leaned into the table with my elbows, my fat tits and a thick roll of belly squashed between it and the rest of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrp...more.\" I burbled at poor Marianne, who had been a real champ through all this, as she came back to refill my Coke. I know I must have looked like a greedy bitch, but I just couldn't help it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, these pizzas. Oh my God these pizzas. They were huge. Looking back on it, I realized why my aunt's \"usual\" was only two slices, because a large pizza took up about half the table. The pepperoni slices were as big as coasters, and the crust was so sweet and flaky that I could have died right then and there. And my fat ass had ordered four of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lifted one of my thick, doughy arms and lowered a piece into my mouth as a trickle of grease ran down from the cheese and into my mouth. I bit down sinfully over a full half of that slice as cheese and grease dripped down my throat. I pretty much shoveled it into my mouth, having officially finished my first Fat-Ass-Sized pizza and celebrating by deep throating some breadsticks drowned in marinara sauce.  Aunt Rhonda watched me with some concern as I suddenly stopped. Probably sure that my little feast had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bunched my face up in a pout. I could feel the tightness of my already too-small shirt pressing uncomfortably into my gut. I wiped the grease onto it, freeing up my hands to reach underneath the hem and roll it up tube-top style beneath my tits. With a happy little fatty grunt, I fondled my gut contentedly with one hand while stuffing myself with the other, eventually returning to normal two-fisted eating practices soon enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know this probably won't surprise you, but out of all four of those tires-called-pizzas (seriously, who besides me could even eat <i>one</i> of those?!)

Go me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four pizzas, stacked on top of each other, took up a considerable amount of table space and were stacked about six inches tall (accounting for the pans and stuff they came in, whatever), and I managed to fit <i>all</i> of it in my big fat gut, <i>and</i> most of the breadsticks. Granted, I didn't feel so hot afterwards, but that's not the point. My stomach was so full and round. It practically radiated heat as my digestive system struggled to keep up with its incredible workload. It pressed so uncomfortably against the table as it hung down, all huge and swollen after my epic Welcome Home feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get y'all anything else?\" chubby little Marianne squeaked as she came up to us, no doubt still fearful that I was going to snap at her, \"We, um... we officially don't have anymore breadsticks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout it, Mel?\" I couldn't tell if Aunt Rhonda was being serious or not, \"You got room for dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...No...\" I gasped, hands kneading my swollen gut as I struggled to breathe, \"Think'm...fll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweetie, I think my niece is done for the day.\" she slipped Marianne her platinum credit card, \"She actually just moved down here. Probably just got a little overexcited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... y-yeah.\" Marianne agreed nervously as she watched me struggle to stay conscious on my side of the booth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marianne left, my Aunt's eyes turned back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to head home, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, this is why I loved my aunt. If this was my Mom, she would have bitched me out in front of the entire restaurant for even thinking to order so much. Then she would have let me eat it all. And then she would have bitched me out again for eating it all. I mean yeah, that was probably for my own good or whatever. But not Aunt Rhonda. I don't know if she's the coolest or most irresponsible woman on the planet, but at this point I didn't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out this monster burp that shook the windows. Seriously, I could hear everything in the whole place stop as soon as I let it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I made such a...hff... hog out of myself, Aunt Rhonda...\" I huffed trying desperately to wriggle my way out of the booth, as the pizzeria slowly came back to life, \"You sure you're not...urp... mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did my best to heave myself up from the booth, but my fat ass and belly weren't going to be having any of that. My gut stuck out a lot further when I was stuffed to my max, and it seriously killed my already wonky sense of balance. My aunt had to walk over and help me up, which means she got a first-hand look at how sweaty I left that booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not the one who's gonna have to deal with all that pizza on the other end.\" she poked my belly (I almost threw up on her), \"And hey, I'm the one who told you to go all out, right? Just... next time give me some warning, first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded sleepily in response. When did it get so dark out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get you home.\" she pat my back and guided me towards the door, \"I was <i>gonna</i> show you around today but then <i>somebody</i> ate our day away. Almost literally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we got home, I was ready to pass out. Aunt Rhonda walked me in, made sure I could fit through the front door, and told me where the guest room was and I just sort of lumbered in and passed out. I didn't change out of my clothes or anything. I just flopped down on my side and went right to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wouldn't wake up until hours later...</span></div></div>",

She of all people should know that I was trying to sleep off last night's epic pizza binge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I was pretty sure I couldn't even go back to sleep if I wanted to, I decided to skip my pre-waking ritual of checking facebook and skip right to the getting up part. Besides, the sooner I got up, the sooner I could get breakfast, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ripped the covers off and wriggled my way over to the edge of the bed, pouring myself into an uneasy standing position as I jiggled myself awake. The whole place shook as my feet came down heavily on the apartment floor. I stormed out of what I would later come to appreciate as a <i>very</i> nice bedroom for a downtown apartment, not realizing that I had at some point kicked off my pants. My stomach was untucked from my ratty pink panties, wobbling and slapping against my fat thighs audibly with every step I took. I might have been turned on if I weren't so upset about being woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...pff...hey Mel...\" my aunt was doing stretches in front of the flat-screen, all decked out spandex. She paused the Jillian Michaels workout and turned to face me, \"How'd you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rm...\" I grumbled, my lower lip stuck out in an exaggerated pout, \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just okay?\" she put her hands on her hips, \"Those are eight hundred thread-count sheets. I'd hoped you'd sleep a little better than <i>okay</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grumbled. Two days in and I've already eaten sixty dollar's worth of pizza and insulted her expensive bedsheets. I definitely couldn't tell her that it was her stupid workout routine that woke me up, considering that she was letting me live with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, yeah, it was great.\" I lied sleepily, \"Just, uh... still getting used to sleeping in a new place is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that my stomach let out the deepest, greediest growl it could make, taking away my aunt's attention for a minute. Considering all the pizza I ate last night, even <i>I</i> was surprised that I could be hungry so soon after. I smiled embarrassedly and brought both hands to my massive middle, scratching my lowermost roll as it swelled out from underneath my t-shirt and making it sway from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Aunt Rhonda said knowingly, \"So it <i>wasn't</i> the sheets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think that this might have had something to do with it.\" I grabbed both flanks of my gut and pressed inward slightly, making it bulge out a little farther \"So, I hate to ask this of you again so soon but... do you think maybe we could go grab a bite to eat?\"</span></div></div>",

I guess I could skip my workout for the day, besides, what\u2019s one missed session, we only live once, so why not enjoy ourselves.\u201d Delighted by my aunts answer, I slowly waddled over to her and wrapped her in a squishy, fat filled hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, we visited a burger place, a local legend for its incredibly large, greasy burgers, their small was about the size of a normal restaurants large, and don\u2019t get me started on their double whammy burger, three buns, five patty\u2019s, ten different kinds of cheese, an entire jar of pickles, an entire onion chopped up and spread through the burger, absolutely swimming in condiments. After arriving and parking, aunt Rhonda and I entered the building, the smell was intoxicating, hand cut fries, locally raised, grass fed beef, freshly baked buns, it was like heaven. As we walked in, the cashier greeted us, saying, \u201cWhy hello Rhonda, I assume your usual, a small burger with a small box of fries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda waved and gave the Cashier a smile , greeting her in return, \u201cHello Tammy, you\u2019re right on the money, as usual, and this is my favorite niece, Mel, I\u2019ve told you about her, so, Mel what do you want, you can have anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Aunt Rhonda with a huge grin, I then swiftly turned to the cashier, causing my many fatty rolls to jiggle, \u201cI\u2019ll have five double whammy\u2019s with two plates of fries.\u201d I began to drool slightly as I thought of the feast I was about to have. Feeling content, a patted my expansive belly and prepared for the oncoming onslaught of food. It was then that the cashier made this my favorite restaurant in town with one simple phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like steak instead of beef.\u201d She\u2019d done it, she\u2019d made this place better than it already was, having my order taken, I went to sit down at a booth, it was a bit of a struggle, but I finally managed to get my fat ass through. Within twenty minutes of ordering, the food was at our table, surprising, considering how much I ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile aunt Rhonda ate slowly, savoring her food, I ate quickly with reckless abandon. Constantly moving the five pound burgers to my mouth, ang taking a bite of the greasy amalgamation of steak, cheese, and bread. In time I finished all five burgers and the two large plates of fries, I was absolutely stuffed beyond my limits, with a pair of incredibly greasy hands, I massaged my incredibly stuffed gut, accidentally spreading grease as my taught belly bobbed up and down with each labored breath, in a state of unbelievable discomfort, I said, \u201cUGHHHHH Uuuuuuurp, Aunt Rhonda, I had fun but, why did you let me do thiiiis, thank you, but why did you let me do that.\u201d My attempts to soothe my discomfort with belly rubs was not proving fruitful, partly because I could barely move my arms after being so stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda simply looked at me and said, \u201cOh I couldn\u2019t say no to that face\u201d aunt Rhonda leaned over the table to pinch my chubby cheeks, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s fun to skip my work out once in a while and splurge, so thank you for convincing me, Mel.\u201d It took the combined efforts of me, aunt Rhonda, and Tammy to dislodge me from the booth, I very nearly fell onto them, but with the help of some random stranger, they were able to keep me stable as I very slowly waddled to the car, this time I had to squeeze into the back, a feeling I\u2019d become accustomed to in the weeks to come.

Which really sucked because I had <i>no</i> idea where I was going or what was around me. She lived in the heart of downtown, and I was more than a few states out of my element.

It hugged every inch of me, wrapped around me so tightly that you could see me jiggling beneath the fabric. My jeans were just as tight, if not moreso. You could count the dimples on my ass through the denim. They were just big enough for me to close over my fupa, but I was really hoping that maybe I could pop the button before lunch and let it all hang out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe get a few stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone from across the restaurant lets me know how fat I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA-Anyway, so long story short, it was hot and I was already exhausted with the apartment building still within sight.

I was sure she was going to start bitching at me. Tell me where to watch where I was going or something, she totally had every right to be pissed at me. But she actually wound up being pretty cool. It helped that I was flipping my shit. Yeah she was a little woozy, but she came out of our little fender-belly-bender alright, so instead of me trying to calm her down, she was trying to calm <i>me</i> down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>so</i> sorry!\" I apologized frantically, unable to really bend over.

The <i>best</i> place to score a breakfast burrito on the cheap is Mexican Pepper. I <i>could</i> show you the way... if you paid me off in burritos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sixty dollars crumpled up in my purse whined. I would need to save all three of those Jacksons, just in case. I didn't know how long Aunt Rhonda was going to keep feeding me before she realized I could eat her out of house and home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again Lily <i>was</i> pretty skinny.

It was a nice little place, filled wall-to-wall with stereotypical Mexican restaurant fare.

Most importantly, for a restaurant smack-dab in the middle of downtown, they were cheap.

No big deal, right? I got my fat ass up, pushed the table a little further into Lily's personal space to accomodate for my well-fed weightiness, and waddled over to the bathroom. Again, no big deal, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously I was going to have to start paying better attention. I wasn't used to all this furniture being in my way.

But, for the second time today, I wasn't watching where I was steering my supreme swollenness and I hit something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't an actual person this time, but I <i>did</i> knock over a free-standing table. Seriously, I knocked it all over. Entrees, drinks, napkins, plates, everything was sent flying down to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, watch where you're going wide-load!\" said some snooty hipster bitch as she pushed away from all the calamity<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah phone!\" her friend wailed in a thick southern accent, diving down to the floor to retrieve what was now a thoroughly ruined iphone, soaked in sweet tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so by this point, people were starting to stare. I had more or less done a relatively good job of keeping people from doing that today. At least, as good a job as someone of my incredible size could manage. But now that I was standing in the middle of the restaurants and these two twigs were raising immortal hell, I was starting to get embarassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" I winced, looking at the very expensive phone, \"My bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right it's <i>your</i> bad, you fatass!\" the first chick said. She had no accent, but she looked like just about every stereotypical Alpha Bitch in every teenaged movie ever. Long blonde hair, trendy clothes, and an odor of unmistakably expensive perfume. \"What the fuck is wrong with you, can't you steer that ginormous monster belly of yours away from other people?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to say something along the lines of 'actually, I've been having something of a problem with that lately' but I decided that it would be in poor taste, considering Lily was still in earshot. Plus, these girls might have been overreacting just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah poor phone...\" the other chick, equally stereotypical sattelite Beta Bitch with curly brunette hair and a similar taste in style, \"You fat bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, hey, I said I was sorry.\" I furrowed my brow, \"No need to get nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're already nasty enough.\" the blonde one stuck a finger venomously between my belly folds, \"You fucking cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment...</span></div></div>",

Really modern-looking decoration with lots of high-end appliances that looked like they hadn't ever been used. That television that woke me up this morning looked a <i>lot</i> bigger now that I was awake, and the couch looked very inviting after walking all that way out from the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" I said smarmily as I waddled on in, clutching our bag of leftovers in one hand, \"Lawyer money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second's hesitation, I plopped my massive ass right down on the couch. It was a sturdy structure. Didn't even groan when I sat on it. Shook the whole damn apartment, but not the couch. Now that I was finally home, I rolled up a little bit of my tank top and unbuttoned my jeans, untucking and letting my belly hang free before biting into a kinda-cold breakfast burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's her client, Bill Gates?\" Lily whistled impressedly as she touched the flat-screen hanging over about sixty percent of the wall, \"She must be <i>loaded</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she <i>did</i> manage to shill out sixty bucks for pizza last night.\" I smiled knowingly, pinching an inch of stomach that had rolled out from underneath my top, \"So yeah, I really hope she is.

You don't wanna start porking out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" she rolled her eyes, snatching the bag out of my hand, \"Something tells me you won't starve if I take this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might.\" I whine, rubbing my belly sensually in a way that only slightly gets me hot, \"You don't know what it's like to have to deal with this big, greedy tummy of mine.

I had met this girl by bumping into her belly-first, then she took me to this really awesome restaurant, <i>then</i> we almost got into a fight and we'd spent the last few hours chilling at my Aunt's place like we'd known each other for years. Maybe it had something to do with having a sister that was bigger than her, but she didn't make me feel like a freak. Or make me feel bad for loving my body. <i>Or</i> for ordering four sub sandwiches and a large two liter.

I was so used to living in Buttercombe Academy that even being home was kind of like living somewhere completely new. I didn't really have any friends there, and I had just moved here. And as much as Aunt Rhonda was down for a sixty-dollar pizza binge, I wasn't exactly ready to come out and tell her that I was trying to get even fatter on purpose.

Seriously, it was as easy as that to find a friend. Who knew? I'd been in South Carolina for about two days and I'd already eaten myself stupid on pizza, found a cheap mexican restaurant, and made a friend who would put up with me being a colossal fatass.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so my first few days living with my aunt were more or less uneventful. I ate, I slept, I ate more, I hung out with Lily a couple of times which inevidably led to me eating, Aunt Rhonda never even thought about learning to cook so we got takeout every night, et cetera. Don't get me wrong, it was a lot more fun than anything I would have been doing at home. But I was binge-watching Netflix almost as fast as I was binge eating, and a girl can only spend so many hours inside before she starts to get bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why I was happy that, on Aunt Rhonda's first day off since I got home, we had a little outing together. I mean, don't get me wrong, I wasn't exactly thrilled to be walking anywhere, but still. The thought was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mel, at least <i>try</i> to keep up.\" my aunt called ahead of me, \"It'll <i>closed</i> before we get there at this rate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever my aunt wasn't wearing pantsuits and rocking skirt-blazer-and-blouse combos, she liked to dress down. Which was weird for me, because my Mom liked to dress like a school-marm everywhere she went. Aunt Rhonda had put on a pair of form-fitting jeans, a half-sleeved tight little t-shirt, and a pair of nearly-new Chucks; but she still managed to look runway-ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have been jealous if I wasn't so exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a... break!\" I whined as I bounced down the sidewalk, \"You're the one who wouldn't let me stop at that hotdog stand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I <i>let</i> you stop at the pretzel stand. <i>And</i> the corndog stand!\" Aunt Rhonda stopped and folded her arms across her chest, waiting patiently for my fat ass to catch up, \"Seriously Mel, I'm not made of money. I mean, big apartment, nice clothes, and picking up the tab for dinner aside, if I stopped every time you got hungry I'd be broke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I'd moved in with my aunt, I'd pretty much been stuffing my fat face non-stop. Which was great in a lot of different ways, but not for my wardrobe. I'd only put on another five pounds since my arrival, but that was just enough to bust all the buttons off of my jeans. And rip my stretchpants. But, thanks to the good people who invented spandex, my short-shorts were still <i>very</i> wearable. They were big and bright and yellow, and I'd somehow managed to pour myself into them. Granted, they weren't big enough for me to tuck my stomach into. My belly was left unshielded to the elements, clearing my path for me as it quivered and quaked with my every awkward step. Behind me, my ass constantly threatened to swallow up the ugly yellow seat of the things, and I had to reach behind me every so often to pick the spandex out of my crack. I'd found an old blue tank top and managed to drape it over myself, but that wasn't much better. It was tight, so tight that it kept riding up on my belly. You could see every inch of me through my clothes, every dimple and fold. I'd attracted a <i>lot</i> of attention this morning. A girl my size barely dressed, walking around letting her big belly flop around and eating up a storm at every food vendor we passed? How could I <i>not</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean it wasn't that Aunt Rhonda wasn't pretty or anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just that there was <i>so</i> much more of me to stare at than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I'm coming...\" I puffed, \"What's got you so... riled up... anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking that... you know, since you got here we haven't really spent any time together. No Auntie-Niece time, you know?\" my aunt slowed her pace to match with my glacial waddling, \"I mean, it's good that you're hanging out with your friend Lily, but I wanted to be the one to show you around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said thanks again for fronting the bill at Pizza Pie, by the way.\" I interjected, whipping out my phone to show her the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, there's this little shop opening up a little further out, and I thought it'd be a great place for you and me to spend some time together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know, we were headed to...</span></div></div>",

It was a smaller building, dwarfed by the towers and skyscrapers in the rest of downtown, but it looked inviting nonetheless. Freshly painted, grand-opening sign out front, and large bay windows facing the street so I could get a great view of all the customers that weren't inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, where they even <i>open</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to find out as I barged in, belly-first and shiny with sweat. The summers in South Carolina were this awful mix of heat and humidity, something that my three hundred or so extra pounds of insulation didn't agree with. By then, my tank top was absolutely drenched in sweat. My belly had completely wriggled its way out of my shorts, and I had a wedgie straight out of rebel-flag-waving, southern-accent-talking, ocean-humidity hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt Rhonda had just barely gotten in the door when this woman, about her age and a good forty pounds heavier, greeted us. She was blonde, had on lots of makeup, and was wearing this bright red t-shirt with APPLE DUMPLING'S written across her impressive, southern-fried chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, happy y'all could make it out today!\" she said with an accent as thick as her waistline, \"Were y'all lookin' to dine in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please.\" Aunt Rhonda said pleasantly as struggled to breathe beside her, \"And, um... do you think we could get a booth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, follow me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The red-clad waitress lead us to a little corner pocket in the restaurant with a great view of downtown. At least, my aunt told me it was. I wasn't very focused on looking out on the street at the moment, considering I was pretty sure that I was dying from heat stroke. What's worse, the booth that our waitress had chosen was just a bit too snug for my impeccable girth. So my belly was already brushing against the edge of the table, which I'd learned could get very uncomfortable very fast after even just a little feasting, and there was pretty much nothing I could do about it. The booths were made into the wall, and the table was bolted to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So welcome to Apple Dumplin's, mah name's Savannah.\" the waitress gave us two menus, \"In case y'all were wondering, yes we <i>are</i> still doin' the Grand Opening discount; just, y'know, to get people talkin'.\" she whispered the last part playfully behind her manicured hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every order of a cake or dozen donuts of any kind is 30% off, a pan of anything like brownies or rice krispy squares is 20%, and the single items are buy one, get one half off.\" she continued, pointing out examples on a flyer she left on our table, \"And, just so you ladies know, every order over $20 comes with a free Apple Dumplin's t-shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" Aunt Rhonda said excitedly, \"My niece and I are going to need just a little more time though, is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. Take yer time.\" Savannah gave us a once over with a big smile, \"Just holler if you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur waitress made her way back behind the counter, into the kitchen, leaving my aunt and I to our own devices. I honestly wasn't sure what to make of this place yet. Yeah the servers were friendly, and there were some pretty good discounts on some already cheap prices, but it was hella out of the way and these booths were <i>not</i> fat girl friendly. Plus, if Savannah was any indication, I'd need a translator every time I came in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this place just great?\" Aunt Rhonda smiled eagerly as she looked up at me from the menu, \"I mean, can't you just <i>feel</i> the whole 'down home, southern cooking' vibe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right? It's just so... southern. I love it!\" she looked back at the menu, \"And <i>look</i> at these prices! Why do they even need discounts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" I had learned long ago not to judge a bakery by it's d\u00e9cor. I mean, \"charming\" southern accents and cute little polka-dots on the walls aside, I hadn't even tasted their food yet. \"It's... cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt seemed really amazed by this place, but I couldn't exactly tell why. I think it was the fact that she was something of a hipster, and this place had just opened. She was probably just looking to get in on the ground floor so she could brag to all her lawyer friends that she had been here before they were, and then recommend it so she could say something like \"I tell <i>all</i> my friends to go there.\" That's what she did with Gerardo's and they... kinda sucked. But even still, she seemed excited. And I was about to get treated to a sweets binge, so who was I to complain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I haven't had a bear claw in years...\" Aunt Rhonda glanced longingly at the menu, \"Should I order one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buy one, get one half-off.\" I pointed at the flyer Savannah had left us, \"Or hey, you could order a dozen for 30% off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think that'd be too... much?\" my aunt crinkled her nose at the thought, \"I mean, for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, it's just a couple bear claws.\" I pshaw'd, dismissing the notion of 'too much' with a wave of my hand, \"You said it yourself, you haven't had one in years. Just order a dozen, get the discount, and take the rest home with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"</span></div></div>",

I ordered a baker's dozen of strawberry cupcakes to start, where each one was about the size of a hand fruit, and two peanut butter cookies as a little appetizer to my appetizer. Aunt Rhonda actually surprised me by ordering her skinny self the dozen bear claws, which she proceeded to scarf down with an admirable eagerness almost immediately after our lose-a-star-on-Yelp level wait time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... oh my <i>god</i> these are good.\" my aunt gushed, creme cheese dotting the corners of her mouth, \"<i>So</i> much better than the bakery on Main street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the bakery on Main Street have wider booths?\" I snarked under my breath, pushing against the edge of the table with my wide wobbly arms, \"Seriously, I'm friggin' squeezed in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already mentioned tightness of the booths at Apple Dumpling's were becoming something of an issue, not even half way into my meal. I had managed to take out five out of thirteen cupcakes, as well as both of my cookies, battling the growing sense of unease that cut deeply into my stomach. The more I ate, the more my stomach pooched out. Which was a concern considering I didn't really have enough breathing room in the first place. It wasn't anything serious, just... a real, extreme discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... oh come on, don't be a sourpuss.\" Aunt Rhonda smacked her lips, \"Don't tell me you, of all people, are going to let a little thing like that come between you and cupcakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just saying they should really let you...\" my face twisted as I continued to push against the table in vain, \"...adjust the seats or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow... you are in there pretty tight.\" Aunt Rhonda finally noticed, taking a glance at the two inches or so of my belly oozing over onto the table, \"Do you want to maybe get all this to go?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, long story short, we got our food to go. My aunt told Savannah about the problem, she gave me this horrified look that practically screamed 'oh god, she's honestly too fat to fit into our booth!', but was super nice about it. Aunt Rhonda got her free Apple Dumpling's t-shirt, our orders topped off for our trouble, and they even threw in an extra t-shirt for me... even if it came nowhere close to fitting. I managed to wriggle my way out of the booth and we hailed a cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first my aunt was kind of disappointed. She had this nice day planned out where we were going to actually go out and do stuff together, which I sort of ruined. I mean, I complained on the walk up, I wasn't exactly receptive to the bakery, and then I got my fat ass stuck in the booth. But after sneaking a few snacks in the back of the cab, a few jokes at my expense, and letting her list off some other places around town where we could visit that were more my scene, she seemed to cheer up enough to be receptive to <i>my</i> idea Auntie-Niece time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does my sister <i>know</i> that you're still mooching off their Netflix account?\" my Aunt Rhonda asked wryly from the other end of her corner couch, \"Or should I bring that up when she inevitably calls me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, the fact that there'd be a wasted account slot on her bill would be more torture than knowing I was having fun for once.\" I snorted, reaching past my huge stomach for another slice of pizza, \"Uff... trust me, she doesn't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during our day, I'd changed out of my big assed highlighter shorts and into something a little more comfortable. I had this pair of boyshorts that still fit me, so I just kept it and the tank-top on, freeing my lower gut from its slight but unbearably tight spandex prison. I took up more than my fair share of the couch, one arm engulfing the armrest while the other drooped lazily over the great slope of my gut. We'd ordered pizza too, after I'd finished off the dozen cupcakes or so from the bakery. At first it was going to be \"for later\" but then I just sort of started eating it. All I got was this look of \"I can't believe you're still hungry\" from my aunt before it was dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt sat on the other end of her giant, L-shaped couch, laying out length-wise with a pillow under her head. On the coffee table, there was an empty personal-sized pizza box that laid in her wake and more than a few napkins. She'd gotten in on the whole lazy day aspect of our day pretty quick, taking the rare opportunity to lay around in jammies in the middle of the day. She'd changed into her new Apple Dumpling's shirt and a pair of breathy, flowy black pajama pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me just say, this was completely new to me at the time. For a lot of my life, I had always just thought of my Aunt Rhonda as a much younger, cooler version of my mom. But still, a version of my mom. The fact that I was laying around with her, eating pizza and sweet stuff, watching Netflix in my PJ's was astounding to me at the time. She was always my cool aunt who bought me these awesome presents and stuff, but the fact that I could be so \"myself\" with her and not have to put on airs like my mom always made us do, or behave myself like when we were at Grandma and Grandpa's was just so... surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, omigod, can't watch...\" Aunt Rhonda squinted her eyes and turned away from the screen, covering her head with the other pillow on her side, \"Gonna go get another bear claw... tell me when it's over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt suddenly sprang to life, rolling off of the couch with the pillow over her head and running into the kitchen, presumably to where she'd left her mostly-gone box of bear claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you baby!\" I hollered, watching the gory horror movie scene and scarfing down pizza like there was no problem. My aunt was a serious wuss if she couldn't handle <i>Zombeavers</i>. \"It's not that bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, yes it is!\" my aunt squealed, the distinctive sound of fried dough slurring her speech, \"She's turning into some...zombie...beaver... thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave the all clear sign that all the nasty stuff was over with not long after, and I rolled my eyes as my aunt tiptoed back into the room. On her way, she dropped the box of bear claws in the trash can, completely empty. She made her way back to her spot on the couch, one last claw in hand, and resumed where she'd left off before her most recent bear claw break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was fast.\" I snickered, big belly jiggling with laughter, \"I thought you were <i>savoring</i> them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? They're good!\" my aunt blushed, \"Seriously, I haven't had those in <i>years</i>, I'm just catching up on lost times... plus, I'm not the one eating pizza <i>after</i> a dozen cupcakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And two cookies.\" I added cheekily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, exercise and tight bakery booths aside, we actually had a pretty good time together. I know it sounds weird, but I really liked hanging out with my aunt. She was fun, even if she was a bit more active than I'd liked to have been. Seriously, between her and Lily, I was having the time of my life in South Carolina. Way better than if I was stuck back home with Mom barking at me to lose weight and not to corrupt my little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I had to say it, that day was probably the day I realized that living with my aunt might not be all that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later...</span></div></div>",

But that girl really knew how to motivate me. I had gone from mindless, indulgent binges to <i>strategically planned</i> mindless, indulgent binges. We'd worked out a system where I pushed myself to my absolute limit at every meal for one day, take a day to rest and let my stomach stretch (which still involved eating, but not nearly as much as the day before) and then repeating the process. It took a while to get used to, but I was really seeing the effects. In just a month, I'd already put on another twenty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go, Mel.\" Lily slapped my fat back, which caused a rippling effect throughout my entire body, \"You'll earn that third chin in no time if you keep this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made me so hot to eat like this. To just give in and stuff myself with everything I could get my hands on.   Just food food and more food, all for me. I had always had a thing for food, but Lily's training really took it into overdrive. I was posessed, no, <i>consumed</i> by my need to eat. My stomach was roaring in agony, begging me to stop, but I had reached a point of no return. I was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why we tended to come to places like buffets. It was just easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Moar</i>...\" I bellowed again, hunched over my nearly-gone breakfast, \"Seriously, I'm so... friggin' hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" Lily said dismissively, patting my back again (she effectively burped me, I let out this window-rattling belch), \"Here, lemme get you another serving. You want more pancakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God yes...\" my voice was thick and husky, \"And sausage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sausage?\" Lily cocked her brown little eyebrow, \"Don't tell me you're slowing down. There's still lots of bacon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo fluffy and cheesy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you at <i>least</i> want some biscuits?\" Lily asked again, tapping on her clipboard with my daily caloric intake on it, \"I mean, there's still lots of--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could help it. The more she listed, the more I stuffed myself. Food just got me so excited. So aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... <i>more</i>.\" I groaned, clutching my stomach, \"I'm so fucking hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily shushed me, and eventually returned with what I'd bargained for. Plenty of everything...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More. More and more and more! Eggs followed sausage followed bacon followed toast dripping with butter. Danishes followed chocolate-stuffed croissants followed biscuits washed down with thick white gravy. lots of breakfast burritos, mounds of homefries, piles of hash-browns, fresh-made waffles, and stack after towering stack of pancakes absolutely drowned in butter and maple syrup avalanched into my overburdened, overstuffed, and overglutted stomach. It wasn\u2019t enough. I was truly mindless. I was swollen to stupid proportions, but I wanted to see how much food I could shovel into my gut in as short a time as possible. I was the perfect combination of horny and hungry. A hunger that knew no satiation, no limit, and seemed to just grow the more I vainly attempted to fill it with mountains and mountains of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting piggishly I crammed handfuls of bacon into my mouth, followed by a good thick chug of milkshake. I was panting heavily now, and slumped back in my screaming chair, my hands desperately clutching the stupidly overglutted sides of my truly gargantuan belly. I drank in my ballooning mass with a fiendish glee, observing lovingly that I had to have gained more than 20 pounds. My belly was just incredible, a massive mountain of blubber, and jam-packed with equally massive mountains of delicious grub. My poor overburdened stomach churned and burbled sluggishly, obviously struggling with this massive overstuffing, but if I had any say, thhis would just be the beginning of today\u2019s festivities. Giving its bubbling mass some happy pats, I turned back to eating, only to be met with a massive sandwich, full of pastrami, salami, sausages, and all the fattiest most succulunt meats. It was one of those mass-produced hero varieties that catering companies make by the yard. Looking at Lily confusedly, a great burbling belch erupted from the overglutted vat of my gut, setting all my fat a-wobble: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*HicuuuUUURRRP What\u2019s this? Lunch? Already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Mel, you\u2019ve been at it for 3 hours already, they\u2019re setting the lunch trays out. Figured I\u2019d start you off with this. You\u2019re not full, are you?\u201d Lily cocked an eyebrow, as her pencil whirred purposefully over the clipboard, busily and methodically recording everything I\u2019d have eaten so far. 3 hours? It felt like nothing at all! Of course, I knew I was obscenely stuffed, all I had to do was listen to my massive gut slosh beneath me. But UGHH, just the sound of the frantic scribbling, and what it meant fired up the twin engines of horny and hungry right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreedily grinning, I gave my belly some purposeful pats: \u201cHIC. Me? Full? Look at this gut! More please! HIC. Heck, Lil, ask management if they can...HIC...just wheel the whole sandwich over here.\u201d I started salivating at the thought, but my stomach gave a superswollen burble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lily stopped for an moment: \u201cYou sure, Mel? It\u2019s pretty huge. You sure you\u2019ll be able to handle it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy belly can handle anything...HIC\u201d I snorted derisively. \u201cCome ON Lily, I\u2019m UUURRHHUNGRY DAMMIT!!\u201d I roared and lunged at the piece of sandwich right there. She sighed, and wheeled to do my bidding. Groaning in pleasure, I crammed mouthful after mouthful of rich food down my throat. One bite, two bites, three. Chew Chew Chew. Swallow. Repeat. I was so single-mindedly focused on eating that I took anything that was in front of me. I didn\u2019t bother looking at Lily when she wheeled the whole sandwich up to me. I didn\u2019t care when she carried a plate piled high with thick sliders. or platters of hot dogs. More more more!! I heard my stomach groan and bubble with vast strain, and I swore I could see my gut swelling and stretching right before my eyes, though I\u2019m sure that was just the food-coma I was rapidly falling into. So much food, so much eating, so much fat; All I had to do was glut and glut again, filling, double filling, and triple overfilling my exploding stomach with as much food as I could possibly shove down my throat. Food flooded into my mammoth stomach at truly unprecedented rates, and my gut rapidly began expanding across the floor and churning in futile digestion that I ignored completely in my blissful feasting. More, MORE and MORE food avalanched into my overburdened body, and the more I ate, the more aroused I became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was consumed (hehe) with a desire to become MASSIVE, and I knew every crammed mouthful was one step closer to getting me there. I belched richly, and continued my paradise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only that, she managed to hail a cab on Saturday night, pay the man to get me across town, <i>convince him to stop at a drive-thru for burgers</i>, helped me into the elevator of my Aunt's apartment building, and steer my semi-conscious body through the front door. I mean, I wasn't exactly dead-weight at the time, but have you ever been around someone who's food drunk? It's <i>very</i> hard to make them do much of anything. Much less wait until they're <i>home</i> to take off their pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wouldn't wake up until hours later, and I do mean <i>hours</i> later. My memory from the night before was fuzzy at best, I distinctly remembered it being before midnight before I eventually succumbed to my food coma, and it was one 'o' clock in the afternoon when I finally woke up. And I was still stuffed. My stomach was still all full and sloshy, but it had very much lost its firmness from last night. There was some room in there, but after nights like these I honestly didn't feel like eating right away. As crazy as I could get, I had my limits. And I just made some new ones last night. It would take a while for me to even be able to <i>think</i> about food again without puking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid there for a minute before I decided that I needed to get up. I struggled to come to my feet, my knees knocking and my pathetic calves quivering in their attempt to support the massiveness of my self. The extra weight I had put on in the month I'd been squatting with Aunt Rhonda had done little to aid my mobility. And since my muscles felt like wet noodles right about now, my pace was even more slow and pronouncedly awkward than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI came out of my bedroom barely dressed, my enormous stomach making a half-shirt out of a respectively stylish Hillary Heart tee, and wearing an old pair of boxers that I'd bought for comfort once upon a time, but now squeezed the crap out of my fat legs. I remember my stomach being really itchy, but being unable to really get the good part because of how big my belly was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mel!\" I heard Lily's voice suddenly, and it freaked me the fuck out. I would have jumped right out of my skin if there hadn't been so much of me to weigh me down, \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ!\" I yelped, stopping my stomach from wobbling as best as I could, \"Don't--URRRAAAP... don't scare me like that, Lily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" Lily fanned her hand in front of her face, \"Oh wow, that... that was just awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you even doing here, Lil?\" I asked, coming down from my shock, \"What happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily had apparently borrowed a couple of clothes from Aunt Rhonda. They were hilariously too tall for her. Seriously, the legs on the black pajama pants she'd borrowed were clothespinned so she couldn't walk on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crashed, I told your Aunt you got super drunk, and she said I should stay the night to make sure you were okay in the morning.\" Lily said with a smile, her dark red hair still tussled into a messy bedhead, \"You weren't kidding, your aunt is the <i>coolest</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do my best.\" another voice came and startled me, this time the familiar surly purring of my Aunt Rhonda, and from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FU--uurRRRP!!\" I jump-burped again, that last one actually managing to hurt a little, \"Aunt Rhonda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt didn't look exactly active either. Despite being dressed more size appropriately than my itty-bitty friend, she looked to have probably spent just as long in bed as I had. Her cute little bob was all messy, and she didn't have on any makeup. She was holding a bavarian creme donut like a handfruit, and taking casual bites out of it while I freaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coolesht aunt ever.\" she said through a mouth full of creme before swallowing, \"Mm... like the sound of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... please, no donuts.\" my stomach gurgled in disgust, and I'm pretty sure that I turned green around the gills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on Mel, donuts are the <i>best</i> hangover food.\" my Aunt took another bite and paused, \"Maybe not the creme filled kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily and I still hadn't told my aunt about my fetish. It wasn't that I didn't trust her, it was just... I didn't really feel like explaining everything, okay? Like how much I was eating, or why I was coming home almost every other night in a stupor <i>or</i> why I was going through clothes so quickly. She had been really nice to me, and hadn't said a word about me getting a job or paying rent, so I figured that I should at least try to not look like I was stuffing my face on her dime. I mean, it kind of looked like I was partying on her dime, which was probably worse in the long run... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt sauntered over into the kitchen and made herself a cup of coffee, grabbing another donut after she popped the last of hers into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your friends are welcome to crash at my place any time.\" my aunt said with a smile at Lily's direction, \"I especially like this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Aunt Rhonda.\" I burped weakly, \"I'll try not to... uh, party too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she went back into her room, leaving Lily and I to our own devices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you told her I got <i>drunk</i>?\" I whisper-moaned, \"She's gonna think I'm drinking my life away! Seriously, couldn't you come up with a better lie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... came home stupid, hungry, gassy, took off your pants... sounds drunk to me.\" Lily gave this sassy little face, \"Seriously, why can't we just tell her what you're doing? I'm cool with it. She'll probably be cool with it too. I mean, she's cool with you drinking, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <i>way</i> different!\" I rasped, plopping down on the couch, \"It's... it's complicated, okay? Just... at least <i>try</i> to make me sound like a halfway decent person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll tell her you took too much communion at church.\" Lily rolled her eyes, steal a donut from the nearly empty box, \"For real though, I've got some good news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>better</i> not be that there's donuts in that box.\" I burped into my hand, \"I'm still nauseous from yesterday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Better</i>.\" Lily said, this diabolical little grin on her face...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So the best way to explain why Lily and I saw each other so much, beyond her being my weight gain coach, was that we lived pretty close to one another. My Aunt Rhonda lived in a ritzy apartment building, and Lily lived in a not-so-ritzy apartment building just a little bit down the road. Of course, it was always <i>her</i> who came to visit <i>me</i>; as me burning that many calories on a brisk waddle that long would severely violate the terms of our contract and make Lily an <i>awful</i> weight gain coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut be that as it may I found myself lumbering stupidly down the road towards Lily's apartment for the first time in forever, on a full stomach no less, as Lily led me by the nose. I was miserable for every quaking step, my rounded stomach slapping heavily against my thick meaty thighs. I broke a sweat just wriggling my way through my Aunt Rhonda's door, and every footfall after that was just overkill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots and <i>lots</i> of overkill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lil...\" I puffed weakly, \"Lily... please... wait up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Mel, you can't be <i>that</i> out of shape!\" the spritely little redhead bounced around the halfway point, her hands on her narrow hips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I weigh... four hundred pounds... dammit!\" I wheezed, coming to a pathetic stop right there in the middle of the sidewalk, arching my back and sticking out my belly as I stretched pitiably, \"You've gotta... give me... a little more time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd probably just be faster to roll you there, fatty.\" Lily poked my stomach as I stretched it out (again, I almost threw up on her) \"Jeez you're puttin' on weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha...\" I smirked, rubbing the spot where she'd poked, \"I wonder <i>who</i> could be the cause of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably some bomb-ass redhead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we made it to her apartment. And <i>wow</i> was it a dump. Seriously, no wonder she never turned down Aunt Rhonda paying for meals. Cheesy lawn furniture everywhere, laundry out on the lines, lots of people standing outside at eleven 'o' clock in the morning with no dayjob, and worst of all <i>no. elevator</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost had a heart attack right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich Lily seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, calm down Mel. I live on the bottom floor.\" Lily rolled her eyes, \"Seriously, I don't think Charlotte would have agreed to move in with me if I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily had told me an hour and a long long walk ago that her sister, Charlotte (the fat one, remember?) had moved in with her sometime last week. Which was totally cool, of course. I was always down for meeting someone new (I'd been in SC for, what, a month? And Lily was my only friend to show for it!), even if I had to walk to meet her. It didn't exactly beat laying around in my undies all day stuffing Oreo's in my mouth, but it was something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that.\" I puffed from behind her, \"Why did you sister agree to move in with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about her funding falling out at the school she <i>wanted</i> to go to.\" Lily said dismissively as she fiddled with her keys, \"So she was going to go to school in Columbia when I'm all, hey, move in with me because it'll be cheaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But really...?\" I led on, twirling my fat finger expectantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But really, I figured you could probably use her help. Seriously, twenty pounds in a month? You must be slacking off.\" Lily slapped my belly fat as it pressed deep against her back, \"Charlotte knows <i>all</i> about this stuff. If you do as she says, we'll need a crane to get you out of you aunt's place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, a familiar tingle tickling beneath my folds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, you know, she's my sister and I might have missed her a little.\" Lily twisted the doorknob, \"So play nice.\"</span></div></div>",

She had this huge, fleshy stomach that was so big and heavy it slapped against her thighs. Her tits were <i>enormous</i>, bigger than the girl's own head by a long-shot, and her ass was so big and fat it may have even put <i>mine</i> to shame.

Seriously, if you ever want to get on my good side it's not hard: just hold out a box of Twinkies and I'm yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no, the fact I had made myself sick the night before didn't stop me. My belly made room when I saw how much food there was in the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was soon clear that Lily wasn't hurting for money, appearance of her apartment building notwithstanding. While she didn't have much pride in where she lived, she did invest a lot in being a good hostess. Her kitchen was stuffed with food, the pantries and fridge almost threatening to explode and pour out boxes and bags of edibles like cornucopias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't Charlotte who had bought them. I got that as soon as the bigger sister opened a cabinet and rooted around, saying half-jokingly and half-frustrated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, Lily. What do you have that isn't loaded with sugar or salt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's some granola bars in there,\u201d the skinny girl said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, double-chocolate and peanut butter.

I just reached up and grabbed whatever my fat arms could hold \u2013 bags of minidoughnuts, a bag of pepperoni Combos, a thing of lemon cr\u00e8me cookies, and a bag of coconut flavored marshmallows \u2013 and followed Charlotte to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest girl had claimed the sofa for herself, practically filling the whole thing, so I went to a bowl chair that looked like it was made of metal, so it should be able to hold me, right? I settled in as slowly as I could and listened for any ominous creaking. Lily took an open chair and for the next twenty minutes carried most of the conversation, serving as an intermediary between us two binging fatties and telling us each about the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Charlotte was finished with her food (I was taking my time, not wanting to push myself so soon after recovering from last night's ordeal) Lily sprang to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant some more? I've got some of those marshmallow rounds you love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte groaned playfully, then waved a hand to say 'Bring 'em on.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you two could probably use some drinks. I'll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Lily was out of the room Charlotte turned to me and, her voice growing somber, asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how much of that,\u201d she indicated my clothes-straining corpulence, \u201cis because of my sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy pride as a self-built fatty caused me to reply immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a lot. Just twenty pounds or so. I was fat when I moved here.\u201d And I slapped my belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder she made friends with you so fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe seems to enjoy being around fatties,\u201d I said, staying as neutral as possible. I'd seen how much Lily had gotten into helping me stuff my fat face and pile on the pounds, but the possibility there was something more driving her on was a question I'd been trying to not read into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte fought back a laugh, lowering her voice a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's one way of putting it. Another is that she enjoys helping people get fatter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't say anything. She clearly had more she wanted to say, and I wanted to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople in our family aren't naturally fat. Look at Lily; both our parents and cousins and uncles and aunts look like her. But since she was young she's enjoyed working in the kitchen, cooking or baking, and when she had food made she was insistent that people eat it. I ended up getting most of it, since I was the big sister, but as time went on Lily became more serious about making food or, when she had allowance money, buying it and giving it to people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur mom just says it's a maternal streak to her, wanting to make people happy by giving them food, but as she's gotten older I think it's not so innocent. I think she outright loves to see people eat, she craves it. And she loves the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d she sat back a bit to emphasize how wide and fat her body was. \u201cYou don't get to 650 pounds by accident. For me, it came from living with Lily until she was an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was reluctant as hell to go back to living with her, but the cost of keeping myself clothed and fed, not being able to walk everywhere so I have to drive, it piled up. I didn't have much choice, but Lily swore she wasn't going to force food on me. She didn't say why, but seeing you now I get it. She has a new project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas she been offering you food a lot? Bringing snacks when you get together, or suggesting you get dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the kitchen we could hear the sound of a blender. Charlotte looked over in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaking milkshakes. Of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to me, and I decided to be open. I wasn't sure Charlotte would get it, but I didn't feel she would be disgusted or judgmental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe doesn't have to offer me food. I love to eat, and honestly, I love being fat. She's actually helping me get fatter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte took a moment to process that.</span></div></div>",

Which, granted, I didn't really have too much of a problem with at the time. It was only during the cooling down sessions of my mindless binges that I really started to have second thoughts. Mainly, that I could even contain all the food that Lily was pumping me full of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was on one of my \"on\" days that Lily and I headed out on the town, looking for a new location for me to stuff myself at. I had just gotten kicked out of the little buffet that I'd been eating at pretty regularly for the past month now after my little all-day binge the other night, and wasn't allowed to come back. Which made all this the more exciting. I had never eaten so much that I'd been kicked out of a restaurant before, and Lily had been teasing me all day with promises of new buffets in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily...\" I moaned, big belly wobbling uncontrollably in front of me as I struggled to keep up with my itty-bitty trainer, \"Wait <i>up</i> for Christ's sake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was enormous. The biggest I had ever been in my life until that point. I was nearing four hundred and thirty pounds, and Lily had more than lived up to her promise of helping me gain weight. I couldn't fit into any of my clothes. I was wearing an old tank-top and some sweatpants that may as well have been cotton leggings. As I lumbered down the street, Lily make sure to stay extra-far ahead of me so I didn't run her over with my fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mel, just a little further!\" she called out to me, urging my fat ass forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little further. Further to food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so hungry. I hadn't eaten anything all day. My sleep schedule had taken this really wonky route where I'd stay up until the wee hours of the morning binging and sleep until noon, only to wake up groggy and sloshy. At first, it was really difficult to put myself on such a strenuous schedule, but Lily managed to guide me through it. Seriously, she knew a <i>lot</i> about making me into a colossal fatass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd... damn... your scrawny... ass...\" I huffed, soaked in sweat as I finally caught up to my tormenter, \"Seriously... you made me walk <i>three</i> blocks for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be all worth it, I promise.\" Lily rubbed the upper crest of my belly proudly, \"Today's gonna be another glorious day for your belly, Melly. Seriously, I've been looking around, and this is <i>the</i> place to get your grub on. Huge portions, big booths, friendly atmosphere, no small children allowed, it's great..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily led me inside my newest grub hub, the Doornail...</span></div></div>",

I mean, don't get me wrong, I <i>loved</i> to get called out on how fat I was by people well-suited to gauge how much was <i>too</i> much, but it made it easier to know that I could get away with some shameless fat-girlery.

I ripped it right out of her hands and practically pressed my nose against it. It had pictures of everything I'd be stuffing myself with today. More meat that I knew what to do with, so many starches I could grow a potato farm with them, more cheese than could possibly be contained by one cow! Oh <i>God</i> I was <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">horny</span>hungry! I couldn't wait another minute! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can't you... like... order an appetizer or something?\" I whined, \"Seriously, I'm starving over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ordered some mozzerella sticks, calm down piggy.\" God I loved it when she called me that, \"They should be here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not soon enough!\" I griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I know that we were being watched. Well, not so much watched, as much as we were being scoped out.

Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... um... what?\" I asked, my mind not exactly sharp enough at the moment to really get into our banter, \"Oh, right. Fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fuck's right!\" the Beta bitch added, \"Y'see Lindsey, Ah toldja she wasn't blind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddammit.\" Lily pinched the bridge of her nose, \"Okay, yeah, you caught us. We lied. Mel's just too fat for her own good. Sorry we knocked over your tabled <i>a month ago</i>. Won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that!

Her fingernail stung like hell. \"Disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrmm...\" I grunted deeply, \"Yeah, I'm a pretty big chick, you skinny...skinny little...little...<i>mmm</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Big</i> is such an understatement, wide load!\" Lindsey continued to push my buttons, she palmed a roll of my fat and shook it, causing me to seize and shiver, \"This is the biggest jelly roll I've ever <i>seen!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, freak, we're just trying to eat.\" Lily said with a disgusted face, \"Stop molesting my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Lindsey added with mock amusement, \"You lookin' to put on another forty pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" I added thickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'll bet yer here for that 'Murica whatever.\" Steph added sharply, \"Right? Tell me Ah'm right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god she <i>so</i> is!\" Lindsey laughed like it was the funniest thing she'd ever heard in her life, \"This fatass is gonna try to outfatass everyone in this whole damn bar! Not that that's saying much, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know if it was the fact that I was already charged up from what I was ordering, the fact that I'd been so strung out from eating so much lately, or the fact that I was just a natural attention hog. But this girl was making me hot. All her insults and how amazed she was by how fucking huge I was, it made me squirm in my seat. I clenched my fat thighs together as my crotch got wetter and wetter at every passing remark. Lily must have been confused as to why I wasn't defending myself, but the truth was, I was too horny to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, fatass...\" Lindsey began...</span></div></div>",

Barbecue sauce dripped out of the edges, running off the bacon strips like dew on a morning leaf. Then there were the hot-dogs. Two foot-longers drowned in chili, mustard and onions, with more fries than I should have known what to do with. The third course was fried chicken, and it was probably enough for the whole chicken. It came with slaw and ranch and macaroni and... <i>mmm</i>. The fourth course was pulled pork barbecue, with my choice of honey or mustard barbecue, to which I chose <i>both</i> in abundance. And the last dish, the last little bit, was an apple pie a la mode. The whole pie. A whole carton of ice cream, brought out when you were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get it now, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in heaven.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With massive bites and insane eagerness to glut my greedy gut, I lunged forward and tore into the burger with a ferocity that even surprised Lily, and I think caught Lindsey off guard, as she stopped and stared for a few seconds before beginning her own meal. Bite after bite, massive swallow after massive swallow, this is what I lived for, and I was in the perfect zone of hungry and horny. Grunting piggishly, I nearly choked half a dozen times on my own glut, so desperately was I packing food into my mouth. Needless to say, the burger disappeared in record time, and the hotdogs similarly vanished, as well as the fries, which I crammed down my throat with two hands, by the fist-full. Only briefly pausing, I grabbed my 32oz glass of cola and chugged it down in massive greedy gulps, ending with a thunderous belch. Grease ran down my chin, my face was a mess, and I\u2019m sure I had more than a little crazed glint in my eye, but I didn\u2019t care. Lindsey didn\u2019t matter, Lily didn\u2019t matter, nothing mattered but my greedy stomach. I ate faster and with more ebullience than I think I ever did at that point, and had utterly demolished the entire meal except dessert until I vaguely came back to my senses and looked across the table to how my competitor was faring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was not in a good place. It was obvious at a glance that she had entered this \u2018contest,\u2019 out of pride, not skill. I hesitate to even call it a contest. It was a massacre. She had barely finished choking down her burger, and was slumped back in her chair, shorts unbuttoned, sweating profusely, and tears of pain squeezing from the corner of her eyes. Her friend Becky just stared at me in open-mouthed shock. I chuckled to myself and decided to make the victory even more complete and humiliating \u201cMmmm what a meal!...URRRP\u2026Hey twig, you gonna finish that? I\u2019m still feelin\u2019 puckish.\u201d Lindsey lolled her head my way and joined Becky in staring at me. After a few seconds she dumbly nodded and pushed her platters my way. I thanked her with a belch and nearly deep-throated the first hot dog of my erstwhile competitor in my eagerness. I knew I had won not only this contest, but also the meal challenge, but the depths of my gluttony-crazed had concocted a new plan, and a new hall of fame all for myself. I would finish TWO Murrican meal things as fast as I could. My stomach began to complain with this avalanche of food, but as usual, I ignored its pleas. Grunting happily to myself, I bulldozed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily later told me that most of the other diners had stopped eating, their own meals long forgotten, and were watching with varying degrees of morbid interest how much I could glut into my incredible gut. Of course, I was also putting on a bit of a show, belching, hiccupping and moaning with pleasure, but hey I can\u2019t help myself around fod. Oh boy did I eat, I outdid even MY expectations of my greed. Continuous glutting. Continuous massive bulging mouthfuls and heavy swallows. As more and more and more piles of downhome American delicacies slammed into my gut, it began to bloat and swell further and further, taking on an even more stupendously heavy appearance. My tank-top slowly began rolling up, and the seams on the side started to creak ominously, but I could barely hear this over the sluggish burbling and churning that began to emanate from the gigantic vat of bubbling gorge that was my gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, FINALLY, at just over 90 minutes, I had finished the last crust of my second pie. I had done it. I had finished MY version of the challenge. Gasping for air like I just ran a marathon, I contentedly slumped back in my chair, hands draped helplessly across the explosive swell of her mammoth belly. I unabashedly hiccupped richly and dazedly looked up at Lily, Becky, the comatose Lindsey, and my server, who was coming to congratulate me on my accomplishment. Despite my impossible feat, and my viciously churning gut, I could only think of one thing to say, licking my lips greedily: \u201cHIICCCC\u2026More please!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I was about to get beat. Hard. This Lindsey bitch, I don\u2019t know where she came from, but she could <i>eat</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was surprising, you know, because she looked like she just waltzed right out of a Hollister catalogue. I had no idea, Lily had no idea, and the people gathering slowly gathering around us had no idea that this skinny little blonde bitch could match me bite for bite at every course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burger? While I was busy choking down bacon and drowning in barbecue sauce, Lindsey was scarfing down the sides like there was nothing to it. The chili dogs? This girl practically deep-throated those things, the corners of her mouth covered in chili <i>which she then promptly had time to lick off and still stay in the time limit</i>. The fucking chicken? Gone! Just\u2026 just gone! I had no idea what was going on\u2014I did what I could just to keep eating, I had to stop myself from looking over at every nonchalant little burp or grumble that she let out just to stay within the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, it came. The final course, after the pulled pork barbecue, was a simple little slice of apple pie a la mode. Just a little, tiny, itty-bitty piece of pie with a little dollop of ice cream on top. Surely nothing I couldn\u2019t handle, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026Lily\u2026\u201d I burbled, my voice thick and heavy, \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 can\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Mel, just a little more!\u201d Lily urged me stoically, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little slice of pie. You <i>love</i> pie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wheezing. My belly was so full I couldn\u2019t think straight. It had rounded out so much that it was just this big bubble of swollen pink meat, my various rolls and folds smoothed out along the crest of my gut as the food took up more and more space. I was tired. I was sweating. I had never felt so full in my life. At least when Lily and I binged at buffets, I could take my time. But now that I was forced to speed-eat, I was beginning to feel the effects of all that food I was sucking down. And it didn\u2019t feel very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn yer mark\u2026\u201d Becky said with a smile, \u201cGet set\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey just picked up the whole piece of pie, ice cream and all, and stuck it in her stupid skinny mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the crowd went wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d she cried out, jabbing me in the doughy upper arm with one of her manicured talons, \u201cPay up chubs! Sixty bucks, in my purse, asap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was munching down on pie, slowly and stupidly. I was just so tired. My jaw hurt. My <i>belly</i> hurt. And, most importantly, my pride hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was an eating machine! How could I have lost to this scrawny little\u2026little\u2026twig?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paid up, and Lindsey rose to see herself out. She had this huge, pregnant-looking gut. It was rock-hard and pink along the crest. It rode up underneath her halter top, and at some point she\u2019d undone the button on her dukes to let that big round thing have some breathing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know she didn\u2019t even pose for her picture? Bitch just waddled out, letting out a big triumphant burp before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStupid skinny bitch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least you finished within the time limit.\u201d Lily consoled me, giving me a nice relaxing belly rub back at my Aunt\u2019s place, \u201cYou <i>could</i> have been out another sixty bucks if you hadn\u2019t remembered to eat the ice cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was miserable. I felt awful. I had this awful, pounding headache that resonated deep within my gut. Thankfully, Aunt Rhonda was going out with her friends from the office, so I had the apartment to myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not abou\u2014URRRRRP\u2014\u201c an enormous, hot burp escaped me and rattled the windows of the living room, \u201cthe money\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think so.\u201d Lily said with a knowing little smile, \u201cSo, you gonna ask for a rematch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, are you kidding me?\u201d I gasped\u2026</span></div></div>",

After all, it was <i>my</i> thing. I was the one who wanted to join in the first place, even if Lily was the one who showed it to me, and I was the one going through training like hell to do it. Eating just wasn\u2019t fun anymore\u2014Lily and I had started treating my eating like it was a job. And the whole reason I wanted to win that money was so that I wouldn\u2019t <i>have</i> to get a job. So when I realized that it had stopped being fun, we stopped. Our lives went back to normal soon enough, and we were just back to being friends. No longer \u201ceater\u201d and \u201ccoach\u201d, we actually had a lot more fun. We still ate out all the time, and I was still fat as holy shit, but me eating wasn\u2019t <i>all</i> we did\u2026 does that make sense?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so life went on as normal. I loafed around my Aunt\u2019s place while she went to work and went out partying, Lily eventually got back into school, and all was well in the world of Mel. I\u2019ll admit that without the constant pressure to keep eating had tapered off my gaining. Whereas before I could put on twenty pounds in a few weeks, I was noticing that my weight gain had plateaued somewhat. Spending my nights binging on takeout and mooching off my aunt had certainly served to fatten me up further, but after living with my aunt for a few months, I had only worked my way up to 460 pounds; a good sixty pound gain from where I started, yeah, but not quite enough for my tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was out on the town enjoying my no-college fat girl lunch at the Big Burger when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then three times in quick succession, my jaw falling slack. \"Uh...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>said</i>,\" Lindsey's rounder face got even more red, no doubt a mixture from how tired she was from making her way over in a hurry and from the clear embarrassment she felt. \"I said I'm sorry, okay? I'm just...!\" she looked like she was about to go on a tirade from the way she raised her pudgy pointer finger, followed by the way she opened and closed her mouth in quick succession like she was fishing for the right words to hurl at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shifted my bulk ever so slightly in the booth, excavating my gut from being confined by the table as I turned to give her my full attention. Normally, I'd not even bother with a sideways glance and just continue eating my lunch, but I was curious, and really wanted to hear what she had to say. Last thing I was expecting from her was to suddenly deflate her angry tirade and then <i>apologize</i>. Her, Lindsey, the snooty skinny (well, <i>formerly</i> skinny, I corrected in my thoughts) bitch who had beaten me at eating, who had been nothing short of unpleasant to me about my size, who had wounded my pride, <i>apologized</i>. To say I was surprised would be putting it very mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey closed her mouth again, this time keeping it shut as she trembled with emotion, I guess, her new flab jiggling along as that belly of hers wobbled in all its prominence. Then, I swear, she surprised me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face just...<i>broke</i>. As in she suddenly lost all composure, and just burst with emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just so sorry, okay?! I get it now... I fucking get it now! I get what being fat is like,\" she bit her lip at the legendary eff word and looked like she was ready to cry. \"I understand how people look and treat you! So just...!\" she bowed her head low, which only made that extra chin swell out further. \"Please don't make this any harder than it has to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me snap out of the numbing shock and now I stared at her with a frown. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" she shot her hands up defensively. \"It's just...aren't you mad at me? Aren't you going to rub it in my face and be all, 'HAH, how do you like it bitch!' to me?\" her eyes took on a downcast look. \"I mean, I totally deserve it, but, y'know, why aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply stared at her. This had to be a joke by some cosmic deity or a dream. It just had to be. No way this was the same snooty hipster chick who just at the beginning of Summer had made it clear she saw me as an enemy, had practically molested me (and aroused me to no end, I'll admit), had stepped on my pride, and had bloated to two-hundred plus pounds in the span of a month. It simply couldn't be, and not just because she was suddenly fat. She had just degraded herself in that sentence, saying she deserved to be chewed over. Which she kinda does, but for her to say it, to openly kick herself, just...<i>damn</i>. She's really not the same anymore, is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I...\" I started, but quickly lost my train of thought. I was still reeling from surprise. \"No harm done, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done?!\" she shrieked in abject shock, and I immediately looked all around us sheepishly as other Big Burger patrons started to look our way. Granted, people were already staring from when Lindsey angrily waddled over to my booth, but upon hearing her incredulous shout, now I was worried the manager might come out and kick us out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pipe down!\" I hissed through my teeth. \"Folks are staring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my ever-growing shock, she clamped her mouth shut as her hands flew to her mouth, looking like a kicked puppy. God, I can't really take this, she's so humble now, so...<i>different</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" she whimpered, shrinking onto herself like I was about to curse bloody murder at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI released an exasperated sigh, bringing a hand to massage my temple. \"It's fine,\" I gestured with my pillowy arm at the opposite side of the booth. \"Why don't you take a seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" her eyes went wide. \"Is it cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, I think I need a fucking beer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's cool. Now sit down,\" I paused, and then quickly added, \"please\" to the end of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did so, and I couldn't help but sigh again. \"Anyway, yeah, no harm done, so don't beat yourself up over it,\" I said, grunting as I shifted back into the booth so I was facing her, my belly going back to its previous position of consuming a good bit of my side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I was...so mean to you and your friend! Mostly you...\" she said quietly. \"I attacked your body, tried to make you feel shitty about yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI released a loud snort at that. \"I wouldn't call what you did as 'attacking'. And believe me, harsher bitches have tried, and failed spectacularly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean your size doesn't bother you?!\" she stared at me in shock. And <i>awe</i>. Something lit up in my belly at that last one, something that just made me puff out my chest proudly, which made my belly lurch further outwards on the table. I realized it was good ol' fatty pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really figuring that out now?\" I laughed, patting my belly proudly while thoroughly enjoying her awestruck expression. \"What, did you think I'm just a girl who eats too much for her own good and forgets to exercise? I mean, the first part's true, I <i>love </i>food, but my size?\" here I stopped patting my gut, instead opting to grip it with my two fluffy hands and jiggle it. \"My girth? I just love feeling heavy. I'm one of those kind of girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was silent, her fat face set on this expression that was a mixture of awe and curiosity. \"So, you eat and grow because...you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but grin. \"No, I don't like it, I <i>love </i>it! It practically defines me!\" I didn't think I could swell with pride any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why weren't you at the County Fair?\" she asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight simple words and just like that, my good mood soured. Bad enough she brought it up, but from how she worded it, that meant she took part in the Fair after all. Fate just seemed to have it out for me lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey shifted in her booth, eyes staring at me with remorse. \"Did I...have to do with that? Is it because of me you didn't go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it. Good <i>Christ</i>, why did she have to hit that sore spot? More importantly, why did she hit that sore spot when she's <i>changed </i>now? Ergo, I can't bring myself to be mad at her! I mean I still kind of am, but now...shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I?\" she pressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't say anything, in which I cursed myself for forgetting that silence is not always golden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" she moaned, bringing her hands to her head as she slumped forward. \"I'm such a terrible person, I'm so sorr--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, stop!\" I snapped, making her flinch but I wasn't in the mood to care. \"I get that you're sorry, but it isn't about that, okay? It's about...you wouldn't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try to...\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes at that. \"Okay then, seeing as suddenly you seem to know what empathy is,\" I looked her dead in the eye. \"Then listen, all my life ever since I fell in love with the feeling of my own blubber, I've wanted to just get more. Enough is never enough, I just want <i>more</i>. I pride myself on making a total pig outta myself, I take immense satisfaction in attracting both good and bad attention due to my weight, and I enjoy living to the image society puts on me thanks to my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned forward, which made her lean backwards as she felt for the first time the depths of my determination and passion. That, and my belly spread even further on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A literal human garbage disposal unit,\" I clarified. \"Such as one at a certain County Fair, for example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped. \"You mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" I replied with a bitter laugh as I leaned back, ignoring my booth's creaking. \"Then along comes this alpha bitch, like an alpha straight out of the movies like Mean Girls n shit, who happens to be a blonde like me, haha!\" I ignore the way she flinches. \"But nothing major, right? She's just a skinny little thing, and yet somehow--<i>somehow</i>--she manages to out-eat the likes of me! Can you believe that?! So no sense in me trying anymore for the Fair when some twiggy little twat beat me <i>hard</i>. So if a one-twenty pound skinny could topple a four-hundred pound heifer, then what exactly is the point of going to an eat-out at the Fair, right? What is the point?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was breathing heavily after that long-winded rant. She was just staring at me, her eyes misting over. I sigh as I chuckle bitterly. In the end, I don't feel any ill will towards her. Bitterness, maybe. Some sense of pride that she's showing signs of coming out as a fatty, probably but I wouldn't go that far. But something negative like anger? Hate? Not at all. If I had any, they all died out when she said she was sorry, and showed me how much she meant it by being so damn humble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, I coulda been a contender, am I right?\" I smile lamely at my dorky phrase. \"Sorry about that, by the way. I was venting out, I called you names, but I don't hate you or anything,\" I looked down at my stomach in contemplation. \"I guess... I just couldn't believe I got beat, and by a skinny girl at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not so skinny anymore,\" Lindsey chuckled quietly. \"But listen, about all of that, down to what happened at the dive bar, I...I have a confession to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised an eyebrow. Just when I thought she couldn't surprise me anymore. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quiet for a moment, but then she gained courage, looked me in the eye, and let it out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Mel, did you eat the donuts in the fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll admit, it was a good question. One that wasn't <i>too</i> far off from the vicinity of logic. Did I eat donuts? Yes. Did I eat out of the fridge, sometimes? Yes. <i>Would</i> I eat donuts, had they been in the fridge? Probably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I hadn't... Really, it wasn't me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" I told my Aunt Rhonda so, \"I didn't even <i>know</i> there were donuts in the fridge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, don't lie to me!\" my Aunt had this real 'Mom' tone that must have run in our family or something, but for some reason I didn't hate it as much when she did it, \"I bought donuts to take with me to the office, they're not here, and you <i>have</i> been known to eat things without asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was only like, six times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting in the couch, as per ushe, and couldn't have looked any less guilty if I wanted to. I had put on another thirty or so pounds in the past few weeks alone, putting me at dangerously close to the big four-five-zero. I officially didn't have a shirt big enough to cover my belly anymore, so I just sort of let it flop out on my lap in a half-dressed nakedness that only <i>I</i> seemed to truly enjoy. My arms were bigger, my ass was wider, even my face was chubbier than ever. I had my long blonde hair tied up in a pony, to keep it off my neck while I watched Netflix in a hoggish bliss as I choked down my Lucky Charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel...\" my Aunt Rhonda led<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm eatin freakin' Lucky Charms, right here!\" I rose the bowl up, sloshing some onto the curvature of my big fat thigh, \"What do you want me to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if <i>you</i> didn't take them...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt Rhonda came into the room, practically popping out of her panties. She <i>really</i> needed to get a few sizes up, but she hadn't done much shopping since I'd got here. I could see the curve of her cute little pot-belly as it rubbed against her t-shirt, and her HOLY CRAP HER ASS WAS HUGE...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Tapdancing Christ, how did I not notice that... those CHEEKS! Holy shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Who</i> did?\" she purred demandingly, putting her hands on her hips and pushing out her hip expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy immediate response was to say 'probably you' but that seemed in poor taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since I moved in with my Aunt, I'd basically been eating non-stop. And she pretty much tended to hang out with me whenever she wasn't working, which meant she was surrounded by as much food as I was, almost as often as I was. I guess it was only expected that she start to... fill out a little? I felt kinda bad about the whole thing, considering <i>I</i> was the one who helped flip her eating switch to 'ON'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Auntie, but it really wasn't me.\" I said innocently, trying not to stare at my Aunt Rhonda's badonkadonk as it oozed out of her panties, \"Honest. I haven't been <i>awake</i> long enough to eat your donuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to appease her, since she immediately lightened up. Her arms fell back to her sides and her head rolled back in anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUGH. Fine. Point taken.\" she said with a moan, opening up a kitchen cabinet to grab a bagel, \"Wonder what happened to them, then? I paid, like, fifteen bucks for the whole box...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt took a bite of the bagel, wretched, and then proceeded to slather it in creme cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph... anyway, guess I'll have to grab some more on the way to work.\" she said through a mouth full of high-calorie bread, \"Be good, I'll be back tonight. What are you thinking for dinner, Pizza Pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" I watched my Aunts bubble butt as it wiggled away, instantly feeling enormously creepy, \"Sure, that sounds... good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat <i>was</i> it about hanging out with me that made my family members fat? Seriously, first poor Alice and now Aunt Rhonda? Seriously, I was like some kind of plague!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big, sexy... jiggly plague.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  And speaking of big, sexy, jiggly plagues... Lily hadn't quite been immune to my infectious increases.  I mean, I hadn't really been paying attention with my Aunt, since, ya know, I lived with her and saw her so often.  Only recently had her backside taken me by surprise.  But, seeing as I didn't live with Lily, the increases on her figure, not to mention her appetite, were a bit more notable as they increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Look, Lily was little when I meant her.  Both vertically and horizontally.  When we initially bumped bellies (well, more like her upper torso was bumped by my lower belly) I was surprised I didn't launch her half a block down the sidewalk.  Again, this girl was maybe 100 pounds, if I was being nice.  But she was small.  And she was still small, compared to me, especially after the past few weeks.  But with my sudden realization that my Aunt Rhonda had turned into a bit of an Aunt Rounda (especially in the rear area), I had a bit of a realization when I finally huffed my way to Lily's front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Now again, this girl, compared to me?  She was a twig.  But, compared to the lithe little Lily that I vaguely recalled almost bouncing into a concussion at the start of my trip here?  She was quite a bit larger.  Nothing astronomical, but lets put it this way:  When a girl my size gains thirty-ish pounds, it's hard to tell.  Well, hard enough to tell.  Apparently my shirts have no problem discriminating.  When a tall lady like my aunt puts on twentish pounds?  Well, it's <i>more</i> noticeable, <i>especially</i> if she's so blessed to gain it all in her ass (not saying I'm jealous, but I assume most women probably would rather have a bigger butt than a bigger belly).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <i>However.</i>  When a girl, with a height deficiency, such as Lily, hangs out with a girl, such as myself, who stuffs themselves constantly, swears by greasy food and sugary snacks, all the time?  Well, they're bound to pick up some habits.  And when you're Lily's height, you tend to show weight... Well, a bit more than most.  But, with the past few weeks composing of glutting myself on my Aunt's dollar, followed by me glutting myself in Lily's company, I hadn't really thought about it.  But today was a bit of a scorcher, which meant absolute hell for myself- look, this fat doesn't exactly encourage cool body temperatures, despite how I dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But Lily had opted for a tanktop which, if I recalled correctly, she wore one of the first times we hung out.  She had combo'd this particular item of clothing with a pair of shorts that, back when we met, probably left a little, but not much to the imagination.  As of the current moment, after she answered the door, I had two thoughts:  \"That shirt doesn't fit right\", and \"I think when Lily turns around, I might see more of her ass than I probably want to.\"  The first, was proven correctly immediately.  The second was proven correct when Lily waved me in and turned around, revealing a quarter of each asscheck as she walked off to her couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Me, being the sensitive, caring individual I am, immediately blurted out \"Hey, Lil, I think you've been snacking a bit too much like myself.\"  Because of course I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lily, for what it's worth, took this in stride.  \"Yeah, I guess I have.\"  I heard a familiar <i>whoosh</i> of her leather couch being plopped into, followed by, \"Now are you gonna come in here and pig out on this ice cream with me or not?\"  I, of course, being the polite guest that I was, ignored the question and bolted (okay, waddled slightly faster than usual) to the couch, spotting Lily with an arm extended with a remote and the other hand gripping a large spoonful of ice cream, which was rapidly approaching her mouth.  I plopped down on the other side of the plastic gallon of ice cream, eliciting a much louder <b><i>WHOMPFHHH</i></b> type noise and lifting up Lily's side of the couch as I did so.  Damn, I was hungry.  And hot.  And so, with the provided spoon, I began to dig into the gallon of ice cream, 3/4 empty, with my current best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sometime later- Okay, about 25 minutes later, I let out a moan as my head began to pulsate with the familiar pains of a brain freeze.  \"Finish without me...\"  I said dramatically, throwing an arm over my head in mock angst.  \"I just can't go on, sailor.  Leave me to burn with Britain.\"  Lily giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm pretty sure you just mixed up, like, 3 different wars, and 4 different war's worth of cliches, but whatever.  It's mostly liquid by now.\"  And with that, she titled the plastic tub up to her face and downed the rest.  I stared at her little (again, relative, although I had to admit, it was getting there) tummy while she did so.  Finally, I felt the pain begin to subside, and I had to ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Do you seriously not get brain freezes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lily stared at me for a second.  \"What's a brain freeze?\"  She cocked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I stared blankly.  \"You serious?\"  She nodded.  \"An ice cream headache?\"  She stared blankly.  \"Your brain doesn't hurt when you eat too much cold stuff?  Seriously, that's why I had to take a break.\"  Again, she stared at me, clearly confused.  \"You've never drank a slushie too fast and felt like you had a headache for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lily let out a small laugh, before she realized I was serious.  \"No, never.  Never ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I was beyond stunned.  \"Bull.  Shit.\"  But she clearly wasn't fucking around.  \"Look, we're gonna go to the gas station, and I'm gonna buy two slushies, and you're gonna chug one.  You need to prove this to me.\"  She looked a little startled, but agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Fifteen minutes later, we were at the gas station.  It would've been about two minutes, but I needed a snack, since I honestly didn't think Lily was going to shotgun the last of the ice cream, so I heated up a taquito- look, I needed something hot to counteract the cold ice cream right before I drank a 42 ounce slushie.  I, of course, went the awesome route- cherry, then blueberry, then cola, then cherry, then lemonade, then cherry again.  Lily, because she's kinda lame, just got 42 ounces of boring old cherry.  We walked out to her (thankfully) air conditioned car, and I stared her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Look, this is how you prove you're not shitting me.  You have to chug that whole thing, right now.  No stops- breathe through your nose.  If you can do that, without stopping, I'll get us dinner later.  If you lose, you have to buy.  Got it?\"  She nodded, her face nothing but seriousness.  \"And... Go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  And I'll be damned.  She did it.  Either this girl had the pain tolerance of a Saint (seriously, I'm kinda bad at metaphors) or she couldn't get brain freezes.  \"Well, I suppose congratulations are in order...\" I said as she let out a moderate belch.  \"We'll go wherever you want for dinner, my treat.\"  Well, technically it'd be my Aunt's treat, since she kinda gave me money, but whatever.  However, Lily looked a little worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yeah, can we, uh, get dinner later?  I'm not feeling too good from all the sugar.\"  I, of course, agreed- I certainly could keep myself entertained with this slushie for at <i>least</i> twenty minutes, and then there were all sorts of snacks at Lily's place.  However, by the time we got home, the fact of Lily's recent gain had crossed my mind again.  And since I truly am the master of tact, as we chilled on the couch, me sitting upright (it's hard as hell to drink a slushie laying down) and Lily laying on her back, her feet of the couch, I finally had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I poked her protruding belly and said, \"Hey, what's up with this?  I thought I was the one getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Lily let out a small hiccup from the sudden force against her gut, and said-</span></div></div>",

Ever since Lily had started hanging out with me, she'd probably put on upwards of twenty pounds. Probably thirty. And most of it, like me, went right to that cute little belly of hers. Beneath her tank top, I could see it bunch up into rolls as she cowered from the judgment of my prodding poking finger, her dramatic muffin top flopping out uncomfortably onto her lap. I didn't even know why she was still wearing those shorts; her lovehandles <i>and</i> her ass were practically pouring out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't blame me.\" I smiled as I gave her tummy another little poke, \"I'm not the one who makes you do stupid stuff like drink two slushies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\" she whined, withdrawing herself even smaller into a tight little ball of Lily, picking her thicker legs up off the floor and wrapping her arms around them, \"Knock it--URP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tightness of her position, combined with the fullness of her belly, proved to be quite uncomfortable for all our snacks sloshing around inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that was almost a <i>real</i> burp!\" I teased, \"You <i>are</i> picking up some bad habits, aren't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shut up!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I just got these, like, a month ago!\"  Lily said angrily, a few minutes later.  Her shorts had been replaced by yoga pants, and she was red in the face as she rambled.  \"Seriously, those were practically brand new, Mel!\"  Despite being angry about her shorts acquiring a new 5 inch hole, Lily was still more than happy to drive the two of us to a restaurant (some new place called Smokey's BBQ).  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno what to tell you, Lily.  Shit happens.  I tend to rip a piece of clothing about once a week, to be honest.\"  Lily sighed, then giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One can only hope that I'll never get so fat that I'm ripping things on a weekly basis...\"  She sort of trailed off at the end of that comment, and I imagined what a Lily with an additional 300 pounds would look like.  I assumed it wouldn't be quite as evenly distributed- she'd probably be one of those fatties that accumulates all of their weight in their tits, I thought bitterly.  Looking over, I could confirm my theory somewhat- Lily was definitely more stacked than she used to be, and I was a little surprised that she hadn't whined about having to get new bras while she was bitching about her pants.  I mean, sure, she had gained mostly in her belly, but my boobs kind of... grew by default and her's definitely had plumped up.  Say, why was I thinking about my best friends tits, anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it doesn't look too busy, at least...\"  Lily said quietly as she maneuvered her car into one of the spaces.  \"Oh, hey, look!  New opening prices- 9$ for the buffet!\"  She didn't even have to ask.  We both knew what we wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, for a place that has BBQ in the name, they sure don't have a ton of BBQ on the buffet line.\"  I grumbled as I threw my tray down.  Boy, I loved buffets that had trays, because I was an old pro, and could easily get 5 plates on there without too much overlap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily swallowed her bite of biscuit before staring at me.  \"Mel... You literally have BBQ ribs, pulled pork, maple fried bacon, and a steak covered in BBQ sauce.  That's... pretty much all there is to BBQ.\"  I sighed, my mouthful of mashed potatoes muffling the sound a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've clearly never been to Texas.\"  I said, but I wasn't too salty about any of this.  Shit, five plates might be enough to warm me up, at least, and by the time I hit that perfect level of stuffed where I wouldn't want to leave the table, I was sure Lily would get food for me.  But it <i>had</i> been a while since I'd really, y'know, pushed myself.  I mean, I always ate what would be enough to feed a family of 5, but it had been a while since I had eaten enough for a family of 15.  Just... Broke down and ate.  I tried to remember the last time I ate so much I couldn't move- it would've been at a buffet, but my Aunt wasn't too fond of them, so the only time I would go would be with Lily. And so-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lil, when did we go to a buffet last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me Mel?  It was like, 6 days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I would've remembered if I ate til I was like, actually full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm not surprised you don't remember, because you only got 3 plates of food before you started bitching about how small the booth was, and we ended up leaving and just getting burgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"  She was right, now I remembered- just because of the burgers.  \"Right.\"  I thought for a second, before deciding I didn't care how creepy I sounded- it wasn't like Lily wasn't already hip to my summer plans.  \"I need to eat until I can't take another bite.  Will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of hard to read Lily's face- partially because she had a sloppy joe held right in front of it.  She took a big bite, chewing slowly, before swallowing and answering.  \"I mean, sure, you're the one who paid, after all...  But how serious are you being?\"  I wasn't quite sure what she meant, and it must have shown, because she elaborated.  \"I guess what I'm saying is, how will you know when you've had enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me laugh, and I had to take a second to calm down before responding.  \"When you're my size, you know when you've had enough.  So let's get to it.\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, Lily probably didn't <i>help</i> the whole \"closing the place down\" thing, but I did most of the grunt work. Seriously, you'd think a place run by a guy a not much skinnier than I was would understand a thing or two about letting loose at a buffet every now and then. I know how big he was because I got a first-hand look at how big this guy was when he came over to our table, personally, to ask us to please calm the fuck down with all the eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thing was, my brain had more or less shut down after the first hour or so. I hadn't gone into a place with my appetite cocked and ready to fire in so long that I went a little crazy. By the time the guy managed to waddle over there, I would say that Lily and I had probably been stuffing our faces (rather, my face) for the better part of three hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a mess. There was barbecue sauce <i>everywhere</i>. On my hands, on my face, down my shirt, even in my hair. What they lacked in variety (at least, what <i>I</i> considered variety) they made up for in quality. Seriously, I had to go home and smack my Aunt Rhonda in the face for suggesting that Lily and I should have gone to Little Pig's. This place had some of the best ribs I'd ever deep-throated, and the best sandwiches I'd ever put into my mouth. And I <i>know</i> sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clutched my gut, burbling and squelching richly as it did it's absolute best to not explode. My shirt, my poor shirt, had been absolutely ruined by barbecue sauce; and my belly had swollen so much that it may as well have just been a half-tee with red-brown stains anyway. My breathing was so labored that I vaguely recognized other customers looking over to our table, wondering just what in the hell was going on. My arms, doughy and flabbier than ever, ached after the intense workout I'd just put them through, and my jaw hung slack into the folds of my chins as I sat there, stuffed stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily, who certainly hadn't been modest in her portions either, actually had to nudge me in the arm to get my attention. I heard the  booth beneath her squeak as she tilted slightly to the right, and slapped my upper arm.\"Mel.\" she burped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was way too out of it to respond on the first shot, and <i>way</i> too concerned with thoughts of my own obesity to show any concern to the tall,  bowling-ball shaped man that stared daggers at me from a good two feet behind his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel.\" she said a little more insistently, but still pretty groggy, \"This guy wants to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh?\" I asked dumbly, my head rolling over to the side to face Bowling Ball Man, \"Hey...rrrRURRRRP...'sup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna have t'ask y'all to leave.\" he looked and sounded an awful lot like Dr. Phil if he'd fallen off the wagon and locked himself in a bakery, \"Y'all got more than yer fair share of barbecue, and I'd really hate to get the police involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaat?\"I replied drunkenly, slurring my words and punctuating my half-thoughts with hot belches, \"That's... dumb. The sign <i>says</i> all you can eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you ladies have eaten enough.\" he said, crossing his arms over is moobs, \"Come on. Out of the booth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was <i>not</i> well for that. I'd pretty much wedged myself into the space between the booth and the table, and (like a <i>lot</i> of booths in this town!) they weren't adjustable. My belly pushed itself into the table, my top-tiers oozing into a big blubbery puddle next to my graveyard of discarded courses. I honestly wasn't sure if I <i>could</i> get up. Thank God Lily was more coherent (and less voluptuous) than I was, because I'm pretty sure that I would have probably had to have been escorted out by Not-Doctor-Phil if I couldn't get myself out of there.So  eventually, Lily helped pull me out of there. There was this big red mark across my gut as it sloshed and shook in front of me, bobbing with my every step to the rhythm of my huge tits. I held it by the flanks, hoping to relieve some of the pressure that gravity was putting on it by holding it up. But I wasn't that strong--<i>no one</i> was. Lily handled all the talking and got me out of there. She guided me out, wincing as  my width scraped against the metal frame of the door, and let me plop myself down on the bench so I could center myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot <i>believe</i> you got me kicked out of a restaurant.\" Lily sounded more amused than upset, \"I've never been kicked out of ANYTHING before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knoooo...\" I remember burping as I leaned onto her, practically crushing her as we waited for our ride home, \"It sucksss. That place was <i>sooo</i> good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sure Big Bob in there is glad you think so.\" Lily looked into the inside, \"He seems pretty pissed. Better hope our taxi comes by... I need to change into something stretchy. <i>Pronto</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna get kicked out of Little Pigs' next?\" I asked almost fliratiously, burping right into her face, \"I'm not doing anything tomorrow. Or the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna get <i>so</i> fucking fat hanging out with you, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I started to black out a little. Anyone who's ever eaten a lot (hopefully not as much as I did) will tell you that you get pretty sleepy when all you do is eat for hours on end. It's a lot more tiring than you'd think! I flickered in and out for a while while we waited for our cab.. All I know for sure about the hour or so after we left was that, somehow, I made it home. And that,  at some point, I'd stripped down to my birthday suit and passed out in my bed. And also that, the next morning, I gave that place the shittiest Yelp! review ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll You Can Eat my big fat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as you can probably guess, I had the most awesome life ever.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So let me put this into context for you\u2014Lily was <i>already</i> kind of a pig before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung out with me all the time, how could she not be? I made it a point to surround myself with so much food that I couldn\u2019t <i>not</i> gain weight. Whenever she wasn\u2019t in class, she was usually with me\u2014binging out of my Aunt\u2019s generous (and seemingly endless) wallet. We were either eating out at a restaurant, eating in her car, or eating on the couch at my Aunt Rhonda\u2019s place; <i>always</i>. Even now that she had started school, Lily still found countless hours to spend with me almost every day as I spent my time ravenously devouring anything put in front of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I guess I had sort of\u2026 rubbed off on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, yeah, she had already put on a lot of weight. But after we got kicked out of the barbecue hut that night, something inside Lily seemed to snap\u2014it was like, once she realized she had gotten kicked out of a buffet (well, <i>I</i> had. She was more through association, though she had eaten a lot) Lily\u2019s eating dial went into overdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had only known each other for about four months, and my little Lily had ballooned herself up to nearly two hundred pounds of pure, unadulterated appetite. Seriously, she was like a completely different chick. Her short stature made her look round and hungry, like a little red-headed Pac Man with tits the size of overripe cantaloupes. Her cute little pot belly had grown heavy and thick, with meaty lovehandles blooming on either side of her gut. Her ass filled the seat of any chair unlucky to have her, and rounded out prominently behind her. If I hadn\u2019t spent every minute gorging alongside her, I would have never known that she was the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy own healthy appetite, of course, hadn\u2019t done anything other than blow myself up even further. I had put on a respectable forty pounds since that night at Big Bob\u2019s, and it probably had a lot to do with my Gaining Coach turned Binge Buddy. Now that I had turned Lily to the Dark Side, we were literally constantly eating when we were together. My tits were huge, my ass was huger, and my hips were so wide that I was starting to brush against doorways when I walked. I had to swing my arms slightly when I walked to keep my fat ass moving, which was no easy feat because my arms were just as heavy and fat as the rest of me. Even my face had started retaining more weight; I\u2019d officially come into my third chin, and my cheeks were so puffy that I was starting to get that cute little fold over the corners of my mouth. But the real star of the show\u2014the top billing of my blubbery body\u2014was my belly. It grew bigger and hungrier every day, just like me. I loved the way it felt when it slapped against the thick mattressy padding of my thighs, and I was just beginning to have to strain to wrap my arms around it. I was huge; bigger than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to toot my own horn here, but I was doing a <i>much</i> better job of packing on the pounds than Lily was. I mean, come on. The first few hundred is easy, right? It\u2019s keeping up your new figure that\u2019s the hard part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway so like always, Lily and I went out to eat after she got out of classes. We parked ourselves at this little greasy spoon place that we\u2019d found called Big Burger. It was one of the few places in town that was both able to accommodate my increasing girth and totally okay with the fact that I regularly performed miraculous feats of gastronomy on a daily basis. We\u2019d actually been eating there a lot lately; it had sort of become me and Lil\u2019s unofficial hangout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we\u2019d pretty much become regular patrons at this place. I could waddle through the door and, just as soon as they saw my gut through the doorway, the waitresses would already have an order for us ready. They always had a little something different, and it was always enough to feed probably a family of five. At first, y\u2019know, it was just sort of nice that they knew us well enough to start off with a big spread. But now, I\u2019ll admit, I sort of expected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was squeezed into the booth, my 460 pound self causing the cheap plastic that struggled to support me to creak and groan with my every movement. I was busy palming a burger the size of a hand fruit and shoving it into my face while Lily grabbed chicken tenders by the handful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl definitely had potential, I remember thinking to myself as I tried not to choke on an unexpected pickle. I had only known her since the Summer, and she\u2019d already packed on a <i>lot</i> of weight. More than I had, dare I say it. And this was coming from a girl who went to a school where, like, 90% of my graduating class couldn\u2019t touch their toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we were just sitting there, stuffing ourselves like normal, when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That is, until a skinny little girl plopped down in our booth.  Of course, I barely had the attention span to notice- but Lily noticed almost immediately. Heck, with Lily's newly acquired chub, I hadn't seen her stop with a half plate left in front of her in weeks, but when this girl sat down, she completely stopped all movement.  And still, if it hadn't been for this girl's new voice, I probably wouldn't have even noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Lily.  I was a little worried I wouldn't find you, this place is usually so busy, but... Yeah.\"  These words barely registered with me- My burger was now gone, but the fries sure weren't, neither was the second plate of fries- well, technically chili fries, since they were doused in chili and cheese and sour cream- and I still had half a shake left.  But, when Lily stopped eating, something in my subconscious awoke, and by the time this girl had given off her loud speech, I had slowed down enough to speak in between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, who's this?\"  I muttered, before jamming some fries into my mouth (They were from the chili pile, for the record- can't eat cold chili deluxe fries.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny girl looked ready to talk again, but she faltered.  I gave her a quick look over as I jammed fries into my mouth.  She was skinny as hell- and that wasn't just a relative measure.  She was pretty slim by any means- she wore a sweatshirt that I was sure was junior sized, and her jawbone was as pronounced as any model's would be.  She had longer, natural black hair, and while attractiveness on either gender was pretty beyond my scope of thought (since it didn't involve food), I would guess most guys (and girls, I suppose) would find her attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily took up the silence.  \"This is Mary.  Her full name is Marigold-\"  Mary blushed at this, mind you.  \"-But she goes by Mary.  She's cool.  She asked if we could hang out, so I invited her.  Is that alright?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, I would've replied in a positive way, since I had barely spoken to anyone beyond servers, my family, and Lily since I had gotten here, but my mouth was full, so I just nodded.  Finally, after I finished chewing (and letting out a small belch), I managed to mutter out a sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you wanna hang out with two big girls like us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was half joking, of course, but while Lily glared at me, I kept my eyes on Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed in embarrassment, but still was able to...</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m cool with it\u2014mostly\u2014but Marigold would be crushed if she just woke up one day and weighed as much as I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. Whenever the <i>negative</i> parts of her being a cute little chub ball came up, some how everything came up to be <i>my</i> fault. But I wasn\u2019t the one who made Lily all roly-poly. In a weird way, I could understand though. Lily probably would have wound up getting fat anyway (if those pictures of her family were any indication) but being around me had probably put her ahead by a few years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, I really didn\u2019t want to lose my best friend\u2014hell, my <i>only</i> friend since I moved here\u2014just because she was worried about what me being around might do to Marie. Just because they went to college together didn\u2019t mean that I should have had to give up my little ginger binger, did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I still hang out with you guys?\u201d I asked after a long pause, \u201cI mean, Marie <i>is</i> going to order subs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you <i>promise</i> you\u2019ll be good.\u201d Lily shivered, \u201cAnd that we can turn the heater on, like, ninety when we get to your Aunt\u2019s place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So it's basically 'the battle of Verdun, is no fun', okay...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my God this was boring.  Like, horribly boring.  They were talking about a World War, but I'll be damned if I knew- or cared- which one.  Luckily for me, there was a <i>TON</i> of food.  An alarming amount, one might say.  I was feeling adventurous, so I was currently holding a sub in one hand and a slice of pizza in the other, and was alternating, which was going about as well as one might expect.  But food is food, so I just sort of drowned out the white noise of education and focused on eating everything in front of me, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have pizza sauce on your, uh... Everything.\"  Mary quietly pointed out from across the table.  I snapped out of my gluttony for half a second to see Mary staring at me, a pencil twirling in her hand.  I swallowed the massive bite of pepperoni that I had jammed in my face and stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah... I uh, I tend to get a bit messy.  Where'd Lily go?\"  Apparently at some point between my second foot-long and my fifth slice of pizza Lily had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom.\"    Marie responded, sounding bored.  For some reason, I felt a little awkward.  I felt a belch rumble up and before I could help myself, I let it out, long and hard.  Marie made a face that I couldn't quite read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry?  I guess I... Ate kinda fast.\"  I suddenly felt very awkward.  I mean, I didn't know a lot about the girl, other than all of the sudden I was kind of the crypt-keeper between her and getting as fat as me, at Lil's request.  \"Are you guys having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, I sucked at this.  \"As much fun as you can have talking about history and prepping for a shitty test.  How's the food?\"  I grinned- I couldn't talk much about college junk, but I could definitely talk about food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I mean, Tino's has the best pizza, but their sandwiches aren't that great, which is why I was super psyched that you had gotten J&amp;L's, and then, I mean, Mandarin Kitchen is a pretty solid choice, their crab rangoon is the best in town!  I've only eaten there a few times, but, uh...\"  I trailed off.  I think I had scared Marie a little, with my food talk.  And she seemed kind of unsure of how to respond.  An awkward silence overtook us.  I started to panic- this girl and Lily seemed tight, what if she didn't like me?  And then her and Lily would hang out all the time and I'd never see her and I'd have to sit at home and eat until I couldn't stand up and watch television and... Well, that didn't sound <i>that</i> bad, but it'd be way better to do with a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pretty sure Lily would be hella pissed, but I did what felt natural to me.  \"Hey, you, uh, want a slice?\"  I mean, it was one slice.  She nodded, and a slid a slice over on a piece of paper towel- and the girl fuckin' <b>devoured</b> it.  Like, she could've put \"hungry Mel\" to shame.  I swear the slice was gone in a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see her eyeing the remaining 2 slices of pizza hungrily, the way a dog will track your movement whenever you have anything they think might be edible.  Panicking, I slammed the two slices together and jammed them into my mouth, chewing frantically.  Marie's eyes grew wide.  \"Sorry, I was feeling hungry again.\"   I managed to blurt out while my cheeks were swollen with pizza, somehow.  She nodded, then began to stare at the remnants of sandwhich in front of me.  Swallowing hard, I crammed the sandwich into my face, jamming way too much food into there at once, until my jaw started to hurt-  And then I proceeded to almost choke when I felt a hand slap on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to get back to it, Marie!\"  Lily shouted.  I sighed with relief- or I would've if there was any sort of space in my mouth.  Lily sat down (the chair letting out a light creak) and gave me a look that said, \"I really hope you didn't offer her food.\"  I tried to give her an innocent look, but I wouldn't know how it turned out, because they were already back to studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while they studied, I started to realize that this awkward situation was bound to repeat itself next time Lily ran off to the bathroom again- and judging by the way she was slamming Coke, it wouldn't be much longer.  Feeling a little queasy from the bites of food I had forced down my throat, I began to diligently dig into the chinese food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid on the couch, feeling like I was on fire.  \"Lily, why is it so FUCKING HOT?\"  I shouted as angrily as I could, except I think the sheer amount of food weighing me down made me sound more pathetic than frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hot because YOU cranked up the heat-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Because you asked me to!</i>\"  I interrupted, but she kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And because I'm pretty sure you ate like, 5 pounds of spicy pork and beef-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Again, because you asked me to!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-<i><b>And also because you're just fat!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she got me with that one.  But still, I was pissed!  And stuffed.  I let out what I hoped like was an angry burp as I sat on the couch and tried to not pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, seriously, Mel, you must've eaten like six pounds of food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, there was no point in arguing with Lily- and I had a feeling I knew why she was so grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And you didn't even save any for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup.  I was just doing what she told me to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, I guess things were kind of heating up in the college world, because I didn't see Lily or Marie for a little while, until I got a text from Lily...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so I got this text from Lily a few days later that said Marie was acting weird. Which, in all honesty, didn't seem that odd. She was a weird chick--if I'd learned anything from my time at Buttercombe, it was that spoiled rich girls <i>tended</i> to be weird; at least by \"normal\" standards. And, y'know, I called Lily and told her that, but she was just convinced that something strange was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand.\" her tinny tone came over the reciever as I held it in place with my fat face and even fatter shoulder, glutting myself on some pizza, \"It's like, ever since a few days ago, she's... different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>URRRP</i>...\" I belched into the speaker, \"Well ('scuse me!} different how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... <i>different!</i>\" Lily said exasperatedly, the tell-tale signs of rustling wrappers punctuating how distressed the chubby bunny really was. Lily had a nasty habit of stress-eating, though it was getting harder and harder to tell between all her regular eating just when exactly she was stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Lil.\" I snorted, smacking my lips into the phone as I sucked down any stray pizza sauce, \"Unless she's grown an extra finger and gills, 'different' could be anything. You've gotta be more specific!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" rustle rustle rustle, \"It's just... y'know, ever since we all hung out together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a strange lump in my throat that quickly dropped to the bottom of my stomach. My eyes opened attentively as I let what Lily said sink in. I hadn't seen Marigold since I let her have that slice of pizza. Lily said that she wasn't used to junk food, or had ever had it, but surely I hadn't done anything wrong, right? I just slipped the girl a slice of pie! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" I said nervously, my chewing becoming more pronounced, \"And, uh... wh-what's she doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so weird!\" Lily said finally, \"Ever since we all hung out together...</span></div></div>",

Well have fun with your hoighty-toighty college hangouts while little ol' me sits at home and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally cut me off.  \"Okay, <b>Jeeze!</b>  Lay off the fucking drama for a second, Mel!  It's just kind of... Excessive.  Like, don't get me wrong, you're like my best friend, but she's only met you once, and the way she talks about you... Sheesh.  It's just kinda weird, but if it'll make her happy, then that's fine.  Plus, I haven't seen you in a while.  But I guess we did get a lot of studying done last time, and it's nice to see Marigold branch out a bit more.  Fine, how about I see if she wants to come over... Tomorrow?  Sixish?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed the last bit of pizza, reached with my free hand for a new slice and found the box empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but the pizza is on you two again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily laughed on the other end of the line.  \"Great.  I'll text you if things don't work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI passed the time the way I usually did.  My lovely Aunt Rhonda would come home around 6ish, usually bearing either groceries or takeout, or both.  She hadn't really exploded in weight after that initial burst of gain- I think maybe after she popped her 15th stitch or so, she realized that maybe eating Apple Dumpling's turnovers every day wasn't doing her any favors.  Granted, she hadn't really gone on a diet, per-say, but it seemed to have sort of peaked.  Still didn't stop her from chowing down with me every night for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo tonight was thai food, which I was perfectly happy with.  The spicy dishes paired nicely with the half gallon of ice cream that I had stored away in the fridge for such an occasion.  By 8ish, Rhonda was usually pretty beat, and if nothing was good on television, she'd peace out to her room for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was my cue to take my pants off.  Don't get me wrong, I only wore stretchy pants- but with my new life of burning maybe 10 calories a day, combined with me cleaning out half the fridge every day, meant that even the stretchiest of elastic was strained by my blossoming gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow pantsless, I'd usually scarf down whatever snacks sounded good- after the previously mentioned ice cream, I reheated the container of Thai that wasn't devoured, then heated up two bags of popcorn (extra butter, obvs) and scarfed them down with a side of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, I'd usually wake up around 11:30- Aunt Rhonda would be long gone, which meant no pants for me.  Then it was basically working through whatever was left in the fridge, or pantry.  Occasionally I'd order some takeout if I was feeling adventurous, but the whole \"not having a job\" thing meant this was a rare occasion, usually when Rhonda left me some money for whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo eventually, it was like, 6:15, and I was starving.  Those two were taking their sweet-ass time and I had been so busy cleaning that I had really worked up an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I had thrown away, like, four pizza boxes.  That takes <i>effort.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, on top of that, I had to force myself into pants, and even (because I didn't want to look like a <i>slob!</i> ) I had squeezed my massive chest into a bra.  My boobs oozed over the cups (not entirely unexpected) and the straps dug angrily into my back, but I still persevered, for Mary's sake.  It'd take a few more hangouts before I went braless around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, my yoga pants were giving me such a ridiculous muffin top that It could easily be considered indecent, and my sweatshirt basically ended just above my bellybutton, giving everyone an excellent view of several inches of my pale, flabby stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach let out a very angry grumble as I texted Lily.  \"where are you guys im seriously starving, im gonna be a skeleton by the time u get here\".  I dramatically threw my phone away and fanned my forehead.  Okay, maybe spending a lot of time at home not doing anything was making me a little stir-crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy phone chirped happily and I scrambled across the couch to grab it, my belly folding into several various sized rolls as I did to, the springs creaking in the angry tone that I'd grown to know over the past few months.  \"Just, hold your damn horses.  Mary's going a little crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was ominous.  I quickly texted back.  \"??? What ???\"  And then a bunch of confused looking cat emojis.  I'm an obnoxious texter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just buying a lot of food.  Chill.  She said she, and I quote, \"Wants to make sure Mel has enough\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened, remembering the absolute glut of food that I had shoveled into my face last time we hung out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i think i love mary, tell her that <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily didn't take long to respond:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Mel, don't be weird.  We're on our way, try not to be too much of a crazy pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"fat chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood pun, me.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was a little preoccupied by the fact that my company for the evening came in bearing loads upon loads of junk food. Seriously, I don't think that I could see Lily's face over all the bags and packaging. Marigold leading the way, they practically bum-rushed to the couch and plopped themselves down; with all that yummy takeout within my immediate grasp, it was only a matter of time before I started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, see, <i>that's</i> where it started getting weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had fully expected this to be a repeat of last time. Lily and Marie do some boring college studying while I'm presented with yet another opportunity to stuff myself beyond the comprehension of most mere mortals. Lily and I would take little breaks to regale Marie in our tales of extreme overeating, I'd zone out on the couch and maybe watch some TV, end of story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no. This time around, after seeing what damage I could do to even a mountain of food, Marie seemed much more interested in watching my each and every move. Like a kid watching a magician; she wanted to see just <i>how</i> all that food disappeared, I guess. I didn't even notice it at first, but after I finished every entree I would look up to see what was closest, only to fine Marie staring at me. It was pretty evident that she wasn't getting much studying done either--the background noise that was their studying quickly faded out without my knowledge, and quickly became Lily doing some guided reading while Marie watched my every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Lily had to get up and use the restroom, leaving just me and Marie. Alone. In my aunt's living room. Surrounded by the remains of several sub sandwiches and thai takeout containers. There was still a box of pizza left on the coffee table, thankfully. That gave me something to shove in my face so I didn't have to face how awkward this was getting. But eventually, I had to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marie? Did, uh... are you on some over dosage of Riddelin? Because you haven't stopped staring at me all night.\" I finally said, uneased by the fact that her eyes were glued to my belly, \"I mean, normally I <i>like</i> the attention but... y'know. Kinda weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie began to bloom an immediate shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" she let out a flustered huff, \"I-It's just... uh... m-maybe a little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Marie, spill it.\" I said before taking another bite of pizza, \"You brought all this food over for <i>free</i>, so that makes us friends in my book; just tell me what's up and, more importantly, why you've been giving me the creep stare all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Marie said quietly before sputtering out a series of mumbling whispers, \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">mumminamummina</font>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what was that?\" I cupped my hand to my ear, \"I couldn't hear you over your crippling social anxiety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I <i>said</i>...\" Marie began, a little more firmly this time...</span></div></div>",

Your parents and your presumably horrible Catholic school mentors can't see you now, so indulge, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure why I was so encouraging- perhaps I saw a bit of myself within Marie- struggling with resisting her upbringing.  Of course, my resistance came early.  Marie just needed some... Encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief second, I found myself wondering what Marie would look like at my size.  She struck me as the kind of girl that only gained below her waist- all hips and ass.  Of course, it'd take her years and years to get even close to my size, and even then I'd probably be way bigger at this rate, probably too big to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Urrrrrrrp!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went wide, and I stared at Marie, who looked just as shocked.  I turned around and saw Lily, standing there looking more than a bit bloated- hey, I wasn't the only one eating this stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to her seat, before sighing.  \"Alright, where were we?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wasn't sure if it was because no one had sat Marie down and talked to her like that before, if she was trying to branch out of her sheltered Catholic-School bubble, or if I just straight-up scared her into submission, but I distinctly remember that after that night on the couch Marie started acting differently around me. She wasn't as shy, she didn't gawk as much, and she actually started to... I don't know, open up to me, I guess. It was weird at first, but then again I guess I had sort of forgotten how to have more than one friend at a time by that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes sense, I guess. I mean, if the worst thing that could happen between us was me sitting her down and telling her to grow up and take charge of her own appetites, and I had already done it, what more reason was there to hold back? I was real with Marie, and I guess she appreciated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe started hanging out some after that. Like <i>by ourselves</i> and everything. I'll admit that we didn't quite \"click\" the same way that Lily and I had; it was a little awkward at first. It probably would have helped if we could all hang out together more than once a week, y'know, to help us ease into things. But I was more than willing to give it a shot, so long as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and as long as she kept the snacks coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, girlfriend was <i>loaded</i>. Which, y'know, makes sense when you look back on our first few hangouts together. She fronted the bill for <i>everything</i>, and didn't so much as think twice about it! Coming from a girl with more inches than dollars and less sense than cents, I was more than ready to take Miss Moneybags's invitations to hang out with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, what's a good place to eat?\" she'd ask me almost every time we hung out, practically licking her lips, \"I can't decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I told her. Mexican Pepper, Apple Dumplin's, Big Burger, just about every one of my own discoveries and hangouts soon became Marie's. Honestly, I'd spent so much of my life going out to eat that it didn't really strike me as odd that it was <i>Marie</i> asking. I was just happy to accept the invitation, and eventually just happy to stuff myself with someone who was more than willing to front the bill for the two of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, I don't really feel like going to Biology today...\" Marie asked me more than a few times, \"Wanna go grab some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, I mean, who was I to say no to Marie's new \"blossoming\"? She was finding herself! Letting go, making <i>herself</i> happy and all that noise. I'd be a damn hypocrite if I didn't at least help her steadily work the rod that those nuns and parents of hers had wedged up her ass. So we started to hang out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marie wants to know if you wanna come eat with us at our cafeteria?\" Lily asked me over the phone, \"She's paying, and it's meatloaf night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'so fulllll!\" Marie whined one night at my Aunt's place, cradling a distended gut, \"Why'd you guys let me eat so much?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that you and Lily <i>knew</i> about deep-deep dish pizzas...\" Marie said with a crazed look in her eye, \"And neither of you <i>told</i> me about it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I never really stopped to look at how much Marie was changing in the coming weeks. I saw her every other day or so, but to me she was just getting more comfortable hanging out with me and Lily. She stopped being so quiet, for the most part, and we started introducing her to our shows... I mean, she just sort of became one of the girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, y'know how when you're really close to someone and you don't <i>realize</i> that they're changing but they are and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it; I'll just come right out and say it: I had done literally what Lily asked me not to do and pushed Marie off the deep end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, in retrospect, was kind of a bitchy thing to do. I understand now why Lily was so intent on keeping us apart, but in all honesty it wasn't like I had done a bad thing. I helped a girl grow up! So what if she was gonna grow out too? And besides, Marie was <i>way</i> more fun now that she had finally let loose. She laughed more, talked more, and honestly seemed more friendly. So she had <i>maybe</i> developed an unhealthy relationship with food. Who <i>didn't</i> have one of those? As far as I was concerned, this little development was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept maybe...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My phone vibrated and scared me half to death.  I was currently in the process of trying to buy a damn pair of yoga pants that might actually, y'know, not rip within ten days of me ordering them?  I was deep in thought, wondering if maybe it was the material, rather than the size itself.  So I was kind of in this weird trance where I was on wikipedia and about five different clothing websites, looking at the \"recommended waistline\" and then comparing the materials when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce my heart rate dropped back down to acceptable levels, I checked my phone- of course it was Lily.  My aunt pretty much didn't text me anymore- hell, I barely saw her, and when I did, she'd comment about work being hell and duck into her room.  And, well, my list of friends wasn't exactly a mile long.  \"Whats up- I'm at the mall and bored as hell- join me and ill buy lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there was a serious dilemna here- mainly the cost-benefit analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pros:</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree lunch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to see Lily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe I can find some new pants (haha yeah fuckin' right, though)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cons:</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to move<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to deal with everyone who isn't Lily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to put on pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty please?\"  Came the next text, along with a picture of Lily pouting- complete with what I now saw was the makings of a third chin.  Bad angle, I guessed.  Phone vibrated again:  \"Hell, I'll buy you two dinners.  I haven't seen you in like a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was true.  And last time, I had met them at their cafeteria and they sat there and just talked about numbers or whatever and I had to keep getting up to get food.  It sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I sighed, picked my fat ass up off the couch- slightly alarmed with how winded it made me, because if getting off the couch was bad, walking around the damn mall was gonna be <b>bad.</b>  But whateves.  Again: free food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo look- busses suck when you're fat.  Like, I get it, <i>bitch</i>, my fat ass takes up two of these shitty plastic bus seats and it means you can't sit down, but I deserve to sit too!  This lady totally shot me the stink eye all the way to the mall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, at some point I realized that my gut was oozing out of my shirt by like, 3 inches, exposing my pale blubbery belly for everyone to see.  She might have been staring at that.  Still rude, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the bus stops right in front of the area with the highest clustering of restaurants.  \"where we eating?\"  I said, simply and sweet.  I waddled my way through the glass doors, almost bouncing into an older lady who looked at me like I was a freak because I was too busy texting.  I didn't bother apologizing- it was lunch time, lady.  I'm not nice when I'm hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm at Johnny's, so come here first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst.  I liked the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnny's was alright.  It was a local chain, I think, maybe seven or eight of them?  You know the type though- Americana through-and-through, even kitsch to make even the tackiest of grammas roll their eyes.  Still, their food was alright- Hell, I had heard a rumor that they made their shakes with lard, like the old days.  I immediately spotted Lily's beacon of red hair across the way.  I shuffled over, sliding into the booth like a pro, the table immediately jamming into my belly and causing several inches to ooze over the top.  \"Sup.\"  I said dully as I slid in- impressed by the spread before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrench fries, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, oh my!  A plate of sliders- only one sad little one left, which she nimbly plucked up and placed in her mouth- she probably knew I was gonna grab for it.  I settled for a mozzarella stick (or 3) which I crammed into my mouth before she could object.  \"So, what's mine?\"  I asked- and Lily gave me a stare like I had just kicked a puppy.  \"You ordered all this!  Damn, Lil, you trying to outstage me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe narrowed her eyes as she swallowed.  \"Look, I was hungry, okay?  I was here with Marie earlier, and she dragged me all over this mall- I don't know what got into her, it's like she's never been here... Before... Oh.\"  Realization washed over her face as she put down her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, oh.  And I can't believe you didn't order for me!\"  I said grumpily, craning my neck to find our server.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't think we're gonna be here much longer.  The server is a real bitch- she looked like she was gonna gag when I ordered all this food.\"  She sighed and grabbed a handful of fries, dipped them in ranch (that's my girl) and jammed them in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be something in the air, I haven't exactly been treated with smiles today either.  Well hurry up!  I'm hungryyyyyy.\"  The grumpy server in question sauntered over- girl could've been younger than me, and probably weighed 95 pounds soaking wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you want something too?\"  I looked at Lily, who shook her head no.  I had half a mind to go off on this girl, but passed.  If it meant we were getting out of her quicker, I was over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm about to go to my spin class.  I think <i>this</i> pig over here needs her check, though!\"  The girl turned bright red and scurried off.  Lily glared at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  I reached for another onion ring and Lily swatted my hand.  \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd buy you lunch, but that doesn't mean you can eat mine.\"  I fell into a sullen silence while Lily devoured the rest of her food.  The server came back, threw the check down, and practically ran off again.  Lily looked at it, dumped a few bucks on the table, threw the last of the french fries into her mouth, and scooted out of the booth with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I think you could hear my jaw hit the table.  Lily looked larger than before- but like, a LOT larger.  Like, I guess I kinda go into a daze when I'm around her and Marie, because they're being boring and there's food and I don't really pay attention to anything else- but in this moment, I was overly aware of how rotund Lily had become.  Her belly was pushing so hard against her blouse that I could see little diamonds of the white shirt underneath oozing through it.  And I recognized that blouse- it certainly hadn't been that tight when I saw her wear it about a month ago.  Muffin-top was a kind term for what Lily was rocking, which was more of an explosion of midriff fat.  Her tits gave her an appearance that the kids would call, \"Hella stacked\".  And her hips were crammed into this skirt thing that looked about two centimeters away from exploding into confetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess she noticed I was staring and not moving because she slapped my arm.  \"You gonna stare or you gonna move?\"  I scooted slowly out of the booth and followed her out of the resturaunt, watching as her ass jiggled wildly beneath her skirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Lily got huge.\"  I thought, before saying, with tact, \"Damn Lily, you got huge!\"  She paused and I almost smacked into her, and I half expected her to tell me to fuck off and go home.  I winced, preparing for the worst, but she just shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.  It's alright.\"  And I guess that was that!  Anyways, I pointed out that I didn't feel like walking across the mall, so I suggested we go to the little Italian joint know as Olive Garden that was conveniently nestled right next to Johnny's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily paused, and before she could even say anything I said \"Look, I'm starving- and you said you're paying.  All you can eat breadsticks and never ending pasta bowls?  Trust me, Lily, this is a no-brainer for you and your wallet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, admitted I was right, and in we went.  I wondered why she seemed so down about it, until our server came up to our table.  It was a bubbly older guy, and his eyes practically lit up when he came up to the booth.  \"Oh, my, back again!  And with a new friend, that's wonderful!\"  Lily turned bright red.  \"I'll get some waters, and make sure you get extra breadsticks- I saw how you went through them last time.\"  I swear, the guy was one step away from winking and clicking his heels together, with how cheery he was.  As he skipped away (Okay, he didn't actually skip, but I'm sure he was tempted)  I gave Lily a wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two visits in one day, huh?  Niiiiice.\"  She kicked me from beneath the table, and I let out a grunt- but I wasn't gonna let this go.  \"It's only like one-thirty- did you come here, then go to Johnny's, and now we're here again?  You're a damn double-dipper- hell, practically a triple dipper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who said we should go here.\"  She grumbled.  But her embarrassment wasn't quite enough to stop her from practically matching me bite for bite with our never ending feast of carbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we were finished, my gut felt like a lead brick- and Lily looked like she was about to puke.  We paid our bill and staggered out into the mall- I could feel the cool air on my exposed stomach and it took everything I had to not belch constantly, or stagger to a bench and sleep it off.  I looked over to see that Lily was trailing behind me- and that she had unbuttoned her blouse, exposing her t-shirt underneath.  <b>Then</b> I noticed that two of the buttons were missing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta... Lay down... Can we -hic- go to... your aunts?\"  I, being ever so kind, said yes.  Besides, Lily driving us saved me from taking the bus again.  When we made it to her car, I clambered in, grasping my seat belt- only to find that I couldn't get it around my gut without basically cutting myself in half, so I chose to forgo it.  It was a short drive, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we got to my aunt's and I eased Lily into the living room, she looked like she was gonna faint.  She collapsed on the couch and practically started snoring before her body stopped wobbling.  Feeling an odd sense of pride in her, I opted for my bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I kicked off my yoga pants, being careful not to bend over too much, I noticed a nice, softball sized hole in the ass area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckin' great.\"  I muttered, before collapsing into my own bed and passing out.</span></div></div>",

All I knew was that I was having this awesome dream that involved Caity Lotz hand-feeding me chocolate-covered strawberries while I watched Stephen Amell do the salmon ladder one minute, and the next I'm being woken up by the drastic whining of bedsprings and the sudden shifting of weight in my mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around, confused and bleary-eyed as the fuzz began to fade from my mind. I had just barely realized that I wasn't in the Arrowcave when I looked to my side; the source of the calamity. I saw Lily on all fours, outlined by the faint light of the hallway creeping through the cracks of my nearly shut door, crawling into my bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, she'd stripped out of most of her clothing. I left her on the couch, stuffed into that blouse and skirt combo, but all Lily had on now was her underwear. I recognized the one good bra she had left, even as her tits swung pendulously between her chubby arms, and her belly hung just an inch lower than that. I could even make out the redness of her hair as she came closer towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whu...

Considering how fast that girl fell asleep, I assumed she was as heavy of a sleeper as any.  I shuffled slightly awkwardly away from her so I couldn't feel her pressed against me- she immediately snuggled up tighter within her blanket and turned away from me.  Eventually- despite her loud snoring, mind you- I fell asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up to the front door shutting- but when I turned over, Lily was still in my bed.  I couldn't fall asleep with her snoring (because <i>damn</i> she was loud as hell) so, pissed off, I decided to eat away my frustration and not getting my usual 11-13 hours of sleep (Hey, big girls need big rest, or whatever).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst order of the day- bagels.  Oh, but I loved my morning bagels!  Easy to eat, high in calories, tasty as hell-  Mmm.  Opening the pantry, I saw I had quite the selection today- Sesame, Original, and what's this I see?  Why, none other than cinnamon swirl!  We had one of those fancy toasters- Six slots, probably for families, but for me, it meant \"First course\".  One of each type of bagel, and a nice big tub of cream cheese waiting for them when they came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile those toasted (six slots seemed to  mean longer toasting times, which seemed counter-intuitive, but what did I know?)  I pulled out my favorite cereal bowl from the drying rack.  Well, calling it a \"cereal bowl\" was a bit like calling one of those 8-cups worth measuring cups a \"drinking glass\".  It could hold a whole box of cereal if you felt like it (and it's me, so lets be real- I felt like it a <b>lot</b>)  But today I held back.  This was because my aunt, in her infinite wisdom, had bought me these amazing pre-made breakfast sandwiches.  Sausage, egg, and cheese on a nice crispy english muffin- at least when you baked them in the oven.  I microwaved them once in a hurry, and that was a mistake.  So those went in as well.  I heard my toaster pop up so I sauntered over there and began cream-cheese-ing my bagels with a grin.  Sure, I was mad that my bed was currently occupied, but at least I had a solid 2,000 calories coming up for me to chow on that should keep me filled for the next, oh, three hours or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, of course, Lily came out, sleepily rubbing her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Mel, your bed is comfy!  Way nicer than mine- oh, damn, are you making breakfast?\"  And she- I kid you not- walked over and grabbed a bagel half (And of all things, she grabbed the cinnamon one!) and took a huge bite before I could even get a word out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess...\"  I said, sadly looking at the remaining half of the bagel.  That was the last one, too!  Guess I'd settle for another sesame.  But...  \"Hey, Lil?\"  I asked tentatively.  I was usually pretty up-front, that is, I don't usually hesitate about what I'm gonna say, I just say it.  But this was a bit more sensitive- after all, Lily was kind of my best friend around here.  \"Do you, uh, remember last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily is pale.  When she blushes, it shows.  \"Um, I remember, getting in your bed.at some point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this was progress.  \"Yeah, but you had, um, said something.  And, uh... Stripped down to your underwear, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was now roughly the shade of a tomato.</span></div></div>",

Interesting, <i>very</i> interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to press her a little harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Lily, I get it.\" I said plainly from my seat on the couch, \"I mean, I went to an all girl's school <i>and</i> grew up with a little sister who gets scared by her own shadow. I'm not really all that unaccustomed to girls crawling into my bed at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Lily's hue had done little to die down with my statement, she was still clearly embarassed by her actions last night. She'd pulled a t-shirt over her bigness as a show of modesty\u2014no doubt forgetting that she'd thrown it off before crawling under my covers last night, \"S-Sorry again about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no big deal!\" I said, my tone sweeter than usual as I scooped out a big spoonful of cr\u00e8me cheese, \"I hardly noticed you were there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had learned two things in my life as a big bombastic bitch who was proud of her size. The first was that I was <i>not</i> the only person who got off on how friggin' fat I was. There were plenty of people\u2014men, women, and pervs on the internet\u2014who loved me for my size. The second was that anyone who squeezes your tummy like Lily had mine last night <i>had</i> to be a fat fetishist (thank you very much, Hannah Hammond.) My method wasn't sound, but with how Lily was acting last night, and how she was acting now, I had a new little theory to test...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I'm just glad there was enough <i>room</i> for you.\" I ramped up the sweetness in my voice as I started to suckle on the spoonful of cr\u00e8me cheese, \"You know, I know it's a King size, but I'm getting pretty <i>big</i> these days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI punctuated the word 'big' by taking the spoon out of my mouth\u2014licked clean, thank you!\u2014and bringing my hands down gently to jostle the bigness of my belly. I was barely dressed, with my gut splaying out and cut into two distinct rolls by gravity and my seated position. It wasn't a big shake or anything, just enough to give my belly a little bounce. Just enough to see if Lily was looking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I slept fine.\" Lily looked away, taking another munch from my (last friggin' cinnamon swirl!) bagel, \"I mean yeah, between the two of us it was pretty snug...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be silly, Lily.\" I spread my elephantine legs a little further apart so as to let my gut drape a little lower between them, allowing it to hang over the couch cushion as I caressed it with one hand, \"You know, I've been putting on a lot of weight lately. With me and Marie hanging out all the time, eating and eating and eating, I've probably put on another twenty pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't... you don't say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can't you tell?\" I forced my stomach outwards, increasing the swell of my dangling belly by a good margin. I continued to rub my rolls with my one good hand, going in soothing circular motions in ways that I'd seen all the greats do on their pay sites, \"My belly's getting so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, what are you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>round</i>...\" I'll admit that I was laying it on thick. I was probably at porn-star levels of believability now, but I'll also admit that all this fondling was actually starting to turn me on. Combined with any excuse to eat cr\u00e8me cheese straight from the economy-sized tubs that my Aunt Rhonda bought, I didn't see any reason <i>not</i> to continue, \"And <i>jiggly</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Enough!\" Lily finally exclaimed, her face beet red...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, that was certainly unexpected.  That came out of nowhere-  I guess in my narrow-mindedness it hadn't occurred to me that last night wasn't just a blatant act of sudden lust on Lily's end.  Maybe she was feeling me up in comparison to herself?  Maybe, just maybe, she was setting a goal?  That'd be pretty damn crazy, but... I mean, all I was trying to do was getting bigger- I guess it was possible I couldn't be the only girl on the planet who's trying to blimp up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, I certainly <i>had</i> noticed you were getting a bit bigger, girl, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was no time for me to finish because damn, if I thought Lily was red before, me saying she was getting bigger put her at the \"Severe\" shade of the Homeland Security scale.  She whipped around, suddenly busying herself in the kitchen with putting away the bagels I had gotten out (well, the bags that weren't empty, <i>dammit</i>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but, like... Way bigger.  Like, fat.\"  She muttered- I'm pretty sure it doesn't take a full minute to tie a twisty back on a bag of bagels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to go along with it.  \"Well, yeah, I didn't wanna be <i>rude</i> or anything, but yeah, you're getting pretty big, Lily.  I mean, you'll never be as big as me, but-\"  Again, I never get to finish my sentences around here, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get as big as you!\"  Lily cried out- woah.  \"Seriously, you don't think I can get to your size?  Look how much damn weight I've gained in the past few months alone!\"  She turned around and jiggled her belly at me with both her hands.  I couldn't argue with that, I guess.  She had gained a shitton of weight lately, but still- there's a different between getting fat and being <b>massive.</b>  I decided to try and take a gentler route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you're right about that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I'm right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Lily, let me finish a sentence!  Jeeeeeze.  Anyways, I'm just saying that... Look, I decided I wanted to be HUGE when I was like, a kid.  And it's taken me a long damn time to get to this size, and don't get me wrong, I love every fuckin' second of it, but...\"  I waited, to see if I could actually fuckin' finish a sentence.  Lily stared at me wide-eyed.  I continued.  \"But there are a lot of downsides.  I have to order pants online, and they're not cheap.  I can barely fit into seats, which, while being <i>hot as fuck</i>- is pretty fucking inconvenient.  All I'm saying is, this is fun for me, personally, because I accepted a long time ago that I was going to be as fat as I could be.  But you?  You were a twig when I met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily seemed to be permanently blushing by now, the only difference being the slight increase or decrease of the shade.  Currently, though, she just looked flustered, not aroused.  \"I guess you're right, but I mean, when we met, and when I realized what you liked, I just kinda said to myself 'different strokes', y'know?  But then I started gaining weight... And it's not like this is uncommon in people who are around you a lot.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to blush out of embarrassment.  It's true, Lily, Marie, and my aunt had all definitely bloated outwards in different ways since my arrival.  I nodded, feeling my chins bunch up into several folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the more I gained, the more I liked it- believe it or not, I wasn't exactly the most confident girl before your arrival.  But I felt comfortable around you, like, immediately.  And then you started making fun of me, and I... I, kinda, liked it?\"  I nodded again- I knew that feeling all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, I tease everyone about everything, I hope you didn't take it personally.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded again.  \"I know you well enough to know you weren't being mean.  But now... Mmm, now, I just- there's something about outgrowing all my clothes, feeling my belly wobble when I move, and last night I guess I just felt like seeing what you felt like compared to me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, no kidding- she was handsier than a Freshman at prom.  \"I noticed.\"  I nodded again.  \"But seriously, Lily, you gotta hear me out on this- there's a point that you're rapidly approaching where this stuff becomes a pretty damn big hassle- I wouldn't be able to make it around your campus, for instance.\"  This was the first time her face changed from intrigue to worry.  \"And look- I can't drive a car.  Well, at least, the few cars I've tried, anyways- the seats don't go back far enough, and if they do, I can't reach the pedals.  I can keep going-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lily shook her head.  She had a weird look on her face now, one that I couldn't quite make out.  Finally, she said...</span></div></div>",

I could practically see her doubt melt behind her eyes like an ice cream cone on a hot Summer day. Her brow furrowed slightly at the word \"big\", bolstering her newfound committal with a surge of bass in her voice. I was almost proud of my little chubster, in a way. But as I continued to watch, her lips curled into a smile. A wicked, devious, dreamy smile that I had seen stretching my own cheeks as I explored myself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it\u2014I wanna be HUGE.\" she said finally, her smile beaming as her hands (still placed firmly on her belly) began to knead her soft freckled flab, \"I want <i>all</i> that. Just... all of it. Too fat for campus, too fat to drive; I just... <i>mmm</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lily lost herself in what, to me, looked like some good old-fashioned belly play, I took a second to marvel at the monster that I had created. Just by merit of being around me. She wasn't joking; nobody who pulls and squeezes themselves like that could be joking. Those noises that she made as she finally let loose, finally gave into the urge to just break down and feel herself up, I recognized them as my own. I'll admit... it was pretty fucking awkward to be on the spectating end of such a confession. I just sort've sat there as Lily squeezed and groped, leaving hot red handprints on her gut as she undid her haphazard twist-tie on the bag of bagels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Gawd...</i>\" Lily bit into a bagel (that girl had a surprisingly big mouth!) \"It just feels so good to... mm... <i>say it</i>, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I know.\" I said with a wry raise of the eyebrows, \"As long as you're cool with knowing everything that's gonna go down once you're <i>my</i> size\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck your size.\" Lily cut me off (a-fucking-gain!) with a smack of her lips as she stuffed more bagel into her mouth, \"I wanna be bigger. <i>God</i> if I feel like this now imagine how I'll feel when I'm... when I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw her stare at me for a second, and I can only imagine that she took that time to imagine what she would look like if she were as fat as I was. Is it weird to admit that I did too? I mean, people do that, right? Imagine their friends fat? Anyway, I could totally see it. Lily'd have a lot more difficulty moving around at my weight than I did considering she was so friggin' short; and her tits would be just the biggest fucking things in the world. She'd have lost her neck long by then; her chins hanging down and brushing against those big titties of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, by then <i>I'd</i> be as big as a house. So Lily could get as fat as she fucking wanted, but <i>I'd</i> still be queen bee around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I told her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get as fat as you fuckin' want, Lil.\" I said with a shrug of my meaty shoulder as I grabbed the bag of bagels from her, \"But you've got a <i>lot</i> of catching up to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI punctuated my statement\u2014no, my <i>challenge</i>\u2014with a slap of my oceanic gut. It wobbled in place between my legs, rippling as far up as my chins and bingo wings as I smiled triumphantly to the lesser fatty. Somehow having Lily get fat, getting <i>so</i> fat anyway, provided me with a nice little anchor point for me. Anyone else would have looked at Lily's transformation since Summer and think \"damn, girl got BIG!\". But I was nearly twice the size of this cow, and still growing! Any time I needed to feel fat, like I wasn't gaining enough or if I just wasn't as big as I ought to have been, I could look at Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily watched my belly shake in what I imagine was envy. She bit her bottom lip and let out a low stream of air through her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel... please...\" she said weakly, \"Y-You're the fattest girl.. the fattest <i>person</i> I've ever met. Will you... will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute there, I saw the old Lily. The skinny little Lily that I bumped into my first day in my new home. The one who, in retrospect, just desperately needed a friend. Someone to nudge her into the right direction. How could I have possibly refused? That would have made me a big, fat hypocrite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...like, literally. A big fat hypocrite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just so long as you know what you're getting into...\" I trailed off, Lily's smile preemptively returning to us, \"I'll get you where you need to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!!\" Lily squealed as she tackled my fat ass, wrapping around my neck and pressing my face directly into her airbag titties, \"Oh you're the best, just the bes\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud cracking noise beneath us as Lily sent her weight on top of mine. I wasn't sure if it was the momentum, Lily's added weight (doubtful, considering Aunt Rhonda was getting pretty chunky these days), or a combination of the two, but the next thing the two of us knew, my fat ass was on the floor, with cr\u00e8me cheese spread all over my belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lesson one.\" I said proudly after the dust settled around us, wiping a finger across my sticky swollenness and suckling off its cr\u00e8me-y goodness, \"Reinforced furniture.\"</span></div></div>",

My Aunt could have told me just about anything so long as it meant that I could stay at home all day on our (now ruined) couch and keep up my ideal lifestyle. So when she said that I would be an over-the-internet teacher assistant, organizing lesson plans and grading papers and stuff, I was over the moon. Not only did that mean little to zero activity beyond moving my fat fingers across a keyboard, that also gave me a rare opportunity to showcase my ability to do menial tasks in exchange for money\u2014something that went far underrepresented as far as I was concerned. It was about damn time I started getting a paycheck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, the money wasn't <i>great</i>, but it was decent pay for the amount of work that I would be doing. Basically I'd get paid weekly, and it'd be performance based. My Aunt said (and she was very clear about this) that I could earn <i>up to</i> nine dollars an hour. Which basically meant \"don't half-ass this Mel, or I'll be super pissed at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I showed her\u2014I intended on going at this with my whole ass. That's right <i>all of my ass</i> was going into making sure that I was the best damn teaching assistant that I could be! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, the teacher that I would be assigned to worked in a <i>local</i> high school. I mean, how hard could it really be to keep everything organized? We had teachers like Ms. Walker at Buttercombe Academy, and she didn't do shit. I figured that she was just some overworked woman (or one who was in over her head!) and needed an extra hand. I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I honestly wished that I had a lot more information before my Aunt just went ahead and signed me up without even consulting me as to just <i>whom</i> I would have liked to be assisting. I guess that's the price you pay when you and your fatass friend break a couch, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still intended to keep my promise to Lily\u2014I'd help her get as big as she wanted, but at least this gave me something to do while she and Marie were at school so I didn't have to sit at my Aunt's place like a sad puppy. A big, fat puppy. Who wasn't so much sad as she was hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so my first day \"on the job\" (if you could really call it that) was via Skype. I was supposed to video-chat with the teacher that I had been assigned so that we could get some one on one time about her expectations in my assisting her. Which was totally fine\u2014all I had to do was pretty myself up from the tits up and throw on something that didn't look too casual, and I was ready to go.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, I was still almost completely naked from my waist (alright, my mid-tummy) down. I had thrown on a sweater that fit over my giant tits and put on some makeup, but other than that I was same-old Mel. No pants, fat hanging out everywhere, cereal bowl sitting on my belly. And now I could <i>be</i> that Mel <i>while</i> getting a paycheck for doing what most people considered housekeeping. So yeah, life was pretty sweet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I opened up my laptop and called my teacher (<i>promptly</i> at nine thirty, her only planning period btw!)

I idly glanced over at the kitchen, wondering how long it'd be before I could get my mid-morning snack on- normally, I wouldn't even have breakfast in my belly by now, but I had slammed down a metric ton of bacon and sausage and eggs beforehand- a hearty breakfast is the cornerstone of any successful day, or whatever.  But a snack sounded good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Carlyle, did I cut out for a second?  Oh, this whole webcam thing would be wonderful if it actually worked...\"  I snapped out of it and looked back at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, it did go quiet for a second- you were saying?\"  Focus, Mel.  Now is not the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well.  Maybe someday we'll get there, eh?  At any rate- I'm going to be sending you tests and quizzes primarily- I'll also send you answer sheets.  There may come a time- usually around mid-terms and finals- where I'll need some help grading essays.  In <i>those</i> instances I'll probably have another webcam session with you to go over what I need to see in those, but it's all pretty straightforward.  In fact, I was told that all teaching assistants should be sent some practice files, but that seems like a waste of both of our time-\"  Heyyy, I liked this lady already!  \"So I'm just going to send you some quizzes some my first period.  Look it over, mark up the wrong answers, total up the correct answers, and send them back by, oh, let's say noon.  I have plenty of faith in you- it's not exactly difficult work, it's just there's so much of it to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded happily, letting off another signature Carlyle smile.  \"Sounds right up my alley, Ms. Calliope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe said our quick goodbyes, and I immediately snapped my laptop shut and launched (read: struggled for about 20 seconds) out of the recliner that had become my temporary sitting location until our new couch arrived tomorrow.  I never liked recliners- they seem to naturally sense my weight and recline back no matter what I do, and if you think getting out of a recliner that's at a 45 degree angle is hard normally, try it when you're at a weight where most scales won't give you a readout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat video call went <i>very</i> well, I felt, and that deserved a reward.  A reward that I had been (kind of) saving- except in reality I had forgotten about it when it got jammed behind a bag of breakfast sausages.  Grinning, I pulled out my treat- a chocolate drizzled cheesecake- 8 thick slices on a platter that was easily 10\"- including <b>crumbled oreo crust!</b>  This, I felt, was accurate reparation for wasting a whole, what, 15 minutes of my morning on a video call?  Plus, I needed my energy for the upcoming day.  Suffice to say, I didn't use a plate.  Just plopped back down in the recliner, groaned unhappily as it staggered backwards, and began to absolutely <i>destroy</i> the cheesecake.  Twenty minutes later, an empty platter sat on the side table, and I was letting out these tiny little hiccup/burp hybrids that one tend's to get after eating over a pound of pure sugar in under a half hour.  However, my brief silent respite was interrupted by the feeling of a very hearty buzz against my thigh from my pocket.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PLEASE CHECK YOUR @TEMPRASCHOOLS ACCOUNT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the laptop from beside the chair and cracked it open, refreshing the email and seeing what I had to work with.  Pssh, only 14 quizzes to score?  And they were only 10 questions each- multiple choice?  Hello, easy street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI popped them open in the grading app- damn, this Tempra School program had it all- and began manually placing bright red X's against incorrect answers on each quiz.  It was pretty menial work, to be honest, and by the time I graded the last one and glanced at the clock, I saw it wasn't even 10:45 yet!  \"Pssh, Mel Carlyle, Teacher Assistant <i>l' extraordinaire</i>.\"  I briefly pictured that 9$ an hour paycheck going into my bank account- I think to celebrate, I'd try that new pizza place that had been aggressively sending us coupons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this program was easy as hell to use.  I saved the batch of quizzes, clicked the \"Graded\" button, and it automatically sent them back to Ms. Calliope.  Just to be safe (and prove how good of a damn assistant I was) I sent her a quick email saying I had wrapped up, and to make sure that the quizzes had sent through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I got up and heated up a frozen pizza.  Thinking about pizza made me want, well, pizza.</span></div></div>",

I was grading 9th grade English assignments, so even when I wasn't provided an answer key, it wasn't like I was struggling to find the correct answers. My whole job was basically to keep Ms. Calliope organized for all four classes; which, I'll have you know, was a skill I had been cultivating since my days as Ms. Nelson's TA back at Buttercombe Academy. I graded papers, sent them back on time, organized her lesson plans, read through her notes once in a while, all while laying lapaciously laying around the house in nothing but my pajamas and clearing out our fridge at home. For nine dollars an hour, I was stupid for not signing up for this program earlier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, my Aunt Rhonda was pretty pleased with me\u2014and with herself, I imagined. I mean, here I was, her niece who got kicked out of her sister's house for being such a colossal fatass that she broke a couch. Not only was she being the <i>best aunt ever</i> and letting said fatass live with her, she <i>also</i> turned me into a semi-functional member of society with a job and everything. She was so proud of me that she pretty much didn't mention the whole couch thing after I showed her what a good job I'd been doing. And whenever she was in the room, I made sure to look like I was hard at work, never letting her in on just how cushy my new job actually was. She eased off me soon enough, and things went right back to normal\u2014good old enabling Aunt Rhonda was back in the fold, ready to reward me for doing such a good job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she needed to. Y'know, because I was gettin' <i>paid</i> like you wouldn't believe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I mean... you'd probably believe it. It wasn't like, the best job in the world or anything, but to a girl who had literally never had a job before? That moolah may as well have made me Dolly Parton rich! And since my Aunt didn't bug me about setting up a saving's account, I was free to squander my wealth as I saw fit, <i>plus</i> my allowance, once it was returned to me. I slipped her forty bucks a week as \"rent\" (read: reembursment) but the rest was mine to keep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat at Mexican Pepper for the first time in months, draped in the favorites of all my new clothes. It was Summer once more, meaning that the unbearable Carolina heat had reared its ugly head again. I was dressed in a custom-ordered tank-top that let my wide wobbly arms hang free in the sunlight, and gave a generous view of my epic amounts of side-boob. I hadn't had something that covered me completely in so long, it felt almost weird to <i>not</i> have my belly roll hanging out over my shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had graduated to taking up an entire side of a booth by myself; the consequence of all my rich decadence since I'd taken up the burden of employment. I was somehow even less mobile. Now that I couldn't spend <i>all</i> my time out and about with Lily and Marie (more on them later!) I was practically permanently parked on my couch. My Aunt had been nice enough to give me a ride over to grab a bite so I could go out and be social on one of my first days off (<i>yus</i>, teacher work days...), but I was going to have to squeeze my fat ass into someone's back seat in order to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, while I was marvelling at how nice it was to finally get out of the house when it was, y'know, daylight, my visiting party Sfinally arrived.

Assumed, because I was currently deciding which three of the appetizers I could order in the \"Gordo Grande Appetizer Special\" (hint: the owners were definitely white).  Nachos were a given, of course.  Salsa came with the act of getting seated- I should know, I had already cleared out our bowl twice.  I decided my other two would be refried beans and ceviche- hadn't gotten seafood in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup?\"  I said casually while I flipped to the next page- Entrees, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not much...\"  Came the reply from the other end.  My dear friend Marie was here, that was nice.  Hadn't seen her in a while, of course- my job was keeping me \"busy\"- I had spoken to Lily here and there, but other than that, I had been a bit of a introvert while I got used to my new schedule.  I briefly glanced over the menu before deciding on just getting the Carne Asada/Chicken Taco party platter, which proudly boasted to feed six people- I guess we would find out if it could feed just one obese girl who already had a few rounds of appetizers in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quietly flipped down my lamented menu and gave Marie the once-over.  She was looking... Well, not like the Marie I had met.  At all.  I had know a few skinny, meek girls in my day (Hell, I was related to one!) but girl had really taken an opportunity to change and <b>RAN</b> with it.  She was definitely looking more... Well, normal!  She was no longer a twig, but sported a chubby figure- but rest assured, she was the type that took the weight well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, well, at least at Buttercombe, you'd get these stick thin girls, much like Marie, and when they'd gain weight, well- You ever see a girl who's hips look like they're thrice as wide as her torso?  Or a girl with gigantic, billowing belly that overwhelms her, while she still has the slim, pointed face of a supermodel?  Point being, Marie could've told me she had been \"kinda chubby\" her whole life and I would've bought it.  She had a tummy, sure- but she dressed for it, with a pair of casual jeans (courtesy of Lily, I was certain), thicker thighs, average boobs- you know, just your everyday chubby girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flopped her menu down on the table and grinned at me.  \"Pork belly tacos would be the greatest right now.  I <i>may</i> have to get a double order...\"  Just then, our server stopped by- she started with me first, and by the time she had finished jotting everything down, I guess she assumed I was ordering for the two of us- because she walked away.  Imagine her surprise when she came back with a spare water for Marie, and Marie immediately demanded a double order of tacos!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both shared a giggle about this, then got down to business.  \"I'm honestly kind of surprised that you texted me- it seems like Lily made plans for the two of us nine times out of ten.\"  Lily gave me a weird look, the kind you give a kid before you tell them the dog got put down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?  Did I say something wrong?\"  I asked, curious about the sudden mood change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing, I-  Oh, sweet!\"  <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">My</span> Our appetizers arrived, and before I could even say anything Marie was chowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, appetizers don't last forever, and so by the time I had gotten my second wind, I decided I wasn't in the mood for puzzle solving- I needed to know what was up.  \"So, Marie- why <i>did</i> you suddenly decide to text me?  I mean, granted, I haven't seen you in a while, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not it.\"  And all of a sudden, I saw the old Marie- the quiet, awkward, uncomfortable Marie.  I reached a chubby hand out and grabbed hers.  \"Seriously, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at me and gave a tiny smile, which reassured me.  Finally, she said, \"Hey, so, not trying to put you on the spot or whatever, but-\"</span></div></div>",

For someone as big as I was and as greedy as my gut got? \"Out of control\" to Marie might have very well been \"Sudden craving for cake\" for me. But I could tell by the way that Marie was looking at me that she was serious\u2014whatever Lily was doing that had made her so upset was at least worth a little investigation, if only to make that sad little look on her face go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, like...\" I did my best to <i>say</i> this without sounding like I wasn't concerned, but I have my reservations as to whether or not Marie bought it, \"<i>How</i> is she out of control? What, is she eating a lot more or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, please, you and Lily only <i>do</i> 'a lot'.\" Marie said with a puff of exasperated air, \"I mean... yeah, she <i>is</i> eating a lot more, but that's not really the issue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I delved a little deeper; my journey into the weeks past catered by the good people at Mexican Pepper. While Marie talked, I ate. And while I listened, I ate. And while I steadily grew more and more upset, I ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently my little talk with Lily many moons ago had been... effective, to say the least. I didn't tell Marie about my part in any of this, of course, and I wasn't <i>entirely</i> sure that I had anything to do with it, really. But I heard Marie's tale of Lily's frequent absenteeism in their (and probably all of her) classes. From what Marie gathered (read: probably indulged in a few times) Lily had taken up my nasty habit of shirking responsibilities in favor of the immediate gratification of food. Furthermore her grades had (expectedly) been slipping; what's more, she was talking to <i>everyone</i> less and less, not just me and Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I asked her about what her schedule was for next semester, right?\" Marie said as she dipped a chip in queso, \"And she tells me that she's transferring to this online school\u2014I'm really worried about her, Mel! She's not going to class, she's switching to a different school, she's not <i>talking to me</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" I nodded, my chins flexing as I pieced together the puzzle in my head\u2014had I really been so busy with my new job that <i>all</i> of this had managed to slip by me?\u2014\"So... what do you think we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know, that's the thing!\" Marie said, snapping her chip between her teeth, \"I really feel like we should go talk to her. Do you think she's avoiding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" I paused, deciding to keep my conversation with Lily a secret for fear of any blame for her strange new behavior shifting towards me, \"Maybe? I don't know. Lily's... a weird chick sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but think that my little discussion with Lily the night we broke my aunt's couch must have had something to do with all of this. She seemed pretty serious about getting fatter\u2014and staying at home all day, skipping classes, and transferring to an easier way to do both of those things definitely sounded like things that I would do if I were a college girl trying my hardest to plump up. I paused, pushed my empty plates forward, and told Marie...</span></div></div>",

I assured Marie that I'd go and talk to Lily- fun is fun and all but I kinda felt she was jumping the shark here- dropping her classes, falling off the map socially?  There's laziness- hell, I'd like to think I'm the epitome of it- and then there's just bad decisions.  This definitely sounded like it was going into the latter category.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of bad decisions- I was starting to wonder if not grabbing the handicap seat when I had the chance was a mistake.  Embarrassingly enough (not to mention, you know, super <b>awesome</b>)  I was hitting a point where taking up two seats on the bus was a necessity- so I was definitely getting a <i>lot</i> of angry glares from the folks who had to stand because my ass was easily taking up half of the seat next to me, rendering it unusable by someone who didn't have a waist size of, like, negative 2.  Whoops.  I made a mental note to either not take the bus at the busiest time, or just grab the handicap seat and hope no-one in a wheelchair got on.  Eventually the bus screeched to a stop in front of the apartment complex that Lily lived in, so heavily hefted my girth out of the seat and squeezed past several people- pushing them hard into seated bus riders and hand rails, even when awkwardly shuffling sideways down the aisle.  I briefly thought about just getting an Uber driver whenever I needed to go somewhere- but the idea of crawling into a compact and making the rear bumper drag against the ground made me both shiver with delight and blush with embarrassment.  I'd have to figure something out eventually, but for right now I guess people on the bus would just have to deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily lived in a tiny studio apartment that was reserved for college students- I think there was like, 30 units crammed into a 4 story building- and of course, Lily lived all the way on the <i>second</i> floor.  I steeled myself, grabbed firmly onto the handrail (fuck you for not having an elevator, fuck you fuck you fuck you) I thought angrily as I clambered up the stairs, overly aware that my face was now bright red.  I ambled slowly down the hall, angry that I had to tackle the stairs and knocked probably a bit too hard on Lily's door- good ol' room 25.  But the girl who answered was decidedly NOT Lily- she was a lithe Asian girl who looked very angry that someone had banged on her door.  \"Can I, like, help you?\"  She asked in a tone that I did not appreciate one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah- I'm looking for Lily- she lives here?\"  I said, trying to sound snarky but probably failing due to being red-faced and panting from all my physical exertion in the past 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not anymore- she asked if we could swap rooms like, last week- she lives in 12 now, downstairs.  She gave me 100 bucks to swap with her.\"  Ugh.  Figures.  I was really looking forward to sitting down and having a soda or five.  \"Anything else you want, or can I go back to studying?\"  The annoyed girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeeze, what a bitch.  I bit my tongue though, said thanks, and slowly shuffled down the stairs.  Lily must have really gone all in on this weight gain thing if she had swapped rooms with a girl.  One would assume she had signed some sort of agreement regarding her room, but whatever.  Finally, I banged on 12, now thoroughly pissed off at how much wasted effort I had put into getting to Lily.  There was a muffled groan from inside the apartment, but no response.  I banged on the door again and heard a louder noise- it sounded suspiciously like a belch.  Now fully annoyed, I decided to try the door- thankfully, it was unlocked.  I threw the door open and heard the tell-tale sound of wrappers crinkling as they shifted out of the way.  I stepped inside to what could easily be described as a pig-sty, and something that would definitely give my mom a heart attack.  I mean, there was a LOT of trash.  Like, six or seven pizza boxes stacked up next to a trash can that was filled up with wrappers- I spotted several fast food bags, bags of chips, boxes of cookies- all stuff I would have loved to get my hands on, you know, to recover my stamina.  The counter, too, was covered in various wrappers, empty bottles of soda, even some cans of beer- naughty, naughty, I found myself thinking.  Wondering how Lily got her hands on beer, I scanned the small living area, and realized Lily was probably in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bedroom was in a better shape- but only barely.  A large mass was covered by blankets, and small hiccups emanated from underneath.  \"Hey, Lils.\"  I said flatly- I was pretty annoyed by now.  I had texted her when I left the mall, and she hadn't responded, so I was unsure if she expected me or not, but all I got in response was a groan.  I waddled over and flopped down on the corner of the bed, which creaked loudly and angrily in a way that reminded me alarmingly of the noise my couch made when we broke it, but it held.  \"Hey, wake up- I wanna talk to... You.\"  I had grabbed the blanket and ripped it off, only to expose a very naked Lily underneath.  \"Jeeze!\"  I shouted, and threw the blanket awkwardly back onto her.  \"Get dressed!\"  I stood up, and Lily let out a sleepy belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer not my mom, y'know...\"  She said grumpily, and didn't shift one bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm your guest, and we need to talk.  <b>Now.</b>\"  I wasn't going to sugercoat this, because that was never my strong suite.  She let out a sigh, so I poked her in the belly, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"  She yelped, and kicked her feet at me in a half-assed attempt at retribution.  \"Fine, fuckin' hell.  Gimme a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed myself off her bed- luckily, it sat at a perfect height so I didn't have to struggle, and made my way into her kitchen.  I cracked open the fridge as I heard her rustle around in her room, and found just what I needed- a half empty two liter of Sprite.  I screwed off the cap and guzzled it down, barely stopping between gulps- I was parched and annoyed, and needed some sugar to get my spirits back up.  I heard the door creak open to her room, as the last few drops of the soda slid down my throat.  I popped the bottle out of my mouth and let out a satisfied belch, which earned me an upset glare from Lily.  \"That was the last of my soda, y'know.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her a look over, and before I could help it, I said, \"Doesn't seem like you need it!\"  She had crammed herself into a tank top, which- while technically covering her tits, it let her quivering gut hang free, which was laced with several stretch marks, and looked much, <i>much</i> larger than the last time I had seen her, a few weeks ago.  Her chest had obviously expanded as well, and each breast hung slightly to the side of her stretched belly.  I could barely see the leg of the stretchy shorts she had squeezed herself into, which gave her a muffin top of epic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I do- and I don't appreciate you drinking the last of it.  Want some pizza?\"  She asked, and whipped out her phone.  Before I could even say yes, she had put it away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I guess not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily gave me a look.  \"You can just text your orders, now.  I got a double of what I usually get, along with <i>extra</i> soda, but you owe me.\"  She slowly ambled over to the couch, cleared off an empty bag of chips, and collapsed heavily onto it.  She took up enough space that I knew I wouldn't be able to fit on it with her, so I sat on the loveseat- noting, with some satisfaction, that my hips brushed both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well you owe me an explanation- and you owe Marie an apology.  The poor girl's been worried sick about you- what's this about you switching schools?\"  Lily rolled her eyes, but I could tell I had caught her off guard with the Marie comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't switch schools- if I did, I couldn't live here anymore.  I just switched to online courses.  And... Well, yeah, I guess I haven't been checking my phone a lot, lately...\"  I smirked as I looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too busy eating?\"  I said cheekily, grabbing a bag of pretzels from the side of the loveseat- empty, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, her chins folding into thirds.  \"Well, yeah.  I wasn't kidding around, Mel.  I wanna be... <i>big.</i>\"  She blushed, and I began to realize I may have created a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to be understanding, but firm.  \"Yeah, Lily, I understand that, obviously- but this is kind of ridiculous.  Even at my size, I still do... Stuff, besides eat.  Not a lot of stuff, but I'm social, I have a job, you know... That kinda stuff.  As appealing as it sounds, you can't spend all your time eating- you need to spice it up once in a while.\"  I knew I was bullshitting her- I really did spend about 95% of my waking hours either eating or recovering from eating so I could eat more, but still.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lily saw right through me.  \"Why the hell can't I?  I get money from my parents, my college is paid for- what's stopping me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gestured around the room.  \"Seriously?  This place is a fucking disaster!  You gotta take out the trash sometime, you know?  And seriously, you really hurt Marie's feelings...\"  I decided that guilt was the only way I'd get a better response out of her.  She stared at the ground for a bit.  \"Yeah, well...\"</span></div></div>",

'n shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so it wasn't exactly what I was aiming for, but it was good enough. Even Lily just realizing that she had been acting like a crazy person (read: exactly how I wanted to act, all the time) and worrying the shit out of everyone was good enough for me. But I had to admit, it would be nice to get to see my little ginger binger a little more often. The only faces I had seen for the past few weeks in any regularity were Ms. Calliope and my aunt's. Having someone that actually shared my interests in being absolutely useless and as lazy as possible sounded pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And about being a productive member of society?\" I crossed my arms over the top of my titty-tastic tonnage, my eyebrows raised in a very mom-ish fashion, much to Lily's chagrin, \"Doing more than just laying around and stuffing your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>UUUUGH</i>.\" Lily threw herself horizontally on the couch, her bigger body bouncing wildly at the sudden impact, \"You <i>suuuuck</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Lilyyyy</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair!\" Lily relented belaboredly, \"You got to spend, like, all <i>Summer</i> laying around being fat and useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid on the couch, all sprawled out like a cat, as her flab jiggled and jostled every which way. My little Lily was turning into quite the plumper; she was already average-everyday-American fat. With our shared fervor for weight gain, this wasn't exactly surprising, but it still always shocked me when I saw just how <i>big</i> she was getting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the worst.\" Lily pouted, \"Makin' me get up and... and and do shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for your own good, fatty.\" I laughed, making my belly quiver, pressed between my crowded thighs, \"Even <i>I</i> go out and socialize... sometimes. It's where I get all my stares and funny looks in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... call me fatty again.\" Lily said with a (semi-)playful purr as she stroked her belly, \"I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so that was one fire put out. It wasn't long before I had re-integrated Lily back into society and she and Marie made nice-nice. Marie did her best, but couldn't quite talk her out of switching to an all-online class schedule; honestly, I didn't blame her. Lily wanted to be bigger than <i>me</i>, and at <i>her</i> height, that meant that she was going to lose a <i>lot</i> of mobility. Quickly. I was in no position to judge her, considering that I had pretty much become fused to my Aunt's couch after it got repaired. In fact, I was all for Lily laying around as much as possible. Again, it'd have been hypocritical if I didn't! So long as she was actually making sure to come out into the sun and make friends with my fat ass, I was all for her being as lazy as she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, I mean, I guess things just sort've went back to normal. Marie went to classes, I still had my job, and Lily... did Lily shit. Now that she didn't have to actually go to classes, Lily was pretty much free to spend all day laying around in underwear that she was rapidly outgrowing. I saw her a lot more, which was fun, but I couldn't partake in her fat-girl shenanigans as much as she (or I!) would have liked to now that I had a job. <i>Responsibilities</i> and shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also my own fat girl shenanigans to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so things were all fine and dandy...</span></div></div>",

More like 50 minutes later, which nicely rounded out to 2:15.  I was on fire!  That meant... Hmm, what did that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI huffed and puffed off the couch (the new one had finally arrived- oh, how wide the delivery guy's eyes had gone when I threw myself on the new plated-steel framed sofa!)  and it was definitely... \"cushier\" than our old one.  I think it was pretty low to the ground, and the frame definitely didn't have a lot of give, but the cushions were beyond puffy.  Which meant it was harder to heft my bulk out, but easier to get to my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waddled over to the couch, slightly proud and slightly alarmed that I was out of breath and coated with a fine misting of sweat from a 10 foot walk, if that.  I mean, it was hot, but it also kinda sucked- I didn't want to think about what would happen when I couldn't get my own food by my own hand- with how much I ate, I'd need to hire at <i>least</i> two helpers.  Still, the idea wasn't without merit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw open the fridge and scowled.  Granted, I wasn't the one who went grocery shopping (hardy har har <b>har</b>, I wouldn't make it... Well, ten feet) but we were still running low.  Lately, I had been giving Rhonda a list that was two pages long and around a hundred bucks, and then working through the bounty by the end of the week.  But, um... It was Wednesday.  And the only thing in the fridge was a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a gallon of juice.  \"Shit!\"  I yelled in frustration as I grabbed the juice.  I staggered back to the couch and popped off the lid, swigging down a solid third of the bottle while I pondered my options.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza was fine, but repetitive.  I had it yesterday, twice- one frozen, one fresh.  A sandwich or three would be nice, but the nearest place, Tito's would probably take at least 45 minutes, and I needed that shit A.S.A.P..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flipped through the nearby places on an app on my phone, when suddenly, the incoming call icon came on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Incoming call from:  Mother</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, shit.  I felt myself tense up unwillingly at the sight of that name.  Why was she calling?  Honestly, I hadn't talked to her in... A long ass time.  My dad had shot me a few emails, mainly asking how I was, and I had answered honestly and briefly- things were fine, I was fine, I had a job, blah blah blah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly thought about ignoring it, but realized that would probably make things worse.  With a slightly shaking hand, I thumbed over the \"Accept\" button and raised the phone to my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H- hello?\"  I asked, timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was immediate and the same I remembered it sounding- judging and belittling and frustrating and a million other negative emotions... But there was almost something more to it, I thought.  Or was I just imagining things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Melanie.\"  And then silence.  I began to panic- was Alice okay?  Did they get a divorce?  Did the house burn down?  <i>Why was she calling?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the phone for a second, and then tried to play it cool.  \"Um, what's u-\" I caught myself.  Mother <i>hated</i> the term \"What's up\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are thing's going at home?\"  I managed to blurt out, hopefully sounding calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sigh on the other end.  I waited it out- I vaguely recalled hearing or reading somewhere that speaking first in a period of importance was often a sign of weakness- and if there was ever a \"period of importance\", it was pretty much... Well, every time I talked to my mother.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d been living with my Aunt Rhonda for more than a year now; I\u2019d been devoting time <i>strictly</i> to coming up with awesome one-liners and fat-positive taunts that would stuff a potato in Mom\u2019s tailpipe. Mom finally calls me after not even speaking to me for more than three hundred and sixty five days, not even sending me a damn Christmas present, and she had to go and say <i>that</i>. Just\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, y\u2019know? It really took the wind out of my sails to hear her finally admit that she missed my adorable ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026uh...\u201d I was in uncharted territory here; Moth\u2014er, <i>Mom</i> and I had never exactly been the closest of Carlyles, \u201cI miss you too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since I had been a little girl, my <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Mother</span><i>Mom</i> and I had been at each other\u2019s throats. Not always because of my weight either (that didn\u2019t start until I started to pork up at Buttercombe!), but for really stupid shit. What clothes I was going to wear, who I was or wasn\u2019t going to hang out with, and even what I wanted for dinner eventually evolved into what clothes I should have been able to fit into but couldn\u2019t, why I spent all my time eating instead of having a bustling social life, and what I <i>wouldn\u2019t</i> be having for dinner as my weight got more and more \u201cout of hand\u201d (pff, whatever that meant). Even now that I was nineteen going on twenty, hearing my Mom actually admit to missing me was\u2026 weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 your Aunt Rhonda tells me that you two got a new couch.\u201d My mother said flatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cringed in anticipation of a high-volume tirade, but no such rant came. She was actually going to <i>dialogue</i> with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 yeah.\u201d I stammered, \u201cS\u2019a\u2026 It\u2019s really comfy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slumped further down into said couch. It really was comfortable, not that Mom cared. It didn\u2019t creak or groan underneath all my big blubbery self, so it had to have been specially reinforced\u2014a smart move on Aunt Rhonda\u2019s part. I awkwardly drummed my belly with my plump fingers, sending ripples across its surface as I watched, mesmerized by the motions. I had never so badly wanted to eat comfort food in my entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind if I ask what happened to the <i>old</i> one?\u201d there was a small release of air on the other end of the line that I, at first, mistook for a sigh. But then I heard the distinct movement of her vocal chords behind it; a very human sounding emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she\u2026 had she just <i>joked</i> with me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kind\u2019ve\u2026 broke it.\u201d I said sheepishly, \u201cWell, me and my friend did. It\u2019s a long story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d My mother\u2019s tone was surprisingly light, considering that I had just told her that me and my massiveness were at least in part for the decimation of my Aunt\u2019s couch, \u201cWell it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have a history of destroying furniture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that snide remark, my chest immediately puffed up. My indifferent expression immediately turned into a pudgy scowl as I frowned into the receiver, ready to unleash a year\u2019s worth of pent-up aggression towards her for kicking me out. But she managed to cut me off. Bitch rage-blocked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean it like that\u2026\u201d she said in a sad(?) tone, sounding oddly human for the first time in ever, \u201cI\u2026 I was just teasing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I snarled, \u201cLook Mom, thanks for calling, but I\u2019ve really\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Rhonda says you have a job now!\u201d she blurted out, making me halt my abrupt hanging up, \u201cA-And that you\u2026 you\u2019re doing a really good job at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I said a little more softly, putting my ear back to the reciever, \u201cWhat of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well it\u2019s just\u2026 you know\u2026\u201d I didn\u2019t, and I made sure to emphasize that with a pause, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, <i>that</i> one took me by surprise. The last time I\u2019d heard that sentence from her was at Patrick\u2019s the day before she kicked me out, telling me how \u201cproud\u201d she was of her pig of a daughter for finishing off three chili cheese burgers, two corndogs, an order of onion rings, and a side of macaroni and cheese. In fact, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d <i>ever</i> heard that come out of her mouth without sarcasm\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2026 Thank you!\u201d I said a little too eagerly, \u201cI, uh\u2026 I learned all my work ethic from Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another laugh on the other end of the line (seriously, who <i>was</i> this woman?!) at that. It sounded\u2026 sadder, somehow. Then there was a sniffle, something that I really hadn\u2019t expected coming from an emotionless robot like my Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, I just wanted to let you know that I\u2019m not mad at you anymore.\u201d I could hear her voice cracking on the other end of the line, \u201cA-And that\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I kicked you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>And</i> made me feel bad about my weight?\u201d I fished before I even realized I had baited the hook, making me widen my eyes in shock. I didn\u2019t <i>want</i> to sound like an ungrateful bitch, after all. This was the first sincere\u2026 anything from my mother I\u2019d gotten in ever! I really didn\u2019t want to screw it up\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am.

I shouldn\u2019t have kicked you out; i-it\u2019s just\u2026 you make me so frustrated sometimes, a-and\u2014!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d I said with a smile, starting to get a little choked up myself, \u201cI can be a little hard to live with. Especially when I\u2019m breaking couches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, <i>I\u2019m</i> at fault here, not you.\u201d My mother sniffled, \u201cI realize that now.

Okay, woah, woah.  Hold your ground, Carlyle.  Let's ease off the throttle just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, look.  I moved out because of my mother- all those years of snide remarks that evolved into cruel comments that evolved into knock-down, drag-out shouting matches?  Literally <i>all</i> my mom's fault.  Hell, some psychologist would probably say my unending quest to become a blob was pretty much entirely <i>because</i> of my mom's attitude towards me growing up (and outwards).  Still, I needed to calm down, find my Chi (thanks, Ms. Calliope, all those essays on Chinese culture... Sheesh), whatever.  Even though our phone call went well, and ended well, I still found myself so stressed last night that I had devoured, well... let's say one doesn't go through an entire bottle of ranch without a LOT of chicken wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, this morning, I had been so worked up about meeting with my mother at the local mall, that I had to calm my nerves with two boxes of chocolate chip waffles, a box of chocolate chip frosted pastries, and... Chocolate chip ice cream.  With chocolate on it.  And then, the bus ride had just, like, SUCKED, so naturally I had gotten a <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">malt</span> two malts.  In fact, I was just finishing the final bit of the banana-peanut butter one when I heard her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately whipped around and saw- well, my mom.  Same as always.

No need to drudge up bad emotions until I knew they needed drudging.  Or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mom.\"  I said flatly, still unsure what was going to happen- but what did happen, is she wrapped her arms around me- well, as best she could.  As far as I could figure, the tips of her fingers barely angled around my back, and her bony arms sunk into my sides like mushing into a gigantic marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awkwardly hugged her back, taking care not to smother her with my hefty arms, which probably would force her so far in between my boobs that we'd need help getting her out, and <i>that</i> would probably dampen the mood a bit.  Finally, we released, and as she pulled back, I saw that her eyes were shimmering ever so slightly with tears.  \"I, uh, missed you.\"  I said awkwardly- but I could tell I was on the cusp of tearing up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother, ever the stoic one, turned around and did one of those subtle wipes at her eyes, the kind people do when they're trying to be sneaky about wiping away tears.  \"I missed you as well, Melanie.

What exactly happened between my mom and Rhonda?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, there's a pretty good mexican place-\"  But she was already walking towards it- an easy enough site seeing as it was about 8 feet away from us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, let's get a table!\"  Well, so far so good.

And she just\u2026 paid for it! Whipped out her debit card, handed it to the pimply teen behind the register, even got me a super-sized soda to wash it all down with! When she saw me huffing and puffing as I struggled to stand, instead of rolling her eyes and body-shaming me under her breath, she just told me to go sit down and that she would bring it all to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird</i> right? I mean, I\u2019ve said a lot about my mother. Caring and nurturing, even <i>motherly</i> isn\u2019t a word that I would use to describe her usual treatment of me. But the Jan Carlyle that I saw that day was a noteworthy exception to the yelling, screaming, obeseophobic bitch that had been picking fights with me since I was old enough to talk. And when she came back to the table, armed with my smorgasbord? She just put it all down, smiling that same weird \u201cI missed you\u201d and divvied it up accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s my sister?\u201d my Mother asked with a hopeful smile, sliding a foil-wrapped burrito across the table to me, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since I came to town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026\u201d I mentally compared the Aunt Rhonda that I had known before my arrival and the bootilicious lady lawyer that waddled around the apartment currently, and decided that her weight was going to have to be a topic for another day. \u201cGood. Rhonda\u2019s doing good. How\u2019s mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw a similar expression flash across my Mother\u2019s face as her practiced poise faltered, skipping a beat as she took her own meager portion of the meal for herself and freezing where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s...certainly healthy.\u201d My Mother said after her pause, \u201cJust came back from her first year at Buttercombe\u2014following, uh\u2026 in your footsteps, I suppose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did my best not to smirk. Going by what I knew about Mom and what I knew about Buttercombe Academy, no doubt that was code for \u201cAlice came home about fifty pounds heavier than when she left\u2014and I don\u2019t have anyone to blame it on since you\u2019re gone.\u201d But I kept that thought deep down inside; no use in poking the bear when she was obviously making a big effort not to chase me off. I decided to just eat my burritos and let it slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we just sort\u2019ve\u2026 talked for a while. I mean, actually talking. Like, my food wasn\u2019t getting <i>cold</i> or anything, but I had a lot to tell her. About Lily, about Marie, about Aunt Rhonda (<i>besides</i> her substantial weight gain, of course\u2026) and about my new job. I was wise enough to omit the part about the whole \u201ctook me almost a year to get a job\u201d thing, but other than that I was mostly straight up with my Mom for the first time in years. And surprisingly, she was pretty cool with almost everything I told her. I even made the casual mention that I was up more than a hundred pounds than I was when I left, and she just let it pass by coolly, not even one of those psychotic little twitches in her eye to be seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof! M\u2019stuffed!\u201d I lied, patting my still pretty swollen stomach with one hand proudly, \u201cThanks a lot for lunch Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was nice, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she said with a soft smile, \u201cA-And you\u2019re sure you got your fill, Melanie? If you\u2019re hungry, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, stop.\u201d I cut her off, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try and bribe me with food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not <i>bribing</i> you with food, Melanie.\u201d My mom said a little crossly, making my colossal ass cheeks clench slightly, before she softened \u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 I want to make sure you\u2019re okay. All this time away from you, not seeing you, not <i>hearing</i> from you because we\u2014<i>I\u2019m</i> so stubborn, it\u2026 I worry about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird</i> right? I had spent so long away from my Mom that I guess I sort\u2019ve built her up in my head as this evil dietary overlord. The only times I really got to see her during my high school years were on Winter and Summer breaks, and we were always fighting\u2026 I never really got to see this side of my Mom. Like, at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she\u2026 had she <i>always</i> worried this much about me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeeeelll\u2026 when you put it <i>that</i> way\u2026\u201d I smiled, rubbing my belly, \u201cI guess I <i>could</i> go for a cookie or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeanut butter?\u201d my Mom asked with a knowing smile, \u201cTwo cookies, coming up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, hey, I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ve got it Mom.\u201d I said, scooching backwards in my seats and scraping the legs against the linoleum floor loudly, \u201cYou want one? I don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Melanie, no.\u201d my Mother cooed (?!), \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask you to spend\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s my treat Mom.\u201d I said, holding out my hands so she could come help me up, \u201cConsider it my way of saying\u2026 y\u2019know\u2026 thanks for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, I dished out like 2 bucks for our cookies.  Pretty good way to end the day, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong.  My Mother continued deeper into the mall, and I followed along diligently, half of me not believing that this was real, thinking that this was some sort of fever dream brought on by some sudden psychotic break- and the other half of me thinking, \"Hey, if my Mom is seriously talking to me like a living human being for the first time in years, I can't just ignore it\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, despite my aching legs, carrying hundreds of pounds of wobbly, <i>heavy</i> fat, shouting mental warnings of \"Yo, lard-ass, we shouldn't be up and moving like this\", I carried on, quiet and collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like Alice was on the \"gain-train\", as it were.  It also sounded like, at some point, Rhonda had essentially told her sister to chill out.  So I was actually experiencing what I assumed most girls got to, well, actually enjoy- being at the mall with my Mom.  So we walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while I was initially bracing for the inevitable \"Oh, Mel, you seem so... Tired...\" Since I was sweating like I had just run a 25K sprint, it didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while I waited for the off-hand comment of \"Oh, Mel, this is a cute dress... Not that it would, <i>ahem</i>, fit you...\"  It didn't happen- in fact, almost psychically, my mother asked if I'd like a triple-mocha frappe from the weird coffee chain when we passed by it- and of course, I said yes, and with a speed I didn't think was possible past the age of 20, my <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Mother</span> Mom was in the line, ordering it for me, and paying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was something that could have broken anyone out of any trance- Hell, a man dying of thirst would've ignored a bottle of water for what both me and my <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">mother</span> Mom saw when I heard my name called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\"  Went the voice- and there was a split-second, while I sipped on my \"Frappe\", and my head/neck lead my gut by a solid 3 seconds- where I thought some random stranger was calling out.  I surely didn't recognize the voice.  But when my eyes locked with theirs, I knew who it was immediately.  And part of me panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lily- guess she had taken one of her rare excursions out of her apartment, her den of laziness, as it were, to go to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing is, she was crammed into something that wouldn't have worked for her rapidly fattening body back when I visited- and that was weeks ago!  Now... Well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut hung out of a hoodie that- if my calculations were correct, based off how under-sized hoodies had worked for me in the past- should've been trashed 25 pounds ago, and that was if you were feeling generous.  As for her shape, now?  Well... Let's say there was more out in the air than there was covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tits had swelled, that was for sure- even with the small V-line of the hoodie zipped up (or what could be zipped, anyways) there was still a canyon of flesh oozing out that even made my massive mammaries look slightly smaller than what she was rocking.  In fact, if some \"regular\" guy (or girl, I guess) was looking at her from the chest up, they may be too hypnotized to even notice the egregious amount of fat that existed below them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I didn't miss it.  Her hips had swelled out in a way that necessitated stretch pants that couldn't be bought in any sort of store- which meant they smacked against passerby who thought maybe, <i>just maybe,</i> they could slip past the blob that was my best friend without slamming into her.  But they were still brushed against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey!\"  I yelled somewhat awkwardly.  My Mom turned around as well, and I braced myself.  At least I had made a decent attempt to not look like a slob.  Lily looked like she had woken up 100 pounds fatter, and hadn't noticed yet.  This was gonna be rough.  Lily tottered up to me in a way that made her look like she had just learned to walk, but in truth probably just displayed how little she had walked since she had delved deeply into the gaining lifestyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed and puffed with exhaustion as she arrived before me and my bewildered mother.  \"Do you... Mind helping... Me?\"  She asked, and I felt myself tense up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Lil, now isn't the <i>best</i> time, I mean, I...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut me off immediately, using her brief rest from physical movement as an opportunity to dive head-first into her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just need some help...  With...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean she had actually <i>walked</i> up to me, so I guess that was a start.

I wish that I could say that Mel's told me a lot about you, buuuut...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that.\" I said sheepishly, \"Y'see, Lily's kinda my best friend here.\" I said that hoping that she wouldn't do anything gross (read: anything that I would totally have done if we weren't in front of my Mom) like burp or feel herself up, and she didn't disappoint, so I continued, \"She goes to college in the area and\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, whatever.\" Lily puffed, \"Mel, are you and you Mom gonna eat any time soon? I'm <i>starving</i>. I came to see if they had any stretchpants that would fit me but all this <i>food</i> around me it's just... <i>mmm!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as Lily started to rub her belly, squishing her doughy hands into the oozing freckled flab that hung out of her hoodie with an abject horror. Not at the sight, of course, but at  my mother's percieved response to such flagrant lack of shame about her weight. That being said, even <i>I</i> usually waited until at least <i>after</i> I'd seriously met someone to give them the impression that I was more in love with my body than what they thought of me.

What are you hungry for?\"  Um, that seemed to be a silly question, I'm sure the real one would be what WASN'T she hungry for.  But it seemed Lily already had the events planned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would absolutely love some chicken right now.  Y'know, fried variant?  Probably with potatoes, and rolls, and some mac and cheese, and-\"  I shot her a look so glaring harsh that I was almost positive her hair rippled.  \"I mean, Chicken Hut would be fine, if you don't mind joining me.\"  Good to know Lily still knew how to talk like a damn human being, despite her earlier <i>public display of self-love,</i> as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Lily, lead the way!\"  My Mom said cheerily.  I balked, and she obviously caught my face, because she added- \"I'd love to get to know my daughter's apparent best friend...\"  I decided to roll with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yeah, let's go, <i>Jan</i>- I could eat, I suppose.\"  I saw Lily open her mouth to shoot off some smarmy comment, but I cut her off with another stern gaze.  She began to do her awkward waddle shuffle towards the Chicken Hut, which was only a few stores down, giving me and my mother a view of her ass.  Again, I cannot reiterate this enough- those stretch pants couldn't even begin to stretch enough to accommodate her shimmying shelf of an ass.  Each cheek rose, well, cheekily (no pun intended, probably) above the top of the pants by about an inch- something that probably would've been sexy to most folks if Lily was about 100 pounds lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Mom shot me a smile as we walked.  \"I was being honest, you know.  I'd love to know more about your friend, here.\"  I couldn't help but give her a small smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lily's been kinda absent lately, y'know, with college and all- it's the busy season and all...\"  I watched as Lily made a hard right turn into the highly anticipated Chicken Hut.  She made a beeline for a booth and was squeezed inside it before we even rounded the corner.  She waved a hand at us eagerly as we walked in- or so I thought, until I realized she was eagerly waving down a waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A coke and a chocolate malt please, and a basket of rolls for now-  Hey, what do you guys want?\"  She asked quickly as we approached the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water is fine, please.\"  <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Jan</span> Mom ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, just a coke, please.\"  I said timidly.  I was still unsure what exactly was happening here.  Lily was staring at the menu, but it was pretty obvious she already knew what she wanted- it was just for show.  I knew for a fact that the Chicken Hut near her apartment delivered, and I couldn't imagine she hadn't ordered from there before- I would assume she hit up everyplace that was within her delivery radius at least once a week... Hell, that's what I would do, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lily, tell me about yourself.  What are you studying?\"  My Mom asked kindly- she, too, wasn't looking at the menu, but I assumed she probably wasn't going to be eating anything, since, again, we had just eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Lily began, and I felt myself get a little nervous...  It occurred to me that it was very possible that she had gone even further down her path of laziness and had dropped out altogether.  \"I'm sort of in between majors at the moment.\"  I waited for a comment from my Mom, but Lily knew what she was doing.  \"If you didn't know, in the first two years of college, over 80% of students change their major at least once.  So-\"  She paused when our drinks came, to chug down half her coke in one go.  \"-I decided to just crank out my required courses right now- I'll declare a major after the semester when I have a better feel for what I want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit- either Lily was a really good bullshitter, or she was being sincere.

Had I entered the Twilight Zone? What sort of alternate reality had I entered to? This was the same women who had fat-shamed me for as long as I remembered, who had berated me about my weight all life, who made me constantly aware of the extent gluttony.

You\u2019d think that with her repertoire of being a fat-shaming, diet-pushing, \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t eat a whole batch of cookies in one sitting\u201d bitchery, she would be the <i>last</i> person to try and keep up with us in a meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say <i>try</i> because, for all her hard work, my mom was still a pretty scrawny woman. Not that I wasn\u2019t impressed or surprised by her effort, but\u2026 it was really more of a snack as far as I was concerned. I didn\u2019t really even notice that my mom had hit the \u201cwoah\u201d mark until I stopped and watched just <i>how much</i> of the delivered food was going to her side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy waitress sat a bucket of fried chicken in front of my mom, which was in and of itself a sight to behold. But no, there was more. Apparently she had ordered the combo\u2014that meant that a box of biscuits, a sizeable styrofoam container of mashed potatoes with gravy, and a large drink (Sprite?) were sat down to my awaiting mother. Said mother smiled eagerly and tipped the waitress (were you supposed to do that at the mall? I hadn\u2019t been doing that\u2026) as the rest of our food was doled out between us. My own meal took a whole other trip for the poor pudgy latina, but that didn\u2019t stop Lily from digging in while they both waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy own meal had been relatively small, considering that I had just eaten with my Mom not even a few hours ago. I wanted to retain at least <i>some</i> semblance of normalcy, right? Prove to my mom that I wasn\u2019t some hopeless pig who was gonna eat herself helpless before she turned twenty? You know, normal stuff that daughters proved to their mothers. I saw then that my modesty was misplaced, but by then I was too awestruck to really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, are you\u2026?\u201d my jaw hung slack, my neck roll bunching beneath it as I stared slack at the display before me, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a <i>lot</i> of food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh p\u2019shaww, what\u2019s the harm?\u201d my mother said as she held a big juicy thigh of greasy chicken above her breast, \u201cHow often is it that I eat dinner with my daughter and her friend? I think that a little <i>celebration</i> is in order\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmen to that!\u201d Lily cried out exuberantly with a burp, taking a punctuating slurp from her sweet tea, \u201cMel\u2019s Mom, you\u2019re the best!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it, Lily.\u201d My mother said with a smile, \u201cAnd please, call me Jan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, my mother punctuated her own sentence with a <i>ravenous</i> bite into her chicken. Seriously, she dove head-first into that thing. When she came up for air, red-orange sauce covered the corners of her mouth, completely challenging the image I had built up of my mother as this diet-crazy neatfreak. As she chewed, her cheeks bulging with chicken and sauce, I actually began to wonder if that was what I looked like\u2014or rather, what I would have looked like in a few years if I dropped a few hundred pounds\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as much as it surprised me, my mother only continued to keep up with us. She managed to take down most of her bucket, alternating her bites with globs of gooey mashed potatoes dripping with gravy and big heaping helpings of biscuit. She didn\u2019t share, either! Lily and I were far too preoccupied with our own meals to notice her surprising affinity for overindulgence. She didn\u2019t try to pawn off a piece, thigh wing or otherwise, even once. She was more than happy to rip into the sweet succulent meat all by herself, and reap the rewards of such indulgence\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time everything was said and done, I was sitting pretty full. Not only had I been binging all day in anticipation of my mother\u2019s arrival, but I had managed to eat first supper <i>and</i> a second supper at the mall. New clothes be damned, I was pretty full. My mom had wound up treating me to pretty much all of the restaurants that the mall had to offer\u2014and with me and Lily combined, the only one suffering more than my distended belly was her poor wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof.\u201d My mom grunted as she leaned back in her chair, her stomach distended, \u201cI think that\u2019s enough for one day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than, of course, her poor stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never seen my mother overeat before. Not even once. No holidays, no birthdays, not even on her birthday. I guess I more than made up for it with my indulgent eating habits, but I had just sort\u2019ve figured that my mother was incapable of such a thing. But lo and behold, across the table was my Mommy Dearest, cradelling a tummy fully of chicken and Mexican food like it was nobody\u2019s business. Beneath her floral top, a distinct bulge of belly pushed forward\u2014not enough to be more pronounced than a bump, but certainly enough for me to take notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe for now.\u201d Lily smacked her lips greedily, literally sucking the sauce off of her chubby fingertips, \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\" my mom said politely, \"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mel, you up for some dessert?\u201d Lily ignored my mother\u2019s answer in favor of mine, one more surely in line with her level of comfort in obesity and overindulgence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d I listened to my gut gurgle, drumming the taut skin of my stomach from beneath my sweater, \u201cI could eat a little more, if you\u2019re up for it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my mom, hoping to test the new waters that we found ourselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom?\u201d I asked, \u201cYou want some dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So... That was weird.  Like, really weird.  Sure, seeing my mom be... Nice, was a definite departure from the usual status-quo, but for her to pig out like that?  Well, it was beyond the pale.  So I wasn't going to say no, of course, but I wasn't entirely shocked when the offer of dessert was scoffed upon.  \"I... I <i>really</i> couldn't, Lily- in fact, I'm starting to...\"  She turned a little pale for a moment, and I waited for her to barf- thankfully, she didn't, just barely suppressed a hiccup. \"Starting to feel a bit ill, perhaps my daughter could take me back to my sisters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't going to object.  \"No, Mom, that totally sounds great- like, really great.  Why don't we get going?\"  I asked timidly- truth be told, I was pretty sure I couldn't handle a round of dessert- well, maybe a dessert fitting someone the size of... Er, my Mom, I guess- but certainly not the kind of dessert <i>I</i> was used to, at any rate.  So it's best we moved on, rather than one of us explode.  And judging by how pale my mother dearest currently was, I had a feeling that exploding sounded pretty alright to her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily couldn't help but air her grievances.  \"Yeah, well... Guess I'll get some ice cream alone...\"  I shot her a look while my mom fished out her credit card.  \"I mean, not that there's, uh, anything wrong with that.\"  She awkwardly shifted her bulk out of her booth, and I mouthed the words 'text me' at her as she slowly scooted out.  She nodded- I figured there was a fifty-fifty chance of her remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's... Get this paid for... I need to lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral awkward moments later- and I mean <i>awkward</i>, because my mom couldn't stop panting loudly as we were rung out.  I knew how she felt... Back when I started blimping up and secretly eating, I had overdone it several times... Well, more like a dozen... Well, more like six or seven times a week towards the end of my skinny phase and into my obese phase.  Point being, I knew how she felt.  When you're skinny and used to eating, oh, I dunno, like 300 calories a meal instead of 1500, it can really feel like dying when you overdo it.  So when we waddled out of the restaurant and my mom handed me her keys to her SUV, I didn't even question it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could still drive... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seat was about 30 inches closer to the steering wheel than I would've liked, and even with it all the way back (which took several agonizing seconds of very slow motorized gears grinding while I stood there awkwardly, the upper half of my asscrack hanging out while I bent over to adjust it) my mom just reclined the passenger seat and groaned.  I mean, she dressed conservatively and was practically a beanpole beforehand so it's not like her gut was jutting into the air like she was several months pregnant- if there was an impression on her outfit I couldn't see it.  But as I revved up the engine and awkwardly backed out, I couldn't help but open my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What brought <i>that</i> on?\"  I asked as bluntly as possible.  Oops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mom grimaced.  \"Mel... I'm sure you remember when you first started... Getting larger.\"  I winced.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid I ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was... I was very rude about it.  That's because... My Mother was not nice about my body.   Or my sister's.  She was... Very old-fashioned.  I... When we had you girls, I was so happy, but as time went on, some things that... That your grandmother taught me, came back, I suppose.\"  I tried to remember my Grandma- the one on my mom's side- and struggled.  I wasn't sure if I had even met her.  But since we were in psychotherapy 101, I supposed I had no choice but to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I took that out on you, and to a lesser extent, Alice.  But after Alice came home... Erm... <i>Larger...</i> I realized that, maybe I had been... Wrong about a few things.  And while I will admit that the food we ate today was tasty...\"  I heard her suppress another hiccup, or maybe a burp- I wasn't sure.  \"I don't... I don't think I can eat quite like you do.  But I wanted... I wanted you to know that I will always love you, and I will understand if you want to, well, eat like your friend Lily does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could almost feel myself tear up.  \"Mom... I...  I'm not sure what...\"  I began, but she was already waving her hand in the air dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get us to my sister's.  I need to lay on a couch or something, before I drive home... Talk to Rhonda...\"  And then her head lolled to the side.  She was in food coma territory- a situation I knew all too well.  Hopefully she took her sister's gain as well as me and my sister's...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I got Mom back to my Aunt Rhonda\u2019s place alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, as alright as I could have possibly gotten her there. My mother may have turned over a new leaf as far as her attitude towards my weight went, but her car surely hadn\u2019t. I had scooted that thing as far back as it could go, and I still wasn\u2019t exactly driving safely. I had to suck it in as much as I could just to keep my belly from bunching up against the steering wheel <i>constantly</i>. But I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke my mom up once we made it to the parking lot, and we slowly made our way out of the vehicle and onto to asphalt. I poured myself onto the ground, my feet aching after the minimal amount of effort I had put into walking all day. Not to mention the fact that I was particularly full\u2014not <i>stuffed</i> mind you (I had come home <i>far</i> fuller in the past!) but enough to at least feel some mild discomfort\u2014and had spent far too much energy emotionally reconciling with my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho, might I say, wasn\u2019t exactly up for the long walk up to the main building either. Her own surprise binge had left her rather ill-suited towards much movement. She trudged, dragging her feet along the dirty pavement and scuffing up her Toms. Who knew I got my \u201cI don\u2019t wanna walk\u201d look from my <i>mother</i> of all people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so we made it to the main building and waited for the elevator. I knew not only by the events of the day, but by the bulging of both our bellies, that my mother would not chastise me for doing so for probably the first time in years. We piled in, slumped against the wall, and waited patiently for the third floor to arrive as we clutched our respective tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made it up alright, waddled down the hall, and I shoved my key in the door before busting in belly-first, my mother not far behind me\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank <i>gawd</i> you\u2019re home.\u201d I heard my aunt call out from what sounded like the living room, \u201cDo we have any more of that cookie dough ice cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe waddled in to the sight of my Aunt Rhonda, beached on the couch. She had one thick leg kicked over the back, bent at the knee and bobbing lightly, as her tummy splayed free from the confines of her Apple Dumplin\u2019s t-shirt; lightly bronzed skin swelling out and pooling on the couch beside her. Her cute black bob was a mess, and her front showed the tell-tale signs of having missed a scoop or two of what looked like some kind of marinara sauce. She turned to look at me, and as soon as she saw my mom walk in behind me, her eyes nearly shot right out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d my aunt moved faster in that second than I had seen her move in months, rolling her bottom-heavy body off the couch and jiggling quickly into her bedroom, \u201cMel, why didn\u2019t you tell me my <i>sister</i> would be here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>told</i> you I was meeting her.\u201d I snarked, stifling a belly laugh as my mother chucked amusedly behind her hand, \u201cYou thought you\u2019d get off that easy? No way, if I\u2019ve gotta see her, so do you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was much fun to be had at Rhonda\u2019s expense as she quickly changed into something more presentable\u2014an outfit that was comfortable, but not \u201cthunder-thighs on the loose, belly rolling out like a storm front\u201d comfortable. My mother and I, from the living room, threw a couple of catty remarks about her state of undress at her through the door, something I never thought we\u2019d ever do. At least not together. Before too long, my aunt reemerged, squeezed into a pair of sweatpants and another shirt that hugged her hippy hugeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRhonda.\u201d My mother said warmly, wrapping her sister in a hug, \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Jan.\u201d my Aunt said, still flustered, before giving me the evil eye over my mom\u2019s shoulder, \u201cYour daughter is dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would expect nothing less.\u201d My mother chuckled, \u201cNow come on, I need to\u2026 sit. <i>Please</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, we sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat and we talked and we ate a little (that was really more me and my Aunt, less so my mother) and honestly it was literally the best time I had ever had with more than one member of my extended family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, oh my god, I had <i>never</i> heard these two women carry on like they did that night. I guess it sort\u2019ve came with the territory of being shipped off to Buttercombe Academy, and in no small part thanks to Aunt Rhonda living farther down the East Coast. But I really felt like an adult, sitting there and listening to my mom and my aunt trade stories and take digs at one another and all that stupid crap that sisters did. In fact, they sort\u2019ve reminded me of me and Alice. Y\u2019know, if Alice could take a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah well I\u2019ll have you know that <i>your daughter</i> made me fat.\u201d My Aunt said with a semi-self-conscious pat to her bloated belly, though her laugh was genuine, \u201cIn fact, I think you just shipped her off to me because you were tired of being the ugly sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my daughter has <i>anything</i> to do with those hips of yours, Rhonda.\u201d My mother said with a laugh, \u201cShe inherited <i>my</i> chest. You just got stuck with Mom\u2019s hips and you\u2019re upset about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Mom and I shared a belly laugh (us! Laughing!) as Rhonda shrunk into her shoulders, taking a curmudgeonly bite out of the recovered cookie dough ice cream. The joke was well-placed and meant innocently, something that even Rhonda could see. It had clearly been some time since these two had sat down and gotten to talk like this. I\u2019d like to think that Rhonda was just as shocked as I was that my mom had become so\u2026 <i>tolerable</i> lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the worst thing she did that evening was sneak a peek at her cell phone\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, look at the time.\u201d My mother yawned, \u201cI\u2019d better be getting to bed. Sleep off our little dinner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, come on!\u201d I plead, \u201cStay up\u2014we still have some ice cream in the fridge, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, I\u2019d better get to bed.\u201d My mother said with a smile as she rocked her still swollen self up off of the couch, \u201cI\u2019ve got a long drive ahead of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake my bed.\u201d My aunt burped, \u201cI\u2019ll crash out on the couch tonight\u2014\u2018sides, I\u2019ve got a long night of Netflix to catch up on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in years, I got a good-night hug from my mom. And she didn\u2019t even bitch when she couldn\u2019t wrap her arms around me\u2014it was so nice. So serene. I felt like a little kid again\u2014which, I mean, I didn\u2019t really get along with mom when I was little, but\u2026 y\u2019know, making up for lost time, right? And she hugged my Aunt Rhonda, and it was nice, and then she just went down the hall, into my Aunt\u2019s bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow.\u201d My aunt said with genuine astonishment, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d I answered her excitedly, \u201cShe\u2019s so\u2026 <i>different</i> now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d My aunt whistled, \u201cYour mom hasn\u2019t been this cool in years\u2014not since Mom died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What happened?\u201d I asked, hoping to expand on that mental note I\u2019d made about Grammy Burkhart near the end of our Mommy-Daughter binge, \u201cLike\u2026 were she and my mom close or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh! Hardly.\u201d My aunt snorted, \u201cMother was a real\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe stopped, visibly censored herself, and continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014mean person.\u201d She continued flatly, \u201cShe spent our entire lives making me and your mom feel like shit about our bodies. And I guess once she died, your mom just sort\u2019ve\u2026 picked it up. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m a lawyer, not a psychologist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone worse at fat-shaming than Mom is. Was. Whatever.\u201d I said with a roll of my eyes, \u201cSeriously, the woman\u2019s a stick. Grandma would have had to have been, like, a <i>super</i> stick to make my Mom feel bad about herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Actually</i>\u2026\u201d my aunt pursed her lips before continuing\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah, I mean, we weren't the skinniest kids... Or teens.\"  I gawked at her.  I tried to recall any pictures of my mom before the age of 28 (when she was first pregnant with me, shortly after her and dad got married) and I honestly couldn't.  At all.  \"I mean, your mom was always heavier than me, of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked an eyebrow at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Well, she was taller!\"  She said defensively.  \"And older... Look, that's not important!\"  I nodded in a way I hoped wasn't too condescending- I actually was pretty damn interested in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please continue.\"  I busied myself by digging a spoon into some cookie dough ice cream that I had pilfered from the freezer- I had <i>miraculously</i> made some room after my mom went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda blew some air from between her lips.  \"<i>Anyways.</i>  Yeah, it started when we were kids.  Your Grandpa- do you even remember him?\"  I shook my head- him and my Grandma had passed not shortly apart.  \"He-  Well, he was a chef.  I mean, he was the <i>best</i> chef.  I think he didn't grow up in a very well-off family, and he learned to cook with what he had- and by the time him and Mom were able to, you know, actually afford food, he really took it up.\"  I stared at her, entranced.  I almost forgot about my ice cream.  <b>Almost.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was big on making meals- hearty meals.  Our Mother- your Grandma- she usually ate about 3 bites and then got pissed off that we weren't, and I quote, 'rationing our food'.  So he'd cook in secret.  And when you're a kid, you don't understand...\"  She started to trail off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get it, Aunt Rhon-\"  I started, but she waved a hand in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I mean, I don't think you do.\"  She was frowning now, and I was starting to regret asking about this in the first place.  \"Your Grandpa was very kind to us- he'd sneak us snacks, baked pasteries he made from scratch, bacon when we were in our rooms- it's kind of surprising that we weren't, you know, bigger than we ended up.  But when we were teens, going into high school, well, that's when Mom got really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off, but I already knew where she was going with her thought.  \"I think I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me sadly.  \"Yeah.  I'm sure you do.  That's why... That's why it's weird, to see my sister act like this.  What do you think happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused for a second.  \"Well, if one daughter getting fat wasn't enough, I guess Alice got a little taste of Buttercombe, and it was a bit of an eye-opener for mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda stared at me for a second before bursting out laughing.  I let her get it out of her system.  \"You getting as big as you did didn't do it, but Alice puts on, what, twenty pounds and she breaks?  I mean...\"  I stared at her for a bit, not quite getting why it was so funny.  She finally recovered, as I took the last bite of my ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, Mel- it's just, she... She was the older sister, and she watched <b>me</b> get rounder than her, and she... Ha, oh, I mean, she just kinda- dropped the weight, while I just grew into it, if that makes sense...  I just- Oh, you would've had to have been there, I guess.  It's just ironic...\"  I was completely lost at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, she's being nice now- that's all that matters.  We should probably get some bed- can I borrow a few blankets?\"  I nodded vigorously, my chins folding into themselves.  As I pushed myself off the couch, grunting from the effort, my Aunt grabbed my thick wrist.  \"Mel, I'm serious- don't say anything to your mom about this, okay?\"</span></div></div>",

Nothing that half a pack of those dollar lemon cookies and a glass of whole milk couldn\u2019t fix. In fact, I slept like a baby\u2014reconciling with my mother had put me in the best place that I had been in\u2026 since I could remember, actually!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo imagine my feelings when, just as we were starting to get along, my Mom had to head back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo, please?\u201d I whined, \u201cCan\u2019t you at least stay for breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, we already <i>had</i> breakfast.\u201d My mother put her hands squarely on her hips, belly bulging<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah but\u2026 but <i>I\u2019m</i> still hungry\u2014that was only the first course!\u201d I plead, turning to my Aunt Rhonda<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be fair\u2026 I <i>could</i> go for some donuts.\u201d My aunt said with a sleepy scratch of her doughy stomach, \u201cWe were kinda holding back for your sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my knee-jerk reaction of expecting condemnation for being so openly greedy and emotional, my mother simply gave a small sigh that tickled the corners of her mouth into a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, you two are incorrigible\u2014you deserve each other.\u201d She said with a little laugh, \u201cBut I have to go. I could only get the one day off, and I\u2019ve got a long drive ahead of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much struggling, my aunt, mother and I managed to get me to a standing position. I <i>was</i> on a semi-full stomach after all, and it wasn\u2019t like either of them were working out. As soon as I was on my chubby feet, I wrapped my arms around my Mom for the first time in forever and gave her a big, squishy bear hug. She wrapped her own bony little arms around me as far as she could reach, her forearms sinking between two of my more prominent side-rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe good, Mel.\u201d She gasped, struggling under my weight, \u201cLove you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too.\u201d I squeezed even tighter, eliciting a familiar gasping noise from deep within my mother as I squeezed the life out of her, \u201cTell Daddy and the Squirt I said hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right\u2026\u201d my mother pushed away from me, and I released her. She looked like a tomato ready to pop\u2014I guess I didn\u2019t realize my own fat girl strength, \u201c<i>About</i> Alice\u2026 she was wondering if she could come visit you? After the semester lets out, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Really?!</i>\u201d I squealed, my chubby hands clapping together with such force that it sent my whole body shaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I told her what\u2026 <i>happened</i> a while back.\u201d My mother paused as she knowingly glossed over the fact that she had kicked me out, \u201cAnd she was so distraught over not getting to see you over the Summer, so I told her that I\u2019d ask your Aunt Rhonda about it and\u2026 well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo sets of eyes turned to face my Aunt Rhonda, currently half-way through a bear-claw that had managed to escape her binge last night. Her gaze shifted towards us, her cheeks bulging as she stood leaned against the counter, belly pouring onto its surface. She stared at us like a deer caught in headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 sure?\u201d my aunt looked around, as if shocked that we were actually asking her permission<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all I needed to hear\u2014I was so excited that I iterally started to jump up and down.. kinda. And then I calmed the fuck down once I realized just how exhausting and dangerous (for myself and the apartment, <i>and</i> the Fitzgerald family a floor below us) that shit was. But I was still fucking ecstatic. I <i>loved</i> my little sister to <i>death</i>, and I hadn\u2019t seen her in <i>forever</i>! In fact, the last time I had seen her was literally the day before my mom kicked me out\u2014I was honestly worried that I wouldn\u2019t see her again, given that she was in Buttercombe and I was in a different state than where she left me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d I squealed, \u201cThis calls for a celebration\u2014I\u2019ll get the ice cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe <i>ate</i> the ice cream.\u201d My aunt managed through her mouthful of bear claw, \u201dLike, six hours ago. Remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen order more donuts! Apple Dumplin\u2019s delivers, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, I <i>really</i> shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I wasn\u2019t having <i>any</i> of that. I was going to see my little sister for the first time in a <i>year</i>\u2014the little squirt that I had literally tried to be the best big sister to in the history of ever. We had been so tight before I left, even though I spent most of my time at Buttercombe. We\u2019d stay up late, watch movies, not tell Mom we did either of those things, eat some snacks while we swapped stories about our respective school lives, it had been so great. And now she was coming here! To me! Because she missed <i>me!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that didn\u2019t call for emergency-delivery-donuts, I don\u2019t know what did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so my Mom left after a couple donuts. Then me and my Aunt went out and got lunch, which eventually turned into lupper. I emailed Ms. Calliope before dinner and told her about what had happened the night before, and why I had suddenly gone dark, and she was pretty okay with it. Then I texted Lily and Marie, filled <i>them</i> in\u2026 it was all pretty exhausting, if you want the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I digress\u2014my Aunt and I spent the next three months getting ready for Summer to start. We figured that since Al couldn\u2019t drive, she\u2019d be staying a bit longer than my Mom had; at least a few days. So we bought this cot bed that rolled underneath my own for her to sleep on (I couldn\u2019t offer my sister my bed like my Aunt Rhonda had, I was <i>way</i> too fat to sleep on the couch!) and we made sure that the house was stocked with extra groceries so that there\u2019d be enough food for the three of us (\u2026for a while.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that time, all my \u2018celebration-binging\u2019 meant that I\u2019d managed to gain another forty pounds; all of it seemingly going straight to my belly. That officially meant that I was too fat to drive. I had managed to drive my mom\u2019s big-ass SUV, but that was only just barely. And since my Aunt Rhonda had to work, that meant that we couldn\u2019t really drive up to Buttercombe and pick my sweet little sister up like I wanted to. So we sprung for a plane ticket\u2014gotta love that sweet, sweet lawyer money!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect, if you wanted the truth. My mom had made it a point to tell me that Al had gotten \u201cbigger\u201d, but she had carefully avoided telling me just how much bigger \u201cbigger\u201d was. It was probably something to do with her new sensitive attitude towards our weights, but it didn\u2019t exactly give me a good idea of what exactly had happened to my sweet little sister. After all, Buttercombe Academy was the most posh, luxurious private school in America, and they pampered all of their students. I gained fifty pounds without even trying when I was Alice\u2019s age; and that was before Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway, my Aunt Rhonda was the one who had to go get Alice. Not only was I too big to fit in the driver\u2019s seat, but even getting in and out of the back seats was becoming a hassle. I\u2019d stayed home and made sure that everything was ready for Alice\u2019s arrival\u2014and of course, excitement-eating a sizeable portion of the snacks and groceries we\u2019d bought for her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was six \u2018o\u2019 clock on a Monday in late May when Alice finally arrived, and I saw the damage for myself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, I was just finishing up my email to Ms. Calliope- she had sent me this incredibly over-the-top gift basket as a thank you for helping her absolutely <i>crush it</i> during finals week, so I sent her an overwhelmingly gushy and heartfelt thank you as I munched on the third KitKat from the damn thing.  I told her to enjoy her month off before we started prepping for next semester (I knew I would- not that I didn't already have like, the lowest effort job ever, but it'd be nice to literally focus on nothing but my eating and my sister and on some nice evenings in with Marie and Lily- not that those two needed any help in the eating department...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, I was trying my hardest not to get little chocolately crumbs on everything when the buzzer for the door rang.  I slammed my laptop shut and shuffled to my feet, my belly flopping loosely over the top of my yoga pants- but that was just how I had to wear pants now, with my gut aggressively (and gloriously) rolling over the top and down towards my thighs.  I didn't even bother trying to pull my sweatshirt down, as I knew the most I'd do is cover a few inches for half a second until I jiggled it back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eagerly pressed the door button for a solid 3 seconds and then glanced back at the coffee table, where the snacks were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, <i>most</i> of the snacks.  Okay, about half.  Half sounded right.  The ranch Doritos were gone, as was most of the queso-dip, but I had been good and left the ruffled potato chips and the sour cream dip alone, other than a few test bites.  I had rearranged the cupcakes so it looked like there was only supposed to be six instead of twelve, and I had even disposed of the Apple Dumplin's box and arranged the assortment on a plate so it looked like they were all there- although I was hoping Aunt Rhonda wouldn't notice the missing chocolate eclair- oh who was I kidding, I knew she would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the door was open and it was kind of a blur for a second and then I was hugging my little sister and trying not to tear up too much.  Look, I may play it cool most of the time but I hadn't seen Alice in for-<i>ever!</i>  It was a very touching scene, let me tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel I missed you so much-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice I can't believe you're here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-So much to tell you about Buttercombe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Do they still have the build your own burger Fridays-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-And I even took a cooking class-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, eventually we both calmed down a bit and sat down on the couch- well, both couches.  At some point my ass had gotten to a point (don't ask me how) where, combined with my aunt's rather generous hips, we couldn't quite both fit on the couch.  So now the living room was slightly rearranged, with two couches sort of crookedly facing the television, with a coffee table in-between.  It was a nice, open set up.  Alice was crammed on the couch next to me- which really put into perspective how big she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, keep in mind, when I went to Buttercombe, part of me was on a mission.  And it was to piss off my mom.  So I ate and ate and ate- I ate myself sick on several occasions, but I just pushed myself, and watched while my roommate, classmates and friends all expanded- but I expanded twice as fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while I was half-expecting my timid little sister to come back with a little paunch, or maybe a few extra pounds in the hip area, I wasn't suprised to see her come back- well, as heavy as she was.   In my head, I figured she about kept pace with the girls I knew in Freshman year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was super weird to see my formally twig-thin sister with an additional 30-40 pounds on her frame.  Not that it didn't suit her just fine, in my eyes.  She was a little shorter than me, and definitely took on more of an apple shape, just like her old sister- no one area gained significantly more, but a potbelly was definitely the first thing you'd notice on her.  She was crammed into a sleek looking sweatshirt that probably fit well five pounds ago, but now emphasized her little tummy, and yoga pants- a growing girl's best friends.  I was brought back to the conversation by a sharp prodding in my ribs- well, the fat surrounding my ribs, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\"  She was exclaiming, happily munching away at a bowl of potato chips and giggling, her eyes bright with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and get this- she thought I wouldn't notice!\"  My aunt was doubled over on her couch, her belly pushing up her own sweatshirt and causing a bit of belly to ooze out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right.  She was telling the couch story.  Of course she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you wouldn't <i>notice!</i>\" I said defensively, although I was laughing too.  \"I just thought maybe it wasn't so bad...\"  I guiltily bit into a glazed donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, the couch was practically at a 45 degree angle...\"  She said, before reaching for a cupcake off the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we sat and talked and laughed- Alice told me all about Buttercombe, how much fun she was having- I talked about how much fun Rhonda and I were having out here, how fucking awesome my job and life was, we even talked about mom a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she- she wasn't super happy when I came home, at first anyways...\"  Alice had gone a bit red- for most of the night, she was like a whole different girl, but this was the first sign of my quite, slightly awkward sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed.  I remembered how it all started back when I came home from Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But!  She quickly dropped the issue, which was nice.  There were a few nights where she'd make this gross stuff for dinner, but I think Dad kind of got on her case about it- he was the one who encouraged her to call you...\"  She looked at me for a minute, smiling.  \"But I <i>may</i> have been the one to give him that idea.\"  I grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your master plan that was about as blunt as a shovel worked, girl, because you're here!\"  Rhonda yawned from the couch.  When I glanced at the clock, I realized it was almost 10:30!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get up in the morning, girls- try and keep it down, okay?  Alice, I'm really glad you're here!\"  She stood up and gave Alice a quick hug, and me one as well, awkwardly jamming my face into her chest from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, goodnight, we will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I'm here too!\"  Alice said, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"  I said as Aunt Rhonda closed the door.  \"What are we gonna do before bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked at the coffee table, which still had a fair amount of food on it.  \"Um... Finish off these snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't have been more proud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So I figured late that night, what better way to show off my little sister than to parade her around to the two people that I actually knew? Ms. Calliope had given me the month off, and Aunt Rhonda was at work anyway. It wasn\u2019t like we really had anything better to do; why <i>not</i> introduce her to Lily and Marie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround noonish (just coming off of brunch, just in time for lunch!) Alice and I took a bus to the mall. There were officially no taxis in South Carolina that could haul me around as effectively as public transportation, so I was beginning to make ready use of it. My ass was so wide that I took up three seats, meaning that I literally needed an entire row of seats to sit comfortably\u2014because God knows I was <i>not</i> about to stand for that long.. Alice sat on the row beside me, next to a few gawkers who looked from her to me like \u201coh shit, you\u2019re <i>related</i>?\u201d. Not the best first bus experience for <i>her</i>, but the overall bumpiness of our ride meant <i>lots</i> of jiggling for me, and that meant that I garnered more than my fair share of attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs our valiant chariot came to a gasping stop, I needed Alice\u2019s help along with a few less-judgmental fellow passengers, to get myself to a standing position. In less than a hundred pounds or so, I was probably going to have to stop these little outings altogether. I was getting too damn heavy for my own good, and while I knew that maybe I should slow down just a <i>little</i> I knew that it was an eventuality for me. The next step was recruiting the cast of <i>Supernatural</i> and/or <i>Arrow</i> to wait on me hand and foot, and my dreams would be fulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back on track, Mall. Alice. Me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was pretty awestruck by just about everything we passed; I had to remember that before she left for Buttercombe, Alice had never been so much as out of our hometown. Coming to a different state where just about everything was the same as it was back home, just moved around a little (and maybe a bit more humid, with a southern drawl) was probably groundbreaking for her. Me? I was too busy heaving and sweating and sputtering like an old engine to really take in the novelty of my surroundings. Just the walk from the bus stop to the entrance of the mall had me ready to collapse. I did my best to play it cool, but <i>damn</i> it was hot! And I was <i>not</i> well-suited for high-temperature climates! I hadn\u2019t exercised this much in months, and I was exhausted and <i>starving</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I waddled through the double doors belly first, Alice toddling behind me, when I saw Lily and Marie in my peripheral. The familiar scent of grease and salt kept my brain so addled that it took me a full minute to register that we weren\u2019t here so I could stuff my fat face, we were here to introduce Alice to my blubbery besties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mel!\u201d Lily called out, waving her doughy, wobbling arm, \u201cOver here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a puff of air\u2014well, a more pronounced puff of air. One that hopefully showed that I would much rather have just started eating right off the bat\u2014and steered my bulk towards the conglomeration that had been prepared for our inevitable feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSup fatties?\u201d I huffed, plopping down into three seats comfortably, \u201cSurprised you guys didn\u2019t get started without me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, Lily tried.\u201d Marie stuck her tongue out at the increasingly overweight redhead, who shot her a dirty look, \u201cBut I knew that today was a special occasion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpe\u2014oh, right.\u201d Again, hungry. Don\u2019t think so good when hungry. \u201cLadies, this is Alice\u2014Alice, this is Lily and Marie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice took a shy step forward, her hands held behind her back as she shrunk into herself. She was still wearing her sweatshirt from yesterday, meaning that her cute little belly was outlined very plainly\u2014no mystery who\u2019s sister <i>she</i> was, after all\u2014and her jeans were tight enough to give everyone a clear view of her muffin top bulging over them. Her chubby little cheeks burned bright red as she smiled awkwardly at my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d She squeaked, taking a seat next to me, \u201cI\u2019m Alice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie gave a little nod and a big smile to Alice, welcoming her into our little gaggle of fatties officially I guessed. Marie had only continued to put on weight in her continued exposure to me and Lily. The sweet, spoiled little rich girl who\u2019d never had junk food had put on quite a bit of weight before the summer started. I could comfortably categorize her as \u201cchubby\u201d now, closing in on the \u201cfat\u201d title very quickly. It figured that all that time on her butt, scarfing down junk food with two fat pigs like me and Lily would make her ass more comfortable to sit on. She wasn\u2019t quite as bootilicious as my Aunt Rhonda as far as proportions went, but my Catholic school snack attacker was a definite pear. Her tummy eeked out of her yoga pants (again, big girl\u2019s best friend!) and onto her well-padded lap, eager to be filled with the day\u2019s binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to finally meet you\u2014Mel hasn\u2019t shut up about you for weeks.\u201d Marie said plainly as yet another laugh was shared at my expense, \u201cBut no, seriously, she\u2019s sweet. You\u2019ve got a good sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burp signaled Lily\u2019s incoming input into the conversation. She definitely hadn\u2019t given up her goal of outclassing me, or of becoming the biggest she could get. Her new battle plan of staying in her dorm all day, eating her weight in junk food while she coaxed through her easy-ass online curriculum had certainly been paying off. Lily was nearing the big three double zero after only a year\u2019s worth of hanging out with me\u2014in maybe another twenty or thirty pounds, she\u2019d reach it. My little ginger binger had become unrecognizable from the skinny little thing she started as. Her belly was huge, lapping over every waistband she owned with pride and folding into two meaty rolls that jiggled with her every step. Her fat ass tested the limits of her single chair\u2014I theorized that \u2018300\u2019 would come with the necessity with a chair under each cheek at her height and overall girth\u2014just as much as her top was tested by her titanic tits. Seriously, she was exploding out of that thing. They were resting on the table and everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept when she keeps us waiting for an hour.\u201d Lily said huskily, \u201cM\u2019starved. Can we eat yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Gawd</i> yes.\u201d I whined, \u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe waited for a sec, let me get my bearings, and then we all went off to order obscene amounts of food without caring about the consequences. Alice stuck mostly by my side while Lily and Marie stuck together, then we all came back with way too much food in tow, and started stuffing it in our faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds fun, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell everything was going <i>great</i> until\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, I was only half-way through my second course, which was, of course, slightly larger than the first, before I realized that everyone wasn't entranced by their food- there was one person who was actually talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was probably reaching a point where she'd consider her meal a snack, if her growth rate was any sort of indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was- in all likelihood- used to Buttercombe portions, which meant that her current platter was a bit larger than usual (not a knock against Buttercombe, they just tended to prefer quarter pounders over half pounders, eight chicken tenders over twelve- you get it), but Marie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was obvious she had gotten chubby by being around Lily, but that <i>also</i> meant that she was used to Lily's eating habits.

Yeah!

You seem like you know the menu here pretty well?\"  I tried to ask innocently while enviously eyeing Lily's sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"  Marie muttered as she split her gigantic almond-topped brownie with her fork.  \"Oh, yeah, I guess...

The comment is as follows, and I swear I made absolutely no change:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I'm <i>stuffed</i>,\" Alice lowed, sinking into her seat, hands on her domelike potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look it,\" Lily or I said, one of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie then chimed in: \"Yeah, those clothes look like they're about to snap on that fat body of yours, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why I now stood outside a dressing room - well, sat (why stand?) - as Alice tried on some plus-er sized clothes. The store attendant was very helpful, a skinny girl, rather cute (considering), whose name began with an L, or something. Upon stepping inside, I realized that I hadn't shopped at one of these places in a while and had <i>no</i> idea how to help Alice find the clothes she needed. Enter store attendant, who took Alice's measurements, even though it involved a little fat touching, and helped find the exact clothes. There were some cute things too - although, I long ago stop caring too much for fashion, seeing as it all inevitably ended up as tatters underneath my ever growing, ever jiggling behemoth booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I turn myself on too much - I heard the door open behind me, and out walked my little sister, who seemed to have grown since those measurements were taken - those clothes looked a little snug! It was now I realized Alice's belly wasn't just a pot, but a burgeoning double! I definitely saw the slightest hint of pooching over of a top roll. I didn't bother to mention it to Alice, who looked distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, fashionista?\" I said, attempting encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart broke as my little - er, younger sister came slowly up to me and muttered, defeated, \"More like <i>fat</i>shionista.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! Those clothes fit you fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, seemingly shameless now that the fat overwhelmed her, turned around and it was then I saw a tear in the clothes across her ass and hips. I sighed, and nodded, guiding her back to the dressing room. Sitting within, my fat ass dwarfing hers, I said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, there's nothing to worry about, okay? You're a growing girl - just look at me! I'm pretty sure I show that you can be HUGE and hot at the same time - aren't guys always flocking around me like seagulls around a half-eaten hotdog?\" that got a laugh, and I side-hugged her. \"But seriously, ya gotta accept yourself in your own skin before you try and change how much there is of it, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sniffled, and looking at me, said:</span></div></div>",

I decided to push forward.  \"I mean... You just don't have to be ashamed of your body!  I mean, hell, look at <i>me.</i>\"  To emphasize my point, I grabbed my prominent paunch and shook it, before grunting unhappily- that hurt a lot more when you carried the weight of two people in your front-center mass, not to mention just gotten done eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looked at me with a half smile.  \"No, I... I get that.  And you're not wrong- I mean, I'm not ashamed of my body- really, I'm not, and how could I be, after seeing some of the older girls at Buttercombe...

Buttercombe gave me such a good experience with fashion, and everything that goes into it...\"  I nodded- I knew all too much how much my sister loved the design aspect of clothes.  \"And... Well, look, they don't exactly have an advanced course there.  In fact...  One of my teachers actually told me that I should look at this other school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so now I was starting to get the whole picture, or so I thought.

Before she left for Buttercombe, Alice probably would have gotten an anxiety attack from the <i>idea</i> of going to a new place, but now she seemed so much more outgoing, so confident, so\u2026 <i>normal</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to think that it was maybe because she was hanging around me, or that Buttercombe Academy had done what it had done for me and helped her come out of her shell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only realized it then, but it <i>had</i>. Just in a very different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I gotcha, Squirt.\u201d I said with a smile, wrapping my wide wobbling arms around my skinnier sister and pulling her close into my tit for a fleshy hug, \u201cJust so long as he\u2019s not\u2026 you know, <i>making</i> you lose weight or anything, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?

When we got to the pizza place, the first thing she did was order enough pizza to have an epic pig out session with me and my friends, and then, she kept on eating, not something one normally did when attempting to slim down, Alice was beginning to turn into me! My little sister was becoming a mini-Mel! Before she left for Buttercombe, Alice probably would have gotten an anxiety attack from the idea of becoming as fat as her big sister, but now she seemed so much more outgoing, so confident, so\u2026 normal! She didn't even look like she cared that much about the extra pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then this 'Zack' was brought up, and she immediately began feeling guilty about eating so much food. I immediately realized that curbing her newfound, Buttercombe induced gluttonous appetite was going to take longer than expected, and chances were that she'd blow up like a balloon, rather than shed the pounds that she wanted to. She would need to either pray Zack wouldn't leave her for the weight or that she could shed the weight before returning home and meeting up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to help her out, but knowing me, I'd just make her either bigger than she was now or about as big as I was when I graduated from Buttercombe, and only then did I wish that I were better at helping with diets, because Alice would need someone better than myself to help her lose weight,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I got ya, Allie.\" I said with a smile, wrapping my wide wobbling arms around my skinnier, stuffed little sister and pulling her close into my tits for a fleshy hug, \"Just don't be surprised if you can't lose weight or anything, right?\" I said as Alice began to sniffle a bit, and I immediately began to feel a little guilty for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Zack did say he wouldn't mind me being chubby, or would he mind if I got bigger\u2026\" Alice said and a knowing smirk grew atop my fat face as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he wouldn't mind a fat girlfriend!\u201d I said, pulling my sister in for another hug, \"Well, then I don't see what the need to diet and slim down is for, if he doesn't mind it if you get about as big as me\u2026why worry about it?\u201d I asked as Alice considered my words, her hand on her chin in deep thought before a look of realization dawned upon her chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel.\" Alice smiled, hugging me tighter, \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too.\" I said with a squeeze, \"But I gotta be honest with ya, Al\u2026if Zack doesn't mind if your fat, then, I don't think you should be slimming down without talking to him first. And maybe\u2026you know, until you know for sure, don\u2019t let Marie order for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point, sis\u2026I feel like a blimp.\u201d Alice cupped her paunch with both hands and gave it a good shake, eliciting a petite burp from deep within her paunch, \"And it's so hard!

I might not be able to help you with the future, but we can talk this out like a family.\u201d I said with a loving hand on Alice's hand, \"I'm always here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re the best.\" Alice said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something I don't know.\" I smiled, \"Now, c'mon, let's go meet up with my friends, and maybe get some pizza.

She was wearing a pretty nerdy outfit, one that generally signifies an attempt to disguise rolls and whatnot - but fuck, my mother had three very defined rolls through the dust and the years. Furthermore, she had a big smile on her fat face, too. And, the way her hand curled against her roll - I'd recognize that anywhere.

I mean, I believed that she used to be about my size when she was younger (I kind've had to\u2014doctoring photos was a lot harder back then than it is now) but I didn't <i>honestly</i> believe that she meant any of that shit about wanting to be fat again. I really, genuinely believed that she was going to yell 'psyche!' and a camera crew was going to come out of nowhere and I was gonna look like a big fat idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the days rolled on and the pounds kept piling on, I was forced to change my opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the three of us went for Cook Out and cleaned the place out. Keeping up with me was one thing, and keeping up with my ravenous Aunt Rhonda was another, but keeping up with <i>both</i> of us, with the addition of my newly ambitious mother meant that we actually closed the place down while they restocked. I was skeptical, given the queasy looks that she gave her so-thick-you-need-a-spoon milkshake, but my suspicions were abated by her willingness to go through with what I believed was a larger part of her plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she started talking to me more I was more concerned, but none more so than when she started asking me where I kept my clothes from my \"skinny days\" so she would have something to wear around the house. Not only had she and I <i>not</i> spoken on the phone until she came to visit me, but she would have <i>never</i> called my days as a chubby Sophomore in Buttercombe Academy anything resembling skinny. I thought it was another step in her scheme, something to get me on her side to make her betrayal all the more satisfying. But when I heard a very audible 'RRRRIIIIP!!' from her end of the phone, I allowed my eyes to unnarrow. That sounded <i>way</i> too real...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she friended Lily and Marie on Facebook, I got downright disgruntled. But when I saw all the links that they were posting and tagging each other in, I... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it. My Mom was really doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gonna get fat! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in that moment, I felt... strange. Like, good strange. It wasn't like I <i>wanted</i> my Mom to get fat or anything. That would have been weird. But, you know, we hadn't had anything in common for so long; since I was eight years old. The fact that we had something that we both shared was... nice! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as time wore on and her profile pics got chubbier and chubbier, and her posts increasingly food oriented and size-positive, and her talks with me became more and more oriented on how I managed to keep myself clothed throughout my expansion, I thought... wow, this is really happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Alice, on home from her Summer break, was surprised at the swift and sudden change in our mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what it is, Mel but Mom's... she's acting so weird!\" Alice's voice poured into my ear from the speaker on my phone, \"She's cooking so much now that she and Dad are, um... are split up. Y'know? I'm kinda worried!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, she's fine!\" I roared boistrously, \"Let her, uh... <i>cope</i> in her own way, Al.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mel she's getting so...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>fat!</i></font>\" Alice lowered her voice, \"And she's cooking so much lately, I don't think I can keep up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rest assured, she would. But that was a story for another time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point was, my Mom had really turned over a new leaf. That one night with me and her sister had really made a difference in her life. Ever since then, she had just started... letting loose! And it was great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so me, Aunt Rhonda, and my friends were all excited to hear that Alice was coming over for a visit, and after my mom got that new outlook on life, and started to try and regain her former corpulent beauty back, I more than expected some changes in Alice's girlish figure. I was so excited that I couldn't sleep at all the other night, the night before Alice's arrival, luckily a food coma could fix that. I spent a lot of time with my friends and my aunt and before we knew it, it was the day of Alice's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo imagine my surprise when Alice and mom came to the door and Alice was starting to look like me in my junior year at Buttercombe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice? Is that you?\" I asked, not expecting Alice to have gained <i><b>that</b></i> much weight, \"You've gotten so\u2026so\u2026so\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat?\" Alice sheepishly replied as she turned a shade of red. \"Y-yes, Mel, I've, uh, noticed.\" My sister put her hands nervously on her belly, she must've felt felt a little self-conscious about her weight at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but, I mean I expected you'd be bigger when you got here\u2014but not this much bigger!\" I said as I processed Alice's new figure. \"Like, seriously, you look like I did in my junior year!\" I said as Alice got more and more flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair\u2026\" My mother said, getting our attention. \"We did a lot of snacking on the way.\" Mom said as she waddled inside the apartment, Alice in tow, \"It's probably not easy for her to adjust to the new me\u2026\" She said as Alice plopped her new, double-wide butt on the couch and as if on instinct, she started channel surfing. Despite my shock at seeing my little sister having gotten so big, I couldn't help but feel a little emotionally happy as I waddled over to her, eager to hang out with her and catch up with her, seeing as we haven't seen each other in a very, very long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's Buttercombe? Enjoying being the NewBee on campus?\" I asked her with a little laugh, \u201cGawd, I miss that place so much, although, I GUESS I could go for my teaching credentials and try and get a job teaching at Buttercombe.\" I said as I mused about going to Stuffington University and become a teacher just as an excuse to go back to Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Alice immediately began engaging in conversation, telling each other how we've been, and before we knew it, we had decided to go outside to hang out. Of course, I hadn't expected Alice to also have a massive appetite, something I found out about after we were already at Apple Dumpling's, and I was actually a little impressed, her appetite was getting close to matching my own, she was eager to stuff her face, and just like that, I decided that this was better, that Jan 2.0  was the best thing that ever happened to our whole family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, M-Mel.\" She stuttered, swallowing the food in her mouth, \"Buttercombe's been great, and, well, I miss you\u2026\" She said and I swore my heart was almost as big as my massive belly when she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss you too, Squirt.\" I hugged her very tightly, eliciting a familiar gasping noise from deep within Alice as I squeezed the life out of her, \"So, how are things with your friends?\" I asked as Alice began to get a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right\u2026\u201d She said as she started twiddling her fingers. She turned so crimson that she looked like a tomato ready to pop\u2014I guess she had something she really wanted to talk to me about, \"Well, my friend Sam, she was wondering if she could come visit next time? After the semester lets out, of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d I squealed, my chubby hands clapping together with such force that it sent my whole body shaking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I told her what\u2026happened a while back.\u201d Alice paused as she knowingly glossed over our mother having evicted me from the family home, \"And she admitted that she wanted to meet you, so I talked to mom, and she told me that she'd ask Aunt Rhonda about it and\u2026well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't believe it, ALice was getting pretty confident, having as much confidence as she had fat on her titanic tushie, normally, she'd have stuttered shakily throughout the whole sentence, but nowadays she said it without a single stutter and she didn't even get the slightest bit shaky as she spoke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" I said ecstatically, \"I don't mind but we'll need to see what Aunt Rhonda says about it\u2026\" I said as I began to get excited, I'd been wanting to meet Alice's friends for a while now and now I was being given the opportunity to do so with one of them, I could barely contain it, I needed to see what Aunt Rhonda was going to say about so I whipped out my phone and texted her about it. Almost instantly, she had texted back that Sam COULD come over, and that got us both so happy that we immediately began ordering more food to stuff ourselves, getting some grub for the road, and began to make our way back to Aunt Rhonda's place to spend some time with our new and improved mother and so that Alice could contact Sam about the whole thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" I squealed, \"This calls for a celebration\u2014I\u2019ll get the ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We ate the ice cream.\" Mom managed through her mouthful of bear claw, \"Like, an hour ago. Sorry, Mel\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll order out! Pizza? Apple Dumplin\u2019s? take your pick ladies!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, I really shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I wasn\u2019t having any of that. I was FINALLY going to meet one of the friends Alice had made at Buttercombe and I felt the need to celebrate this moment in a massive family pig out. I couldn't wait to see this 'Sam' girl! Although, I figured that she must be pretty big since she was at Buttercombe. And I've heard so much about her, and now she was coming here! To meet me! Because Alice wanted to introduce her to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that didn\u2019t call for emergency-delivery-food, I don\u2019t know what did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day\u2026</span></div></div>",

Why she was so awkward around me at first, why Lily had gotten so mad, and why a skinny twig like that seemed to have an appetite on par with mine\u2014she was a chubby chaser! She liked her ladies big and bodacious, and I just so happened to be the biggest and most bodacious person this side of the Mason-Dixon, let alone between me and Lily!

Really, if it wasn\u2019t edible, it didn\u2019t really register to me\u2014at least not immediately. If Mary had been giving me the goo-goo eyes, I had been too busy eating to really notice; let alone reciprocate. And when she started listing off all that food, that was just my tummy talking. I had no intention of making a move on Mary. Certainly not now that I knew my pint-sized porker of a friend was sweet on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I get it. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I apologized and pulled her close, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone\u2026 just warn a girl next time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Lily laughed, her belly brushing against mine as she wobbled in my arms, unable to wrestle with my superior fat girl strength, \u201cJust\u2026 head back to your Aunt\u2019s house. I\u2019ll text you later, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will text me through the <i>whole thing</i>.\u201d I added, \u201c<i>And</i> pay for subs, Chinese, and Pizza at a later date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Lily smiled, \u201cThanks Mel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, I went back inside, said my goodbyes (trying to come across as friendly but not too friendly) and caught a cab back to my Aunt Rhonda\u2019s apartment\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, naturally, I whipped out my phone to give the guy a shitty Yelp! review, right? I waddled to my Aunt\u2019s door the whole way, typing out my propaganda (something I made up on the spot about fat-shaming) and got inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was <i>just</i> about to hit send when I looked up to make sure that I wasn\u2019t going to knock anything over in the doorframe, when the first thing I see is this big, enormous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt Rhonda had only continued to put on weight in the coming months that I stayed with her, and she seemed to be getting exponentially skilled at doing so. Whereas she had maybe gained fifteen pounds in the first month, she had put on another twenty the second month, and so on. We were officially four months into being roommates, and my intrusion into my formerly fit Auntie\u2019s life had turned her into a real porker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Mel.\u201d My Aunt\u2019s voice came from the massive asscheeks silhouetted by the refrigerator light, \u201cBack so soon? I thought you were hanging out with Lily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt\u2019s ass had gotten fat. Like, bypassing the ph- and going straight to f-. Her badonk had gained another donk and thensome, going from a pert and shapely thing to a rolling expanse of booty blubber. Her thighs had widened into doughy columns of flab that wobbled at every step as one leg fought the other for space in her increasingly tight ensembles. In her quest to make me as comfortable as could be (the sweet, loving Aunt that she was!) she found herself fighting the temptations that I gave into willingly, and losing those battles spectacularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my Aunt straightened up with a soda (one of those accommodations that I\u2019d mentioned earlier!) in hand, her belly poured over the waistband of her sweatpants and oozing into a tan doughy pot belly that trembled at her heavy footfalls. She was so pear\u2014all that weight she\u2019d gained, and my Aunt had only traded in bras a handful of times. Despite having put on nearly as much weight as Lily or I had, she was nowhere near the cup-size of the itty-bitty butterball that was my titty-tastic Lily, and certainly not as big as mine were. Her arms, spare tire, and even her face had gotten fatter, but my poor Aunt just wasn\u2019t to be blessed with the Carlyle Chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, turns out she\u2019s got a date.\u201d I puffed, passing by my Aunt and plopping down on the couch, making it creak and groan in agony in its latest of a long list of complaints, \u201cSo I just headed back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d My Aunt said as she scarfed down the better half of a bear-claw, scratching her barely-concealed belly as it battled with her black tank top, \u201cWell, I was just about to order some pizza\u2026 you want in?\u201d<br>\r\nSee?\u2014it wasn\u2019t just <i>me</i> that was making her fat. It was a lot of things, I swear. Like the fact that she went to Apple Dumplin\u2019s with increasing and frightening amounts of frequency. Or the fact that she had a desk job. Or the fact that she hadn\u2019t touched her exercise equipment since, like, I got here. And\u2026 maybe the fact that she was harboring her incredibly obese niece, who was a <i>little</i> needy and surrounded herself with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoint being; nmf<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh.\u201d I rolled my eyes, unbuttoning my shirt tossing it over to the other end of the living room, leaving me in nothing but my tank and leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect\u2014I\u2019ll get Pizza Pie on the phone!\u201d my Aunt said a little too eagerly, whipping around on her heels to retrieve her phone from the kitchen as her ass bobbed dutifully behind her\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wiiiith\u2026 um\u2026 Mel, what do you want to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoke!\u201d I said in a slightly elevated tone while we vegged out on the couch, \u201cAnd you better make that four if you want any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake that <i>four</i> extra large pepperoni pies and two two-liters of Coke, please.\u201d My aunt said casually into the phone as she drummed her chubbing fingers against the surface of her belly, \u201cWhat kind of silly question is that? Of <i>course</i> we want breadsticks. Extra cheese, if you\u2019d please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled to myself as I watched my Aunt get into a tizzy over whether or not we were going to get breadsticks. She sunk into the couch lazily, despite the fact that her ass made her sit a full four inches taller than she used to, and handled the phonecall like an old pro. I got some mild astonishment that the Burkehart Special had evolved from two slices of pizza to a whole pie, considering the size of those things. But I let her go on because, mostly, her order was built very much with me in mind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>DINGDONG</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty-five minutes later, Aunt Rhonda returned from her short trip to the front door with four extra-large boxes that reeked of pepperoni, cheese, and good-old fashioned pizza grease. She had to hold her arms out wide, due to their size, and they cut pretty noticeably into the top of her belly as it rolled over her waistband. On top of them, a bag of cheesy breadsticks and two 2 liters of Coke had been delivered as promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt wasted no time in placing it all on the coffee table as I paused Supernatural for her. She laid everything out quickly. As she bent over, I could practically hear the seams in her sweats groaning in pain as her massive ass threatened to pop right out of the overtaxed bottoms. My authentically-fatass aunt grabbed the topmost of the pizza boxes and opening it up to take an eager whiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh yeahhh\u2026\u201d she said greedily, her gut gurgling audibly, \u201cThat\u2019s the stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile there was just little old me, watching my aunt horde all the pizza while I starved. Seriously, I didn\u2019t really realize until then how much of my Aunt\u2019s inner fat girl had come out since I\u2019d moved in. I mean, I wasn\u2019t in any real position to criticize, but still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Auntie.\u201d I said in mock threat, my chins quivering as I spoke, \u201cDon\u2019t leave your favorite niece hanging over here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt stuck her tongue out girlishly and delivered my appropriated three boxes, as promised. I\u2019ll admit that I wasn\u2019t really hungry, but I was kind of bored. And it had been about two hours since I\u2019d eaten last, so I figured that I could have done with a little snack. Even if Lil and I had overdone it a little, that was no excuse for me to start slacking off on my diet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I didn\u2019t get to go full fat girl on my pizza. I was already too full, my mind was still pretty occupied with how Lily and Marigold were doing, and I honestly got too wrapped up in Supernatural to really release the beast all over some pizza. Don\u2019t get me wrong when I say that I ate a lot. But it was the <i>normal</i> a lot, not the comparative. What most people considered \u201ca lot\u201d, I considered \u201ctoo easy\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut apparently, it wasn\u2019t \u201ca lot\u201d for Aunt Rhonda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt had become, slowly but surely, one of those people who zoned out when she watched TV. She could just blank out, eyes glaze over, and munch mindlessly on the couch while her shows played\u2014a recent side-effect of me introducing her to Netflix and <i>Supernatural</i>, so yeah that one\u2019s kinda my bad. Now normally, when that happens, the worst thing that comes out of it is a missing bag of chips or something. Maybe a carton of ice cream for those regular-grade fatties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant that every box of pizza within her reach was a victim, and her trusty box of bear claws was better than a security blanket. She ate incessantly, gripped in the wonderful world of the Winchester brothers and completely unphased by how much she was stuffing into her face. The more tenuous the situation, the faster she ate. The more drama-filled the episode? The faster she ate. Every twist and turn of the CW\u2019s magnum opus was met with a furious bite and chomp from my Aunt Rhonda as she scarfed her way through season 8 with me, her cheeks bulging as she shoved bite after bite past her lips and down her throat with reckless abandon; grunting and mustering through the whole ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as her breathing grew labored, heavy and shallow due to the due-term food baby she was nursing, she found herself unable to stop. Not that, y\u2019know, I tried to. But still. I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure she would have kept eating if I tried to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I just had to up and turn off Netflix because she had fallen into a food coma on the couch; her belly round and taut with two and a half boxes of Pizza Pie and the better portion of a baker\u2019s dozen of bear claws. Not to mention the breadsticks and the soda. My Aunt had really pigged out that night\u2014without even meaning to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly bulged outwards, easily in its second trimester of food pregnancy. It was shiny with sweat, and it churned audibly as it struggled to tackle the massive meal that my aunt had forced upon it. In her sleep, she clumsily moved her doughy arms to try and rub it in a futile attempt to soothe the monster tummyache that she had created. Her head lulled against her shoulder, a puddle of drool forming in the corner of her mouth as she let out tiny whimpers of pain in her quest to digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do with her\u2014<i>my</i> fat ass couldn\u2019t haul <i>her</i> fat ass to her bedroom\u2014I grabbed the blanket off her bed and draped it over her, and called it a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so things just sort of built on from there. It was a really subtle change, but as Fall faded into Winter and the weeks rolled on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, like I was saying my Aunt and I had really fallen in, constantly stuffing ourselves and becoming loaded couched potatoes over the course of both the fall and winter. We had both a massive Thanksgiving, and a Christmas. Which wasn't surprising, I mean we love to eat! Massive meals littering the tables just for the two of us. We both gained the expected weight that came with being practically shut-ins, force feeding ourselves nearly 24/7. Aunt Rhonda had blimped out nicely, her massive ass taking up an entire love seat now as she sat down eating some take-out for the third time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had rounded out quite a bit as well. My belly pretty much needed it's own zipcode, and reaching my belly button had become a thing of the past. Hell, if Auntie hadn't have given me some clothing money I would be out of a wardrobe. Not that I even care, laying around and eating nude sounds just as good to me. I needed the room to grow. But no, I needed the clothes because I actually planned to go <i>outside</i> tonight. See, there was this new buffet in town and you KNOW I'm down to pig out. The place had even been open for a week! I had just been in such a stupor at home that the opening night had came and went without a second thought. So, I intended to fix that mistake, those poor chefs are about to have the food-rug pulled out from underneath them if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, dinner-time rolls around and I manage to get dressed and catch a ride to the buffet. It's a chinese buffet, the usual, but it's new and considering all the buffets I've wrecked over the years it will be nice to walk in without glares. A small part of me feels bad taking advantage of an All-you-can-Eat deal. A small part of me that's massively overpowered by a ton of lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lumbered heavily, almost rolling, through the front double doors as the smell struck me all at once. It was wonderful! My mouth was already watering before I even made it to the hostess, my massive blubbery belly swaying back and forth in front of me. It wasn't even full yet, I can't imagine how I'm going to get out of here... Unfortunately I snapped out of my daze by the cold tone of the young girl at the hostess stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God....not another one..\" she mummered under her breath, barely audible as I smacked my lips in anticipation. \"Please, follow me.\" she said kindly after some mental correction. Following her was a struggle, she was definitely walking too fast for a fat girl like me! Waddling at top speed, we finally made it to the table as I panted catching my breath. \"Please feel free to start whenever you're ready\" she beamed a fake smile before adding \"..and god help us all..\" before walking off in a sulk back to her station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally! I didn't even sit down. Why would I? I would just have to get back up, and at my size that took some effort! Waddling to the buffet line as fast as I could I soaked in the sight of all the food I could eat! Grabbing a plate I started shoveling food onto it like my life depended on it, hell, it did! Moving down the rows my plate got fuller and fuller as I stacked it higher with fattening calorie-laden junk food. Finally satisfied with my first of many hauls I started to make my way back..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mel?\" a weak voice called out behind me, causing me to almost drop my plate as I twisted my three-chinned head around. It was Marigold! Er....Mary..Marie? Damn, I forgot it had been so long, \"Mel it is you!\" she continued, seeming to gain her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Marie\" I paused, the food on my plate beckoning me to go sit down and stuff my face. But something made me pause..I mean REALLY pause. Marie, the skinny little student that Lily had started dating had her arms <i>filled</i> with plates! She looked like one of those waiters at a mexican restaurant with plates all up and down their arms. \"Hey, is all that for you?\" I dumbly asked, though in the back of my mind I knew the answer. After all, if Marie was here Lily was sure to be nearby. But it had been months since I last saw her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe no silly,\" she giggled, expertly balancing her haul of food as we chatted in the middle of the buffet, \"I'm here with Lily.....oh I bet you want to say hi! Come on follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been so long since I had seen Lily that I didn't even reply, simply took my plate with me as I waddled behind the stick of a dark-haired girl as she wove her way through the crowds and tables into the dining area and to their table. I knew it had been a while since I saw Lily but... </span></div></div>",

Hell, I might have even picked up on that Marie was a feeder. But nothing, <i>nothing</i> would have prepared me for what I waddled into behind Marie. I almost dropped my plate, that's how shocked I was, I almost dropped <i>food</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off there were two tables dragged together, under my assumption that one table couldn't contain the amount of food displayed. This spread made my Aunt and I's Thanksgiving feast looked like a snack! And Marie just casually sat her armfull of plates down along side the feast before gently and carefully stepping around to the head of the table where Lily sat. And sat she did. Not one, not two, but THREE of the buffets already generous sized chairs where hauled together, as Lily's pasty white ass sat across them and oozed over the sides. Her bare belly was massive! Ghost white like the rest of her and patterned with stretchmarks from her surprising gain, several empty plates collected on top of it's solid orb surface. Lily had to be seated a full four feet away from the table to accommodate it. Stretched across her top was the only article of clothing I could see, a ratty, stained white tank top that looked a threads breath from snapping at any moment. It barely touched her belly, her massive breasts oozing out from the top and sides as no bra could even touch them. Grease stains soaked its surface as her white skin shown through. I even got a good eyefull of her thick nipples pocking out from the tight fabric. Lily HAD to be AT LEAST 700 pounds from my guess alone.....<i>Damn</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\" Lily called, her four chins shaking like an earthquake. Even seeing her old friend didn't stop her from continuing to fork and spoon food into her mouth as she struggled to lift her massive hanging arms. Marie quickly ducked around, cleaning the empty plates off Lily's gut and replacing them with full ones all the while rubbing circles into her bloated girlfriends belly like one might treat a pregnant stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lily?\" I don't normally get chocked up but DAMN. The sight of my previously chubby friend turned massively obese blob had knocked the wind out of me. \"What...happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pasty white Jabba the Hutt sitting at the end of the table laughed, causing her...well...everything to jiggle and shake \"I guess this IS a shock to you Mel! You were always the fatter one after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but....how in the fuck did THIS happen??\" I motioned. My heavy plate of food still resting in my hands. Eventually I just had to set it down on the table next to me, though hopefully Lily wouldn't eat it..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could answer, Marie interjected, her hand still on Lily's belly. \"You're wasting time honey,\" she crooned, gathering some food on a spoon and holding it up to Lily's mouth. Like a trained animal, Lily opened her mouth and moaned as she savored her morsel.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gulping down the spoonfulls of food Marie was providing her, Lily finally caught up and gasped for breath, some beads of sweat rolling down her forehead and onto her cheeks. \"Marie...*uurrrpp* happened.\" the immense fatty replied. The skinny college girl was quick to grab a napkin and dab her forehead dry. Damn this girl was a hardcore feeder, she was really into this! I could hear the threads of Lily's shirt straining as her massive rolls of fat and tits filled up, each breath seemed to gamble with whether or not the dam would hold. \"Come on and sit down *uuurrp* We can pig out like old times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was really the only motivation I needed. I MISSED Lily. I missed eating with her, I missed chatting and hanging with her. So I looked around till I found a spare chair that wasn't under her enormous ass and parked myself on the other end of the makeshift feast table and started digging into my own plate. The food was a little cold at this point, I feel like I had spent hours staring at Lily, but I can't turn down food so I started stuffing myself as well while we attempted to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say <i>attempt</i> to catch up because as good as our intentions were, we were still only two fat girls surrounded by food. We traded some comments, some stories. I caught up Lily on how my Aunt Rhonda was doing. I told her all about our couch potato-ness and how she was basically becoming worse than me. Lily then told me what she had been up to. Marie and her had started dating shortly after Lily had confronted me about her crush on the stick of a girl. They had spent every night studying for finals with Marie bringing snacks, and eventually they developed a feeder/feedee relationship that only grew once school had ended. Now, during winter break she admitted she pretty much spends 24/7 eating, which honestly sounds like THE LIFE. I definitely need a feeder if I'm going to keep up. All the while this was happening, Marie worked tirelessly to keep the table refreshed with food for the both of us, a task harder than it sounds with two of the biggest girls in town at the same table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hours later, the buffet and I was stuffed. More than stuffed. My competitive nature kept me eating far passed any point of being full but I was just outclassed in every corner by a better belly. Leaning back in my chair, I swear we were the only people left anymore, most normal people long since leaving to go home. Marie had, without a doubt, cleared every scrap of food from every buffet line at the end. I'm not sure if the cooks and staffers were happy or mad, I mean it's less for them to throw away right? Though I think any time saved there is going to be spent on this mess of a table. Dishes were everywhere, stacked head high and just as deep. Refill glasses lined the outer edge as Marie brought more and more drinks for Lily to wash down her feast with. And the desserts, oh god the deserts. I had tapped out long before the dessert portion of the meal began but I swear, Lily was sucking down milkshakes like she had just started. Marie rarely leaving her side the entire time. And whenever Lily slowed, Marie was right there to encourage her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, only ten more cookies,\" Marie begged, holding a plate of oversized chocolatechip cookies she had taken from the dessert bar. This was officially the last food on the table, hell, probably in the restaurant and Marie wasn't leaving any leftovers. Lily looked <i>miserable</i>, her eyes watered down and cheeks flushed she panted as she visibly worked up the courage to open her mouth. One. Two. Three. Slowly Marie fed her the remaining snacks as Lily's belly, already visibly more swollen and tight than when I had arrived (what did it look like before dinner?) stretched out just a little bit more. \"There!\" she beamed, laying a gentle hand on the delicate cargo of Lily's belly as she rubbed large circles, her hands occasionally dipping down and sliding under rolls and into her overfattened belly button in a playfully sexual manner. \"I hope you got enough, both of you..\" she purred. Damn this girl was really into this. So different than the meek little twig I first met. I nodded back, too full to talk and slowly drifting into a food coma as I watched Marie step away and talk to a nearby waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could stand up myself, she returned with two staff members already rolling up their sleeves. Jostling me a bit to bring me back to reality, Marie helped me up and out of the way as her and the other employees moved the tables out from in front of Lily, finally revealing the rest of her swollen body. Each man taking one of Lily's arms over their head, they bent down and braced themselves as they lifted the titanic girl off from her sweat soaked seats. It was like watching a landslide. Her belly fell down to her knees, while still remaining as rigid and full as ever as it stuck out in front of her. This caused her massive I cup breasts to fall as well, her tank top gasping for breath as it fought it's final battle against gravity. I thought Lily was going to flash the place right then and there, though thankfully the buffet had already cleared out and only staff remained. Once they got my blob of a friend on her feet, the two men left, pocketing the extra tip Marie had left for their 'services', while Marie herself propped up against Lily to hold her steady, Lily's arm over her should, one arm around her back and one hand placed delicately on her extended belly like a proud mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..\" Lily panted, her face red from the exercise needed to stand up and balance, \"I......had.......fun. We should....totally....do this again....sometimes...\" I swear Lily looked like a woman in labor, obscenely bent back, her dome of a packed stomach pushed out while Marie, her doula coached her through it. Part of me was extremely jealous at everything she had. I'm the one that wanted to get huge and here was my friend out-doing me! If I was ever going to get that big I needed a plan. Maybe now that she's bigger than me, Lily will let me hang out with her and Marie?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..\" I burped, my own dinner being a little big much even for me, \"Who said we have to end here? We can still hang right? It's been so long...\" </span></div></div>",

She had been so jealous of me hanging with Marie when we first met because she knew she was a chubby chaser...and..well..with big ole me around she knew she was lose out. But now? Now Lily was literally so stuffed with fat she needed help simply waddling, putting me and my meager pounds to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....oh!\" she burped, her head turning to Marie as her fat chins piled up under her face. Her cheeks were so fat they were inhibiting her vision as she glanced down at the skinny college student almost as if she was asking for permission. Marie smiled, her head nuzzled into Lily's shoulder fat as she continued rubbing Lily's massive food-packed gut until the bloated whale finally made up her mind, \"S-Sure! I'm sure we could watch Netflix or something at Marie's house..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, the three of us slowly made our way outside and to Marie's car. I decided to ride with them, if only to save a trip. Plus I didn't want to have to call Aunt Rhonda to pick me up as late as it was, I'm sure she would understand. Not to mention shes probably pigged out on the couch all night as is in no condition of course. It took some effort, and a ton of elbow grease on Marie's part but we finally got Lily's massive ass into the passenger seat of her medium sized car. Just barely though, as her stomach was clearly pressed up against the dash board and her fat hung over the shifter. With her belly sitting in her lap, it pushed her massive breasts even higher, I dont think she could even see what's in front of her. Did I mention how huge Lily was? I don't think I even realize it, I think I've been in shock the entire night. Hopping (or grunting and sliding) into the cramped back seat myself, we were finally off. I swear with both Lily and myself in the car the bottom HAD to be dragging the ground as the wheels squeaked and groaned beneath us. My belly full and Marie and Lily being awful at car conversation (Lily couldn't move to talk, and Marie simply had her hand on Lily's belly as she stared silently out the front) I slowly drifted back off into my food coma as the street lights slowly passed over head....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huhgh?\" I moaned, wiping some slobber off my chins as I blinked and squinted, \"I swear I'm...up..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" I could tell it was Marie now, turned around from the front seat facing me as she gently shook my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Want what?\" I asked, still half asleep as I slowly realized where we were........Mcdonalds. Seriously, busted out all night at a buffet and this chick had to stop at a fast food place on the way back? No wonder Lily's so big! Quickly getting my thoughts together, and checking the contents of my stomach I made up my mind, \"Uhhhhhh, I could go for a couple milkshakes I guess...\" I answered droggily, still half asleep. I could see Lily in the passenger seat knocked out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Marie beamed, turning back out the window, \"And two large chocolate shakes! That'll be all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bzzzzt\" the drive-thru menu buzzed to life as the voice of a meek highschooler replied, \"Uhhh I-I o-kay, let's see so you have...three number ones, fours number eights, two number threes, five orders of supersized fries, four large cokes aaaaaannnd two large chocolate shakes. That'll be forty five dollars and six cents, please pull around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think my head about exploded. All that food! Damn, I should have ordered more! Clearly this girl was the express ticket to fat city. A grade-A feeder on the level of that bitch Hannah from the Academy. Except without the psychotic bitch parts....well at least from what I could tell now...Pulling around to the window, Marie paid as the cashier handed her bag after bag of food, all which were delicately placed atop Lily's stomach as she slowly stirred from her slumber. \"Uhhh...thanks..\" I muttered as Marie turned around to hand me my milkshakes, straws already in place. Sipping on each in turn, I sat back and enjoyed my treat as I watch Lily dig into her own bags as Marie pulled back out onto the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long, but soon Lily was double fisting burgers into her mouth as ketchup and sauce dripped down the sides of her mouth. One burger down, two burger down, damn Lily could enter an eating contest at this rate. I was feeling downright....SMALL, what with my 'light' near 500 pound frame and two dwindly milkshakes. I watched with awe as she switched back and forth, shoveling fist fulls of fries into her mouth and sipping on her supersized cokes with Maries help. Lily was relentless, and soon all of her chins, top and stomach were covered the remains of her second feast for the night. Ketchup dribbled onto her shelf of a chest as grease, loose fries, and mixed sauces stained her shirt. She was a slobby mess as Marie turned down a side street and down the beginning of her driveway, coming to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Marie beamed, already starting to gather the piles of trash that surrounded the whale Lily..</span></div></div>",

Without my best (and regrettably only) friend in the world too preoccupied with her new girlfriend to give me the proper amount of constant attention that I required, I found myself clinging to my Aunt Rhonda for socialization. And, as it turns out, latching myself and my incredibly sedentary lifestyle onto my aunt was probably the last thing she needed if she ever wanted to get her figure back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause after spending an entire autumn adhered to the couch on the Mel Carlyle diet, there was no going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of us, we probably had the fattest asses in the county. All that time on our butts sitting down, eating take-out, and watching TV had done a number on us both in the dietary department. I think maybe, towards the end there, I may have gone two weeks without putting on actual clothes\u2014just laying around in my pajamas all day, trying to keep myself at least somewhat decent. My Aunt at least had to get dressed to go to work, but her skirts and blazers came unbuttoned almost as soon as she was in the door before they were eventually replaced by roomier dresses that at least covered her titanic ass. And as the weeks went on, finding clothes that fit either of us were becoming a bit of an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all finally came to a head one Saturday morning in November. We had spent the night before trashing the apartment\u2014Rhonda\u2019s chique bachelorette pad had been trashed by about three day\u2019s worth of takeout containers and boxes\u2014and were just coming out of a night crashing on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel.\u201d My Aunt burped thickly, her sultry purr having been replaced by a curt thickness in tone as she chowed down on a hearty breakfast burrito from the microwave, \u201cRemote.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had, in all honesty, never put on so much weight so quickly in my entire life. A life of constant exposure to TV and takeout food without much incentive to leave my seat had left me gaining so fast that nothing I owned could even hope to keep up with me. My t-shirts\u2014even the big ones!\u2014shied away from the herculean task of keeping my gut sheathed from the world. I was laying down on my end of the L-shaped couch, and my gut rose so high that not only could I not see the glass balcony door, I couldn\u2019t see any <i>light</i> from the glass balcony door. My belly had gotten so huge that it was literally almost as tall standing up as it was big around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUngh.\u201d I whined, smacking my lips sleepily in an effort to get the donut glaze off of my lips, \u201cYou do it. You\u2019re closer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave my aunt my practiced, best pouty-face ever. I\u2019d like to think that my extra chins made me look extra adorable (even if I was rapidly eating myself towards necklessness). She still didn\u2019t budge though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI pay bills.\u201d My Aunt rose one of her eyebrows questioningly while she went to town on her breakfast burrito, \u201cAnd I let you live here for free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a little standoff between us; my pouty princess face meeting her acquired resting mom face as we both silently argued as to who would be the one to get the remote this time. Netflix had done that stupid thing where it asked us if we were still watching\u2014and neither of us were really in the mood to pry ourselves up even the few inches it would require to grab the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFffffine.\u201d My Aunt huffed, shoving the last of her burrito in her mouth, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. <i>Again.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt had probably been hit a lot harder than I had been by our season of immobility. When she sat in her spot on the couch, I was about ninety percent sure that her ass and thighs were about as big around as one of the cushions. Like, I could see no cushion where she sat down. Her pajamas had slowly moved away from \u201csexy\u201d and had officially become more \u201coh my god these fit me.\u201d Gone were her boyshorts and tank tops of the Summer, and Winter had brought in frumpy gray men\u2019s shirts and a pair of spandex gym shorts built for a hippopotamus. Or, at least, a hippopotamus\u2019 ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat in her fixed position on the couch, her belly surged deep into her lap. It had collapsed into two very distinctive folds with a matching set of lovehandles that granted her an impressive muffintop\u2014akin more to banana bread now that she was officially more waist than chest. My aunt had gotten so fat that she officially had to brace herself against the back of the couch to give her enough support to lift that massive ass of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this huge thing that stuck out, I swear to god, almost a foot behind her\u2014and that\u2019s counting backfat too. Living with my Aunt had turned her into a complete porker; and what\u2019s worse, my life was so much fun that she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to do anything about it. She had to arch her back and lean over to get the remote\u2014god, even her <i>arms</i> had gotten all fat\u2014and she gave me the nastiest look the whole time like I\u2019d made her go jog or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear\u2026\u201d she said with great strain, her belly brushing against the coffee table as she leaned over, \u201cThe things that I\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>RIIIIIIIIP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened as my Aunt\u2019s puffy face grew red. I did my best to stifle a giggle, but to no avail. I had a prime view of what had happened too\u2014thanks to the fact that I was smart enough to not get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt had split her sweats right down the middle; giving light to a pair of tight pink panties that looked to have seen far better days. Her hands shot to protect her dignity, leaking out in a diamond-shaped rift in the fabric of her sweats, but found that not only was the hole too big to cover, but her butt was too big around for her to reach it adequately. I could hear her struggle to stay hunched over, breathing heavily already as she rocked uneasily as all that junk inside her trunk weighed her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have gotten it this time...\" I said cheekily, reaching out with my wide wobbly arms to pat my Aunt on her fat tank of an ass</span></div></div>",

Eventually their manager gave up, I even snagged a 10% discount.\"  Rhonda dumped the boxes unceremoniously in front of me on the coffee table.  \"We're gonna need some milk for these- you better cue up something good on Netflix, I need some background noise while I work on my reports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, the pastries were gone before noon.  Oddly enough, I probably only ate, like, a box and a half.  Two, tops.  Serious!  I was still hungry.  Turns out, maybe I wasn't the ONLY reason Rhonda had become rotund.  She was a <b>serious</b> work-eater.  Her right had was committed her mouse while her left hand was committed to jamming doughnut after fritter after bear claw into her ever-working mouth.  No wonder her ass had grown too wide for cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't take more than an hour before I had to complain.  \"Look, I need lunch.  Seriously.  You want anything, or... Uh, have ideas?\"  I asked, somewhat begging.  Let's be real, I don't have the cash, or the energy, to get something to eat.  However, it seemed Rhonda didn't either, at least on the energy side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze, we just <i>urp</i> finished those pasteries, but my purse is on the table, just grab my card and get something, okay?  Take my car, too, I gotta take care of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly <b>shit</b>.  Access to the car AND the card?  Hell, fucking, yes.  \"I'll be back soon, okay?\"  And with that, I was off.  Off with freedom, off with unlimited money, off with... No idea what to get.  Lucky for me, there was the fast-food equivalent of the Las Vegas strip not even two blocks from my super-rad Rhonda's house, and within a half hour, I had the front seat- and part of the back seat, as well- loaded with fast food.  I hadn't even looked at the receipts, just drove, ordered, and grabbed.   The car smelled of grease, the card was hot from swipes, but I had easily overloaded the car with calories, and as I huffed and puffed through the doorway with load number one (of, I had estimated, four), Aunt Rhonda closed her laptop, which was alarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for her to say, \"What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food didn't stand a chance.</span></div></div>",

But I was pretty sure that all my Aunt had done was completely forgot that, you know, when you eat too much, you get fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and it's kinda hard to stay full when your Aunt is eating more than you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should've been in heaven, what with tons of greasy treats within reach.  But the thing is, Rhonda was snagging bags almost faster than I could reach for them- I mean, the woman ate an entire double bacon cheeseburger in three bites!  And the way she was hitting those fries, holy shit!  As I grabbed one of the sodas, I actually took a break to watch her eat.  I would almost feel impressed if I wasn't also being actively cheated out of glorious calories.  And so, I decided to say something.  \"Say, uh, Rhonda?  You... Okay?\"  I asked, kind of dumbly.  She obviously was fine, if the rate she was eating was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just tryin' to eat quickly before I get back to work...\"  She muttered before throwing three chicken nuggets into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't quite sure where to go with this.  \"Oh, yeah, uh, is work kinda... Stressful?\"  I asked, feeling more awkward by the second.  To calm my nerves, I grabbed a large fries and began mowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda sighed- <i>actually fucking sighed</i> and finished off the last of the chicken nuggets.  \"Look, I- I just have a lot on my plate, okay?  Seriously, I honestly wanted to work from home so I could avoid people bugging me while I was trying to get work done, this stuff is so stressful.  I just wanna eat my lunch and get back to work, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taken aback.  I thought we were doing alright here, but damn- either she was in serious denial about her weight, or she was legitimately stressed out.  I put my arms up in mock surrender.  \"Sheesh, sorry I asked!\"  She didn't have to get all bitch mode on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's fine.  I'm sorry for snapping at you, I just need to get back to it.\"  Well, that was as good as it was gonna get.  Guess I'd just need to be a bit more aggressive with my food grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in the end, it didn't really make much of a difference.  Even with my Aunt and I growing our appetites by mach speeds throughout the previous months, we were no match for the pounds of greasy garbage I brought home.  I was half asleep, food coma coming on strong, when I heard the click of a laptop opening.  I opened my eyes to see my Aunt, casually leaning back and resting her laptop on her generous gut.  And, I guess she didn't know I was awake, because I watched her grab her flab and <i>grin.</i>  Okay, she definitely knew about her gain... Did she like it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was family related...  I'd have to test my theory later.  For now, I just let me stomach grumble as it digested and fell back asleep.  I couldn't get anything done while I was stuffed stupid...</span></div></div>",

Once I mentioned in passing that the Boutique Grande-Belle (the <i>only</i> place in probably the whole state that could cater to a girl of my significant size) was right down the road from the Big Burger that Lily and I used to go to all the time, convincing my aunt became an effortless endeavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I wasn\u2019t lying about the whole \u201cno clothes\u201d thing; I really had eaten my way out of my latest wardrobe. Since Aunt Rhonda had slowly but surely become just as lazy as I was, that meant that we were <i>both</i> procrastinating in making sure that my beautiful blubber had some cover. That isn\u2019t to say that she was faring any better, what with her increasingly rapid\u2014and suspicious!\u2014weight gain. We both just had to throw on whatever we could find, and hope that we didn\u2019t run into any familiar faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully I managed to walk away with some nicer clothing before we left. Well, before Aunt Rhonda dragged me out of the store. I got a new top, a sweater, some jeans, a pair of leggings (I know, right?!), some sweats, and a big comfy hoodie. It wasn\u2019t much but it offered enough variety to keep me clothed for a while. At least, until I put on another forty pounds\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have gotten more, but my Aunt wouldn\u2019t have any more waiting. She\u2019d picked out all her clothes\u2014mostly blazers, skirts, and a pair of cute yoga pants that I talked her into\u2014and was waiting on me to waddle my fat ass in and out of the dressing room with increasing frustration. Long before I was ever really \u201cdone\u201d (as if I ever got tired of an excuse to check out how fat I was getting) she took me by the hand and lead me to the checkout counter, ending my shopping spree before it could ever really begin in favor of getting us out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin five minutes of swiping her credit card, my Aunt and I were looking for a booth in the Big Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank <i>gawd</i>.\u201d My aunt puffed as she plopped down into her seat, still stuffed like a sausage into her old Apple Dumplin\u2019s t-shirt, the one that had once upon a time been far too big for her, \u201cI thought I\u2019d never get you out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I was a little pouty at being forcibly taken out of the Boutique so early, but this is what I wanted, right? Food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, shit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo see if my Aunt Rhonda was really a closet feedee. Right. Sorry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to get her here, to the Big Burger, because I wanted to test my hypothesis. I had noticed that my Aunt Rhonda was beginning to take too kindly to my lazy life of indulgence, and I had begun to make my own theories about why. She\u2019d been ordering more and more food, and doing her best to take the lion\u2019s share for herself\u2014plus I had actually caught her manhanding her belly with a big smile on her face when she thought I was \u201csleeping\u201d. Seems like pretty damning evidence, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, over the course of our little auntie-niece luncheon\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Helloooooo-\"  Our server began, her cheerful demeanor not even slipping a smidgen as she practically skipped over to our table.  She must have known by my- err, <i>our</i> sizes that this wasn't going to be a quick table, but the bill (and by association, tip) would sure be more than enough to justify the effort.  \"Welcome to Big Burger, my name is Sally- and I'm gonna go ahead and say you've been here before!\"  Jeeze, the smile on this girl's face could've melted an iceberg, with how warm it was.  Truth be told, we had been here, about a dozen times, but she had no way of knowing- I'd remember this server anywhere.  She was one of those \"pear shapes\"- you know, she's got a skinny face, modest waist, practically no boobs- but holy shit if her hips and ass weren't wide enough to catch anyone's eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I know exactly what I want to start with.\"  Wow, Aunt Rhonda wasn't messing around today.  \"And I know what she wants, too.  I'll have the double BBQ burger with onion rings AND the fries, and she'll have the double olive and onion burger, extra swiss, with fries and onion rings as well.  On top of that, we'd both like a chocolate malt, and... Hmm, Mel, you want the mozzarella sticks or the fried pickles as the appetizer?\"  I kinda blanked, to be honest.  I was watching our server's face.  You see, I know there are three kinds of people in this world in relation to women like me.  There are:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Those who are disgusted, and make no show of hiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Those who are ambivalent, but care enough about what people think, so they hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Those who love extra padding, and want to see more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this girl definitely fell into category three.  You could tell by the face she made when my auntie-dearest ordered 60$ of food \"to start with\", how she didn't even try to pretend we weren't connoisseurs of this fine dining establishment, and the way she didn't even hesitate to write down every single bit of food my aunt demanded the second the words left her mouth.  And it certainly didn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were about two minutes into our appetizers (Aunt Rhonda ended up getting both, of course)- my mind was struggling to focus on the original game plant, to measure Aunt Rhonda's gluttony and maybe get to the bottom of it, when Sally returned with our drinks.  \"Sooo...\" She began, as if unsure of how to word it.  I quickly counted the malts on the platter- lo and behold, there were three, not two, along with those fancy metal cups that they mix them in, you know, where they leave the extra.  \"We had a table walk out.  So here's your malts-\" She deposited the drinks in front of us, and as I suspected, both sets of cups were filled to the brim.  \"-and here's their malt- it's banana chocolate, but I figured at least one of you would enjoy it!  Anyways, food should be out soon!\"  And with that, she sauntered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I couldn't help but stare!  I mean, damn, for a pretty small girl, that ass was out of control!  I found myself idly wondering how people with that awkward body shape buy pants, before Aunt Rhonda had the <b>audacity</b> to steal some pickles off my plate.  \"HEY!\"  I shouted a bit more loudly than I intended, which caused Sally to whip her head around and stare at us.  I quickly diverted my stare at her posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\"  My aunt laughed.  \"When you start paying for food, I give you full permission to steal off my plate.\"  She laughed- I scowled, playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna regret that!\"  I muttered, quickly scarfing down the remnants of my plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, long story short, my brain kinda forgot why I was there in the first place- to surveil on Rhonda.  See, it didn't stop with the malts.  When our burgers came out, we got an extra plate of fries.  When we were wrapping up, we got refills on our malts (something I know from experience isn't practice at Big Burger).  Hell, I was coming close to being stuffed, while Rhonda was looking a bit worse for wear.  We were both breathing heavier than usual- I was letting out low belches while Rhonda's cheeks puffed out every now and then- she wasn't as unashamed as myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the check came, I had completely forgotten about Rhonda- I was more interested in Sally.  I could see her saying something through that little swingy-door that leads to the back kitchen, before she came to pick up the check.  And when she came to the table to grab it, she was carrying a take-out bag that looked pretty darn full.  \"These are some leftovers that we were just going to toss, but I figured you ladies could have them!\"  She sounded as cheerful as ever, but there was a slight undertone to her voice that I couldn't quite place.  She thrust the bag into my hands while grabbing the cash from my aunt, who assured her she could keep the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we started to slowly walk/waddle our way to the exit, I decided to check the bag.  There was a <i>lot</i> of stuff in there- some cookies, a slice of their pie (their fucking amazing apple pie, that is), a container of- judging by the smell- bleu cheese chicken wings.  And to top it all off...</span></div></div>",

Fucking. Called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, proverbially. That is to say \u201cI knew she was a fucking chubby chaser, I knew it knew it knew it!\u201d, but I digress. I <i>did</i> actually call her though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, was it <i>weird</i>? A little, yeah. Sally looked to be a little older than me, maybe early-mid twenties, and I hadn\u2019t exactly known her as anything other than a waitress at Big Burger. But I\u2019ll be honest when I say that I was getting a little bored of just me and my aunt laying around stuffing our faces\u2014without Lily around, my social circle had taken a low blow, taking me from \u201ctwo people in the whole state\u201d to \u201cmy aunt, who I sometimes fight over food with\u201d. I hadn\u2019t been asked out on a date since Christmas Break in my Junior year, I figured, y\u2019know, why ask to many questions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I would have liked to say that I texted her right then and there, I was a little preoccupied with all the goodies that Sally sent us home. Despite being pretty friggin\u2019 full, I managed to snack on some of the more tantalizing tidbits of her little gift. By the time we made it home, my Aunt and I had put a pretty big dent in the bag\u2019s contents, with her snagging half the apple pie slices (I trained her too well!) and splitting most of the cookies with me. We weren\u2019t fifteen minutes into our customary post-binge-episode-of-whatever on Netflix before the bag was completely decimated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want the truth, I was more focused on trying to remember the exact curvature of Sally\u2019s big booty in her uniform than I was with trying to figure out my attraction to Tenant\u2019s Kilgrave. I don\u2019t know if it was because I was lonely, or if it was because she was the first person to give me any sort of romantic attention since I\u2019d moved down here, but I couldn\u2019t get that girl out of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time my aunt had lapsed into a food coma, cradling her distended gut with the tender love and care of a bonafide piglet, it was a little after midnight\u2014just one episode of Jessica Jones into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew it was a little late, but I couldn\u2019t resist. I hadn\u2019t felt butterflies in my stomach like that in a while. I whipped out my phone and started tapping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey it\u2019s Mel from Big Burger.\u201d I texted, deleting and rewriting several times over, \u201cThanks again for all that yummy food ;)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expected to have to wait, since she was still probably closing the store, but I got a response almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour welcome cutey\u201d she sent back, \u201cI love spoiling my best customers\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell its allllll gone.\u201d, I bit my lower lip as I continued forward, my confidence soaring as I failed to keep my smile in check, \u201cWe ate it all up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way :o\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached for the bag, struggling against my oceanic gut, and took a quick picture of the crumb-dusted but otherwise empty contents. I forwarded it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSend moar? I\u2019m still REALLY hungry :c\u201d I sent with a picture of my face, making this overexaggerated puppy-dog pout, \u201cMy mean old aunt only let me eat half of it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally\u2019s next message took a bit longer than the others to come, making me a little worried.

Even as I struggled to remain graceful, however, the springs beneath the sofa began to groan in agony as soon as my fat ass seemed to touch them. Given the circumstances, it wasn\u2019t quite so bad. It was loud though, and I wanted to at least <i>look</i> polite\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d I said half-heartedly as I nestled down deeper into the couch. I gave my gut a loving little pet as I spread my legs <i>that</i> much farther apart than they already were, making it surge outwards as it pooled off of the sofa, \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind a little noise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d Sally purred, biting her bottom lip as she seemed to drink in the sight of me, beached on her couch, \u201cI\u2019m going to go get the pizza. You just wait <i>right</i> there, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally sauntered into the other room, presumably the kitchen, while I did everything I could to at least appear like I wasn\u2019t desperate. Her gait was slow and sensual, her wide hips and full cheeks bouncing up and down as she purposefully put a little extra wiggle into her step. Once she reached the doorway, she craned her head backwards to see if I was, indeed, watching her walk and she smiled. Her brown eyes seemed to twinkle, even in the sad bachelorette-pad lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh <i>God</i> I was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl\u2014this Sally chick that I had only just formally met a few hours ago\u2014<i>god</i> she knew how to turn my crank. I\u2019d been tingling ever since I sat down, sparking from the way she looked me up and down. Watching her big round ass move and shake the way it did, listening to the soft contours of her voice, rereading those texts we\u2019d sent each other all the way over? I was getting hornier by the second, and the unmistakable smell of cheese and grease lingering in the air wasn\u2019t making things any easier\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Mel, here it <i>is</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like, for real, just talking. I know that might be kind of hard to believe considering all the <i>not</i> talking we did last night, but we really didn\u2019t do much anything else. I mean, we didn\u2019t exactly get to know each other the night before, so why not the morning after, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point I had mentioned that I was hungry because goddamn I had burned a <i>lot</i> of calories last night. Not enough to burn off literally any of the entire pizzas that I had binged on, and not really even \u201chungry\u201d, just\u2026 not full. I guess. I don\u2019t know. Sally was quick to head into the kitchen and came back with an entire box of donut holes for me to snack on while I worked up the energy to stand by myself, but that just sort\u2019ve turned into me laying in bed, eating donut holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean\u2026 I <i>rationed</i> them pretty wisely, I think.

But no breakfast.\u201d I grunted, rubbing the small section of my stomach that I could still reach, \u201cLike, for real, those donut holes are killin' me. I\u2019m legit gonna die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to lay splayed out on my side in order to sleep, otherwise I would have been crushed by my own gut last night. And I still had room to wiggle around, even with Sally doing her damndest to play big spoon. The frame of her bed was metal, and judging by how well it took to me being aboard it, I guessed that it had to have been reinforced. Something told me that this wasn\u2019t the first time that Sally had a girl of my size in bed with her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, if you say so.\u201d Sally said with a pout, \u201cMaybe you want to do tomorrow?

Sally let out a little squeal as she wrapped her legs around me, and wrapped around me like a koala bear. Unfortunately, she wrapped around me too tightly. She squeezed out the loudest, nastiest, <i>angriest</i> burp that I'd ever heard in my entire life.

The sweater was it's own issue- I had gotten it a little bit messy while mindlessly gorging on pizza- focus on food and sex, but certainly not keeping a few dollops of sauce off my massive tits and bulging belly.  The leggings were an issue because, well, they just didn't fit right.  Putting them under my belly was a necessity, but I wouldn't have attempted to put any sort of pressure on my monstrously bloated midsection to begin with.  But the weight of my center mass just meant the leggings were doing a poor job of covering my ass properly, as Sally eagerly pointed out to me as I stood, slightly breathless just from getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sally, I know they don't fit, and neither does my sweater- that's what happens when you constantly gain like, five pounds a week.\"  Her eyes got wide.  \"Okay, that may have been a liberal estimate.  Although, at this rate...\"  I grinned a little, still trying to get used to this whole 'flirting with another girl' thing- although after the sex-bomb night I had, I found it was pretty easy to push my comfort zone a little further than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you ripping out of them in no time, don't you worry.\"  She said with a happy wink, and I almost tackled her right then and there.  Gaining alone was fun.  Having a sexy, extremely flirty feeder?  It was putting my sex-drive into overdrive.  There was a thud from outside her room, like someone just fell out of bed.  \"Oh.  Shit.  Hey, so, I don't actually live alone...\"  She began as she quickly threw on her pants to work uniform.  \"My roommate, she, uh...\"  Sally was whipping her head around, and looked rather frazzled as she threw on her uniform shirt as well- Ugh, even in her shitty unflattering work uniform she still looked so damn <i>hot...</i>  \"She's- well, we don't see eye to eye on some things, but maybe we can-\"  Sally stopped as there was a sound of a door opening in the hallway.  \"Well...\"  She muttered under her breath.  \"Maybe she's in a good mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of boxes being shuffled around in the other room- presumably the pizza boxes.  \"Seriously, Sally?\"  Sally hung her head as she walked out into the main living room-style area... It was weird watching this confident, aggressive woman acting so timid all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I had a guest over, as I'm sure you can tell.\"  I began to head out behind her as the mystery roommate sighed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was me, hi!  I'm Mel.\"  I said as friendly as possibly as I scoped over Sally's roomie.  Her eyes grew wide at the sight of me, which was understandable, given my current attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup.\"  The girl said flatly.  \"I'm Tess.\"  I looked her over- she was pretty average, honestly- she made Sally look a lot larger in comparison.  Tess was a darker skinned girl, and she was adorned in the typical 'Just woke up' attire of a tank top and some loose sweatpants, which emphasized just how, well, normally shaped she was.  \"Yeah, well, I heard.  Try and keep it down next time, okay?\"  She headed towards the door.  \"I'm gonna run to the gym- please at least pick up these fuckin' boxes.\"  And then she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt awkward, which was weird, because making people uncomfortable was kind of my M.O. as of recently, even if it was usually unintentional.  \"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally started gathering up boxes.  \"Typical Tess, can't even be nice to a stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she didn't seem surprised- I take it this is a, uh, regular thing?\" I said bluntly, feeling a little hurt.  Sally whipped around and I could tell I hurt her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not exactly getting bigger girls over here all the time, Mel.\"  She frowned.  \"I, uh... Tess and I kinda had a thing.  A while ago.  Like, half a year ago.\"  She blushed.  \"Um, Tess used to be a bit bigger...\"  I held up a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get it.  It's a little weird to be rooming with your ex, isn't it?\"  Sally frowned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we had just renewed our lease like, two weeks beforehand.  We barely ever interact with each other anymore, but... Yeah.  We broke up when she figured out my, um, preferences- I may have been tempting her an awful lot with food and stuff.  Now she gets weird whenever there's junk food in the house, probably because it reminds her of, y'know, not being a frigid, no-fun bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over and put my arm around her, squishing her into my massive frame.  \"Well, I'm sure I'll get on her good side, eventually.  That is, assuming we're gonna repeat last night in the future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally pushed away from me, grinning.  \"How's tomorrow night sound?\"</span></div></div>",

I was still winded by the time that I waddled over, but I managed to park my fat ass on the bench before anyone else came up and decided to take those precious few inches away from my spacious derriere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI collapsed onto the metal bench, pouring off of it in every direction. The corners of both my ass cheeks filled the arms as my ample amounts of backfat sought to clog the gaps in the wood framing. I spread my legs as much as I could, hoping to alleviate the still pain that was still very present in the pit (and every other part) of my stomach. I know that I wasn\u2019t the most <i>active</i> girl, but I really shouldn\u2019t have been that tired from walking out of Sally\u2019s apartment, down to the parking lot, and parking myself on a bench. It had to have been the fact that I was still struggling to digest the better half of a pizzeria. Seriously, I was probably sweating cheese and pepperoni grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of sweat, I was pretty ripe. Sex with Sally (awesome, AWESOME sex with Sally!) had been the most exercise that I had probably gotten in <i>years</i>. I had pushed myself harder in the bedroom than I ever had in Coach Knight\u2019s gym class back in Sophomore year, and boy was I beat. Sweat literally rolled off of me. Rolled off my rolls. It couldn\u2019t have helped that I was lugging around a pizza baby in my belly, or that I was wearing a sweater on top of being <i>very</i> well suited to winter climates. I needed a shower\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t really paying attention to anything. I was so tired. The bus probably could have rolled up right in front of me and I wouldn\u2019t have noticed. So when a certain dark-skinned gym rat sauntered up behind me, I was caught completely off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess had changed outfits, probably while I was sputtering and rolling myself down to the bus stop. She\u2019d traded in her t-shirt for a tank with some logo on it that I probably would have recognized if I worked out, and her sweats for a pair of leggings that hugged her at the hips. Her frizzy black hair was pony-tied behind her, a perfect little ringlet coming down to bounce against her caramel colored forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 hi?\u201d I smiled from my seat on the bench<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess looked at me, didn\u2019t respond, and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, real talk? I had never been around anyone\u2019s ex. Like, <i>my</i> anyone\u2019s exes. Probably since, like, fifth grade. I didn\u2019t exactly have the best romantic life in Buttercombe Academy considering that I was surrounded by other women (though if I\u2019d known that was an option for me, I probably would have had a much better time!) and that translated into me being awkward as fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s, uh\u2026 it\u2019s cold out.\u201d I continued, against my better judgement, \u201cYou, uh\u2026 you don\u2019t need a coat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarm myself up at the gym.\u201d Tess said flatly, despite the goosepimples forming on her exposed arms, \u201cGet my body moving, get blood flowing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere Tess paused to look me up and down as I sat my nearly five hundred pound self on a bench, bending the poor thing with my elephantine ass. I was dressed in what I had on last night, so that meant that I was pretty much flaunting my body in such a shameless way that even I felt a little self conscious. My belly was still so swollen, and my leggings were damn near ready to give up the ghost. They probably would as soon as I got up to board the bus (if it ever showed up.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you probably wouldn\u2019t know much about that.\u201d Bitch said to me, \u201cYou\u2019ve got your <i>own</i> way of keeping warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddammit, you see what I mean? I\u2019m fucking <i>terrible</i> at this. I mean, normally I would just say like \u2018screw off\u2019 or something of equally witty report, but how was I supposed to handle snarking Sally\u2019s ex-girlfriend? Who she <i>lived</i> with? Who she had to live with until her lease was up? I couldn\u2019t just bitch back\u2026 could I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I get that you\u2019re Sally\u2019s new\u2026 <i>whatever</i>, but I don\u2019t appreciate you two fucking up my place.\u201d Tess snarled, folding her arms across her incredibly modest chest, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be the bitchy ex-girlfriend. So I\u2019ve only got one thing to say to you, and after that, we can be\u2026 whatever. We don\u2019t have to talk, we don\u2019t have to communicate, we don\u2019t have to interact. You do you, I\u2019ll do me. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 k?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTess uncrossed her arms, took a step closer to me, and said\u2026</span></div></div>",

Don't get in my way, or whatever.\"  And then she was off, jogging back to the house, presumably.  Uh... Okay?  It was definitely high up on there on my list of weird encounters that made no fucking sense, but whatever.  My bus squeaked up (finally) and I clambered on board, before whipping out my phone... And then pausing.  Tess obviously made my dear sweet Sally (Okay, I fell hard, fast, don't judge) uncomfortable, and now I was about as uncomfortable as I had been since I tried to wedge myself into a seat with arm-rests on it at a restaurant and spent the whole meal feeling like I was in a vice grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould I say anything to her at all?  For all I knew, this was some weird thing between the two of them- Oh man, what if they had some weird kink thing where the two of them played good cop bad cop on some poor, unsuspecting fat girl and then spent all day giggling about it on their couch-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cut myself off mid-thought.  That was a dumb line of logic, and besides, I could easily clear this up in a matter of two seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly pressed my pudgy fingers against my screen, texting Sally almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>so... ran into Tess while waiting for my bus.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left it open ended, knowing she was at work and probably didn't want to be distra-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy phone vibrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"right\"><i>Oh.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, so I managed to get home and all that jazz. Took the bus, swallowed up the majority of a row with my big fat ass cheeks, and then I waddled through the front door of my Aunt\u2019s apartment to find said aunt in a Mel Carlyle patented state of undress. She had apparently been having something of a ball since my mysterious disappearance the night before, if the amount of containers, wrappers, cartons, and other various insedit signs of a good-old-fashioned stuffing were any indication, and I can\u2019t say that I blamed her. I\u2019d like to think that if she shoe was on the other foot\u2014if my Aunt had hooked up with some hot chick and disappeared for the night\u2014I\u2019d be just as okay with it as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to tell her about Sally, if only to explain the Mel-shaped absence on the couch last night after she woke up from her food coma. I tried not to go into too great of detail (for example; I left the <i>entirety</i> of our stuffing session out. She\u2019s my aunt, and that would have been weird!) but I more or less gave her an outline of what had happened. Our waitress was cute, she gave me her number, so I went over last night. She seemed pretty cool with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you <i>liked</i> girls.\u201d My aunt said with a wry wriggling of her eyebrows as she sat reclined in her chair, double chin framing her face, \u201cLook at you, getting experimental.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t either.\u201d I said with a shier smile than I care to admit, taking a nervous sip of my bubbly soda to calm the still roaring tides of my stomach, \u201cHey, I guess no one comes out exactly straight after spending four years surrounded by other women, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had you pegged.\u201d Rhonda said with a snort, popping a bonbon into her mouth, \u201cEver since you and that Lily girl had that little spat, you\u2019ve just been eating and eating and eating, and\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmigod <i>auntie</i>! Lily and I were <i>not</i> a thing.\u201d I puffed, unable to hold back an embarrassed redness that plastered itself all over my face, \u201cI-I\u2019ve been eating because\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe-<i>cause</i>\u2026?\u201d My aunt twirled one sausagey finger, allowing one hand to fall back limply on the swell of her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh\u2026\u201d Shit. Couldn\u2019t tell her the real reason, could I? \u201cI mean, I <i>do</i> miss Lily, but\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d My aunt said dismissively, \u201cThe point is that you have a <i>new</i>-slash-<i>first</i> girlfriend, and that\u2019s fine by me. It\u2019ll be nice to have this place to myself once in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious by my sudden intrusion and the fact that she was still dressed in what she had on when I got here that me being in the apartment clearly didn\u2019t affect her one way or the other. She had on one of my shirts\u2014albeit one that fit me more snugly than I liked\u2014and wore it like a nightgown. She certainly had the hips to fill it out; it clung tightly to her fattened, heart-shaped thighs and made a nice tablecloth for her shelf of an ass. Beyond that though, my aunt had grown a keen distaste for pajama pants. She was wearing underwear, but \u2018topped\u2019 was about as clothed as I could expect her to be at most points during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo to celebrate me landing someone as hot as Sally, my Aunt suggested that we order in as if we didn\u2019t already constantly do that all the time. <i>I</i> think that it was just an excuse for her to stuff her face (like she needed one) but the thought was still very sweet. We called in Pizza Pie! and we ordered from Mexican Pepper, Sub Shack, just\u2026 well, pretty much everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though I had really pushed it last night, I was beginning to come down. Plus, knowing that Sally liked my body almost as much as I did gave me incentive to pick up the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during that \u2018picking up the pace\u2019 (which, btw, lasted for <i>quite</i> a while!) that Sally finally called me. It had to have been after her shift at the Big Burger, but if you want the truth, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what time it was. The night before had just served to exhaust me\u2014again, probably my most exercise <i>ever</i>\u2014and all this eating with my aunt just made me sleepy. I had honestly forgotten all about Tess and her attitude until Sally called me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c<i>Hey beautiful!</i>\u201d Sally said on the other end, \u201c<i>How\u2019s my favorite slumber-partier doing?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, doing good.\u201d I tried to respond casually in front of my aunt, not that she cared, \u201cSitting here, eating with my aunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>That\u2019s great, I love that you care so much about your figure.</i>\u201d she said with a little purr, \u201c<i>What\u2019s on the menu?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d I surveyed the damage done to our living room, \u201cPretty much everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Not Big Burger! I would have totally loved it if you came and saw me!</i>\u201d I could practically see Sally\u2019s face bend into a fake pout<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s kinda hard to lug\u2026\u201d Again, I tried to be as not-weird as possible for my aunt\u2019s sake, \u201cAll of <i>me</i> around. You understand, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Point taken, point taken.</i>\u201d she answered, moving on with a giggle, \u201c<i>So guess what? I talked to Tess.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Aaaaand\u2026<i>\u201d<br>\r\n</i></i></span></div></div>",

That might be a bit much, like, 48 hours after our sordid affair.  \"<i>No, actually one of my coworker's parents own a bunch of small townhouses around town, and they're gonna rent me one for cheap- hell, it might actually end up being cheaper than rooming with Tess after all the utilities...</i>\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this was definitely some great news- my aunt was still staring at me so I flashed her a quick thumbs up, mouthing the words \"I'll tell you in a bit\" before returning to the phone.  \"Well, I gotta admit, I'm probably not gonna be much help moving...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't worry about it- I wouldn't want you burning all those calories, as long as you're there to help me break in the place afterwards...</i>\"  I blushed, <b>hard</b>, and was relieved to see my Aunt was busy stuffing her face again and ignoring my phone call.  \"<i>Annnnyways, I know you're with your Aunt, so I'll let you go.

I blushed even harder, grateful that my single-minded eating habits were apparently derived from my Aunt, because- if her earlier ribbing was any indication- she'd be giving me some serious shit about how red my face was, not to mention that awkward end of the phone call, but luckily, she had found a renewed love for empanadas.  Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you seriously eat all the empanadas?\"  I asked incredulously- we had gotten six of them, and they were untouched when I got on the phone, oh, 2 minutes ago?  I got a guilty stare in return.  \"Ugh, just hand me the tamales, then.\"  Another guilty stare.  I sighed and reached for the pizza box, which, miraculously, still had a fair amount in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were pretty boring, to be honest.  I texted Lily a few times but she was pretty much exclusively with Marie, which was a bummer but still adorable- I told her that <i>I</i> happened to be seeing a lady, which got me about a hundred :O faces and a promise of a girls night at some point, but I guess she was pretty booked.  Sally texted me a lot, but between working, packing, and figuring out moving stuff, she was too busy to spend any real time with me- and since moving my bulk from the house was a pretty severe ordeal in it's own right, hanging out for only an hour or two was kind of a big turn-off.  We finally made plans to meet up- she said her place was in an insane state of disarray, but she suggested we check out this Chinese Buffet place that was right by my place, because, and I quote, it would be \"Super fucking hot to watch you gorge yourself in public\".  So, even though it was literally a ten minute walk away, I left almost a half hour early, because honestly?  I felt like it'd be in poor taste to show up soaked in sweat, so I figured by the time I had cooled off a bit, I'd be semi-presentable.</span></div></div>",

My Aunt and I had gone there a couple of times, back when she was still skinny, and I\u2019d heard Lily gush about it here and there on the off chance that I got to talk to her. It wasn\u2019t exactly the nicest place\u2014most buffets aren\u2019t\u2014but I decided to get just a little dressed up. Just a little, y\u2019know? This would be the first time that I had actually gotten to <i>see</i> Sally in what felt like forever. I didn\u2019t want to give the impression that I was some doubty fat girl who couldn\u2019t fix myself up despite her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said, I left about thirty minutes early to accommodate for any potential sweat-related anxiety. It was getting warm again, which meant that I had to plan accordingly. I put on a flowy top (well, it <i>used</i> to be flowy) that was made of some really comfortable material. Once upon a time, right after I had gotten out of Buttercombe, it was one of my best-fitting Summer shirts. But after nearly another year of gain, it had begun to fall short of expectation. Whereas before it managed to cover my swollen tits and engorged gut with ease, my ample gain meant that I was testing its limits. Instead of covering my belly and coming down to touch the top of my thighs, it now stopped squarely at the outermost edge of my stomach, right at my widest, and left a creamy white ring of pudge for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy leggings, custom ordered from a site an old Buttercombe alum showed me, seemed to be showing their age despite faring better than any of my tops. These were the same brand that I had worn to Sally\u2019s that night, and while those handled pretty well all things considered, I knew that if things continued with Sally like I <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">thought</span><i>hoped</i> that they would, I\u2019d need to order another size or so up. These ones were the same size as what I had worn to her place on our first night together, and they barely managed to hold me in after everything that I had eaten. Which meant good news, that they would probably still hold me for another twenty pounds or so, but unless I wanted to start eating without pants on (any more than I already did), I would need to go ahead and plan accordingly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t put on any makeup at home because I would have just sweat it off on the walk over, so I made myself up in the bathroom. Nothing too fancy\u2014I was never too big on makeup. Some eyeliner, a little lipstick, and I was more or less good to go with about five minutes to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI claimed our table (booths and I did <i>not</i> get along at my size!) and I was seen by our waitress and I confirmed the party and blah blah blah. The reservation was under Carlyle, and I told the hostess to be on the lookout for a redhead with a fine ass, because that was my date. She nodded, smiled, and asked me if I wanted to go ahead and get myself something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I think I\u2019ll wait. Don\u2019t want to spoil my appetite or anything.\u201d I gave the waitress a wink as she placed my drink down in front of me, \u201cAs if that\u2019s possible, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there I was\u2014sexy, confident land whale about to meet up with her girlfriend for the first time in almost a week. I had even showed up early and everything! But soon the clock struck 7, and there was no sign of Sally to be seen. And then it was five after, and then <i>ten</i> after\u2026 I got a little worried!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, you know, I\u2026 I had been sitting in this restaurant, surrounded by all the wonderful smells that hung thickly in the air. The sound of dishware clinking against each other, plates clunking against tables as overfed patrons plopped themselves down for meals with their fat families. I could hear the sizzling of the grill in the back and\u2026 and it was making me a little wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had purposely held myself back from stuffing myself like a piggy so I could give Sally a show. I had even let my Aunt finish off our lunch and <i>forgone</i> our early dinner so I would have plenty of room. So when she wasn\u2019t there, and I had done all that walking, and my tummy was <i>so</i> empty, I just\u2026 well, I figured, what was the harm in getting started without her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and waddled over to the service bar, where all these delicious, greasy foods were just plopped in front of me, ripe for the taking. I felt my mouth water before I even realized that I was salivating, my belly oozing and pouring onto the rim of the bar. I grabbed a plate\u2014just one!\u2014and got myself something to snack on; a little pile of lo mein and some eggrolls. No big deal, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was suckling on my second eggroll before I even sat down, the cushioned seats deflating beneath my ass as I plopped down. They were so good; I drowned the third little sucker in soy sauce and crunched it between my teeth while I worked on his youngest brother. And then I just started chowing down on the lo mein\u2014those greasy noodles were <i>greeeat</i>. I had gone so long without food, hours by that point, that my synapses started to sizzle at the hint of a stuffing soon to come. I was so excited, so <i>eager</i> to begin my binging that I hardly noticed when I dropped a noodle on my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d I whined, putting my fork back on my now-empty plate, \u201cMy shirt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ruined, at least as far as the evening went. Orange-brown sauce outlined the wriggly curves of the noodle, ruining my top. I tried to wipe it off, you know to see if it was so dark because there was still grease on it or something, but my hands were still sticky with soy sauce! I had made it even worse, and Sally was due any minute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta fix this\u2026\u201d I mumbled huskily to myself as I braced myself for getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I was <i>totally</i> going to do that. I swear. I was going to go to the bathroom, take off my shirt, and rinse it off in the sink really quick before I used one of those hand-jet things to dry it off. It might not have worked <i>completely</i>, but it would have at least made some of the damage that I had already done a little less obvious\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my intentions only lasted as soon as I saw the buffet lines. All that delicious, greasy shit sitting in pans, glistening underneath heat lamps? On an empty stomach? I spent more time than I should have just staring, gawking, <i>trying not to</i> just give into my baser instincts. My mouth was salivating, I enviously watched some chunky Asian guy sneak a bite of chicken before piling his plate high with the stuff. My gut gurgled greedily, <i>demanding</i> that I satisfy her. I put my hands on its drastic outward curve, inadvertently spreading the stains to my flanks. I was so hot, smacking my lips like the hungry cow that I was as I tried to resist the sweet siren song of the unlimited buffet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they put out the sweet and sour chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went fucking ballistic. I changed my course right that fucking second and got a tray with four plates on it. I stacked them high with as much greasy, fatty shit as it could handle. I stacked shit <i>on top of</i> shit. No entr\u00e9e, no sides, just fucking food. All of it a messy disorganized gorge in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat back down and started stuffing my face. Loudly. I just ate and ate and ate, bite after bite going to fuel my heightened appetites. How could Sally have expected me to go this long without eating? She should have known that a big, greedy girl like me couldn\u2019t have held off on eating while she whatevered the time away. I was a mess, a big fat mess, who completely ignored the family atmosphere of the buffet as I started moaning while I ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2026 have some regrets about that. But that came later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear, I binged for an hour. Sally was so fucking late, but I didn\u2019t care. Being with her, after our first night together, my eating switch had been flipped on. I didn\u2019t care who was around me, I didn\u2019t care who watched, I just wanted to stuff my fat face until I couldn\u2019t stuff my fat face anymore. And then have someone stroke me and call me a fatty or an oinker or a cow or <i>whatever</i> and then coax me into eating even more, more, <i>more</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s\u2026 healthy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, like I said, I binged for what literally became an hour before\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So there are times, in mostly every person's life, where they get stood up.  Some people go home and get drunk, some people just shrug it off, some people go apeshit at whoever it was that stood them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just <i>ate.</i>  I mean, look, it was kind of a perfect storm type situation, I had an elevated level of emotions, and there was a lot of food around me.  Look, a perfect storm with me in general is just a lot of food, period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kind of went off the deep end, and I think it was around the point where I was just grabbing egg rolls off a platter and eating them standing up that I sort of came out of my psuedo-trance.  I glanced down at my shirt, which was now a far cry from \"presentable\"- it was coated with crumbs that were stuck to probably every single Asian-style sauce imaginable, which meant my front was essentially a rainbow of high-sodium, high-MSG content.  Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI munched down on the last egg roll and tried to take stock of where I was at.  I definitely wasn't like, so stuffed that it hurt, but I knew from experience I was about two plates away from that point.  So naturally, I grabbed three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't just a sad binge, this was a fuckin' <i>bender.</i>  There were a lot of logistics I hadn't quite worked out yet, such as:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>How I was going to get home<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow I was going to even get out of this building<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow I was going to explain to my aunt why I looked like I feel into a dumpster filled exclusive with chinese food.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut those were all at the back of my mind- for now, I just wanted to gorge until I felt like splitting open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was basically brief periods of lucidness in between bouts of one of the most aggressive stuffings I've partook in in quite some time.  Later, on reflection, I'd realize that it wasn't even entirely anger at getting stood up - it was just sexual frustration.  The things I had felt the other day with Sally was beyond anything I had physically experienced and the thought of it happening again, alongside the sting of getting bailed on- well, it just kind of turned into a weird sexually frustrated food fuck-fest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at some point, about 4 plates past where I probably should've stopped, there was a sharp tickling on my leg- I looked down and of course my fucking leggings now had a massive split down the side.  I let out a sigh that immediately turned into an aggressive belch- and that's when I <i>really</i> felt how full I was.  I immediately let out several more belches, which did nothing to help with the incredibly pain and pressure in my gut.  It was like I had swallowed a molotov cocktail- I was sweating, something I hadn't even realized, and my previous moans of pleasure from the abundance of food in front of me were now non-stop grunts of horrible discomfort.  Belching wasn't doing anything, and when I briefly tried to rub my gut in a way that always helped, even the gentlest strokes felt like sharp punches to my insanely engorged gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, I kind of lost sense of time.  My head lulled back and I normally would've felt embarrassed - not because of my overstuffed state, but, I dunno, passing out at a buffet was probably a low point for me.  At some point, I realized that it was now most definitely night-time, and a glance at the clock on the wall told me I had been here for over two hours.  Which seemed like a long time, so I decided it was finally time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurching off from the table, I swallowed nervously.  Standing was painful, with my body wanting to lean forward due to the large mass of food that was now resting firmly in my gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy yourself?\"  The older woman at the front asked me without a trace of irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put a fist to my mouth and belched, trying hard not to let it be as loud as it felt like it would be and failing miserably.  \"You could say that.\"  I grunted as I slowly shuffled out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there I was.  I was so fucking full and fat and overwhelmed with the amount of greasy garbage that I had just shoveled into my body that I briefly considered sleeping on a bench rather than try walking home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I thought about calling my Aunt, before realizing she had mentioned she was having a girls night with some ladies from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I thought about calling Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nope</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I realized I had to call an Uber or something, and just hope that I didn't get someone with a Prius or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I looked at my phone, I saw about twenty missed calls.  Slightly caught off guard, I realized I hadn't looked at my phone in two hours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were literally all from Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a voicemail, but I realized with a sinking feeling that I hadn't even bothered trying to see why she was late- I just stuffed my face on a whim.  Oh God, what if something happened to her?  Something serious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately called her.</span></div></div>",

I had spent the last two hours (give or take) stuffing my face like I had never managed to stuff my face before. I was topped off to the point of popping, and I was a confused wreck of pain and embarrassment and relief that Sally was okay and that <i>we</i> were okay and I was <i>so</i> fucking horny, I just\u2026 I\u2019m a whiner, okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHey Mel, I was wondering when you\u2019d call\u2026\u201d</i> Sally said, sounding a little relieved herself, <i>\u201cIs\u2026 everything okay?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d I moaned, \u201cI\u2019m stuffed and my tummy hurts and I can\u2019t\u2026 I just can\u2019t even!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou actually went out to eat <b>without</b> me?\u201d</i> Sally scoffed, more amused than offended, <i>\u201cYou didn\u2019t pick up because you were too busy pigging out on what was supposed to be <b>our</b> date?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! You weren\u2019t answering and\u2026 and I thought you stood me up!\u201d I bellowed into the receiver, all this talking was really taking the wind out of me, \u201cI eat when I\u2019m upset.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI would never stand you up, you big dumb dummy\u2014there was a grease fire at Big Burger, I got held up.\u201d</i> Sally cooed, <i>\u201cMy poor little piglet.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m poor. Come get me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI squeezed myself into a park bench while I waited for about half an hour for Sally to roll up, but with my super-stuffed state it felt much longer. I just sat there, cradling my belly and whimpering as city folk just sort\u2019ve passed me by. Some gave me stares, other lingering looks of curiosity, but I paid them no mind. I was consumed entirely by the throbbing mass of mess stretching my stomach, drawing it tight and taut. The worst part was that, unlike in my own home, I couldn\u2019t just up and take off my pants or roll up my top or whatever. I had to remain at least <i>somewhat</i> dressed, lest I be charged with public indecency. My poor tummy was doing its best to swell out of my sweater, but even as it pushed the hem further up on my gut, all it did was press tightly against the fabric. It may as well have been a miracle when Sally showed up, if only because that meant soon I would be able to slip out of those uncomfortable clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEy gurl.\u201d She said playfully, putting her car in park on the curb, \u201cHeaded my way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally drove a surprisingly large car. It wasn\u2019t like, A-Team van or anything, but it was definitely a lot more vehicle than a bootylicious redhead like her needed. I mean, I didn\u2019t exactly know her life story yet, but I didn\u2019t think she was like, denmother to a bunch of girlscouts or anything. Why she needed all that space, I didn\u2019t know. And frankly, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care since at the time, I was more food than girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmigawd <i>yes</i>.\u201d I huffed, throwing my arms off my gut and pushing against the bench. Sally soon came to my assistance, and between the two of us, we gathered enough momentum to wrestle my thighs out from between the arms, \u201cSave me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was standing, I could see Sally marveling at the size of my stomach. All that food had made it pretty big, and it was rock-hard\u2026 at least, where it wasn\u2019t soft and jiggly. It was a big, two-tummy-tiered ball that came and went with my labored breathing. I winced as she put a hand on it, sizing me up like an overripened watermelon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, Mel.\u201d She whistled, a familiar (and moistening) look in her eyes, \u201cMaybe I need to stand you up more often\u2014you seem to eat more by yourself than when I\u2019m around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 you dare\u2026\u201d I panted, touching the back of Sally\u2019s hand with mine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy rambunctious redhead gave me a swift swat on my sizeable seat and opened the back doors so I could wobble into the back seat of her car. I found myself with plenty of room as I claimed the middle seat, the van somehow managing <i>not</i> to groan in agony as I lowered myself onto its suspension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to have air-conditioning on my big sweaty gut. I\u2019ll tell you that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally climbed back into the driver\u2019s seat and put her steed into reverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 where we headed?\u201d I asked weakly, \u201cNow that, you know\u2026 we\u2019re together?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For another thing... Well, the night with Sally where I gorged myself was practically orgasmic even <b>before</b>, you know, the actual orgasming part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pig, it's not my fault you went overboard when I wasn't there to enjoy it...\"  Sally bit her lip.  \"And for another thing, I had a <i>really</i> long day, and it would definitely cheer me up...\"  She batted her eyelashes at me innocently, but I had a feeling that I was going to be eating whether I was up to it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could eat a small snack...\"  I burped loudly afterwards, emphasizing the point that I probably didn't need anything resembling a small snack.  Sally just grinned.  \"But I'm sure as hell not getting out of this car.\"  I said, and reclined my seat.  \"Wake me up when we get there...\"  I dozed off pretty damn quickly- honestly, I would've rather gone home and collapsed into bed, but I figured I needed to spend a little bit of time with Sally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up to a bag plopping into my lap, causing me to lurch up from my reclined state, my belly surging forward and pushing the bag onto the floor.  \"Good job, girl.  A plus, seriously.\"  I grunted as I snapped the seat out of it's reclined position and futilely reached my hands down to grab it, but of course my titanic tummy prevented anything more than pathetic grunting and arm waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it, stop, you look so ridiculous!\"  Sally giggled as she lithely snatched the bag up and thrust it into my awaiting arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the bag and saw a ton of fries.  LIke, a shit-ton of fries.  I reached in and felt around a bit...  \"Did you seriously buy three large fries?\"  I said, amazed, but still shoveled a handful into my mouth.  \"I mean...\"  I said with my mouth half-full of fries.  \"That's usually like, a mid-day snack for me, but...\"  Sally just stared at me, and that's when I saw there were two more bags sitting in her lap.  I gulped the fries down nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, there's variety...\"  She said with a grin, reaching into a bag and pulling out a burger.  \"Twenty-Five bucks gets you a lot of <i>foooooood</i>....\"  She waved the now unwrapped burger under my nose, and I instinctively took a bite out of it.  \"And I'm not taking you home until all of these bags are empty.\"  I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sally...</i>\"  I groaned as I swallowed the burger.  \"I'll <i>explooode...</i>\" I was only partially joking- while I was happily shoving french fries into my face, it was only an hour or so ago where I was so stuffed full of sodium soaked chicken, beef, rice and veggies that I thought I would literally pop, and now I apparently had several pounds of McDonalds to eat...  But I also knew that if Sally was as into me as I figured she was, then talking about exploding would definitely push her buttons- and although it was fairly dark in the parking lot, and we were quickly moving past dusk territory, I could tell she was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  She said, her voice breathy, \"I could watch you eat <i>all</i> night, so feel free to eat slow...\"  She reached out and began lightly rubbing my bloated gut as I went to town on the french fries.  I let out a happy grunt as she rubbed my overwhelmed midsection, and began eating with renewed vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most fast food feasts, despite my better judgement, the three bags that were overloaded with burgers, fries, chicken nuggets, and apple pies were quickly emptied, and if I thought I was a mess after my buffet binge, now I was <i>really</i> in rough shape.  Despite Sally's loving rubs, my gut was now pulsing with pain, and if I was alone I'd almost certainly be miserable- but thankfully I had a helper who managed to rub out belches and hiccups while I tried my hardest not to pass out.  I was vaguely aware of the car moving at some point, and when it stopped again I opened my eyes and saw stars.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot figuratively, I mean it was now officially night.  \"Whaz- Whu...\"  I let out a belch that rattled the windows of the car and caused an excited giggle from Sally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's after ten, dear.\"  I groaned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI basically had glutted myself to the max, twice, in three-ish hours.  That was a pretty impressive night for me, at any rate.  I was more of an \"eat all day\" kinda girl, rather than \"overglut myself into a stupor every few hours\" girl, to be honest- but that surely wasn't as entertaining for my sweetheart Sally.  I tried to respond.  \"Yeah, well-\" But another loud belch rumbled out of my gut before I could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me...\"  Sally said lustily, \"If I had my druthers, I'd make our night in the other day look like child's play, but, and trust me, this breaks my heart, I have to do a double shift tomorrow- we have a lot of cleaning to do after that stupid grease fire.\"  I groaned, partially out of frustration, partially out of pain- my belly was gurgling like crazy trying to process the metric ton of grease I had shoveled into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gon'... I'm gonna need a... Day to digest, anyways...\"  I huffed as Sally slid her thick rear out the door and walked around to open my door for me- so chivalrous!  \"I... don't know if I could handle any... <i>physical</i> activity... Anyways...\"  I huffed as Sally helped me inch my way out of the car, which was an olympian feat in it's own right.  I eyed the walk to my Aunt's and almost started sobbing.  Every shuffling step was misery, since my center of mass felt like I had shotgunned ten pounds of ball bearings.  Somehow, Sally managed to navigate me into the apartment and into my bed- thankfully, my Aunt still wasn't home from her night out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think we made out a bit, but by the time I was in bed and undressed I was starting to pass out- I distinctly recall her sweetly kissing my forehead before slipping out, though, and as I slipped into a bona-fide food coma I realized I was falling pretty hard for this girl, and <i>fast.</i></span></div></div>",

Gotcha -- and went off to bed for as long as physically possible. This case meant about fourteen hours. When I woke up, around one or two, I checked my phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Text me when you wake up, piggy <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You up?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>:(</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly -- or as quickly as my pudgy fingers would allow -- replied back that I had just woken up. Not feeling too bad after not having heard from her last night for such a length, I left my phone and slowly, determined, pushed my stiff body up off the bed. Yawning loudly, I pat my belly which had returned to its naturally squishy demeanor. And yet, my hands missed the vague but obvious stiffness that came with being stuffed and as a gurgle and a growl came, I realize, I missed breakfast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess I'll have to have a brunch twice the size as usual!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day Aunt Rhonda would go grocery shopping, and so I took no remorse in quite literally clearing out two cabinets and half the fridge. I would list for you what came out of there and went into my belly, since I know how much you, dear reader, loves to know what I stuff myself with, but the list would be too exhaustive and so I hope that knowing that my brunch lasted almost two hours clues you into how much food went into my gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took another fifteen minutes to cradle my once more swollen and aching belly in my fluffy arms, and burping loudly, took that as a sign I should probably see if Sally had replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA four minute walk back to my room -- nothing. Nothing? What the fuck? NOTHING? This was fishy. I sent another text, something flirty along the lines of <i>Just stuffed myself for you ;)</i>. I waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while I became hungry again and still no response! I huffed angrily. That fat-ass flat-chested jerk. Ugh. If this was the way our relationship was going to go, I might as well just go date the Burger King. He may not be real, but at least he's consistent. I cleared out another few cabinets and other half of the fridge (and freezer) for dinner, and, that's when I heard over the sound of my gas and chewing my ringtone from the other room. Sally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow I managed to get my fat ass up and over to the phone before the ringer stopped. I picked up. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mel?\"</i> she was crying, <i>\"Can I come over?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was hoping to guilt her into bringing me food, I decided to simply tell her yes, quite emphatically (emfatically). I sat faithfully by the door, and, when she arrived, opened it. She ran straight into my arms. Conveniently, I felt the warmth of a bag of McDonalds on my left love handles, and the cold XL soda on my right love handles. That's what I call a perfect match.</span></div></div>",

Uh, again?\"  Sally gave a pathetic little snort as she laid her head onto my thick thigh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you could say that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allowed her to lay there, because it left both arms open for grabbing food and/or beverage from the coffee table without having to navigate around a second person.  It was cute, though- it had been a while since I intimately sat on a couch with someone.  \"I'll try not to drop food in your face.\"  I added as an afterthought, which got me another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"  She trailed off, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uh... Wanna talk about it?  Or did you just come over here to feed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, sniffled, and began.  \"So.  You know, with us just meeting like, what, two weeks ago, I feel like you're gonna think I'm like, a slut- you shouldn't have to hear about two of my exes within like, three days of each other- but... Well, you're gonna have to trust me on this one, I don't have a lot of them- exes, you know, and I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shushed her by putting my less salt-coated hand on her lips.  \"Sally, we're both adults- I don't really give a shit how many people you've dated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a smile that seemed more genuine than the previous.  \"Well, for the record- it's three.  I'm not a fan of <i>dating around</i> or whatever... But with my track record, well...\"  I took an eager bite out of my second burger, waving my hand in a 'get on with it' kind of fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, before Tess there was this guy, Ross.  I, uh, wasn't sure of my... <i>Preferences </i>back then, and he was- well, he wasn't charming.  He wasn't even nice.  He was just, kinda... There.  When I was... Lonely.\"  She blushed.  \"I sound like a fuckin' scumbag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph-\" I paused to swallow, reaching for my drink and accidentally dripping the condensation on her face, which she wiped away with a frown.  \"No, no- trust me, I get it...  I went to an all girls school, I know about <i>wants and needs.</i>\"  She grimaced at me, but continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, there isn't much to say- we dated for like 8 months, he was an asshole all the time, we broke up and I thought he moved away for good.  I guess he's back in town though... He was always on my shit about getting into shape-\"  Her voice took on a mocking tone. \"<i>Sally, you're lucky you have me, no other guy would put up with your fat ass, you need to get to a gym...</i>\" She let out another sniffle, and looked on the verge of tears.  \"I didn't used to be so self confident, you know?  And, well, he came in today, did his whole 'Oh shit, it's Sally!' thing to all his douchebag bros, and then just... You know... Said shit... About me.\"  She closed her eyes and turned her head and I felt the warmth of tears on my leg.  \"I understand the irony of letting comments about my body get to me, what with...\"  She trailed off, but I got the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly put down my drink, careful not to drip on her again.  \"Sally.   Hey.\"  She kept her eyes closed, but when I put my hand on her arm, she grabbed it with her opposite hand.  \"That guy?  He doesn't matter.  You're... Well, you're absolutely gorgeous- who the fuck <i>cares</i> what he thinks?  I know we haven't really known each other for long, but, for what it's worth, I think your ass is <b>amazing.</b>  And so is the rest of your body.\"  She smiled, and turned her head back upwards to face me.  I saw her eyes glisten with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked.  \"Trust me, girl, if I didn't, I would <b>not</b> have let any of this stuff between us happen.  But the things you made me feel, back at your place?  Let's just say, it hasn't left my mind since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell by her current shade of blushing that my last comment had done the trick.  \"You know, you're right- <i>fuck</i> Ross.\"  I gasped as Sally snapped upwards and kissed me, flipping awkwardly on the couch and cradling my gut, nuzzling affectionately into it in an awkward crouched position, jutting her sizable ass up into the air slightly.  \"As for that night, why don't we repeat it?\"  She purred into my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  I said, awkwardly.  I mean, I had to admit- I would have <i>loved</i> to cum again like I did that night, but there were two issues, which I decided to lay out to Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, I honestly already ate pretty much anything worth eating in this place, and, uh, the McDonalds is pretty much gone.  And two, my Aunt Rhonda is gonna be home, y'know, soon?\"</span></div></div>",

At the rate we were going, how much more I had started eating once I got around her, we weren\u2019t exactly practicing abstinence. But she had just told me about her stupid jerk ex-boyfriend and I really wasn\u2019t feeling it after all that and honestly, the girl just looked like she could have used a nice night in. So I gave it to her! No strings attached (except that she was on drink duty\u2014she had to keep my cup full, because I wasn\u2019t in any shape to get up and down like that!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually my Aunt came home, exhausted from a long day of not being on the couch stuffing her face, and collapsed into a bootylicious heap on the opposite side of the sofa. It took her a minute or two to register Sally\u2019s presence, and even longer to realize that we weren\u2019t fucking each other\u2019s brains out. Hardly a moment went by back then when we could be in the same room together and not be doing <i>something</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and thought for a second, cupping her thick second chin, before finally saying (and I\u2019m not shitting you here):<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Sally\u2026 you being here reminds me\u2026\u201d my Aunt purred, \u201cI could <i>really</i> go for a burger right now. If I gave you some money, do you think\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie!\u201d I threw a throw pillow at my Aunt (hey, that\u2019s what they\u2019re for, right?) and scolded my increasingly gluttonous relation, \u201cMy girlfriend isn\u2019t your burger delivery girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Mizz Burkhart.\u201d Sally said chipperly, \u201cI\u2019m Mel\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn skippy.\u201d I said proudly, crossing my arms willfully, though with great effort<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo skippy.\u201d Sally said with a peck to my cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made my aunt laugh\u2014one of those belly laughs where we could see her jiggling beneath her blouse. She rocked a little on her big fat butt as she gripped the arm rest, before finally coming back at us with:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I pay Mel\u2019s rent\u2014unless <i>you\u2019d</i> like to start chipping in\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 burgers?\u201d Sally turned to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could eat.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd\u2026 you know, it was nice! I think it was that night that Sally and I really realized that we could just\u2026 y\u2019know, <i>exist</i> together. Without all the dirty stuff. I mean yeah I still ate a lot, but that was just because it was me. And Sally still watched me, of course, but that\u2019s just because she\u2019s a little freak, and I couldn\u2019t help but love her for it; but it wasn\u2019t <i>why</i> we were hanging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI liked Sally. Like, as a person. Not just as a set of legs and access to cheap burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought I was hot as shit, she was great in the sack, and she could get me all hot and juicy in two words, where some of my other partners had needed a two hundred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and I\u2019d like to think that our relationship went from\u2026 not exactly <i>superficial</i> but certainly <i>baby</i>\u2026 to something a little more complex. Sally and I saw each other most nights during the week, and while we weren\u2019t screwing like chubby-chasing little rabbits anymore, we were actually having a <i>better</i> time than ever. Getting to know each other, building bonds, kindling the fire of our romantic passion for one another\u2026 you know, all that stupid bullshit that you totally don\u2019t get until you\u2019re actually in a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to put on weight, of course. With Sally\u2019s help, I crested a quarter ton, and started working dutifully on the rest of the tonnage to come. I pretty much needed help doing anything as I got closer and closer to middling at 550, which gave me <i>plenty</i> of excuses to keep my sexy little assistant around, doing things for me (and to me, should the mood strike us!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, things were going <i>great</i>\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So...\"  Sally said out of the blue one night.  She fondled my belly happily while I busied myself with a double cheeseburger in my hands.  Now normally, I'd double fist double cheeseburgers like nobodies business, but Sally had been getting a little... Creative, with my burger orders.  This thing had to be at least a pound, if not more- and it was completely loaded up with the works- fried onions, fried pickles, mayo, guac, and possibly some chili sauce?  I couldn't tell but it was a fucking mouth orgasm, and even though it was a little harder to chow down on due to the sheer girth of the thing, it was well worth every sloppy bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, I knew Sally didn't mind when I got a little messy with my eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wussat?\"  I grumbled before taking another heavy bite.  <i>Fuck</i>, this burger was good- and judging by the bag Sally had brought over, it wasn't the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had just settled in for the night- Sally was trying to get me into some show about some comic, but it was all gritty and had a lot of talking and not a lot of action, so I was happily busying myself with food.  It wasn't like her to try and talk to me when I had barely even begun to glut myself- it cut into my eating time to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... You couldn't have just laid around eating all day every day before we started... Y'know.\"  I smirked, my face undoubtedly coated in various <i>accoutrement</i> from my monster burger, which I was 2/3 of the way through and, shockingly, already not feeling the normal roaring hunger that overwhelmed the first half hour of my almost daily gorges with Sally.  That was impressive in it's own right, and for a split second I had my doubts about finishing multiples of the thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel?  Sweetie?\"  Sally was waving a hand in front of my face.  I swallowed my tremendous bite of burger and glanced at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... I, uh... I have friends.\"  I said, lamely.  My gut grumbled and I dutifully took a bite.  Maybe my doubts about eating more than one of these had been unjustified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally grinned at me.  \"Some friends they must be, if you've almost never mentioned them... And I don't see them blowing up your phone or anything...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned.  She wasn't wrong, I hadn't spoke with Marigold or Lily in more than a hot minute- Sally and I were hanging out almost every day, and every day I was usually glutted into such a state that I slept until I heard from her again- often, my post-binge comas tended to last upwards of nine hours before I was even in a remotely coherent state, and by then Sally was usually blowing up my phone about all the food she was gonna jam in my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, I'm pretty sure I had gained like, two pounds a day since Sally and I began hooking up constantly, and all that extra weight, on top of all the extra weight I was already lugging around, meant I was basically the human incarnation of lethargy and laziness, which meant getting a hold of old friends wasn't really high on my list of things to spend energy on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim, I grabbed my phone (after wiping my hand off on a napkin, of course- no sense gunking the thing up) and pulled up my contacts.  Sally watched, one eye cocked at me.  The phone buzzed not even five seconds after I had sent my text, and I quickly replied before putting the phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess what?\"  I said smugly before jamming the last chunk of burger into my mouth, and almost immediately regretted it- this burger was pretty dense, especially with all the toppings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She asked happily, reaching into the bag and pulling out, which gave me a bit of a pause, and I swallowed happily before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going on a double date tomorrow- also, how many burgers did you bring?\"  Sally grinned at the words double date, and her smile grew alarmingly wide at the burger question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double date sounds fun.  And for the record, I've brought four burgers-\"  I felt my stomach rumble, but was it out of hunger or apprehension?  \"They won't be too much for you, will they?\"  Now it was my turn to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out...\"  I said as I snatched one from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, long story short, I ate until I felt fit to burst, which is something that I could safely say I hadn't felt in a while- While Sally kept me stuffed on the daily, either at my Aunt's house place or at her new swanky digs (but more often than not, my Aunt's place, mostly because me moving around was, y'know, hard to do).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, I was so stuffed that I barely remembered saying goodnight- by the time I had forced down that final burger I was fit to burst and it was all we could do to get to bed, but I <i>did</i> remember that Sally and I agreed to meet up at four, so we could meet up with Marie and Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI learned the next day that Sally had thoughtfully set an alarm for me to wake up at two in the afternoon.  So I showered (which, at my size, meant a lot of creative usage of a detachable shower head), managed to find something semi-decent to squeeze into... Sally had graciously gone out and bought me some pants and shirts with at least five X's in the size description.  And I am fairly certain she is a miracle worker, because, again, I was able to squeeze into them without ripping anything, which was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she picked me up in her awesomely oversized SUV (\"It had my name on it!\" she had claimed when I finally asked why she owned a vehicle more suited for a family of five, and given her taste in women, it was obvious she liked things <b>big.</b>) and we made our way to our current destination... A wonderful Italian place with decent prices and absolutely outrageous serving sizes- which meant I could order shrimp alfredo, chicken puttanesca, baked ziti, fill up on bread, and still have the bill be less than triple digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been Marigold's suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we pulled up, I suddenly got anxious.  I hadn't seen Lily or Mary in a while, and while Sally felt like the missing link in my life and I had no problem spending any amount of time with her, or talking with her, or getting intimate with her, I suddenly didn't know how I was going to deal with the closest thing I had to best friends around these parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sally was as bubbly as ever, her charm oozing out of every pore as she hopped out.  \"What?\"  She asked, sticking her head in the door of the car.  \"You need help getting out?  That'd be kinda hot, all things considered...\"  She purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just... I haven't seen these two in a while.  I mean, last time we hung out, I don't think they were really even a 'thing', it's just...\"  Sally shut her door and was around on my side before I even registered- for such a thick-bootied girl, she could certainly move when she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, hon, you are one wonderful, sexy, <i>perfect</i> woman and anyone would be lucky to call you your friend, now lets get in there- you need yourself some heavy Italian dishes, I can tell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was certainly enough to get me motivated.  I got out of the car (with no help from Sally, thank you) and we headed inside- where we were immediately accosted by a very cheerful Marigold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked almost nothing like the meek, timid Marigold I remembered.  Sure, she was still basically a stick, but she was actually wearing a dress that one might call \"casual-formal\", which is something I'd never catch the Mary I thought I knew in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MEL?\"  She practically shrieked, before burying herself heavily into my side fat, which immediately enveloped her lithe form.  Such an outburst certainly wasn't her usual MO, neither was a bodily hug.  \"I was so so <i>so</i> excited when Lily told me you texted her!  And this place?  It was my suggestion!\"  She let go me and gave me a wink, before turning to Sally.  \"And you... You must be Sally!\"  Sally's eyes had gone wide- this skinny little thing had basically accosted me, whereas my description of Marigold was \"Tiny and quiet\".  It wasn't long before Sally was embraced as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, hey Marigold, sorry I haven't gotten a hold of you or Lily in a while, I just-\"  I began, but was quieted with a wave of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even mention it- I can see you've been busy...\" This got a tiny smile, but a knowing one nonetheless.  \"Well, we already got a table, although Lily had to run to the bathroom, she should be here soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait!\"  I said sincerely, and Sally agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when Lily did finally show up...</span></div></div>",

I wonder what had caused it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's...\" Marie paused, taking a sip, \"...eating well..\" she gave me and Sally a <i>very</i> obvious wink. Oh god this girl is worse than Sally. I mean my girl's obviously...forward..but it seems so much more..<i>more</i> coming from sweet delightful Marie. Beside me I could see Sally squirming in her seat. This session of chewing the fat with another closet feeder clearly making her drool in more than one place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>UUURRRRRPPP</b></i>...Sorry for the wait guys..\" a husky voice bellowed out from behind me. Spinning around I was nearly smacked with a face full of porcelain skin from a very bulbous stomach. My first instinct was to let my jaw drop to the floor, but Sally had gripped my hand so tight on my thigh she was digging her nails into my pants. Lily was massive. Not quite as large as I was, at least not post-Sally, but clearly catching up and fast. Unlike the three of us who had taken the chance to dress up for the occasion, Lily made no such effort. A white tank top stretched across her chest like a bra, her nipples poking out through its thin fabric. Down low she was shoved into a ripped pair of grey sweat pants that her waist oozed over on all angles. Her stomach and side fat was littered with red stretchmarks as it sloshed from side of side as she painfully waddled to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up, Marie yanked out a chair for her girlfriend to sit on. The heavy Lily resting a hand on her gut as she side stepped in front of it. A large roll hung over her crotch yet the majority of her stomach was a drum tight ball in front of her that seemed to throb with each breath. As soon as her shelf of an ass hit the chair, Lily let out another massive belch as she panted to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you....okay?\" I paused. I had no idea what to say right now. I hadn't seen Lily in months and she had clearly been busy..but while Marie was eager to greet Sally and I, Lily seemed too busy keeping herself together to notice our presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrp....Mel! It's good to see you!\" she beamed, finally catching up to the conversation as she scooted into her seat. \"Y-yeah, I'm fine. Marie just <i>insisted</i> we stop at both McDonalds and Dairy Queen on the way here and I had to...empty the tanks..if you know what I mean.\" she gave me a knowing wink as she gently patted the top of her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha yeah it's been awhile I guess...\" I shifted. This was incredibly awkward....sooooo incredibly awkward..looking over for support from Sally she...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was an awkward pause.  Well, I assumed it was awkward, anyways.  It felt really long.  Honestly, I was just struggling to recover from the sight of Lily.  I mean... Last time I saw her, she was... Well, she was fat.  But not like, massive?  Not massive like me, anyways.  But now... I snapped out of my trance as Sally finally released her vice grip on my thigh.  \"Hi, I'm Sally!\"  She said, overly eager (in my own fucking opinion) as she extended a hand across the table, to shake Lily's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I struggled to be mad at her as I watched her lean forward to shake Lily's hand- There's two things that could always break my bad mood: Food, and Sally's indescribable backside, but let me try anyways: Disproportionate, wobbly, and most importantly: <i>sexy</i>.  You would think that someone with a body that was never not <i>wobbly</i> wouldn't find \"wobbly\" sexy, but here we were.  Anyways, I was a little hurt by Sally's response, but not too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, Lily, this is my- my girlfriend, Sally.\"  I'm not gonna lie, it was weird calling her my girlfriend.  I was still adjusting, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\"  She said, as cheerfully as possible.  Lily was eyeing the air behind Sally and I hungrily, and I watched as her expression relaxed right before our server popped up. \"Hi, <i>Staceyyyy!</i>\" She said, dragging out Stacey's name in a way I didn't think was necessary, only for our server (apparently named Stacey?) to respond in her own, overly enthusiastic voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lily and Marie, my favorite customers!  Your usual 'Warm-up'?\"  I turned around to look at our server, only to watch as she winked.  I didn't know Stacey at all, but she seemed to have some sort of relationship with my two closest friends- I would guess she just liked their tips and wasn't into land whales, but I could be wrong- seeing as my current relationship involved a server who preferred heavier girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Why don't you, uh, triple it?  I mean, we have guests!\"  Marigold- sorry, Marie- gestured to us.  \"-And they're clearly hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry!\"  I offered happily, eliciting a friendly laugh from Stacey, and Sally, and Marie as well- Lily just seemed focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, triple the appetizers, got it.  Any drink orders?\"  She asked, friendly and professional.  I had to admit, this place was pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... A pitcher of Coke?\" Marie asked, before Lily grunted- <i>Literally grunted</i> at her.  \"Sorry, two pitchers?\"  This got a nod.  Stacey happily took off towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" I began, awkwardly, but Sally kicked in immediately- talking to Marie immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lily looks awesome!\"  She basically shouted.  Lily, oblivious, was looking at the swinging door separating us from the kitchen.  \"Seriously, I'm impressed.\"  Marie blushed, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's... She's definitely awesome.\"  Hearing the word 'Awesome' come out of her mouth was weird enough...  What came next was even weirder.  \"Honestly, I think she could get a lot fatter.\"  Sally's hand slapped back onto my thigh.  \"I mean... Fatter that... Well, fatter than Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes shot wide as our drinks returned, along with 3 baskets of chili-cheese fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHREE BASKETS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean... As far as appetizers go, a basket of chili-cheese fries felt more like an entree.  Easily a pound of french fries drenched in cheese sauce and chili, they were a mess.  They also didn't fit the \"Italian\" theme of the place.  Of course, Lily and I didn't notice, and began shoveling them down.  I heard, in my hunger-fueled glut; Sally ordering for me while Marie ordered for Lily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fettuccine<br>\r\nRotini<br>\r\nGarlic Bread (two orders)<br>\r\nMinestrone<br>\r\nSpaghetti<br>\r\nCarbonara</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Sally ordered \"the same\" for me, and the rest of the night was kind of a blur from there.  I ate and talked to Lily in between bites, while Sally and Marie talked in between... Well, I dunno, In between their observation of me and Lily?  We really went nuts.  Honestly?  I don't remember most of it.  Those chili-cheese fries, combined with the pitcher of soda I chugged alongside Lily?  I mean, I was in full-blown glut mode immediately, and I didn't really snap out of it until the car ride home, when we hit a particularly rough bump, causing me to belch in a way that didn't sound entirely human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... <i>FUCK!</i>\" I shouted after the painful eruption.  I attempted to rub my own massive front-side, only to fail to find energy to do so.  \"Babe... I don't... I don't feel so good...\"  I grunted, my hands idly flexing as I failed to give myself a relaxing belly massage- Something that, I had to admit, was happening more commonly as I consistently gorged myself in front of Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you went pretty wild- I'm not gonna lie, it was pretty hot, baby...\"  Sally muttered, but her eyes stayed locked ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You-\" I stopped, took a deep breath, and continued. \"You seemed pretty into how Lily looked...\" I grunted- I was barely awake at this point, so I wasn't feeling particularly venomous, but I was still frustrated.  I mean, I didn't expect her to look so... <b>large</b>.  But Sally couldn't take her eyes off of her!  I mean... As far as I could recall, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel.  Sweetie.\"  She placed a hand on my gut, which caused me to wince.  \"You'll always be the sexiest girl to me.  Seriously.\"  I grinned, despite myself.  \"I just... You told me Lily was... Small.  And she isn't.  That's... Hot, you know?\"  I couldn't bring myself to be upset.  Even I, the lardy lass that I was, couldn't hide the fact that it was pretty impressive that Lily was that large.  \"Look... I can prove it to you.  In like... 3 minutes, provided you're quiet...\"  I shook my head- Sally was a pro at a lot of things, but making me finish quietly was <b>not</b> one of them, <i>especially</i> when I was stuffed, and I didn't feel like waking up my Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to sleep, Sally.  But-\" I started, but Sally already had me figured out- she leaned over (very easy, thanks to her thinner midsection) and kissed me- <i>hard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing.  I love you.\"  She said, grinning at me. As I moved forward to embrace her, she gave me a caveat.  \"You know, Lily has almost hit your size already.  You can't be mad at me for finding that hot.\"</span></div></div>",

You can't be mad at me for finding that hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words rang in my head for days as both Sally and I recovered from our double date. I don't know why they bothered me so much. Was it simply that Sally found another girl attractive? Was it because even though I was gaining at a steady rate, Lily had nearly caught up to me? Maybe a combination of both? I couldn't tell. But I still couldn't stop thinking about it. So I did what I always do. I ate. And ate. And ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Mel, what has gotten into you!\" Sally giggled, sitting next to me on her massive steel reinforced king sized bed with a gallon carton of icecream held in one arm and a spoon in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-more...\" I gurgled, melted chocolate running down my mouth and chins as Sally spoon fed me another large bite. I was wearing my usual \"sally time\" attire of a tshirt and panties, my massive near-naked form sprawled out on her bed as I watched my stomach rise and fall. My belly looked worse for wear, incredibly dense and bloated with blue veins marring the surface like a road map thanks to a stack of similar icecream cartons laying beside me. It had been a week since our double date and every day I had spent at Sally's eating myself into a food coma. Over and over again. I made sure my aunt knew of course. After all, she knew we were dating so it wasn't that strange for couples to gravitate towards spending time together. Of course our time together was of Sally feeding me till I burst. I don't think I had even actually 'talked' to Sally this week, outside of begging for more and more food. \"Mooore..\" I growled, my chins giggling beneath me face as Sally pushed a spoon full of dessert through my open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey you <i>know</i> how hot this is for me but...\" Sally trailed off as she realized the container she was holding was empty. Throwing it aside she gingerly touched my distended stomach and traced her fingers around its apex. \"This is a bit much...Are you okay? I don't want you to burst babe..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....URRP...fine...\" I pant \"Just a little snack..\" I try to play it cool by slapping the side of my gut, only for a massive spike in pain to shoot through my middle. \"A-ah!\" I wince, my face contorting as I let out a massive bout of gas from both ends. I could see Sally rub her legs together and bite her lip as she watched me squirm, though it was quickly replaced with a look of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take his slow you know. We don't have to do this all at once.\" she leaned in and kissed my blubbery cheek. But honestly, I kinda wanted to. That image of Lily burned in my mind. How did she get so big so fast? I was the one who taught her how to be fat! \"Why don't we go out some time again?\" Sally interrupted my thoughts, \"Maaaybe your friends want to have dinner and a movie sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to break me out of my thoughts. \"Order me some pizza.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another day or two before Sally decided tot once again press the issue of my non-stop eating.  \"Mel, love, I need- <i>we</i> need to talk.\"  I was several mini pot pies past my previous record, and I was looking to keep going well into the night.   My constant gluttony was admittedly only getting more out of control- I guess seeing Lily like she was kinda... Broke me, in a way.  Don't get me wrong, I ate constantly before, but now I was pushing myself to the limit literally every waking moment.  I could feel it, too- Getting up was no longer just a burden, it was an actual <b>struggle.</b>  My gut felt fit to burst constantly, and I could feel the pounds piling on in a way I had never felt before.  And honestly, I fucking <i>loved it.</i>  However, all good things must come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\"  I moaned as I took a final bite out of a pot pie, adding it's container to the tins of its fallen brethren scattering the table in front of me.  Sally sighed, before scooting the other pot pies that awaited me across the table and out of my reach.  \"Hey, what the- <i>URRP</i>- fuck?\"  I hopelessly flailed my chubby digits in their direction, but I was anchored to the couch by my own enormity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, seriously?  You've had like... 13 of these already.  You can't take a quick break to actually talk to me?\"  I sighed dramatically.  \"Look, this is hot.  Seriously, like... Really, really hot.  But it's also... Kinda expensive?  I mean, you've been eating nonstop for almost a whole week.  I go to work, and when I come home I'm out of food.  So I buy more, and then you eat it, and that's... I mean, this is like a fantasy come to life, honestly.\"  I nodded as best I could, my multiple chins pushing together as I did so.  \"And you're getting so big- I swear I can see you growing.\"  I blushed as she cooed and grabbed my belly, which was still slightly malleable despite the sheer amount of food I had already crammed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fail to see-\" I hiccuped.  \"-the problem?\"  I hiccuped again.  She patiently handed a glass of whole milk, which I shotgunned, clearing away the offending noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I mean.  That's kinda... All you've been doing.  And don't get me wrong- it's hot as hell.  I can't emphasize that enough.  But...\"  She looked uncomfortable now, and I was almost starting to feel bad- but I was also starting to get impatient.  I wanted my damn pot pies!  \"I miss... You know, actually talking to you.  Actually <i>doing</i> stuff, you know?\"  Her fingers crept up my thigh.  She was right- we hadn't really fooled around since that night we saw Lily and Mary.  She had tried to initiate it a few times, but I was so caught up in my eating that i didn't bother stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Yeah.  I'm sorry.\"  She gave me a quick kiss on my cheek, before handing me another pot pie.  \"Oh!\"  I immediately took a bite, before Sally pushed me roughly backwards.  I flopped onto my back heavily, grunting as I did so- before popping the rest of the pie into my mouth.  \"More please.\"  I said, holding out my hand and feeling a warm pot pie slide into it- before I felt sally slide between my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we try both?\"  She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, for a while, we found a happy medium between my constant gluttony and Sally's desire to, y'know, have a girlfriend rather than a black hole of eating that never talks.  And it worked out fine!  Really, I was happy.  But soon enough, those thoughts started creeping back... Thoughts of my newly enormous friend, Lily.  And so I slowly slipped back into my jealous gluttony, eating more and talking less, until Sally brought it up again- and this time she wasn't so nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sleeping off my mid afternoon gorge when she walked into her apartment- and I immediately noticed the distinct lack of food in her hands.  My stomach grumbled anxiously.  \"Uh... No food?\"  I grunted, feeling lethargic from my nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mel.  No food.  No money, so no food.\"  My eyes got wide- and I honestly thought I might start crying.  I had been eating so much- almost every waking moment- that the fact that I might not have food in my hands within five minutes of waking up was a serious shock to the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"  I started, but Sally had already walked out of the room.  \"Sally!  I need something to eat!\"  There was a second, and then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just bought groceries, why don't you have some?\"  I sighed, feeling morose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already ate them, Sally!\"  There was a slamming of a door and Sally stormed back into the living room, which had transformed into my personal living quarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was over a hundred dollars of groceries, Mel!\"  She threw her hands in the air, gesturing to the pile of garbage around me.  I realized that Sally looked incredibly worn down- a far cry from her usual bubbly self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Are you okay?\"  I asked, trying to ignore the incessant grumbling happening in my core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I've worked overtime twice this week, and I've spent my entire paycheck feeding you!  You haven't said thank you to me once for all the fucking food I bring you, my boss got on my ass about how much food I've been bringing home, and you- you just aren't acting like yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to feel bad- but I was also starting to feel hungry, and when I was hungry, I was grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you liked this.  Y'know, this whole fat girl thing.  Were you just <i>using</i> me?  Just another fetish-fueling girl for you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Mel.  Seriously.  I wasn't using you, I really cared about you!  But you don't care about me, you just care about stuffing your fucking face- on MY dollar, mind you.\"  I started to stand up- struggling to find the energy to get my hefty frame off the couch, it took me several tries to get enough momentum to shift my bulk upwards.  \"What are you doing?\"  She asked, clearly on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get some food.\"  I responded, and began to waddle towards the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without pants?\"  She asked wearily.  Fuck.  I turned and slowly waddled into her bedroom, where my clothes were laying in a pile on the floor.  I collapsed onto her bed and began the arduous process of shifting my massive, meaty thighs into the stretchy lycra leggings, all too aware that I probably outgrew them.  However, I was barely ever to pour my huge legs into the poor, over-stressed material. \"Are you seriously just gonna leave me?\"  I turned to face her, already panting from the small amount of physical exertion.  \"After everything?\"  I narrowed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not... I just... I need some food.  And some time.  To think, y'know?\"  She nodded sadly.  \"I'll text you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, I waddled out the door.  And to be honest, I really <i>was</i> just hungry, and I really <i>was</i> gonna text her once I got home.  But... As I made my way home via the bus, (which, I realized sadly, was probably the last time I'd ever be able to do so, judging by how much my ass hung over the two seats I occupied) I was overtaken by just how loooong it had been since I ate.  So I got off the bus early, and waddled to McDonalds, where I pulled out my last 20$ bill and ordered 19 cheeseburgers (fuck taxes, by the way) and proceeded to eat all of them in, oh, about 10 minutes.  Then I made my way back to the bus, got on, and took it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, when I walked in the door, my phone was almost dead- and when I made my way to plug it in, my Aunt came out, saw my sad face, put two and two together, and ordered us a pizza feast, which put me into yet another food coma... And when I woke up from <i>that</i>, my Aunt had ordered sandwiches for us, and also bought some ice cream to \"cheer me up\", even though she ate her fair share of it... And I just kinda fell back into my habit of eating all the time and blocking out the world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Sally was hesitant to feed my desires, Aunt Rhonda was more than happy to bury me in food 24/7. Maybe it was because she didn't have any idea what I was doing. Or maybe, unlike Sally, she had cash to spare and then some. Every night was an ever increasing amount of take-out. Or icecream. Or both. She had recently discovered a grocery delivery site on the internet so our fridge was always packed. And to boot, she gave me the account number and password so that I could add items to her cart whenever I wanted. Had I struck upon this situation months ago I would have been ecstatic! But....there was something missing. The lack of Sally only left an empty feeling inside of me that I did my best to fill with food...but it obviously wasn't working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been maybe a week...or two...or three...to be honest I have no idea. I never left the house and rarely kept a sleeping schedule. I ate when I was awake and fell asleep when I was full, no matter what actual time it was. Not to mention the grocery delivery service stopping my nearly every day made keeping track of time a bitch. Aunt Rhonda tried to keep me in clothes, occasionally going out of her way to buy some comfortable shirts and pants in ever increasing Xs of sizes. And, to an extent, I kept up my appearances as I nearly ate her out of house and home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel! Your phone is ringing!\" Rhonda called from another room in the house. I was in the middle of another chicken wing binge as I heard heavy steps make their way towards my room. Swinging the door open my aunt leaned in holding up my phone, \"Honey, your phone is ringing again. This is the fifth time today just answer it.\" Tossing the phone on the bed beside me I was alone again as she left to go to work. Or come home from work? I'dunno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping grease off of my hands onto my shirt, I wiggled down and picked up my phone. My fingers were getting fatter, thats for sure as I fumbled sliding it open. It was Sally. Apparently there was five missed calls, and about twenty text messages of varying degrees of urgency. I guess I HAD kinda...a little bit....abandoned her...maybe. And this wasn't like Lily and Marie, who were simply my friends and had eachother...Sally <i>was</i> my girlfriend...or at least I hoped she still was. Fate be damned as I thought on the subject because right when I was holding my phone it started ringing, with Sally's name plastered in big letters right across is. It only took my fat hands a couple tries at pressing answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Saaaalllyy..\" I said dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel!\" I heard an exacerbated sigh on the other end of the line,\"What the heck you had me worried sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugggggggggggggh, I'm sorry I was just getting some food from my aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For <i>three weeks</i>? You just disappeared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you could have come looking for me if you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you could have not left just because I couldn't feed you 24/7.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bad for myself once again I dug back into my food with my free hands, filling my mouth so I wouldn't have to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're even eating right now. Great.\" an unusually snippy Sally spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hfey, you wanfte me fatterfgh\" I mumbled through a mouthful of fatty food, grease running down the creases of my lips and pooling on my chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wanted you dumbass! This is just...excessive. You're going to burst..or or..something if you keep this up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewing through the fat I rolled my eyes, my stomach gurgling and groaning on que. \"It worked for Lily...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence..followed by some out of range cursing. \"Is this what this is about? Babe, I'm sorry for staring at her. It's nothing! I love <i>you</i> Mel. No one else is going to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that!\" I spat out some chicken, bits of food and crumbs resting on the peak of my mountainous belly. I tried to sit up using my free arm but to no avail. Falling down, defeated, I rubbed my belly as I held the phone up to my ear. \"She just...got so big so fast...I mean that's what I wanted to do and she's so much better at it! She's been doing this only since I've known her and she's almost bigger than me and it took me my whole life to get to this point! What's the point if I can't even do this right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey...honey...who cares? So what? She's your friend, you should be happy that she's happy. And you should be happy with me right? Come on let's put this all behind us okay? Just...stop worrying about it. And stop eating me out of house and home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part made both of us chuckle. Though, it was true. I <i>did</i> kinda eat all of Sally's money. Which only made me feel worse. But if Sally was up to getting back together I was too. \"Okay...I get it. I was...am being a huge bitch about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emphasis on huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh yes</i>.\" Sally purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine you win girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds more like it Mel. But please, let's keep it to All-You-Can-Eat buffets from now on okay? My wallet still hurts..\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I idly spun a comically large meatball on the tip of my fork.  \"Y'know... I'm actually starting to think I'm over meatballs?  Like... They're just like a burger, but with none of the good stuff that you can do with a burger!  You dip em in sauce and that's -hic- it.\" Sally stared at me from the other side of our booth- I only felt partially guilty about the fact that the table had been shoved so far towards her that she basically couldn't breathe, since I got the feeling she found it perfectly acceptable (and probably kinda hot, if we're being honest).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, you've literally had at least 30 meatballs, so, I mean... I can see why you'd think that way.\"  She leaned forward onto her elbows, wincing at the pressure against her midsection.  \"Have you had enough that you can actually, I dunno, carry a conversation?\"  I leaned backwards as best I could- I was pretty much stuck sitting up straight because of my gut pressing against the table, but I figured she got the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... Yeah.\"  I drummed my fingers against my belly- it was far from full, something I would surely fix by the end of the night.  But I had had five plates already (all fabulously catered by my wonderful girlfriend) and she had just loaded up a tray that would probably last me- well, longer than the last few trays, which I pretty much ate in a blind haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... All of this was kicked off from you thinking I wanted to screw your friend, Lily?\"  I almost spit the huge bite of meatball right out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, I shook my head.  \"I never thought you wanted to <i>fuck</i> her!\"  Honestly, that one hurt, mostly because I had thought that, a tiny bit.  \"I just... Look, I mean, I don't have a lot of things going for me besides being fucking huge-\" Sally held her hand up, eager to protest, but I shook my head again.  \"Okay, okay, that's not true, I <i>guess...</i>\" She nodded her head sagely.  \"It's just, I mean... Look, I never really like, had a goal to get massive or whatever, I just really really really really <i>really</i>-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love food?  Yeah, I'm aware, Mel, and you need to know that... I mean, I like how big you are, but that's not why I <i>like you</i> like you.  I love your personality, your passion.  I just love that your Mel fuckin' Carlyle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn skippy, partner.\"  Sally looked at me like I was a moron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn skippy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn skippy, damn skippy!  Look, let me finish my thought before I get too hungry and can't focus again, alright?\"  I ate the rest of my meatball for emphasis, and Sally held her hands up in mock surrender.  \"Look, I just- I've known Lily for a while, and I knew she was into Marie and that Marie likes bigger girls but... I guess I just never figured Lily would like, literally explode.  She's fucking huge!\"  Sally started blushing.  I really needed to word my sentences better.  \"I mean, not as big as me...\" I reached across the table and grabbed Sally's hand.  \"But I... I went to a school that literally consisted of fat girls getting fatter, and I have never, <i>ever</i> seen someone get that big that fast.  Ever.  And I literally knew a girl who sat in her room and ate for the better part of the day, every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her name was Mel Carlyle?\"  Sally smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, shut up, I actually went to class!  Most of the time... Look, I'm not exaggerating, all this girl did was eat.  And she didn't blimp up like Lily has.\" Between my Buttercombe story and the constant talk of Lily's newfound largeness, I was surprised my girlfriend wasn't sliding off her damn seat into a puddle on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose I can talk you out of winding this up soon?\"  Sally said, her face burning pink as she reached across the table and pushed the tray towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally, focus.  Remember what we talked about?\"  She rolled her eyes dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, the all you can eat thing was my idea.  And I'm seriously still broke, so yeah.  We gotta load you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right and then, if you can get me out of this damn booth, <i>then</i> we can fool around.  Meanwhile, though...\"  I gestured to my empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, I ate way too much fucking food and basically got stuck in the booth.  Sally was finally able to wiggle her fat ass free, causing the table to literally rocket against the now empty side of the booth so loudly it sounded like a damn gun went off, which earned us several stares and glares from the other patrons.  Then Sally was (miraculously) able to get my overfed self out of the booth and slowly shuffled over to her SUV, where I collapsed into the back seat and barely could be brought back out once we got to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual happened after that, passing by in a hazy, exhausting, exhilarating frenzy that was different from our usual affair, probably because we hadn't been together in 3 weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the post-coitus pillow-talk happened, which I normally enjoyed, but as Sally propped herself up against one of my massive boobs, she asked a question that I honestly wasn't sure how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think... I mean.  Would you wanna start like... Trying to gain?\"  My hand that was busy massaging Sally's luscious ass stopped immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally.  I eat like, ten thousand calories a day.  Do you seriously think that- I mean, am I not fat enough?\"  Sally pushed herself up, clearly realizing she may have been a little lax in her foresight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mel!  I didn't mean- I didn't... Oh, fuck.  I'm so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled her into my massive form, giggling as her relatively skinnier partner collapsed into me.  \"Sally, it's fine.  I just don't really know what the fuck you think I can do to 'try and gain weight', y'know?  Like, I eat my fair share of food- and none of it is exactly low in fat.  If I'm not gaining weight like this, I think I may have hit a plateau that can't be solved by mere food alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled against my frame, her laughter causing my entire body to ripple with tiny vibrations.  \"Yeah, that's fair.  And I can tell you're bigger since the last time we, y'know.\"  She massaged my leg.  \"I just... You said it yourself, you love to eat.  A lot.  And I know you've definitely pushed your limits since we became a thing and all.  I just- I just was curious if you thought about pushing yourself even further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat for a moment, mulling it over.  On one hand, my huge form getting even more massive was a pretty sexy thought- and I definitely enjoyed the feeling of my heavier frame causing my clothes to get tighter and tighter.  Not to mention, I mean- even with the fifteen-ish pounds I almost definitely put on in the past few weeks, Sally's sexual skills seemed to have quadrupled.  I quietly shuddered at the memory of our latest tryst.  If more pounds=more of <i>that</i>, I'd definitely be down to do whatever it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, I wasn't lying- I was easily packing away five times the amount of daily recommended calories, and it's not like I was magically gaining several pounds a day... Unlike Lily, which I now realized was the entire reason Sally even brought this up- she clearly was curious what Marie had been doing to Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sally, I gotta say... I-\"</span></div></div>",

Opening up it's obvious how fucking fat my fingers are getting...and my hands...and my arms..but all that could wait. I <i>really</i> needed to learn how Lily seemed to be magically inflating like a fat red headed balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What r u up to\" I awkwardly type, fingers trailing on the keys and I barely get the words out. Her reply wasn't instantaneous, but it was clear the phone was nearby because only a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanging with Lily.

The week leading up to Marie's place almost seemed like a blur. Sally and I were on better terms, we hit the buffet a couple more times than I could count. Clothing that fit me was getting <i>quite</i> snug in all the right places. Loading me up in her oversized SUV, Sally made sure to avoid the speedbumps as she hauled my fat ass to Marie's. Which...I had never been to before actually. Marie had always met up with Lily and I...or she was with Lily..or I met her somewhere else. Come to think of it, I had <i>no idea</i> about Marie's personal life at all. So color me surprised when we pulled up to the address Marie shot me to find Marie's...house? Like NICE house. Not big...not like a mansion or anything but this girl had CASH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling into her driveway Sally parked her beast of a car behind Marie's and helped me unload. Hitting the ground at full force my gut only stopped jiggling by the time we made it to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll....get it!\" a raspy voice panted from inside as Sally rang the doorbell. If I had a glass of water, it would have shook like in Jurassic Park as massive lumbering steps made their way towards the door. After a moment of silence (which was KILLING Sally), the door swung open and dropped the other boot, revealing a massive Lily leaning against the door frame as sweat ran down her face. If Lily was almost my size last time we met, she had closed the gap incredibly quickly. Still wearing the same shirt and sweatpants from the restaurant, they now looked skin tight as rolls of flesh oozed out in every direction. Her belly was massively bloated, and every roll and flap was littered with bright red angry stretchmarks from her rampant inflation. \"Hey..guys...come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was speechless. Fuck, <i>I</i> was speechless. Eventually we both got over it enough to greet Lily back and step inside. \"Welcome welcome!\" Marie called out, carrying a box of doughnuts as she strutted out of the nearby kitchen. Effortlessly, she picked up a doughnut, stuffed it into Lily's mouth, and handed her the box as her hands gravitated towards her gut. \"I hope you found this place alright. Why don't you come in and take a seat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the main living room, it was clear that..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Holy.  Shit.\"  Surprisingly, Sally said it, not me.  However, I couldn't help but echo the sentiment with a surprised gasp.  This place looked... Incredible.  It seemed they had moved a bed into the living room- only for me to realize that it wasn't a bed, just a gigantic couch, which Lily happily waddled over to and collapsed on.  She didn't even take up half of the thing- that's how huge it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's uh... A nice set up, right?\"  Marie said awkwardly as she hurried back towards the kitchen, before returning with a tray with four milkshakes- two were normal sized, while the other two were gigantic.  It was obvious who got what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say it's a lot more than nice.\"  Sally bemoaned as I collapsed on the couch next to Lily.  With the two of us on the couch, there was still room for Sally's bottom-heavy form to squeeze in between myself and the arm of the thing, which was impressive.   The two of us almost didn't fit on her loveseat, so to have this much room must have been incredible- even if her hips were squishing into mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily had already turned on the television and was idly flipping through the channels- I was not surprised to find that they apparently had every channel- and that Marie had shelled out for a remote with bigger buttons, which presumably was for the elderly, but worked just well for woman with fat fingers.  \"You guys-\" She paused to drink her milkshake like she had just run a marathon  \"- Care what we watch?\"  She followed this up by a substantial belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no.\"  I muttered, while sipping my milkshake.  \"Marie, this milkshake is amazing!  What's in it?\"  I shouted from my spot on the couch.  Sally had begun to wiggle- for more than one reason, i Initially thought, until she forced herself up from the couch, kissed me, and ran off to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta see their setup, Mel!  This is awesome!\"  And then, after a startled gasp from her trip to the kitchen, there was a quiet muttering, and then \"She's gonna give me the recipe, Mel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had already begun sipping my milkshake again, but paused to yell out a quick \"Thanks!\" Before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fill up on milkshake, Mel.\"  Lily warned- as if that were an issue.  \"Marie is <i>hic</i> making us a special dinner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned through my straw.  \"Sounds like a blast.\"  Thankfully, the milkshake didn't really fill me up.  Like, at all.  So, I stole a few of Lily's doughnuts, much to her chagrin, which held me over for a few more minutes, before my stomach began to grumble yet again.  I guess I had gotten so used to glutting myself at every opportunity that not eating just... Wasn't a thing I could do anymore?  So I naturally decided to whine about it.  \"Sallyyyyy.\"  I moaned.  Nothin'.  \"<i>Sally!</i>\" I shouted- still nothing.  \"Uh, Lily?\"  She grunted at me.  \"Any reason why they wouldn't be in the kitchen?\"  She shrugged, her eyes locked on the television.  \"O... Kay.  Well, I'm gonna go look for them I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to push myself off the couch- it was really comfy, but I was curious as to where my girlfriend and her new feeder bestie had wandered off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling into the kitchen, I didn't spot either of the two ladies- but I did spot another box of doughnuts next to a tasty looking package of cookies, both of which I devoured in a few short minutes.  After taking a quick detour to the fridge for a carton of milk, I surveyed the kitchen a bit more thoroughly.  Marie had an industrial blender- because of course she did- and sitting next to it was a large black container.  Picking it up, I read the label:  \"Protein and Carbohydrate Powder\".  Well, that tracked.  I never really purposefully gained, just ate a lot.  Marie was clearly feeding Lily with food designed explicitly to fatten.  I idly wondered how much of that shit got put into my own shake as I waddled out of the kitchen...</span></div></div>",

A bit. \"Sally I'm hungrrryy.\" My ponderous steps echoed down the hall as I carefully waddled towards the only other open door. My hand rested on my belly, stuffed full of food and milkshake from earlier but still oh so hungry. Leaning against the wall for support I made it around and opened the door. Or well...my belly opened the door. As I entered the room gut first I found Sally and Marie huddled up on the bed with their legs crossed. Like a couple of school girls they had a massive photo album spread out across their legs and they were giggling as they flipped through the thick pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally when are we going to eat?\" I whined, filling out the entire doorframe with my heavyweight hips and ass. Looking up they both had a deer in the headlights look about them like they just got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh..I don't know..Marie?\" Sally looked over, both girls curling the book up against their chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yeah things are cooking,\" Marie gave Sally a wicked smile, \"Should be ready in just a few. Help yourself to the snacks on the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate them..\" I admitted bluntly, scratching the top of my distended belly. Marie could only bite her lip and Sally tightened her grasp on the book. \"Soo...uh...what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie started internally sweating, \"Uhhh, just a scrapbook...do you want to see?\" Sally cut Marie a <i>poisonous</i> glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, I grunted as I fully entered the room and plopped down on the bed beside Marie. The bed almost gave no give, at least not what I'm used to, and it was clear that it was an incredibly reinforced frame. Marie scooted close to me....a little <i>too</i> close, but that was apparently just how Marie rolled. Opening the book for me I was a little bit shocked though not entirely surprised. Both pages were jammed full of various pictures of Lily....naked. Not to say it was weird to see my friend completely nude, but it was totally weird to see my friend nude. She was standing up, her belly bloated out in a room that I hadn't seen yet. Each picture was high quality enough to see every vein, stretchmark and cellulite mark on her and crammed around the pictures were recorded numbers like weight, BMI etc and a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping the pages showed that this went on, in both directions, as I saw Lilly lose weight all the way back down till the point (I assume) she met Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....is weird..\" I muttered, too confused to say much. I've always wanted to gain weight, and eat, and eat some more. But this just seemed...too clinical for me? I mean I want to get fat eating great food. Or being fed great food. Needless to say great food has to be involved at some point in the equation. I never really 'kept track' like this... \"But hey...I mean whatever floats your boat...I guess..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally let out a sigh of relief. Presumably from our earlier Lily-based spat based on her weight. Though, in retrospect it's clear why Lily caught up to me so quick. I was enjoying every bite like the hedonistic bitch I am, and Lily has some Dr. Fattenstien working overtime to add every pound to her. So yeah, she was cheating big time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes chatting, both girls helped me off the bed and back into the living room where I sat back down next to Lily (who hadn't moved a muscle since my departure)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting my belly, Sally followed Marie back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I told Sally that I would send my aunt her number, apologized, and tried my best not to seem like I wanted to commit traditional Japanese suicide. I was so embarrassed at how I\u2019d texted Sally, and so jealous that my aunt managed to score the attention of this really cute feeder chick instead of me, that I literally could have committed senpuku right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI settled for, however, scarfing down all of my aunt\u2019s secret stashes of ice cream and calling it a night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my aunt finally came to, some wee hours before noon, I broke down and told her everything that had happened while she was asleep that night. Minus the whole \u201cI may or may not have tried to flirt with her first\u201d thing. It was over a hearty breakfast of Apple Dumplin\u2019s pastries though, so I was forced to repeat and reemphasize quite a few times for her to get more than just the gist of what I was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Really</i>?\u201d My Aunt actually stopped eating as she let pride tickle her under the chins, \u201cI didn\u2019t even notice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d I garbled, my snark muffled with a mouthful of apple-filled donut, \u201cShe said she thinks you\u2019re hot, and wanted me to give you her number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could practically see my Aunt\u2019s ego swelling. She had spent the past year and a half getting fat with me, and the past few months hadn\u2019t left a lot of room for the party girl lifestyle that she sported before I moved in and introduced her to the world of binging and Netflix. She took a self-satisfied chomp on her donut, a smile dimpling her chubby cheeks as she \u201cwiped\u201d the glazing on her tank top, lingering for a conspicuous amount of time on the uncovered part of her gut that spilled out over her lap. I hadn\u2019t quite proved that my Aunt was just as much of a blubber-lover as I was, but my suspicions certainly weren\u2019t going <i>un-</i>verified with how she\u2019d been acting lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as my Aunt clearly stroked her ego and gut, mulling over the situation she found herself in for far longer than appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 what\u2019s the harm?\u201d my aunt said after a while, \u201cI mean, it <i>has</i> been a while since my last date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, alright. I\u2019ll admit that I didn\u2019t exactly <i>want</i> to admit that making my Aunt Rhonda feel so good about herself made me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside. After all, I was the one who turned her into such a porker, and she had really put a stop to her partying after I moved in so she could be sort of my surrogate Mom. While I didn\u2019t <i>want</i> to admit that my Aunt Rhonda had it going on, I couldn\u2019t deny her what was rightfully hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t mean I had to be too happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you even <i>like</i> girls?\u201d I joked, purposefully plucking one of my aunts pastries from her designated box<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do when they work at Big Burger, yes.\u201d My aunt said definitively, punctuating her statement with a final pat of her belly, \u201cI like those girls very much.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was doing everything I could to get my weight up, up to and including those weird tricks from fetishy stories online, and I hadn\u2019t so much as gained a pound in the past few days. Mind you, those past few days had been spent eating all kinds of greasy fast food fare. Pizzas, burgers, <i>pizza burgers</i> (surprisingly, not as good as you\u2019d think) combined with a non-existent exercise regimen and I had just barely managed to maintain a weight just cresting five hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gut was huge, a big and swollen thing that folded into two tummy tiers that sagged onto my lap while standing. My arms were so flabby that they plumped out of every sleeve in my rapidly decreasing wardrobe, and my hips were getting so big that I had to wriggle my way through every doorway that I came across. My tits, my face, hell even my <i>toes</i> were getting so obscenely plump that I looked like I was sinking into myself. But the thing is that I had <i>stayed</i> at this weight for <i>weeks</i> now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI huffed, steered myself around towards the bathroom door, and walked out into the hallway of my Aunt\u2019s apartment. I one had lofty dreams and ambitions about getting caught between the walls of this place\u2014and these were roomy hallways!\u2014that fueled my wet dreams and made my pussy drool with lust. But when I thought about it now, all it did was make me frustrated. I was eating as much as I could, and I hadn\u2019t gotten any closer to my goal in more than a month!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I squeezed through the bathroom door, I emerged just in time to come face to face with my aunt\u2019s fat tits. She left her door open at night, and she had picked up my fat-ism about sleeping until noon. She\u2019d also started sleeping naked, which, weird. Because, y\u2019know, I\u2019m the only other person who lived in the house. I came through the door just as she wrestled her way to a sitting position, stretching her big flabby arms out into the air after a long night of god-knows-what with Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus auntie, <i>boundaries</i>!\u201d I covered my eyes and averted my gaze as my aunt slowly came to, smacking her lips sleepily, \u201cStop flashing your tits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d my aunt said drowsily, \u201cWhoops\u2014sorry Mel!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moaned in agony as I heard her pour herself onto the floor, heavy footsteps quaking the place as she toga\u2019d herself with the blanket. Even draped beneath the flowy makeshift garment, her flaring hips and saddlebag thighs were incredibly prominent. Hell, I could even see the droop of her belly as it hung freely beneath the light blue blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, just\u2026 y\u2019know, I live here too.\u201d I was still blushing, surprised by the similarities in the shape of our nipples<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen you pop out of more clothing than I\u2019ve <i>bought</i> you, missy.\u201d My Aunt Rhonda said sharply as she put her hands on her wide fatty hips, \u201cYou\u2019ve BA\u2019d me more times than I\u2019ve flashed you, I can guarantee that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt retreated into her bedroom momentarily, leaving me to my own devices as I wandered into the living room. I was a little peckish, even after my late-night microwaveable burrito binge, but I had long learned that my Aunt Rhonda wasn\u2019t much of a grocery-store kind of girl. This long into our cohabitation and this deep into her descent into fattydom, I hadn\u2019t had a homecooked meal in months; I lived entirely on takeout and restaurant fare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt emerged a few minutes later, packed into an old pair of pajama pants that I had my Dad send over back when me and Lily were really tight. I had intended on giving them to my pudgy little padawan when she was big enough to fit into them, but my Aunt Rhonda found them a while ago and had been using them ever since. Her thick, doughy pillars of thighs were crammed into the plaid legs, stretching and distorting the pattern as it conformed to her proportions and left a serious case of whale tail sticking out the back. Her ass was so big I could see it coming\u2014soon she\u2019d be graduating to even more recent pairs of pants. Hell, at the rate she was going, we might wind up sharing a wardrobe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for breakfast?\u201d I asked dryly, \u201cApple Dumplins? Maybe like, IHOP or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 IHOP sounds good.\u201d My aunt said huskily with a sleepy scratch of her exposed gut as it lapped over the waistband of my old pajamas, \u201cI could really go for some maple syrup\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was, where I\u2019d been staying at mostly the same weight, my Aunt had been getting fatter than ever in the weeks she\u2019d started dating Sally. In fact, I hadn\u2019t so much as seen the redheaded waitress since the two of them started shacking up, but I\u2019d been seeing exponential amounts of my aunt ever since. In the figurative sense, not the literal. She\u2019d gone back to spending nights out, leaving me all by my lonesome while she and Sally did\u2026 stuff. Really fattening stuff, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, I didn\u2019t know what she was doing exactly, but my Aunt was turning into a total hog. She was eating all the time, almost as much as me, and she had gotten even lazier than before. She was wearing my old jammies <i>and stretching them</i>. I didn\u2019t know whether I should be concerned with how quickly she was blimping out, impressed at her rate of gain, or jealous that she had a really hot girlfriend to help plump herself up.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though we didn't live in the <i>big</i> big city, Sally and I never really used her car much. Especially not once she started working at home. Most of the time my piddly problems could be solved by bus, and Aunt Rhonda had turned into such a homebody that she'd seriously considered having groceries delivered to the house. Whenever she and Sally went out, it was always Sally to come pick her up. So to say that we hadn't used my aunt's trusty little sedan in quite a while was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suspension groaned underneath our combined weight. I was gear-grindingly home-grown by myself, but my Aunt's big suspension-squishing shelf of seat was enough to make me seriously doubt her vehicle's ability to get us much of anywhere; let alone all the way to her favorite little pancake house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before I moved in Aunt Rhonda used to frequent here. Her previous life as a lovely lady lawyer hadn't left her with much time for home-cooking breakfast after all. But after she started to particularly partake in my past-time of piggishness, she had started coming in a lot more. Not so much since she started working from home, which is the only way that I could conceive the shocked expression on some of the staff's faces. Even I recognized them, but they surely couldn't recognize the bloated hippy woman wobbling her way out of the car, more than a foot of fat ass sticking out behind her and crammed into black leggings that ought to have been put out to pasture with her fatass, five hundred pound niece struggling to stand from her seat in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi; welcome to Papa's Breakfast nook!\" a cute little waitress said uneasily, \"What, uh... t-table for two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\" my Aunt burbled thickly as she came to a stop in front of the podium, the rest of her still quivering as I caught up, \"Some place close to the kitchen, if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skinny minny lead us both by the nose to this table in the left-hand corner of the restaurant, where Rhonda and I collapsed in a simultaneous grunt of relief. Neither of us were this used to walking around by now, given the fact that our days were more often than not spent <i>waiting</i> for food rather than going out to receive it. I hadn't noticed how out of shape my Aunt was until now, if you want the truth. When I first moved in she was pretty fit. But now... just walking from the car to our table had left her just as out of breath as I was. And I was at least two hundred... a hundred fifty... look, I was still fatter than her, okay? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here she was, digging through the menu like there was gold at the end of it. Her long, doughy arms quivered with the slight motion that flicking her fatty fingers entailed. She couldn't take her big bovine eyes off of the (admittedly tantalizing) pictures of what this little place had to offer. A small, delirious smile crossed her lips and dimpled her cheeks. I could hear the low, demanding growl of not <i>my</i> belly, but hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" I thumbed through the menu myself, though at a much more <i>reasonable</i> and <i>normal</i> pace, \"What were you thinking about gett\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have this all you can eat breakfast menu that's just <i>to die</i> for.\" my Aunt said sharply, reaching across the table to flip my menu to page six, where the details of such a menu were outlined, \"I was thinking that I'd start off with that. But since, y'know, the sides aren't covered, I'd get a plate of country hashbrowns (that's hashbrowns with gravy, ham, and a little bit of butter, just so you know, sweetie) and I'd spring for the never ending bacon bar so I'd have something to snack on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked stupidly. Was this... behemoth... really my aunt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, sweetie?\" my Aunt said after a pause, her face flushed with (what I hoped) was excitement, \"What did you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I wanted <i>that</i>!\" I said uneasily, \"Which is kinda what I wanted to talk to you about... don't you think you're going a little overboard Auntie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coming from you of all people?\" my aunt chortled, her great gut quivering in appreciation as it lapped over the table, \"Mel, to you, <i>too much</i> is like... I don't know, eating a whole bakery. Building and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" I admitted, \"But Auntie... a five hundred pound woman just told you that she thought your order was a little much. And that's kinda my point. You've been going crazy lately! I just... I don't know. I'm worried about you. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" my Aunt huffed, seemingly just a little offended by my (admittedly) hypocritical approach to problem solving, \"I'm not doing anything <i>you</i> wouldn't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, and that's kinda the problem.\" I said insistently, \"I mean, I'm definitely not <i>judging</i> you. I just... wanna know what's up. You know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt took a deep breath and put down her menu...</span></div></div>",

My Aunt had gone from skinny lawyer to fully-fledged fatty in almost no time, but she had still stayed more or less the \"same\", if that makes sense. She was always the same Aunt Rhonda, just give or take a hundred pounds or so. But ever since she had started dating this Sally woman, she'd undergone some pretty stark personality changes. She was lazier than ever, greedier than all get out, and I don't think even <i>I</i> loved food with the same amount of fervor that she did. I was confident that, if nothing was done, my Aunt would have to be taken home with a forklift much sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you know, deep down... yeah, I was jealous. Ever since Lily and I sort've drifted apart, I was feeling pretty lonely. My days mostly consisted of binging in the literal sense (as in on food) and in the figurative sense (as in on Netflix and Hulu) and not much else. Meanwhile my increasingly doughy aunt had scored this really hot redhead with big tits an easy line to greasy fast food burgers, <i>easily</i> three of my biggest turn-ons besides being a Winchester brother, all rolled into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" I cocked one blonde eyebrow, \"You guys... still doing good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're doing <i>better</i> than good...\" my Aunt said with a mischievous little smile that made the fat of her face bunch up just so in a suggestive way, \"I've never been with <i>anyone</i> who made me feel the way that Sally does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was inclined to believe her too! While my Aunt may have become a spoiled, lazy pig, I'd never seen her happier. Even when she was a curvy lady lawyer who went out clubbing with guys young enough to be her nephew (SO JEALOUS!), she didn't seem as... I don't know. At home? Content? Whatever she and Sally did, it was making her happy. And fat. But mostly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, after I eat breakfast with you, I'm going to meet up with her for brunch.\" my Aunt stabbed a particularly plump link of sausage with her fork and lifted up to her soft pink lips, looking at it thoughtfully and longingly for a minute before taking a bite, \"And... then we're meeting some coworkers of hers for Lunch at this new place downtown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... more people who work at Big Burger?\" I asked, confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh! You didn't know?\" my Aunt laughed, her great big gut jiggling in amusement at my apparent ignorance, \"No, Sally actually works at DynaCorp. She just does the whole waitress thing part-time. What's it called? A side hustle. Yeah, she hustles on the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching my Aunt eat almost made me proud, in a weird kind of way. Was this what it was like to sit across from me while I ate? I guess I'd never know. For her arms to be so thick and flabby, they sure could move when they wanted to. She downed her first course not long after she trailed off there, patting her gut triumphantly and taking a big swig of her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And speaking of hustling.\" she suddenly picked up, \"Can I get some more over here? We're ready to place another order!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, this was definitely like sitting across from me at a restaurant. </span></div></div>",

I realized, another sign of my increasing shut in behavior) and started downloading Blubr. It wasn\u2019t just that my aunt had snagged a super hot redhead who kept her stuffed and glutted at every opportunity. It was...well, I was bored, I was lonley, and I was kind of regretting my actions of the last few months, especially letting Lily and I drift apart. That kind of hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got home, and said goodbye to my Aunt, who was VERY eager to drive off and go get some brunch. By the time I got home and collapsed into my bed, the programmed. I took what remained of my \u2018morning\u2019(it was well past noon), taking some selfies and writing up a short bio. I showed off how when I took a selfie in the bathroom mirror, my gut filled the sink. In my bio, I emphasized that I\u2019d been deliberately gaining since I was 15 years old, how I wanted to be the fattest woman ever. Clich\u00e9 stuff I know, but it\u2019s clich\u00e9 for a reason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen like a good fatty, I put the phone away, because at this point I was starving and exhausted from...maybe an hour without food, and the light exercise involved in taking a few selfies. I gorged on leftover Chinese until I literally, physically hurt, and then decided it was time for my afternoon nap. When I got up it was after 5 o\u2019clock, and still no sign of Aunt Rhonda. I struggled to heft my weight up off the couch, grabbed some chips and headed to my bedroom to swipe up for a while. You see, Blubr is a little more complex then Tinder. I\u2019d tried installing it once before, but never really used it. Basically, you swipe right if you want to feed someone. You swipe up, if you want someone to feed you. You swipe down if you want to get fat together. And you swipe left if you want someone to fuck off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what I was expecting when I picked it up, but I really wasn\u2019t prepared for...</span></div></div>",

I mean, she\u2019s the one who\u2019s in a relationship and trolling around Blubr for MORE fatties to feed. God, she was probably just a predator, like Hannah back at Buttercombe, just feeding girls until she got bored and then dumping them. Maybe I should warn Rhonda? But she was the happiest I\u2019d ever seen her! I didn\u2019t want to break that up! But surely it would be better to get it from me then to get it by catching her...after being strung along for months. Maybe years! It was a real dilemma, a trillema even. What could I do?</span></div></div>",

A fat girl has to have her priorities. I love my aunt, but it takes a <i>lot</i> to get me up off the couch, and the possibility of her falling over...not enough to <i>really</i> hustle. Still, my concern was there. \u201cAre you okay? Are you drunk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo...noo\u2026.\u201d Her speech was slurred.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, let me preface this by saying that, yes, I <i>did</i> manage to gain some more weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, it was kind've hard not to when you were living with Rhonda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next few months, I played voyeur as I watched my Aunt grow more comfortable with her size, grow more content in laying around all day, grow happier with Sally\u2026 Look, I pretty much just spent a lot of time watching her grow. That was more or less what she did, for the most part. Sally\u2019s spoiling had awakened something deep inside of her that I couldn\u2019t have imagined laid hidden behind the skinny lawyer I had moved in with what seemed like so long ago. And it only got worse when Sally moved in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel, get me something to snack on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? Yes, I\u2019d like one of everything. Yes, I said everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs anyone else hungry? I\u2019m starved!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I\u2019ll be honest, it was hard to keep up with my aunt. She was just this <i>machine</i>, practically programmed to eat constantly. Just all the time. Once Sally moved in, not long after my Aunt reached the big five-double-oh, she made sure that that was all there was for my big fat aunt to do! Sally made enough money to take care of the both of them, as well as me on the side. I wasn\u2019t quite comfortable with it at first, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMilkshakes, on the house!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho wants pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m making a burger run, does anyone want anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally made me feel <i>more</i> than comfortable. With her fronting the bill for anything my little heart could desire\u2014which, since I didn\u2019t really have a life outside of my aunt by this point, mostly pertained to food\u2014it was all too easy to backslide. No job, no other commitments, just me, my Aunt Rhonda, and her live-in girlfriend. And we were all getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, or as I liked to call her, my Aunt\u2019s chubby chasing Christian Grey, wasn\u2019t really trying to put on any weight. It was just more that hanging out with me and my Aunt was somewhat dangerous for anyone trying to maintain a girlish figure. She would thicken out rather nicely, developing a wide set of hips and an impressive set of breasts, but our tan-skinned supporter could quite keep her budding belly under wraps. She had put on about sixty pounds by this point, and every one of them made her more attractive and appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelly?\u201d she called out to me one day, \u201cHow are your auntie\u2019s old clothes fitting, sweetheart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fine!\u201d I hollered out into the hallway as I watched her big round ass saunter through the apartment, \u201cJust a little loose\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry.\u201d She purred, \u201cYou\u2019ll grow into them. I\u2019m sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh <i>gooood</i> why did she have to talk like that? It just made me so wet. I hadn\u2019t gotten any in months, and living with someone who was so <i>open</i> about her fetish made me so frustrated sometimes. Ever since she\u2019d moved in, all she\u2019d done was encourage me and I\u2019d been eating so much more and then she\u2019d cup my cheek and tickle under my chins and <i>goooodd</i> I needed to get a better vibrator\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was huge. After Sally moved in, I\u2019d eaten myself up to six hundred pounds. Do you have any clue how fucking enormous I felt? And all I had to do was eat. I didn\u2019t have a job, I didn\u2019t have to pay rent. Lily and I still hadn\u2019t talked. I had so much shit wrong with my life but food made it all better. Did I <i>like</i> living like a hermit? No. But all I had to do was post a couple of pictures of myself online and let the admiration pour in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gut was the biggest part about me. I was starting to get stuck in the hallways. My flanks would touch either side of the wall now. In a couple more pounds, I seriously think I\u2019d be too big to get through. Sometimes I imagined Sally having to push me through, move me to the couch, and\u2026 and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really needed to get laid. I just needed to get laid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d find some lucky guy or girl who liked landwhales, let them in, and just let them fuck me up. I needed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelly~\u201d Sally called out, \u201cCome on out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026 hff\u2026 kay!\u201d I panted, tottering through my bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wearing one of my aunt\u2019s old outfits. It was an Apple Dumplin\u2019s shirt that was sized for an elephant, and it was still too small. About three inches of my pale belly blubber stuck out on all sides around me. I was dressed in these medical scrubs\u2014the drawstring cut tight around my gut. I was huge, but these were the only things that fit me these days\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t you look <i>great</i>.\u201d Sally squealed, \u201cDoesn\u2019t she look great, Rhonda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo good.\u201d Rhonda said huskily, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like it\u2019ll fit me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not an exaggeration. I have to stress that fact. Ever since Sally moved in, my Aunt had completely given in to the life of a live-in feedee. And she. Was. Enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs in \u201cliterally dressed in a bedsheet\u201d enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt Rhonda had to weigh almost a thousand pounds. There was no telling anymore. I hadn\u2019t seen her on her feet in ages. But I knew for a fact that she was confined to the apartment. There was no way she was squeezing those mile-wide, dimpled hips through the doorway. Even turning sideways, my Aunt was just too fat to leave. Not that she wanted to. She was as happy as a pig in mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pillowy arms pumped snacks into her mouth. Hostess cakes, Watanagashi-ken junk I recognized from Buttercombe, those cheap fruit pies that Sally liked to buy her were all kept in a steady cache next to her between meals. Huge puddles of breasts fell to either side of her mountainous gut as it dominated the bedframe that Sally had ordered, just for her. Her short black hair framed her face, swaddled by rows of chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at my Aunt made me a mixture of confused, awe-inspired and\u2026 a little aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 well\u2026 it does pinch a little here\u2026\u201d Sally said with a frown as she pinched where the drawstring dug into my tummy, \u201cYou\u2019re just a little too tubby for these already, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sally purred<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHff\u2026 <i>hff\u2026</i>\u201d I whimpered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty more.\u201d Rhonda said nonplussed, oblivious to my frustration, \u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh <i>yes</i>.\u201d Sally looked absolutely giddy, \u201cI\u2019ll go get you some more from our old room and you can\u2026 model them for us. Doesn\u2019t that sound fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Hff\u2026</i>\u201d I gasped, my crotch throbbing, \u201cY-Yeahhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Sally said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll go get some.\u201d </span></div></div>",

My Premium Snapchat is evidence enough of that. If you really want to know, I\u2019m happy to tell you what really went down behind closed doors\u2026 for a pizza. Maybe two, if I see you getting all hot and bothered by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFucking pervs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t all that long ago that Rhonda Burkhart was turning heads. At just over thirty-five, she\u2019d managed to carve herself out a respectable career as a corporate lawyer with a nasty reputation for sniffing out the weakness in anyone unfortunate enough to face her in court. The fierce, intimidating gaze that she\u2019d accrued in the courtroom had also served her well in her dating life. Combined with her matured good looks and penchant for witty banter, Rhonda had entire dormitories of college undergrads trembling at her touch. A girl had to drink, didn\u2019t she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that all began to change once her niece moved in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer older sister Jan had kicked poor little Melanie Carlyle out after a little mishap with a couch. Mel was a big girl, you see and\u2026 well, her fervor for things like pizza and pasta and donuts and sugar and fat was a bit more contagious than Rhonda might have initially bargained for. Even then, after she\u2019d started to put on\u2026 some\u2026 weight, Rhonda wasn\u2019t all that impeded. She mostly stuck to groups, going out with her fellow attorneys from the firm, but she still could have had her pick of any college boy she wanted. It was confidence that wooed them, not a slim figure. At least, in theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the pounds piled on and the pesky needle on that scale kept going further and further down the line, Rhonda soon found herself without quite as many admirers. This, in turn, affected her confidence in the courtroom. Cases started to get lost\u2014easy ones, too!\u2014and she\u2019d started spending more nights at home, eating out, with her fatass niece, generally feeling like a failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all of that began to change once she met Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen years younger than her, working part time at a Big Burger for motives yet unknown, the minute that Sally laid eyes on the plump, zaftig attorney she\u2019d fallen head over heels. Overlooking the tailor-made blonde bombshell blimping out beside her, Sally saw something in the large lady lawyer that made her squirm; something that the exceptionally powerful, independently wealthy heiress hadn\u2019t known until she spied Rhonda\u2019s shapely rear absolutely stuffed into a pair of gray sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was love as at first sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hit it off instantly. The fact that Rhonda hadn\u2019t had a proper date ever since she began teetering over two hundred and fifty pounds certainly had something to do with it\u2014she\u2019d never seriously considered dating another woman before. Her conservative Christian upbringing had its weird little mainstays like that; stuffing herself left and right and hopping from undergrad to undergrad had never bothered her, but another woman\u2026 that made her think twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for as long as it took for her to see how dead-set Sally was on making sure that she could have everything that she ever wanted. Rhonda made good money as an attorney, but she\u2019d never in her wildest dreams thought that she could afford the extravagance that Sally showered her with. Date nights were lavish experiences, stuffed to the brim with exotic foods and gallons of sour wines that fogged her mind. It made it so much easier to justify having one, two, three appetizers at dinner. Then desserts, and there was this cute little tradition that they\u2019d started by going out for ice cream afterwards\u2026 Sally didn\u2019t seem to mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, with the caloric content of her day to day life as well as the high fat intake that came with Sally\u2019s incessant spoiling, poor Rhonda began to blow up bigger than ever! Almost five nights a week she\u2019d meet with this woman, eat like there was no tomorrow while chugging down wine and taking shots left and right, stuff herself even more, get felt up on the way home before feeling like an utter cow the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d half-heartedly tell herself that it had to stop\u2014that things couldn\u2019t keep going like this, or she was going to explode!<br>\r\nBut Sally was so convincing when she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA statuesque redhead with a stacked chest and strong hands, she was a towering and powerful woman. Her long red hair was always perfect\u2014the kind of perfect that only mysterious secret millionaires could consistently pull off\u2014and it framed her chiseled face so serenely. Her big green eyes would look Rhonda up and down, up and down, before every date and she\u2019d bite those full red lips of hers like a little girl going to prom for the first time. Even as Rhonda got fatter and fatter, she could never say no. Never say no to Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rising weight certainly hadn\u2019t caused them any undue stress in the bedroom. Her lover was so passionate, fierce was the word really, that Rhonda didn\u2019t have the energy to consider her rising weight. Stuffed full and fat almost every time, and usually drunk off of her increasingly excessive ass even more still, all Rhonda could really do for Sally was lay there and allow herself to be pleasured. She would lie back while Sally went to work, playing with her neglected sex like it was the most natural thing for her to do in the world. And Rhonda loved it. Every second of it\u2014every twitch of Sally\u2019s elegant fingers or every thrust of her expensive dildo was masterful and meant for Rhonda\u2019s pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda\u2019s pleasure was all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she kept eating. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One morning, before they had all moved in together, Rhonda had burgled into Mel\u2019s bedroom. Surely she had to have had something that would fit her, yes? It was only logical for her to think so\u2014Rhonda\u2019s niece had only gotten much, much fatter since she\u2019d agreed to take her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, come on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie?\u201d Mel\u2019s (\"cute, adorable, melodic!\") voice caused her aunt to squeak in surprise, \u201cWhat\u2026 whatcha doing there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda put a pair of sweatpants that could warm a redwood behind her ample amounts of back. Her booty pressed against the dresser drawers, visible from the front of her vastness as her stomach hung low out of her tank top. Her only tank top. Pale white belly blubber sagged low over her crotch as she stood, naked from the waist-down, in her niece\u2019s bedroom. All while pretending that no one could have seen the big blue scrubs that she\u2019d just taken for herself from the second to the bottom drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chubby knuckles whitened as her grip tightened on the biggest pair of pants she had seen in her life. Surely these had to fit, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 stealing my pajama pants?\u201d Mel asked incredulously, \u201cSeriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I let you live here rent free.\u201d Rhonda\u2019s round face was getting blotchy red from the crest of her cheeks to the deep valley of where her chins met, \u201cSo\u2026 so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without another word, Rhonda bolted as fast as her fat, toddling waddle would allow her to. She whipped the scrubs back in front of her as she scrambled for the doorway, not accounting for the sheer fact that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026she was so fat that she\u2019d had to turn sideways to get into Mel\u2019s room in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie!\u201d Mel let loose a belly-wobbling giggle as she watched the ample amount of her aunt squirm helplessly in the door frame, \u201cAre you actually stuck in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d Rhonda whimpered, \u201cI just\u2026 am having difficulty\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda wriggled her naked bottom as best she could\u2014god it hurt to push against the wood like that. Her pillowy thighs cut deep at their widest part into the door frame, bulging over the sides and getting her stuck fast. How humiliating was it for her to be too fat to get around her own apartment? After that night with Sally, bringing her home and getting wedged belly-first into the front door, you\u2019d think that she would have learned her lesson\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it\u2014this was going to have to be it. She had to diet, and she had to do it now. How was she going to live if she was too big to even get around\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRhonda?\u201d Sally\u2019s voice called out from the bedroom, \u201cIs that you,  sweetcheeks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRhonda!\u201d Sally\u2019s green eyes widened as she drank in the sight of her morbidly obese girlfriend wedged in the doorway right across the hall, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here now, hmmm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller and thinner of the two sauntered over to the frame filling fatty that was Rhonda Burkhardt. How had she ever allowed herself to get this big? She could still remember when she was a jaw-droppingly hot prosecutor, hopping from guy to guy as she saw fit. Now she was a huge hippy hippo, caught in the doorway to her own apartment. All because she liked to eat. And drink. And eat while being drunk. She was a woman undone by her own carnal desires to indulge, and now there was no turning back! Sally was going to dump her for seeing for what a fat sack of crap she was, sticking belly-first into the hallway\u2026 by a lot more than she expected to be, really. How fat was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Good morning, Sally! Sweetie! Honey\u2026 pie\u2026\u201d Rhonda smiled awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 kind\u2019ve in the middle of something. Do you want to just wait in the bedroom for me? I\u2019ll be out soon\u2026 ish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally leaned forward, into Rhonda\u2019s gravitational pull, to examine the vastness that was her girlfriend. She had a thick spare tire, resting on the ballooning bulge that was her lower tummy tier. Despite what Rhonda thought, it wasn\u2019t just her hips and thighs that her squeezed her tight\u2014that belly was big enough for her lauraceous lovehandles to get wedged in there too. That was actually part of her problem. Sally traced the line where the upper fold of her stomach rested on top of the more dominant, larger ring of fat that hung over her crotch and thighs with a long elegant finger, sending shivers down Rhonda\u2019s spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sweetie.\u201d Sally clicked her tongue, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty stuck, there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no\u2026 Rhonda gulped, her cheeks burning and her eyes hot with preemptive tears, here it comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be in there for quite a while.\u201d Sally purred as her hands travelled to the sides of her stuck stomach, her fingers digging deep into the pillowy pudge of her hedonistic hippo of a girlfriend, \u201cWhich means I can do whatever I want to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda\u2019s eyes widened as well as they could (what with her fat face and all) as an electric jolt shocked her from the tip of her head down to her does. Sally lifted up her gut and held it close against her tight body, pressing herself into Rhonda\u2019s roundness as well as the current constraints would allow her to. She let out an audible, if broken, exhale of pure pleasure. A moan, almost, if it had been louder. But she was too taken aback by Sally so openly and brazenly caressing her stomach\u2014one of the biggest (no pun intended) sources of discomfort as far as her weight problem went. Just what the hell was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sally!\u201d Rhonda squeaked, \u201cW-What are you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSh, shshshsh\u2026\u201d Sally shushed the fretting fatty with an index finger, \u201cLet me have my fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross!\u201d Mel cried out from the other side of the bedroom, \u201cDoes anyone care that I\u2019m literally trapped in here by my aunt\u2019s big fat butt?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mel\u2019s petulant whining was met with complete and total dismissal. Sally palmed Rhonda\u2019s fat stomach, weighing it in either palm as the her flesh settled into her open hands. The taller, stonger woman bit her bottom lip like she had a million times before as Rhonda felt the butterflies in her stomach tickle her from the inside. A spark between them set fire to a fondling, jiggling sort of molestation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sally!\u201d Rhonda gasped, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod you\u2019re so fat.\u201d Sally purred ecstatically, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I mean, I knew you were putting on weight, but Rhonda you\u2019ve gotten so\u2026 so big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally buried her face into her lover\u2019s belly, motorboating her blubber like one might an especially nice pair of tits. At least, that\u2019s what Rhonda had always assumed that kind of thing was for. Never for her belly. Never for her gross, fat, disgusting stomach. But at the same time, it felt\u2026 right? She certainly wasn\u2019t complaining, getting hot and bothered while she was stuck in a doorway. Sally\u2019s teeth sunk into the bottom belly blubber with the ease that one might expect from someone so fired up. Rhonda wasn\u2019t\u2026 Rhonda wasn\u2019t totally out of this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys?!\u201d Mel whined, \u201cI can literally hear everything that\u2019s going on right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought\u2026 I thought that if you saw me like this\u2026\u201d Rhonda panted, her sex throbbing as a pavlovian need for food and alcohol began to grow within her girth, \u201cYou\u2019d think I was too fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing.\u201d Sally said with a husky growl to her voice, \u201cLet\u2019s get you out of there so I can take you back into your bedroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuh\u2026 really?\u201d Rhonda gasped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnless you want met to fuck you right here in the doorway?\u201d Sally licked her lips, \u201cBecause, as long as we\u2019re being honest\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease for the love of God, do not fuck each other right here in the doorway.\u201d Mel groaned, \u201cJesus fucking Christ, how am I jealous and grossed out at the same time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was that! Rhonda and Sally\u2019s relationship solidified in ways that no one would have ever expected. Rhonda quit her job as soon as she learned just how rich Sally was and let herself go. Hard. Every day in and out, Rhonda\u2019s indulgences became the household\u2019s top priority. She and her niece were moved into an apartment across Greenville, one with peculiar sizes in mind. With two women weighing more than four hundred pounds apiece, certain precautions had to be made, after all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201d Rhonda asked one night, long after the fact, as she did her best to hold her gut suspended above Sally\u2019s head, \u201cI\u2019m not exactly as skinny as I used to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I stutter?\u201d Sally asked forthright, \u201cLet it drop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Rhonda bit her bottom lip in excitement as she dropped the mound of her belly that she\u2019d been holding over Sally\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wet SLAP filled the air as the redhead drowned beneath all that was her girlfriend. Her lover. Her fat goddess of a girlfriend. Beneath all that was Rhonda, Sally squirmed in abject delight. It had been so long since she\u2019d been with a woman of this size. Of this sheer\u2026 massiveness. She could barely breath as Rhonda\u2019s musk was trapped underneath the crawlspace created by her corpulence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026 having fun down there?\u201d Rhonda asked in a deceptively tiny voice, feeling Sally struggle beneath her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFFMFMGDDDD\u201d Sally sounded, barely, beneath her as her toes clenched and her knuckles whitened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. Yes this is what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda massaged her stomach lovingly as she bit into another donut\u2014Sally had started keeping snacks ready for her by the bedside, ever since she\u2019d moved in. If Sally wanted her fat, then Sally was going to get her fat. Now that she didn\u2019t have to worry about her job or her niece, Sally could get her full attention\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her appetite, of course.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I decided being concerned with her blimping, yet impressed at her rate of gain essentially canceled each other out. That left only jealousy of that asstacular girlfriend of hers who, most importantly, <i>loved</i> blubbery beauties like yours truly...and my Aunt, I guess. It was disheartening that a girl who could get any girl (or guy), but who had the special, refined erotic taste that lent oneself towards fatties, would rather be with an aged sow than a bright, perky piglet. This was the stuff that drove desperate people to comfort eating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that's what I did. Despite my Aunt's ever-growing appetite and encouragement, the fact that she spent most of her time with Sally meant that whatever grocery shopping she did was donated to the First National Bank of My Belly. And this most gloomy of days meant that I would consume <i>literally</i> anything - Pop Tarts, Frozen Pizzas, Donuts, Mini-Donuts, Donut Holes, every liter of soda that wasn't Diet (who was my Aunt kidding?), a jar of Peanut Butter, ice cream (cookie-dough, cookies and cream, and Rocky Road), a rotisserie chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, cereal with maple syrup (since we were out of milk), and Twinkies. Surprisingly, finding myself full and stretched out with a taut but faithfully flabby belly did not improve my spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs burps drowned out the sound of some dumb movie on rerun, shaking my tits and reminding me that I still needed a bra that fit me, I contemplated surrender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, I can't just give up? So my Aunt was getting more pussy than me, so my weight had momentarily plateaued, so I had emptied the fridge and the cabinets? In dire circumstances like these, there was only one thing left to do. And so, I stood up, and waddled to my Aunt's room, glancing around. It must be here, somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing so far as to lay down on my belly, which at this point in the day threatened the possibility of not being able to get back up, I peaked under the bed. Right under where you could tell my Aunt's massive form had been straining and warping the frame and mattress, was a beautiful bag from a specialty designer for girls of my and my Aunt's size. I smiled and grabbed it. Peering into it, I saw beautiful silk material, quite a lot of it, actually. Lingerie. <i>Nice</i> lingerie - for fatties! Shit was expensive, and no doubt Sally had a very deep wallet to afford it, alongside all the other goodies my Aunt was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard a creak behind me - in all my excitement, I must've missed my Aunt returning home. I froze in place and waited for her to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thwack sounded out as my left asscheek rippled violently with a hand against it. I jumped up and heard a lovely laugh. Turning around, Sally stood, and as we made eye contact, her smile changed to shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh,\" she said, gasping, hands to her mouth, \"I thought you were piggy - er, Rhonda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my ass and blushed heavily, frankly enjoying such a reminder of my derriere's desirability. \"No...isn't she out with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then I realized - Sally had put quite a few on. Whereas before a fairly slim cutie with a huge ass had been, now there was a plumper ready for more plumping. Obviously Rhonda had been doing some dirty work. Soft, round breasts poured over a too-tight bra that pressed against a shirt way too see-through, though I didn't mind the view of her round, obviously plush potbelly, and that huge ass now demanded words more fitting - massive, humongous, etc. - \"What's that?\" she asked, pointing to the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down, remembering the lingerie. \"Just...some lingerie. Didn't you buy it...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked inside, and shook her head as she unfolded it, and as I saw the cups now in their full size, a flash of my Aunt's massive tits appeared to me and I blushed. \"No...I've been meaning to, since she's been wearing the same cotton stuff with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Rhonda didn't buy it,\" I say, confused and absentminded, \"she always takes me along when she buys clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally lowered the bra and I realized she was beginning to cry, eyes angry as tears rolled down her chubby cheeks. \"That slutty cow is cheating on me!\" she fumed. I, once again, froze. I had nothing to say, I couldn't think. After a long moment of watching this softer Sally grieve...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, so I was more than happy to spread a little love my Aunt\u2019s way. She was letting me live with her for free, and sprung for literally almost every bite that I shoved into my mouth, so the least I could do was let her have her cakes and eat them too. But keep in mind that I weighed about five hundred pounds of pure indulgence and appetite\u2014I hadn\u2019t gone hungry since my Freshman year in prep school. And for the past few weeks, I\u2019d been running myself ragged trying to keep up with my Aunt burning all manner of precious calories with incessant take-out trips and being deprived the lion\u2019s share of greasy, tantalizing foodstuffs, and I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I was a little bitter about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was hardly <i>starving</i> (can you imagine, me? Ha!) I was <i>hardly</i> indulging myself at the level I would have liked to have been. Inadvertently converting my Aunt Rhonda had been as counterproductive as splitting all my meals in half, and that just wasn\u2019t going to cut it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for me, my Aunt had a case that day, which meant that for once I could have the apartment all to myself again. No sharing, no pausing the TV, and <i>all the space on the couch I could want</i>! My Aunt\u2019s first day out of the house since she went home-bound was like a godsend to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the freezing Carolina winter outside, I had put on plenty of insulating pounds to keep myself warm enough to warrant wallowing around in my last set of surviving jammies. I tucked my gut into the waistband of my biggest pair of scrubs, which cut deeply into the swell of my fupa as it fought to keep my belly clothed. My tank-top was hitched up so high that it was barely decent, managing to coddle my breasts and <i>some</i> of my spare tire, but leaving just about everything else out on display. My gut had gotten so huge that I had trouble wrapping my arms around it, swelling heavily over my junk and fighting my fat legs for space in my bottoms. My fat ass crushed our couch, its supreme weight causing a noticeable dip in the support as its frame splintered and cracked. My fat, wobbling arms were busy shoveling food into my triply-chinned face as I stuffed myself like I hadn\u2019t eaten in weeks. My Aunt\u2019s absence meant that I had at least until 5\u2019o\u2019clock to catch up on all the meals that I\u2019d missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it figured that, <i>just</i> when I had the opportunity to play catchup, Lily started texting me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so pissed. Seriously, I almost threw my phone across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey Mel!</i> the text read, <i>Been a minute huh?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Eating</i> I sent back simply, stuffing my face with one hand while my fat thumb typed on the other, <i>Cutting into calorie time</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Me too ;)</i> she sent back, <i>That\u2019s actually kinda why I wanted to talk to you\u2026<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was only supposed to be a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook, I knew the drill. New relationships need time to get going. Lovebirds need time alone to just BE together without any awkward third wheel. Especially if that third wheel had a spare tire fit for a monster truck with a penchant for distracting one of the partners. So I let them be, and initially didn't care when Lily fell off the face of the earth. But as the weeks rolled on I began to get real lonely. Remember, she was basically my only friend down here, other than my aunt of course. Without her, I really had nothing to do except eat, especially when I was lonely and bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd oh mama did I eat. Filling that pit left by a lack of socialization focused my mind on the only goal that could keep my attention for more than a few minutes: getting fatter. After the first week of waiting for Lily, I basically spent day after day after day lounging, sleeping, but mostly glutting my gut with unbridled ferocity. There wasn\u2019t a minute that I wasn\u2019t eating, thinking about eating, or dreaming about eating. The more I ate, and the bigger I got, I less I thought about how bored and friendless I was. I spent weeks almost constantly explosively superstuffed. My dear aunt, bless her heart, freely kept the avalanche of food coming, probably discerning something was off with me, but too tactful to mention it. She actually lost a chunk of weight with the effort of keeping the apartment well stocked, and with the vast majority of that stock being rapidly funneled into my massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of my gut, the two months of gigantically rich feedings every day, plus eating most of Rhonda's portions, caused my weight to skyrocket even further. It was one of those ironies of history that Lily had promised to help me gain weight, but it was her absence that fueled the most rapid weight gain of my short life. By the end of the two months, a week before Thanksgiving found me looking absolutely HUGE, sitting comfortably past the 500 pound threshold. Or so I thought, for l broke our last scale's limit of 500, and that was a week ago. My great belly, as usual, bore the massive majority of her fat, and it was becoming so gigantic that my center of gravity was distinctly centered somewhere into my huge gut, making walking any distance a great struggle. Luckily I spent most of my time vegging out on the couch gorging myself blind and rejoicing in the ever growing circumference of my massive gut. It was truly gargantuan. I couldn't reach around it even if I stretched, becoming so incredibly massive that any shirt became nearly an unbearable burden. My home attire thus devolved into solely a bra-and-sweatpants getup that left my giant blubbery belly bare for the entire world to see. It was permanently too much for me to handle, and I couldn't be happier with myself. By the end of these weeks, I had all but buried my loneliness underneath loads of food and mountains of luscious fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this changed, however, one day that began much like the rest. It was mid-afternoon and I was sprawled on the groaning couch, my gut surging up as tall as it was wide, and impeding almost all my view of anything ahead of me. I was double-fisting pieces of extra-cheesy pizza, each hand bearing two pieces stacked on each other. Giggling in a slightly unhinged-fashion at my own greed, I crammed my maw with as much as I could pack in, then swallowed heavily, rinse repeat. Then Aunt Rhonda poked her nose in: \"Hey Melly-dear, guess who's here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI belched \"mmmff. *gullp* The Chinese food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just shook her head in slight annoyance: \"Finish what you have first, at least. Geez. No, Lily's at the door! Want me to show her in?\" I stopped short. Lily? I had heard nothing from her. Not even a peep. Now she shows up unannounced? It had been so long I couldn't remain bitter at her deserting me, especially since I managed to eat myself crazy without her. What could be the harm? Plus I kinda wanted to show off how big I had gotten. Of course I wanted to see her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, I crammed the rest of the pizza into my mouth piggishly and muttered: \"URRP...shhhurre. Why not?\" I lost myself in chomping the rest of this way-to-cheesy treat and only when I heard Lily's small voice squeak \"uhh..Mel??\" did I shake myself out of my greedy self-absorbtion. I huffed and groaned, struggling to lift myself to enough of a height so as to see Lily over the mountain of my swollen gut. My stomach squelched and churned at the disturbance, and my fat wobbled crazily. Finally Lily's lovely visage swam into view. She had obviously gained a good deal of weight in her absence, but it was clear to me I was the one who had done most of the gaining. I swallowed heavily and reached my hands to carress as much of the mammoth sack of belly as I could reach, patting it proudly. \"URP...heyyy stranger! long time no see! Soooo...whaddya think?\"</span></div></div>",

The living's been good for Melly.\" I snickered and licked some leftover pizza sauce off my hands, which then returned to their pride place, plopped vainly atop the acres of my swollen fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...how did you get so big?\" Lily almost sounded dejected: \"I've been eating like crazy, and even with Marie's help you still blimp out and beat me by a mile.\" She sadly put her hands on her potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you think I don't eat when you're not around?\" I asked pointedly. \"Besides, Lil, you kinda dropped off the face of the earth, I missed you. Remember you're my only friend here, and I had nothing to do to pass the time but eat...and eat...mmmm.\" I began to lose myself in fantasies of vast feasts, only to be called back by Lily's throat-clearing. \"Sorry, sorry. Anyway, don't look so down-hearted, chubby. Do you know how long it took me to master the art of becoming a major fatass? These things take time, sometimes more time than you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knowww...\" Lily whined, \"but it's sometimes so difficult to see you where you are and NOT get impatient, you know? I wish I could just go...*poof* and be just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey but then you'd miss all the great food that woulda gotten you there!\" I said, in a mighty attempt to cheer my pudgy friend up. \"Look how much progress you've made so far! You'll be like me in no-time, especially with Marie helpin' you out like that. That's what really did it for me!\" Lily looked up, a little more cheery<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know so!\" I chuckled heartily. \"Look at you now! Don't give up just because the going's a bit tough! I believe in you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily grinned, quite a bit heartened: \"Thank you, Mel!! That really means a lot.\" She thought for a moment: \"Oh! I came to ask you if you wanted to go out to eat at this cool new buffet we found. Marie's out of town this weekend, and now I REALLY want to see how you got so big so fast. You down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's food, I'm always down! Let's say...6PM?\" Lily nodded, and then the doorbell rang: \"oooh that's the Chinese food!

Really? That\u2019s kind of odd for a small town\u201d Lily questioned whilst absentmindedly rubbing her first (of hopefully many) belly-rolls between her thumb and forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so long as they serve big portions I don\u2019t care what they serve!\u201d I laughed, my massive gut wobbling heavily as we reached the large double doors, a helpful waitress opening them as we entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome welcome\u201d came a rather smarmy man who dressed a little more importantly than the waitresses and waiters scattered around the place. \u201cTable for two? Or would you like our couples table?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTable for two\u201d Lily requested, \u201cAlthough I would like to try this couples table with Marigold another time....\u201d Lily pondered as the hand-rubbing man led us to our seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s if they don\u2019t bar us for what I am about to do here\u201d I chuckled as the foolish greeter seated us far too close to the buffet for the restaurants own good, \u201cThis is going to be fun\u201d I added, patting the top of my gigantic gut as we were left to our own devices. The pat however jostled out an odd hiccup. I was trying to hide from Lily just how much I had glutted myself throughout the day until later, so she could marvel all the more on what she was about to witness. Unfortunately I probably ate a bit TOO much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily raised an eyebrow: \"Mel...\" she said slowly \"how much have you already had to eat?\" Shit, cover blown. Might as well use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welll not THAT much,\" I said nochalantly, my hands vainly spread across my vast gut, \"there was that pizza you saw. Then the Chinese takeout. URP. Then the Thai place. Then the Mexican. ooooh then takeout from the Doornail...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I get it, you're beyond stuffed. So WHY do you think you can handle another meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chucked, \"to show you, Lil, how I got all thisss\" I slapped my hands on the thunderous flanks of my gut, and wobbled it around, entrancing her with its shaking blubber and soft churning. \"I have room for...HIC*burble*...everything here...and ANYTHING...HIC...*bubble*.\u201d My hands sunk deep into my fat despite my gorged state. An explosion of rich bubbling erupted from the mountain of food from my previous meals, the disturbance jostling up a few more belches and hiccups as well from the depths of the overglutted vat of my gut. \"Alright, Lily. start getting me platters, and I'll show you...HIC...how much I c'n handle!\" She rolled her eyes and heaved her chubby body up, grateful that we were so close to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking nimbly, she vastly overloaded a towering platter of rich, greasy barbecue, and with a significant grunt, hefted it over to me. I squealed a thank you, and commenced gorging myself with the ferocity of a starving animal. And I ate...and ate...and ate. Oh my GOD did I GORGE! Driven by the need to show Lily my capacity, and the stares of the other diners, I caused food to flood into my mammoth stomach at truly unprecedented rates, and I felt my gut rapidly begin expanding and churning in futile digestion that I ignored completely in my blissful feasting. More, MORE and MORE food avalanched into my overburdened body.<br>\r\nAs more and more and more piles of eastern delicacies slammed into my overglutted gut, the my belly continued to swell further and further, and it must have looked stupendously massive and heavy. My shirt rolled up even further, reduced to nothing but a crop-top, and the seams on the side nonetheless started to creak ominously. I was in my zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter God knows how long I slumped back for a second, hands draped helplessly across the explosive swell of my mammoth belly, my breath coming in ragged hiccups: \"HIC\u2026HICCC\u2026HICCCCCC!!! Oh GOSH\u2026UUURRP\u2026what a feast! HIC! So much fooood...God I love\u2026HIC\u2026being so fucking FAT URRP.\" I woozily sat there, a stupidly happy smile plastered on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had just returned with another platter, which she set down with a relieved \"Whoof...God DAMN Melly you weren't shitting me. Ready for more or you good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I toldja thiss gutt can handle anything...HIC\" I winked. \"oh you bet, I have only begun to gorge...URP\". Giggling, I grunted and hefted myself back into a sitting position and began glutting yet again. So much food, so much eating, so much fat; All I had to do was cram food into my mouth, filling, double filling, and triple overfilling my exploding stomach with as much food as I could possibly shove down my throat. I thought it could last forever, but with a loud SNAP, I was brought to reality by my chair breaking beneath me. I tumbled down to the floor with a *plop* that shook the whole restaurant, and caused the greeter to come running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh Oh</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you know by now, I\u2019m never one to do things in half measures, and so for the next two and a half weeks, I absolutely let myself go into a life of laziness, lassitude, and insane gluttony. The weeks passed in an absolute blur of food. Now come to think of it, I don\u2019t think there was a moment that I could remember (granted, I did black out many MANY times) when I wasn\u2019t heavily glutting myself, sleeping, or thinking of eating. I don\u2019t know what it was, but I just couldn\u2019t help myself. I gorged myself with as much food as my massive stomach could handle, sloshed my way home, slept it off, and repeated the process, always aided and abetted by my lovely Lily. To be honest, I don't think I was ever completely not stuffed for an entire four weeks. It was truly incredible. Speaking of Lily, she had put on a fair bit of weight too, and was looking decidedly portly, but she had shown a remarkable resistance to the lure of eating, especially around someone like me. Or she was too busy making sure my gut was nearly always packed to bursting with as much food as I could cram down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course such incredible exertions (I told you eating was hard work) and unbelievable sloth didn\u2019t go with consequences. Wonderful, plush consequences. I had packed on another 15 pounds, and was sitting pretty at just over 460 pounds. I. Was. MASSIVE. Long having soared past my highest weight to date, as far as I was concerned, the SKY was the limit. As usual, my mammoth belly was bearing the vast amount of my gaining, and it was easily the most stupid big thing I ever dreamed of growing, especially when glutted to explosive levels. This was a fat girl\u2019s paradise, and I was MORE than content to linger forever. As long as Aunt Rhonda didn\u2019t mind, and Lily remained happy, things couldn\u2019t get any better. Or so I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, I had gotten banned from Little Pigs too, but after some hunting around, Good ol\u2019 Lily had found this new buffet, the Doornail, and for the past week, it had been the perfect place to stuff myself stupid, with crazy delicious downhome delicacies, and a laid, back downhome staff to match. It was there that I found myself at 3pm on a Wednesday, deep within the lunch-phase of my typical daily glut. Frenetically stuffing gravy-slathered fried chicken pieces into my mouth, and ignoring the rich burbling of my pleading gut, I was so in the zone, that it took a particularly heavy punch from Lily to get my attention. Leaning back heavily against the wall of the booth (adjustable! Yay!) I licked my fingers and patted the vast upper swell of my bulging, half-sheathed belly: \u201cHiccuuuurrpp!! Whaazatt for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake Up, Tubby, I think we got trouble. Those twats who we met that first day just entered.\u201d Lily whispered sharply. I looked up, still woozy, but curious. I recognized the ugly clothes and stereotypical haute couture outfits even in my food-drunken state. But there was something else that caught my eye, something that made me focus, even just a little...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And then I realized; both of those snooty snobs had put on a noticeable amount of weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, I hadn\u2019t seen them for months. The first and only time I had the displeasure of making their acquaintanceship was when my belly knocked over their table back at Mexican Pepper, but that had been a few months and about sixty pounds ago. If they hadn\u2019t pitched such a bitch fit (and if Lily\u2019s lame-ass excuse about me being blind) didn\u2019t stick out so much in my mind, I probably would have forgotten that those twiggy snots even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so inconsequential to me, in fact, that I almost didn\u2019t even register what the trouble was. I was too engrossed in stuffing myself to give them a second thought on my own. But then Lily casually reminded me about the day we met, and the day we met <i>them</i>, and things clicked immediately into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026\u201d I burped, smacking my lips, \u201cThat\u2019s <i>them</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily snickered as I gave them a snarling second glance, my nostril curled distastefully at their Fall Casual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight?\u201d she said cattily, \u201cI almost didn\u2019t recognize them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd really, you probably wouldn\u2019t have either. Both girls looked to have put on at least thirty pounds since we\u2019d seen them last. The blonde one with the outsized sunglasses and the platinum blonde dye-job (Lindsey, if my eavesdropping skills were correct) was sporting quite the tummy. It stretched her halter top enough to outline the distinct curve of her pot, and it rode up a little around her muffin top\u2014leaving an inch or two of skin bubbling over the sides of her jeans. Her face looked doughy, and her tits had gone up a couple sizes. Meanwhile the beta brunette (Who, as far as we could tell, was named Stephanie) had put on a lot of weight in her lower body. Her hips flared out noticeably, giving her a distinct bell-shape. And from the angle she was standing at, Lily and I could plainly see the great growth of her ass. Her belly rounded out a little in front, but Stephanie\u2019s booty had definitely done some ballooning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed the tell-tale signs of recent acts of gluttony too\u2014smeared lip-stick, quiet little burps into their hands, the fact that the stupid brunette one still had some ketchup on her tee\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, the little things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d Lily said maliciously, \u201cThey got big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you\u2019re one to talk.\u201d I poked Lily in her left melon, inadvertently gathering that she had gone braless yet again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike <i>you\u2019re</i> one to talk.\u201d Lily snorted, batting my hand away, \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d I paused, \u201cBut\u2026</span></div></div>",

Point is, I went back, digested for a while, and then ate some more. Nothing you haven't already heard about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh, and just for the record: I didn't say anything about Auntie getting fat to Lily.

Like, all kinds of clothes. Shirts, skirts, panties, everything. And there was enough to last her about a week. \"New clothes, huh?\" I said to her after she brought in the last of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-huh,\" she replied, setting the bags down in front of the couch. Then she sat down and kicked off her high heels. \"None of my stuff fits right anymore, so I figured it was time to update my wardrobe.\" She leaned back and sighed, her little belly just barely peeking out of her business clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I thought back to this morning and tried not to look guilty. \"Oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah.\" She pat her belly. Wait, did that mean she- \"I've just gotten a little too big for my clothes now. Too much fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So she did notice. Either she skimmed through the denial phase or just skipped it altogether. Good on her all the same. \"You noticed, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's hard not to when everything pinches you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then we fell into this sort of awkward silence. I didn't know where to take the conversation from there, and I'm pretty sure my aunt was in the same boat. Like, I think we both knew <i>where</i> to go from there, but not <i>how.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a bit, Auntie said, \"It's all the food, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The food.\" She gestured at all the snacks on the coffee table. \"You've always got some out, and we spend a lot of time together when we can, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, right.

Not my stomach, if you can believe that. No, it was <i>hers.</i> We both stared at her pot-belly, then at each other. She blushed and got up. \"Right! Dinner! Sorry! Let me go order those pizzas!\" And she hurried off to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I just grinned to myself. God, I'm so glad Aunt Rhonda's nothing like her sister.

I eat a lot, and I go through clothes pretty quickly too. Plus, I always kind of guessed that Aunt Rhonda would expect me to start paying rent eventually. She told me that I had to either get a job, or start selling stuff on eBay. And since I didn't have any stuff, job it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was that I had never really been... \"employed\" before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Mel, there's <i>plenty</i> of places to work around here!\" Lily exclaimed as she lead me down the street (the freakishly hot, humid street!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says Little Miss College Education.\" I snorted, taking a big bite out of my third corndog, \"Seriously, I've never had a job before! Do you <i>know</i> how hard it is to find a job in this economy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to <i>private school</i>.\" Lily retorted, looking at a copy of my resume, \"Seriously, they didn't prepare you for employment in Buttercombe Academy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they were too busy making sure all the important students were taken care of.\" I wheezed, struggling to keep up with my itty-bitty weight gain coach, \"Seriously... I'm at a loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first Saturday of the month, and everyone was out and about. People on bikes, lots of cars honking, and lots of pedestrians. And then there was me. I'd put on a good twenty pounds or so thanks to Lily, and believe me I was feeling it. I'd begged Aunt Rhonda for some new clothes a few weeks ago, but they were already gettiing tight. My belly had only gotten bigger, but my ass had officially made every single bottom I owned obselete. Even my gross highlighter-yellow shorts, which I had quite literally exploded out of three days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... how about a job in food service?\" Lily looked at my resume, \"You've got all these culinary classes listed on your resume. Why not put them to good use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...pff... I guess.\" I wheezed, taking a slurp from my Pepsi snowcone, \"But I'm really more into... <i>eating</i> food than... making it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do what you know, right?\" Lily laughed, patting my big sweaty belly beneath my tank-top a few times. It sloshed and shook in front of me, upsetting my pace, \"Come on, there's nothing wrong with working with food. You'll actually probably get a discount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it. I'm sold.\" I laughed breathlessly, stopping right there in the middle of the sidewalk, \"So where should I apply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

And it\u2019s so fuckin\u2019 hot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cText your Aunt?\u201d Lily suggested hopefully, \u201cMaybe she\u2019s on her lunch break? Do\u2026 do lawyers get lunch breaks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, they did. I whipped out my phone and typed out a message to my aunt with my pudgy little fingers that I had decided to apply at Apple Dumplin\u2019s, waited about five seconds, and felt my phone vibrate against my flabby hip. She was fucking ecstatic\u2014not only that I was taking her empty threat of kicking me out seriously, but that I was looking into a career at a place that was quickly becoming her guilty pleasure. Aunt Rhonda was probably going to go by Apple Dumplin\u2019s <i>anyway</i>\u2014the woman had a serious addiction to bear claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we waited, stopping in one of the local fast food joints for a quick pit-stop, spent about twenty more dollars on lunch for me and Lil (mostly me) and my aunt swung by. She was kind enough to bring me a pair of freshly laundried jeans the size of a tent, and a t-shirt to better cover my obscene amounts of cleavage and arm fat. We piled into the car and drove, Aunt Rhonda\u2019s intervention turning my hellish walk through the sun-baked urban jungle into a cushy five-minute ride with air conditioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stopped a little farther away, allowing me to sneak my fat ass into a restroom and change. And then promptly take too long, have to have Lily come in and help me. I emerged ready and raring to go\u2014having only split a seam or two in my struggle to keep my bodacious bigness halfway decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to get your first job, Mel?\u201d Lily said excitedly with a pump of her little arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d I groaned, rubbing the vicious overhang of my belly blubber as it spilled over the waistband of my jeans, \u201cCan barely\u2026 <i>breathe</i> in these\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAtta girl.\u201d Lily pat my malleable massiveness, making it quiver in delight underneath my top, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014you\u2019ll be able to buy new pants. Pants that maybe shouldn\u2019t scream every time you breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Lily led me by the chins next door as my Aunt drove off, dozens of donuts in tow for her firm\u2019s breakroom. Every labored step took an extraordinary amount of willpower because seriously, these jeans were <i>not</i> comfortable. It took me twice as long as it normally would have, to give you a rough estimate of how fucking unpleasant my monster muffin top made walking. Every other step I had to stop and adjust my shirt, pulling it back over my belly bulges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we made it. I walked right through the double doors, recognized Savannah the waitress, stood straight up, looked as professional as possible, and asked her if there was a position open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell~\u201d she said in that Southern way that I was beginning to recognize, \u201cWe <i>are</i> accepting positions for\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, it's not a regular occurrence or anything, but it just happens sometimes. Totally not my fault. Well, kind of my fault, considering I very deliberately stuffed it full of calories over the course of several years, turning it into the wrecking ball it is today, but I digress. My point is that the incident with Lily (whose name I would not learn until later), while unfortunate, was not a novelty for me. I was prepared to write off that redhead and just forget the the whole thing had ever happened. Of course, that wasn't what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I'll start off by saying that I eventually made it to Gerardo's. I had to take a few breaks here and there, but in my defense it was <b>really</b> hot. I'm pretty sure I managed to sweat off at least a pound of water, maybe more. Anyway, as I was saying, Gerardo's. It looked like pretty much every Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to. Mexican flag hanging from the ceiling? Check. Pictures of bullfighters adorning the walls? Check. Red and yellow wallpaper in shades that subconsciously trigger feelings of hunger in people? Double check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, despite the fact that I'd made it to the place that supposedly made the best breakfast burritos in town, I was feeling pretty pissed. According to the clock on the wall, it was almost noon. This meant that I'd gone several hours without a good meal, had instead spent said hours <i>exercising</i>, and in the process probably missed out on trying the breakfast burrito since it was no longer breakfast time. Still, I was here now, and I resolved to give this place a fair shake. At any rate, I'd have to eat quite a bit to make up for all of the calories that I'd wasted getting here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I stepped in the place, I saw a familiar shade of red hair. It took me a moment to recognize that this was the same girl who I'd bumped into before. As it turned out...</span></div></div>",

It was one of those little tables for one, which meant it was probably going to get pretty crowded with plates, but seeing as all the bigger tables were currently being used, so I'd just have to make do. Anyway, I was just looking over the menu when I saw the skinny red head at the other end of the restaurant. Her face was redder than her hair, and she was pointing and gesturing at me while having a whispered argument with this tall, chubby woman who I'm guessing was her supervisor. I decided to ignore them after a moment, seeing as I had a menu in front of me and I wanted to know what I was going to order before the server got to my table. Get the food over here a little quicker, you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I'd just decided on a few choice morsels (You can tell that I'm being sarcastic, right?) when I hear someone clearing their throat. I then look up to see the person who'd be bringing me my food today. You have three guesses about who it was, and the first two don't count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! My name is Lily, and I'll be your server today! Can I start you off with something to drink?\" she said in the most cheerless cheerful voice I'd heard in my life. About the only thing more fake than that voice was the smile on her face. I'd been on the receiving end of quite a few \"I'm smiling at you because I'm socially obligated to smile at you\" smiles in my life, and this one had to be in the top ten, at least. Her skinny body was as tense as... well, it was really tense. All-in-all, her attitude and posture said, \"I don't want to be here and I don't want deal with you, but I have to because I need to get paid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI responded that I was actually ready to order, to which she responded, \"So what can I get you then?\" She then coughed, which I'm pretty sure she did to hide muttering the word \"fatass\" from me. So it was going to be that way, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after that, things proceeded as they usually do when I go to a restaurant. I ordered a lot of food (sadly, there were no breakfast burritos served after 12:00, as Lily informed me with one of the most unapologetic apologies I'd ever heard), the server asked if I actually meant to order it all, I responded with a yes, and then the waiting game began. Fortunately, I didn't have to wait too long. Pretty sure that Lily was trying to expedite things so that she could be rid of my fat ass as quickly as possible, but since it meant the food got to me sooner I wasn't complaining. And as it turned out, Gerardo's <b>was</b> pretty good. It wasn't the best Mexican food I'd ever had, but then it's hard to top the kind of cuisine you can get at my alma mater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after a few burritos, some tacos, and a taco salad (the only kind of salad worth eating), I was feeling pleasantly full. I would have stuffed myself further, but a part of me was cognizant of the fact that I would have to walk back home. Which sucked, but bothering Aunt Rhonda at work just to have her drive me home felt like a bad move to make if I wanted to continue staying with her. So I was preparing myself for the odyssey home when Lily brought me the check. She was still wearing that fake smile, but she was also looking really tired. I actually felt kind of bad for her. It wasn't like I'd meant to ruin her day, but I guess that had happened nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I looked over the check (not as much as I thought it would be, even considering how much I ate), and took out the money that Aunt Rhonda had given me to pay for it.</span></div></div>",

Just a little. We were two hugely fat chicks, taking up so much sidewalk with our supremely wide figures that people had to move around us, panting up a storm at the very not-so-slight exertion of having to haul our fat asses a grand total of one city block. What's worse, I was just a <i>little</i> bit bigger than I thought my top could contain--my belly kept trying to wriggle its way out of my tank top, and it threatened to flop right out of my jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut we made it there, barely, and we only caused half as much of a scene when we barged in through the doorway. We were both pretty starved by the time we got there, running on fumes and Asian aromas alone. I could hear Lily's gut groaning as she picked up her pace, her little body waddling fiercely in an attempt to get in before I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" said a surprisingly size-tolerant hostess, \"Table for two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Mel, save some sweet and sour chicken for the <i>rest</i> of us, why don't ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stuck my tongue out at Lily as I leaned into the self-service booth, my wobbly arm extended with tongs, my platter filled with sticky orange chicken. My belly pooled onto the tray slider as I held my plate up at chest-level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Height makes might, shorty.\" I stuck the tongs into the empty bin and let one side collect sweet and sour sauce, which I then drizzled over the already drowned chicken, \"Not to mention girth, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you bitch.\" Lily's fat face twisted into a frown as I waddled back to our booth, \"I'm getting all the sesame chicken, just for that short joke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have it!\" I hollered back, my big belly sloshing back and forth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I collapsed into my seat, the whole restaurant seemed to shake. I wriggle-waddled my way further into the booth, my fat rolls pressing lightly against the table as I struggled to move my collossal ass. We had been eating for about an hour now, with no signs of slowing down. It was nice to finally eat with someone who could at least keep up with me--the last person who could do that was my roommate back at Buttercombe, but that seemed like <i>forever</i> ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily followed suit not long after, her own humongously little body struggling to fit into the booth as much as mine was. She was easily as fat as I was, if she didn't weigh the same. Her long rust-red hair framed the chubby curvature of her cheeks, threatening to dribble into the sesame sauce. She hadn't been seated for more than a second before she started digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... so... how long have you... been here?\" I asked nonchalantly between animalistic mouthfuls of hot, gooey chicken, \"South Carolina, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...urp...just moved here.\" she answered in a similar fashion, \"Like...wh-urrrp... a week ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph... me too.\" I bit into the sweet meat of my meal, orange sauce beginning to coat my lips as I swallowed with reckless abandon, \"Just moved in with...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">mm, this is good</font>... just moved in with my aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Lily said almost disinterestedly, as if I were somehow less interesting than chicken, \"I'm here 'cuz...</span></div></div>",

Or so I thought. As we walked I was attuned to the people around us (OK, I was hoping to catch people staring at us), but no one noticed us. It's not like we didn't stand out; people had to walk around us when they passed, but then they were on their way, ignoring us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have much time to ponder this; after just a couple blocks Lily grabbed my arm and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, wait! Fat Burger! They don't have that where you're from, do they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I've never heard of it.\u201d I followed her eyes across the intersection to a fast food place billing itself as 'The Last Great Hamburger Stand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've got to try it.\u201d I let her drag me across the street; not like hamburgers weren't a tempting lunch themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy neutral mood turned positive when I saw the menu. In addition to small, medium and large burgers they also had XL, XXL and XXXL. Yeah, Lily knew where to find real food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she knew how to eat. While I mulled my order, she asked for a pair of XXXLs and three orders of fries, plus a large soda and two large shakes (one chocolate, one strawberry). I was starving myself, and also feeling a little... defensive about my own appetite. I couldn't let her see me eating like a bird, could I? So I got pretty much the same thing, preferring the southwestern bacon clubs to the regular burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe staff must have recognized Lily, because they all straightened up when she came in, and they were so quick with our order I wondered if we should have tipped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until we were deep into our meal that something occurred to me. Breaking the silence (if you count chewing and moans of pleasure to be 'silence') I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you know I'm not from around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily finished chewing her mouthful of fries before she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a small town, and I know I'd remember seeing someone like you. No way would someone as fat as you stay off my radar for long.\u201d She smiled when she said it, some private joke on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first thought was she was a lesbian, attracted to obese women, but I couldn't think of how to test those waters so soon into our acquaintanceship without it sounding weird. Not that I was automatically averse, but I had just met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let the matter drop, returning to my food. It was a filling meal, even by my standards, and at the end I was happily stroking a belly that purred like a content kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill want to hit the buffet?\u201d Lily asked me when we were back on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've still got room,\u201d I decided. \u201cLead the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after another block we were passing an El Pollo Loco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mind if we stop here?\u201d Lily asked, rubbing her belly. \u201cI could go for a burrito or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, a quick snack didn't seem good enough. The smells, the pictures on the menu; they made our mouths water. We ended up sharing a 12-piece meal, complete with sides. I can't remember who suggested it, but it didn't matter. Hands greasy, we were both bent over the table, dropping bones picked clean on a plate between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK (belch). Now we can go to the buffet,\u201d Lily announced, as if both stops had been the opening act to the real meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were moving a lot slower now, weighed down by swollen guts churning and digesting the food we had already eaten. I was still up for a little more, but I didn't think I had it in me for a full buffet stop. I mean, when I go to a buffet I have certain expectations about how much I'll get for my money, you know? I was along for the ride more to find out where this supposedly awesome buffet was for future reference than I was for a real meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I saw the Dairy Queen I had a suspicion we wouldn't make it to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Lily wanted to stop and get some dessert. We demolished half a dozen sundaes plus pieces of cheesecake and root beer floats, and at the end I couldn't pretend I could still go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Lily had hit her limits as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I overdid it,\u201d she said, hands on her bulging middle pressed against the table. \u201cIt's happened before. I have no self-control when it comes to food; even if I'm walking to one place I'll have to stop anywhere that looks tasty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't have to apologize to me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou think I have any self-control when it comes to food? At least I know where a few places to eat are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just sorry we couldn't get to the buffet. You would have loved it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother time.\u201d I said. \u201cI'm new in town, and I'm learning where everything is. Here,\u201d I got out a pen and wrote on a napkin. \u201cCall me sometime, we can get lunch again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, definitely,\u201d she said, brightening noticeably. \u201cI love to meet new gluttons. Oh!\u201d She put a hand in front of her mouth. \u201cI'm sorry, that was a bit presumptive of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed, a full-on belly-jiggling chortle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine. After watching me eat just now, how can you think I'm not a greedy piglet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all fat people enjoy eating,\u201d she said, \u201cOnly a certain kind of person embraces their appetite. Only some people can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time I wasn't sure how to respond, so I just nodded and kept my lips sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe parted ways, Lily saying she had some obligation later that afternoon, and I headed back to Aunt Rhonda's apartment. A nap would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily seemed cool, and I thought about how great it was I had made a friend my first day in town. And not just a friend, but, as she put it, a fellow glutton. I couldn't wait to see her again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lily called me the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you want to go to the buffet now? They open at 10:30, so if we hurry we can get there first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat turned out to be a little optimistic. Even though I knew where to go and had enough self-control to not stop anywhere along the way (alright, it was the promise of a buffet and unlimited trips to the serving stations that kept my eyes looking forward), I didn't know the bus routes or schedules yet, so I had to hoof it. And at my size, walking just a few blocks was a commitment of time and energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I got to the restaurant \u2013 The Golden Fan \u2013 I was panting and my belly was growling. Lily was standing out front, wearing stretchy leggings and a college football jersey. I had on jeans and a button-down blouse, perhaps not the best choice for a marathon eating session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt may not look like much from the outside,\u201d Lily said, leading me in, \u201cbut I like to think of it as a well-kept secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wrong on either part. The exterior of the building was gray stucco with one of those electric signs that was just a piece of plastic with fluorescent lights behind it, but the interior was surprisingly spacious and well-lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back!\u201d the hostess said, recognizing Lily. \u201cAnd you brought a friend. Welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTable for two,\u201d Lily said. \u201cBenches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the hostess said. \u201cRight this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenches, I wondered, but when I saw the dining area it made sense. Most of the place was tables and booths, with regular chairs at the former. But a few of them had thick, sturdy benches instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I could see why. We weren't the first people there, it turned out. A tremendously fat man, weighing at least twice as much as me, was seated at one of the benches. He was wearing a blue and white track suit, along with small black glasses that were apparently for aesthetic rather than practical purposes, for as a waitress brought over a tray of food he looked up and smiled. There was no way this guy could squeeze into a booth, and even with two chairs under him the restaurant would be risking destruction of property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a small ring of plates and bowls in front of him, the waitress running back and forth between him and the buffet to keep his table full. I couldn't help but stare, for a number of reasons. Jealousy, mostly, of both his size and how he was being waited on personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it take to get service like that?\u201d I asked Lily. We had been shown to our table and were now heading to the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet as fat as him. Special customers get special treatment, but we're not at that point yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet,\u201d I echoed, smiling. It felt good to be hanging with a fellow gainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food lived up to Lily's promise, and even if I didn't 'need' to be making several trips to fill my belly I wanted to try some of everything. And then I wanted seconds and thirds of the stuff I really liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur meal went on long enough for the lunch rush to get into full swing, couples and individuals coming in and filling the regular tables and booths, and a couple other gargantuan fatties getting seated and waited upon. One of them, a middle-aged woman in a sleeveless dress with a belly that came past her knees, exchanged a glance with Lily. They don't look related, but they knew each other. She also looked me over, smiling at something. I don't think she knew I saw her, but I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've seen maybe one or two mega-obese people in my life,\u201d I said to Lily, circling the issue. \u201cBut now there's three here in one place. Does this town have a ton of really fat people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe more than usual,\u201d she said, \u201cWe're in the South, you know. Southern cuisine is pretty fattening, and we're not shy about enjoying our food. But I think it's more that we fatties know each other, we know where the best restaurants are. And this place has such excellent service, it's a favorite spot for all the big eaters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a reasonable answer, so I let it drop. Still, I was starting to get the feeling there was something else going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut my suspicions died as we kept eating, and I lost myself to the gluttony. We ate for over an hour and a half, each unintentionally pushing the other on because we were too proud to yield. When it was done we couldn't move, and we sat there for a while stroking our bellies and chatting about our lives. Lily was particularly interested about Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn entire school of fat girls. That's sounds awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, and I hated leaving. But this place doesn't seem so bad. Good Chinese food is always a plus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, there's plenty more places in town you have to check out. We haven't even scratched the surface of what this town has to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that set the agenda for the next few days: I would meet up with Lily and we would go to this or that restaurant, she introducing me to the best meals in town or just where to find certain franchises I loved. At every place we gorged with total abandon, and at almost every place I saw at least one mega-fat person. A couple times it was someone I had already seen, like Track Suit or Sundress Woman, but most of the time it was a new person. How many supremely fat people were there in this town, I wondered. And why did they all live here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got something of an answer that weekend. On Friday Lily and I were at a seafood place that sold buckets of fried clams, and in the middle of our third or fourth one she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this is kind of last minute, but on Sunday would you be willing to come with me</span></div></div>",

I know I was in the Bible Belt now, but Lily hadn't given any sign of being religious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to offend her, so instead of saying 'No' I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could. I'm not a huge believer or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, then smacked her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, duh! I should probably explain, it's not Christian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's... I guess you would call it pagan. My parents and I are Old World. We go to a temple that worships Ceres, the goddess of the harvest and abundance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d I said. \u201cThat's interesting. Never expected to meet a pagan down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're not big on labels or anything. In fact, our temple doesn't even look like a religious place. There's just a couple dozen of us, so we rent out a hall on the edge of town every week and get together for a feast. It's how we show our gratitude to the Goddess, by enjoying the fruits of her gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn't you just say there would be food?\u201d I asked. \u201cCould have gotten right to the point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't want to surprise you when you got there. I know some people would think it was weird, worshiping a goddess of food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot me. That sounds like one theology I can get behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Sunday Lily and her parents came by my aunt's apartment to pick me up. Her parents were even fatter than her, but not as fat as some people in town. Around 550, maybe 600 pounds apiece, her father being bigger than her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know how much Lily explained to you,\u201d her father said as we drove, \u201cbut this meeting isn't big on rituals or ceremonies. There's no sermon or blessings, no hymns or whatever. There may be a prayer at the start of the feast, the temple mother consecrating the meal and offering thanks to Ceres, but then it's just a big meal. It's more of a social event than anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fun,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks for inviting me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't mention it,\u201d Lily's mother said. \u201cWe always like to meet other people with appetites. They're the ones blessed the most by Ceres, Deena always says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeena?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe temple mother,\u201d Lily said. \u201cHead of the church. Other than handling finances, it's a mostly ceremonial position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's an important role,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe embodies the image of Ceres and her abundant gifts. She's the spiritual center of our congregation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was fighting mightily not to roll my eyes. On the subject of gods and goddesses I was of the mind that they (if they existed) seemed to like staying in the background, and that was fine by me. They did their thing, I did mine. But Lily's family was being nice to me, inviting me to a free meal like this, and I didn't want to be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall was so unassuming I wondered if I wasn't be put on. Other than a sign near the road that said 'McGreevy Hall' there was nothing special or noteworthy about it, no indication of why it had been built or what purpose it served now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside it was just as blandly forgettable. A plaque to one side of the entrance (linoleum floor, wood-panel walls) explained who McGreevy had been, and there was a community events bulletin board that was sorely in need of updating. But as I followed my hosts through the entrance and to the main hall I could tell something was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the smells, first of all. Even before I saw the food I could smell it, the aromas of all the dishes mingling together but each striking on its own. It was better than any restaurant I had been to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once I saw the food I almost had my own religious epiphany right then and there. There was a rectangle of tables in the center, with dozens of trays and bowls of the biggest servings of food I had ever seen, and the most tantalizing. No buffet I had been to (and I had been to a lot in the past four years) rivaled this spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo taken with the sight of the food was I, it took me several breaths to turn and take in the other... congregants, I'll call them. I recognized almost all of them, the fattest of the fatties I had seen around town. Men and women and a few teenagers, it was like a secret meeting of the biggest eaters in town. No wonder Lily had said she would recognize someone as fat as me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones I didn't recognize were a few skinny people setting the tables, a portly man about my size but at least a decade older, and a woman who broke all conceived notions I had about the limits of obesity. The man was chatting with some of the other people waiting to eat, probably just a regular member of the church. But the woman... She was sitting on what I assumed was a small platform, her turgid immensity a pile of blubbery rolls rising from the ground up to her head like a pyramid of flesh. At her size it was relative if she was more belly-heavy or bottom-heavy; everything about her was packed with fat, from her cheeks that made her eyes look small to the chubby toes of her feet poking out of her sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a great white dress, and her chestnut hair was done in several braids. She had an 'Earth mother' vibe to her, only it was more real than what your typical hippie liked to conjure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that's Deena,\u201d I said to Lily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it in one. Come on, I'll introduce you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little in awe of her; outclassed as a glutton but also feeling more like a child than an adult. There was something primal in the majesty she exuded. Still, I followed Lily over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeena, this is Mel. She just moved to town a few days ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer warm smile did little to put me at ease, but I shook her hand when offered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to our temple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for having me, um, temple mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, a surprising lilting tone to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeena is fine. You've already seen we don't care much for ostentatious appearances, not like the Catholics, and neither do we focus on hierarchy or ranks. I hold the title of temple mother, but it is not who I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you enjoy the meal here today, and that you will enjoy it to the fullest you can. If you leave here unsatisfied, it will be a mark of shame on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think you have to worry about that. Everything looks so good, I'll probably be upset when I have to stop eating because I'm full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember that feeling,\u201d Deena said, \u201cTo see food and not be able to eat it. So frustrating.\u201d She looked at the clock on the wall. \u201cTime for the meal to begin. Again, enjoy yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe congregants circled around the tables, Lily and I finding space near her parents, though nobody sat down. Once we were all assembled the platform or whatever it was Deena was sitting on moved forward, completing the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome all,\u201d she said, raising her voice to be heard, \u201cold friends and new. We are gathered here today to enjoy the blessings of our patron goddess, Ceres, She of the crop and the harvest, She of abundance. In celebration we will feast. Take all that you want, eat to your fill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as prayers went, I'd heard worse. Once she was done we all sat down and began eating. Like a Thanksgiving meal we took from what was in front of us and then passed the dishes around. With so many dishes it took some time before everyone had a chance at everything, but like I said, the portions were so huge that nobody missed out on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will little talking at first, but into the fifth or sixth course several conversations broke out. I was sitting next to Track Suit, who introduced himself as Kenji, so we talked about both being transplants to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came here three years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a lot skinnier then, but my job involved just sitting in a cubicle all day, and after a while I was packing on the pounds. When I was invited here my weight started to skyrocket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInvited?\u201d I asked. I turned toward Lily. \u201cI wouldn't guess you guys do a lot of evangelizing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren't trying to convert anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the people here were raised in the church, or if we see someone who looks like they'd belong we invite them. Like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike me,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you guys going to try to indoctrinate me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don't do that. If you want to come back in the future, you're welcome to, but we're not a cult. We're not going to take control of your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was dead serious; she clearly believed in this Ceres stuff, and my attempts to keep the tone light were shot down by her earnest defense of it. Hours later, after we had all eaten our fill and were shambling out of the hall cradling painfully swollen bellies, Lily repeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant what I said earlier. If you want to come back, you can. You're exactly the type of person who we want here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the best, most indulgent meal of my life I couldn't refuse the offer, so a week later (a week filled with stuffing myself around town) I was again picked up by Lily's family and driven out to the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there this quickly became a normal thing for me, and then the highlight of my week. I was enjoying myself binging at this or that restaurant, but none of them were as good as the temple meetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after a few weeks of these feasts that I was starting to feel like a part of the 'congregation.' I had gotten to know a lot of the people in the temple, all of them having the same love of food and fat I had, and this was becoming as much of a family as my real one. Maybe a nicer one, since none of them filled the role of my fat-shaming mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was also then that something upset the status quo.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost a month of my new life, which was even more lazy and gluttonous than my old one at Buttercombe, had gotten my weight gain moving again. Moving up, of course. I had come to Carolina weighing about 400 pounds, and I was proud to say I was close to hitting 500 now. A lot of it came from Aunt Rhonda being super accommodating, never getting on my case to get a job, always having money in her purse to give to me, and always buying any snacks or goodies I put on her grocery list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never really saw motherhood as for me,\u201d Aunt Rhonda told me at one point, when I ventured to mention how awesome and un-mom-like she was being, \u201cespecially not with an infant or young child. But having a teenage daughter, someone I can talk to and relate to? That seemed pretty nice. And having you here is as good as it'll ever get. I'm loving this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then we did each other's nails and talked about cute guys on TV shows we liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the other thing helping my gain was the weekly 'church' meetings, which were always a massive feast that lasted all afternoon. Every week I went hog wild, cramming my face with everything on offer and only stopping when I was too full to move. Everyone else ate themselves stupid, but I was getting compliments and recognition even from Deena, the temple mother, for my appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should say 'almost everyone,' actually, because after a few weeks I noticed something: there were quite a few skinny people at the temple. They never ate with us fatties, and I had been so overwhelmed with getting to know the other big eaters that I hadn't noticed the people who set the tables, brought the food out, and started to clean up after we were all done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked Deena about it one week, before we started the feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they're members of the temple,\u201d she said, \u201cbut no, they don't eat with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I hadn't asked many \u2013 or really, any \u2013 questions about the temple and its theology until now, but this seemed like such an obvious lapse in the avowed 'worship through eating' when members of the congregation didn't have a literal seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis may sound strange if you've heard about the Judeo-Christian god being all-loving and having infinite compassion, but we don't believe Ceres shows Her love equally to all people. She hates no one unless they deserve it, and She will help any sincere petitioner, but She reserves special privilege for those who capture Her fancy. Appetite, girth, and other gifts go to those She chooses, but everyone should find contentment in their own station.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mulled that over while we ate, now paying closer attention to the skinny people when they popped up after the feast. They worked quickly, efficiently clearing the table and rushing back to the kitchen to clean the plates and silverware. I also noticed that Deena wasn't completely done eating yet; one of the skinnies was bringing her plates of food so she could continue eating while the rest of the congregation said their goodbyes and departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the skinnies, something in the way they held themselves and moved hurriedly, that seemed out of place. I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something.</span></div></div>",

Sleep off the 'itis,' give my belly a chance to empty before dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner tonight was a honey-baked ham and potatoes au gratin. Aunt Rhonda wasn't ever going to be a world class chef, but she had a good head for down-home cooking. The feast earlier didn't impede my performance at the dinner table, cleaning plate after plate and downing glass after glass of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying it, Mel?\u201d Aunt Rhonda asked, her eyes fixed on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's great,\u201d I said, mouth half-full of ham. I drained my glass, the two-liter next to my plate empty. \u201cIs there any more soda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Of course.\u201d Aunt Rhonda almost bolted out of her chair, speed-walking back to the kitchen and returning with a chilled bottle of Cherry Coke. \u201cDo you want anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, a little unnerved by seeing the temple skinnies' efficient behavior mirrored in my aunt. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time,\u201d she said, and then she went back to her own seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could have been a weird coincidence, I thought to myself as I laid in bed that night. Had to have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no. Over the next couple days I was more aware of Aunt Rhonda's behavior towards me. She was quicker to get me something if I asked for it, and more than once she offered me something I hadn't asked for (snacks, a dessert before I went to bed). She had been totally cool with my appetite until now, but this went from enabling to encouraging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that I was complaining, but a voice in my head was telling me there was something behind this, and not knowing what it was made me nervous. I didn't want something bad to happen to Aunt Rhonda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentioned all of this to Lily on Friday. We were at an Italian place, eating whole pizzas or the occasional order of cheese bread, our bellies both bunched up against the table and our butts crammed into our chairs. As I said aloud what I had been obsessing over the past few days I was struck at how silly this sounded, but Lily was quiet and attentive as I spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was done, she finished chewing the food in her mouth and said</span></div></div>",

It's a gift from Ceres. You're giving off positive vibrations that makes people around you feel happier, compelling them to make you happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked, not stopping myself in time to avoid the chance of offending Lily and her religious beliefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember when you first moved here, and you saw Kenji at the Golden Fan, being waited on? That was because of his aura. The waitstaff at any restaurant he goes to will wait on him hand and foot, and they won't even think about doing so. Like with your aunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to laugh that off, but I couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so jealous,\u201d Lily said, taking another bite of food. \u201cI've been going to temple since I was a kid, trying to get myself as fat as possible and hoping for Ceres' gifts, but you come in and after just a month you're already this far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you?\u201d I said. She sounded a little upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should enjoy it. Ceres only shares her gifts with people She has big plans for. There's no telling how far you can go with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilly as this was, I couldn't help but imagine myself as big as Kenji, or even Deena, people bringing me food while I sat back and relaxed. Like a queen, being tended to and not having to lift a finger herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the apartment and being greeted with the smells of a veritable smorgasbord did nothing to bring me down to Earth. Aunt Rhonda was in the kitchen, cooking up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you, kiddo?\u201d she called. \u201cHope you didn't eat too much for lunch, I kind of went overboard with dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells great,\u201d I said, walking to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it? I'm glad.\u201d Aunt Rhonda was wearing a red apron; she had taken off her suit's jacket, but she was still wearing the blouse and pencil skirt gone to work in. As if she had started cooking as soon as she got home. \u201cI found a couple cookbooks during my lunch hour and I just had to try some of the recipes. Don't make any plans for the weekend, because I need you on hand to taste-test all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'll be out Sunday afternoon,\u201d I said. She turned around and put her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right. You're always gone on Sundays. What is it you're doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded genuinely curious, and I hated the idea of lying to her, so I told her the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's a sort of New Age, Wiccan group I hang out with. We get together and eat a big lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA big lunch, you say.\u201d Gears were turning in her head. \u201cDo they need any cooks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Sunday Lily and her parents didn't pick me up. Instead, Aunt Rhonda drove me out to McGreevy Hall (I knew the directions with my eyes closed) to see this for herself. As we entered the hall you could see a change coming over her. I led her to the dining hall itself, but as I made introductions she was fidgety. When I introduced her to Deena she blurted out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where's the kitchen? You guys probably need some help there feeding this many people, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's through the doors in the back there,\u201d Deena said, indicating the double-doors even if she couldn't turn around and point. Aunt Rhonda practically skipped out of the hall, leaving me and the temple mother alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she OK?\u201d I asked, now definitely worried by her swiftly changing behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfectly fine,\u201d Deena replied. \u201cLily told me your aura has revealed itself, so I understand this is new to you, but you have no reason to worry. Your aunt is still herself, and she's still in her right mind. She's just focused on pleasing you and the rest of us than she is her own desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's been acting different for a few days now, but when she got here it was like a total transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the combined auras of all of us here. When you two go home today she'll come down, so to speak. But she'll still be happy to please you. I say you should make the most of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't see anything truly bad going on, so rather than worry I settled back into my happy glutton role. I spent the afternoon gorging like always, Aunt Rhonda never coming out of the kitchen until the feast was over. Like Deena said, she seemed to mellow out when we were on the road and putting distance between us and everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she returned to complete normalcy. As soon as we were back home she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going to get started on dinner, sweetie. Why don't you have a nice nap? I'll wake you when it's ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner she made was bigger than any meal she had made before. She had filled almost the entire dining room table with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got to talking with the other people in the kitchen at the temple,\u201d she said; not 'hall,' but 'temple.' \u201cThey were all really nice, giving me tips and tricks when cooking. They even gave me some new recipes to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I couldn't think of anything to do except roll with this, so I sat down and filled my gullet with what turned out to be amazing food. Aunt Rhonda must have learned something while at the hall. It was so good I even ate a little beyond my usual stopping point; I just didn't want to leave anything sitting there! But finally I had to yield to the limits of my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don't want anything else?\u201d my aunt asked as she cleared the table. I merely groaned, shutting my eyes at the thought of even another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long could this go on, I wondered. Was Aunt Rhonda really going to be fixing me these huge, delicious meals every day? I couldn't see a downside to it, I admit, but part of me still thought there was something skeevy about her almost being hypnotized like this.</span></div></div>",

I was far too busy stuffing my face and masturbating to how fat I was to worry about metaphysical problems about auras and karmas and all that business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I knew for sure was that after I took my Aunt to the temple, I was getting waited on hand and foot and she was cooking more than\u2026 well, ever, since I\u2019d never seen her show an interest in the art before then. There was a definite change in my Aunt\u2019s behavior\u2014something that everyone <i>told</i> me was because of some \u2018aura\u2019 mumbo-jumbo, but like I said I had more than a few reservations about all that\u2014and that change was benefiting me more than I had really ever thought it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would spend every day for the foreseeable future in my Aunt\u2019s bachelorette pad, lounging around and eating takeout. Sometimes Lily would come over if she felt like skipping classes, and sometimes we\u2019d go out to eat at one of the many restaurants that Lily\u2019s \u201ccongregation\u201d frequented. I\u2019d usually be home in time for dinner, which had slowly become something of a spectacle at my Aunt\u2019s home. Her booming social life slowly fizzled out as she seemed to become more and more obsessed with making sure that I was getting enough to eat; at first I was worried, but as the weeks flew by and I grew accustomed to such bountiful meals, this quickly became my new normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only exceptions to my simple life of \u201cordinary\u201d indulgences were Sundays, where my Aunt drove me to McGreevy Hall to meet up with Lily, her family, and the rest of the congregation. There I was given near constant attention and affection; praise and encouragement from Deena while I was waited on by the skinnies, who (I\u2019ll admit) seemed to dote on me more and more as I continued to put on more weight. In an environment where I was encouraged to eat as much as I wanted and do as little for myself as possible in <i>literally</i> almost every constant in my life, was it any wonder that I had my reservations about trying to undo whatever this \u201cgoddess\u201d thing was? I would have had to have been stupid <i>not</i> to take advantage of all this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was <i>before</i> we started to go on Wednesday nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was swelling up so fast that I might as well have been a big, fat balloon. With all the food that I was eating at almost every hour of the day, I was putting on weight at an unbelievable pace. My belly swung lower and farther in front of me during the increasingly rare occasions that I rose to my feet under my own power, constantly full as it bobbed before me. It had grown so big that, when full, I could no longer wrap my arms around it\u2014and at this rate, it wouldn\u2019t be long before I just straight up couldn\u2019t do it, period. The angle at which I was forced to hold my arms grew alongside their relative flabbiness and the circumference of my enormous ass. I looked like I was slowly blowing up outwards, my chins bunching against one another as they lay rest on my fatted chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hardly believe that I was getting so big\u2014it had taken me <i>years</i> to climb up to four hundred pounds at Buttercombe. I had idly imagined that moving out to South Carolina with my aunt would take me so far beyond that; to go so far beyond so <i>quickly</i> was a fucking dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more weeks of the Ceres treatment, all this aura and shit\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I admit, I was pretty bratty; quick to demand more food, feeling entitled to having my every whim catered to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if the people around me weren't so eager to please I wouldn't have gone as far as I did. After putting up with my mom's oppressive regime it felt great to be somewhere that not only didn't judge me but encouraged me for my gluttony and obesity. I would have been happy with simply having Aunt Rhonda enabling me and Deena and the rest of the congregation giving me a place to be myself, but the more I fell in with the Ceres worshipers the more everyone that came into my life wanted to keep me happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember when I mentioned seeing Kenji for the first time, and how the staff at the buffet was waiting on him? I was experiencing that for myself now. I could go into any restaurant or diner in town, plop my fat ass on a couple chairs (one chair wasn't enough anymore), and sit back while the staff brought me course after course of food. Half the time they didn't even remember to charge me; that was something no one in the church mentioned to me, but I wasn't going to question it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike right now. I was at a Coldstone Creamery, and the two girls behind the counter \u2013 Jessi and Teri \u2013 weren't ringing up what I was eating. They hadn't last time, either. I just ate until I was tired of ice cream (which took a while) then got up and went home for dinner. They didn't stop me, they didn't ask for money. They just smiled and watched me leave, almost awestruck by either my impressive girth or just by me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still didn't know what it was that was causing this. Yes, my 'aura' was the cause, but how did it work? Was my growing size making it stronger? If so, why didn't anyone outside the Ceres church ever mention how much fatter I was getting? Even Aunt Rhonda only talked about how much more I was eating than when I first came to live with her; the fact that I had outgrown my wardrobe four times over didn't register, only my expanded stomach capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt sort of let down nobody was talking about my fat. Well, Lily did. She was both jealous and amazed at how fast I was growing, and Deena had taken a special interest in me. At the gatherings now she had me sit next to her, which I gathered was a place of honor among the congregants. But to have no one else mention that I was over seven hundred freaking pounds after just a couple months? It was frustrating, because that was what I was most proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. 725 pounds. Believe it. I was so fat that when I went out of the apartment I had to turn my body and shuffled through the door, and when I got to a restaurant I need to aim for the middle of the double doors. Maneuvering around the apartment or a dining floor required all my concentration, because if I wasn't careful I could knock over a table with an errant waddle of my hip, or if I turned around too fast my wrecking ball ass or belly would knock someone to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords can't describe how powerful it felt to be so big. Rather than feeling restricted, like I was stuck in a world not meant for me, I felt imposing. People had to clear out of my way lest they go sprawling to the floor. It was intoxicating, all my pleasure and primal arousal at the thought of my size magnified a hundred times, a thousand times as my body grew out in every direction. When I sat down (which was most of the time) my belly loomed before me, growing rounder as I filled it with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was bigger than most of the other congregants now, and still growing. Deena explained at one point that even with Ceres' blessing everyone had a set limit to how big they could naturally be; it was why the skinnies doted on us fatties instead of trying to get bigger themselves, and it was why not everyone in the congregation reached the state of uber-obesity she had and I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even in a group of fat-loving gluttons I was establishing myself as bigger and hungrier than them. Damn right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I wasn't humble about it. Just as I was at the ice cream shop right now, taking every new dish with the feeling of entitlement that this was mine by virtue of me being me, so I was everywhere I went. Every restaurant's staff wanted to keep me fed, and I sat back and accepted it all. Even at home I was a selfish little witch, greedily gobbling up everything Aunt Rhonda made me and asking for more. She never complained, she never criticized my laziness, she just went back to work in the kitchen while I would slip a hand down to my snatch and pleasure myself while still eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in hog heaven, and I only wanted more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey, Aunt Rhonda,\u201d I said between mouthfuls of pasta that night, \u201cI've been thinking. You spend so much time making me dinner every night, and on the weekends you spend all your time in the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love to cook for you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou're a hungry girl, and you need to be fed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. 'Need to be fed.' Every time I thought I had reached the limits of my aura's power, I got a surprise like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. You're so awesome like that. But you deserve your personal time, you know? When was the last time you went out with your friends, had a girl's night out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don't know.\u201d Aunt Rhonda waved the idea off. \"I can't take a night off. What would you do for dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I could always order in. Or maybe,\u201d I pretended this idea had just occurred to me, \u201cyou could invite your friends over. Have them over for dinner, show off these mad skills you've been developing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d She turned the idea over in her head. \u201cBut it takes a lot to feed you. I wouldn't want to you go hungry because we had guests over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cYou always make so much, and you should share this with your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really do,\u201d I said, trying to will my aura to make Aunt Rhonda go along with this. I had no idea whether someone could control their aura consciously or not, but for the benefits I would reap from this I had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo nights later Aunt Rhonda's friends came to the apartment for dinner. She had left work earlier to make an even bigger spread of food than normal, almost fearful of leaving me wanting. I kept my amusement to myself; if this worked like I thought it would, I would have more than I knew what to do with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was in the kitchen, putting a final glaze on a ham, I answered the door. I was wearing a pair of black biker shorts and a white tank top that couldn't even stretch past my breasts and first roll of flab. As far as dinner party attire went I was a travesty, but I was giddy at the thought of how Aunt Rhonda's friends would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three of them, and they had conveniently arrived at the same time. Emma, Jana and Patsy, they stood on the other side of the door and each fought to hide their shock at the sight of me. I think Emma had the easiest time; perhaps she had seen me out and about at some point. The other two did well enough; if I hadn't been looking for exactly that, I probably wouldn't have caught their initial disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Aunt Rhonda's friends,\u201d I said, smiling warmly. \u201cI'm Melanie, call me Mel. I'm her niece; her sister is my mother. Please, come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them wanted to be the one to say anything or otherwise disrupt the evening before it started, so they all came in and handed me their coats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner's about to begin,\u201d I said, pointing in the direction of the dining room. \u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the table while I hung up their coats, then went to join them. Instead of a regular seat I had a thick bench, something Aunt Rhonda had purchased a while ago after I had broken two of her chairs (at the same time). I had to sit back a ways from the table, because my belly was just too large for me. When we started eating I would lean forward, no doubt looking more like a hog than I already did. Normally I would just bring the table up to my breasts and use them as a makeshift table, but I wanted to emphasize my obesity and my appetite as much as possible. Might give my aura an extra kick, I figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda and the others made small talk, the guests divining quickly that I was not a conversationalist while a meal was going on, and I happily ate away. For the next 45 minutes I lost myself in my first-dinner haze, filling and emptying countless plates of food and oblivious to the others around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after the ham was gone, along with half the chicken-fried steaks, that I started to come out of my fugue. Eating a bit slower now, I looked around at the other women still sitting at the table. They had long since finished their own meals, but Aunt Rhonda wouldn't get up until I was finished and the others were too polite to get up and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was something else. It was subtle, but after seeing it in dozens of people it was like a bright neon sign to me. They were waiting; waiting for something they probably didn't understand, waiting to do or be called to do something they couldn't articulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, I thought to myself, or should that be goddess? This was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the best meal you've ever made, Aunt Rhonda,\u201d I said when a lull in the conversation presented itself. Her expression lit up as she turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think so? What do you think of the potatoes? I was trying something new with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they were the best. We don't have any more, do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can whip some up,\u201d she said, already getting to her feet. Her role as hostess was forgotten in light of my need for more food. Awesome, but what was even more awesome was what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Emma said, \u201cI remember a recipe my grandmother had for poppy seed bread. Would you mind some help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJana and Patsy were only a few seconds behind them, saying something about not wanting to sit around. I stayed where I was and kept eating, elated things were turning out better than I expected. I had thought Aunt Rhonda might ask for some help in the kitchen, but even that wasn't needed. The other women fell in line after less than an hour in the same room as me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Rhonda's fears about me going hungry came to nothing, as she and her friends spent another hour and a half working the kitchen and bringing me more food. I wondered how the others rationalized spending their evening feeding a complete stranger like this. Emma in particular threw herself into her work. I made a note to myself to ask Deena about that later, whether some skinnies were more devoted than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other women left after they were convinced they had had enough, leaving me to wait to find out just how powerful these effects really were.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I found out the next morning. It was my habit to sleep as long as I wanted, which was often until my belly was completely empty and crying out for food, but today I was woken up around 7:30 by Aunt Rhonda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for disturbing you,\u201d she said, \u201cbut Emma came by to pick me up, and she wanted to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway of my room was Emma, holding a stack of Tupperware boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy grandmother ran a restaurant in Charleston for a few decades, and when she passed away I ended up with her recipe books. I always meant to dive into them and learn to cook myself, but it wasn't until last night that I had a real desire to try. I made some doughnuts, they're cream-filled, but I think I went overboard with them. So I wanted you to have the extras.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed me, still sitting in my bed, the stack of boxes. I opened the top one \u2013 the doughnuts were glistening with sugared glaze \u2013 and tried one. It was orgasmic, I was moaning my appreciation. You could see the joy in Emma's face as I scarfed down one and then started on a second. I ended up emptying all three boxes while she and Aunt Rhonda stood by, watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad you liked them,\u201d she said, taking the now empty cases. \u201cI've got some other recipes I want to try. Hopefully you'll like those as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime you want to stop by,\u201d Aunt Rhonda said. \u201cMel is the best taste-tester ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked out, leaving me to lick my fingers and doze back to sleep, excited with how well this was turning out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I came back home from a pizza binge that night I found Aunt Rhonda and Emma working in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, honey,\u201d Aunt Rhonda said. \u201cEm wanted to try a recipe for fried chicken. She swears by it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the main attraction at my grandmother's restaurant,\u201d her friend added. \u201cIt's made with real lard, but hopefully you're not worried about your figure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe spent all night with me eating and Aunt Rhonda and Emma cooking, the two ecstatic to see me wolfing down their offerings. Emma's grandmother sure knew her stuff; everything that came from her recipe books was to die for, and I almost wanted to order Emma to come back the next night to keep cooking for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that I needed to issue any demands. The next morning I was again awoken by Emma turning up with more treats for me, and that night not only Emma but Patsy came by to work the kitchen with Aunt Rhonda. Jana held out for a day longer, and when she came by she said it was to see her friends, but she was quickly at work peeling potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a couple days I had a personal staff of chefs, two of them as dedicated as you could want but the other two still coming by every evening and working to keep me stuffed. By the end of the week this was a normal routine for all of us, and on Saturday it was a day-long affair. I woke up and found a seat on the couch in the living room, and while I binge-watched Supernatural for the umpteenth time all four women were keeping the kitchen going, bringing me dish after bowl after dish of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be what it's like for Deena, I thought at one point. Not moving, no work, just sitting back and letting people bring you an endless stream of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of the temple mother made me a little bit nervous. Aunt Rhonda had already invited her friends to tag along to McGreevy tomorrow, and I wondered how Deena would react to the news of me assembling a personal circle of feeders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it interrupted my feasting. I went to bed that night having eaten more in one day than I did in four before I came to South Carolina, and my hopes for the next day were to best even that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to McGreevy the next day (Aunt Rhonda driving me and the other three women piled into Emma's car) Rhonda led the others directly to the kitchen. But they had to go through the main hall to get there, and I know Deena saw them as they passed. Rather than try to hide or avoid confessing what was going on, I went over to Deena and laid the situation out completely.</span></div></div>",

It can often take years for a fatty to get a non-family member or friend to start waiting on them personally, and most never even accomplish that, but here you have three in just a couple months. Ceres is truly with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was worried you would lecture me not to abuse my gift.\u201d I relaxed. Deena seemed OK with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d She was genuinely surprised. \u201cThe worst thing you can do with any gift is not use it. If Ceres is giving you all this, you should seize it. How else can you show your devotion to her if you squander your abilities? I've never felt more sure of this, Melanie, that you have been chosen by our goddess for wonderful things. Don't throw that away. Eat, and enjoy the help of others around you. This can only be the start for you, I know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow emboldened by Deena's encouragement, I became even more demanding with Aunt Rhonda and her friends. I wasn't bossy or abusive in any way, but I threw away any reservations and fears about taxing their hospitality. When I wanted more food, I told them (politely) and they were quick to provide it. When I loved a particular recipe (and Emma brought so many great dishes to the table it was ridiculous) I said so, and they would always make more of it for me whenever I wanted. Every night the kitchen was packed with all four women working to feed one me, and every morning Emma came by with increasingly larger offerings of treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple weeks of this I suggested (half-jokingly) that Emma should move in and work with Aunt Rhonda on her recipes all the time. And she actually did! Now I had her and Aunt Rhonda making me a giant breakfast every morning before they went to work. I was eating even more than ever now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had become the queen bee with Lily and the other congregants our age or younger, easily the fattest and most gluttonous, an inspiration to them. There weren't that many, only a handful, but plenty of the adults were also expressing admiration and amazement at how I was growing as a devotee of Ceres. I was still mostly focused on the immediate results of all this: giants feasts of food, and my body getting ever fatter and fatter. I was now the second-biggest person in the congregation, a distinction that was underscored more and more each time we got together. Rising steadily, my weight was coming to the half-ton mark and looking to leave it behind. What had once been something I could only dream about \u2013 being so fat I needed a fourth digit to express it \u2013 had almost become reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever doubts I may have had about auras and Ceres' blessing was long gone. I was living the dream, and I knew where to give credit. For the first time ever I was starting to take religion seriously, but it still had trouble competing with my desire for instant gratification. Should I try to learn more about Ceres and Her wishes, I wondered, or should I keep on as I had been, and eat for my own pleasure?</span></div></div>",

Ceres was the goddess of the bounty, right? So what better way to get in touch with Ceres than by making sure I had an entourage of skinnies to coddle me? I knew that if I was ever going to get anywhere in my new life, I was going to need <i>lots</i> of help taking care of my fat ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had just moved into the new apartment a little ways down the road. My bountiful body had officially outgrown the meager doorways provided in the old one, and with three occupants under one roof (not to mention to posse of skinnies it took to keep me satisfied) I had convinced my Aunt Rhonda that moving on up was the only solution. While everyone else around me struggled and heaved, my Aunt Rhonda and Emma toiling with the movers, I happily scarfed down treat after treat of sweet caloric goodness. Even as the time approached for the biggest move\u2014being me\u2014my appetite was not appeased. I was walked down the hallway, down the creaking elevator, and heaved into the car by three burly men from the moving company as my Aunt hand-fed me pastries and other sugary confections to keep me in good spirits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked\u2026 mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we finally arrived I just collapsed into a pale heap of sweating mass right there on the new couch, sputtering and spewing stupidly as I struggled to catch my breath. As I neared ever closer to the coveted quadruple digit, what little exercise I got had plummeted even further. I was no longer capable of walking even to the other side of a room without becoming winded\u2014all the more reason for me to have my Aunt at my beck and call. She was more than happy to help me, as were any of my other skinnies, but I really came to rely on her for a lot as I worked over-time in trying to reach the one-thousand pound mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Melanie\u2026 are you alright?\u201d my aunt crooned as she wiped my head with a damp washcloth, dabbing away the sweat I\u2019d accumulated from the top of my forehead, \u201cIs there anything I can get you, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBear claw.\u201d I gasped, barely lifting my arm in a weak plea for more, \u201cPlease.\u201d I thickly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt complied (of course she did!) and handed me one of the move-in boxes of donuts from this place called Apple Dumplin\u2019s. She placed the box on the great shelf of my tits and left me to my own devices as I clumsily stuffed them into my mouth with my wide, obstructive arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new place was specifically chosen with my size in mind. It was a bigger place in build, but also in design. The doorways\u2014though not wide enough to allow me to enter hip-to-hip\u2014were spacious enough for me to get through without too much hassle if I turned sideways. There were two double french doors serving as <i>my</i> main entrance and exit, and a considerable amount of time had been put into picking a place with a sizeable kitchen and living room area. It was perfect; just the kind of place a girl my size needed if she was going to be doted on all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was mowing through my box of bear claws when Lily came into the living room, struggling with one of my bigger boxes of personal affections. Just a bunch of stuff from Buttercombe, and honestly probably not that heavy. But then Lily was lugging around her own bigness to boot, so her huffing and puffing wasn\u2019t exactly uncalled for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I had grown, so had my little flock of fatties that followed me (although certainly to scale.) When I had met Lily, she had been a meager three hundred pounds squashed onto an already diminutive physique. As she and her family started taking me to the Temple and we started hanging out more and more, there had been a steady incline of intake and an increase of inches on her little big body. However once I started to fully accept my gifts, her own gain seemed to grow more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 <i>fuck</i> Mel!\u201d she wheezed, dropping the box on the armrest and leaning over it with both hands, \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s <i>in</i> this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStuff.\u201d I said, my tone a little short as I begrudgingly divided my attention between Lily and food, \u201cS\u2019not that heavy, Lil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, compared to you?\u201d Lily snorted, her laugh having become short and husky as her weight had climbed (I wondered idly if the same thing had happened to mine) \u201cI\u2019m happy to help you move and everything, but you never said it would be so much <i>work</i>\u2014m\u2019gonna take a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt\u2019s L-shaped couch\u2014I was currently crushing the short end\u2014was one of the few seating arrangements available if Lily and I wanted to sit together. My nearly half-tonnage was more than enough to swallow any loveseat that dared to oppose my massive ass, and even on most couches only women of my Aunt Rhonda\u2019s size would have been able to sit comfortably next to me. Lily meanwhile had ballooned up so much that she was almost half my size; something that I would have considered impressive to have done in a little under a year if I weren\u2019t, y\u2019know, the size of a baby elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily\u2019s short stature made her look a lot fatter than she actually was, but that was no easy feat. She was getting pretty big under my tutelage. Her gut was this big, triply-tiered thing that sunk and sagged over her knees and held out almost as far as she could reach. Her tits were pretty huge too, something that I don\u2019t say lightly. Mine were bigger because <i>I</i> was bigger, but if Lil ever got to my size, I doubt she\u2019d be able to see anything in front of her. They were these big, milky white balloons that sagged to either side of her billowing belly as it sat up on the couch; flanked by two flabby arms and propped up on enough ass for four or five skinny Lilys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the company, I ate recklessly. The box of bear claws was demolished in a few minutes after Lily sat down, but my appetite had yet to be sated. Even after my breakfasts and brunches, plus all those snacks my Aunt had given me to coax me along while we moved, I had grown too greedy and my appetite too spoiled to do without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLily.\u201d I burped, \u201cMind getting me something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Uuuugh</i>.\u201d she mock moaned\u2014though I could sense some genuine begrudging in her tone, \u201cBut I just sat down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLilyyyy\u2026\u201d I moaned for real, \u201cI\u2019m <i>hungry</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Lily rolled her eyes and slowly rocked herself off of the couch, leaving her even more out of breath than she had been when she sat down, \u201cWe\u2019ve really\u2026 <i>really</i> gotta\u2026 get you some\u2026 maids or somethin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the idea had been formed, as she walked past and pat my belly approvingly. Lily meandered into the kitchen with my Aunt Rhonda and left me alone to my thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had already used my aura to capture the hearts and minds of just about everyone in Aunt Rhonda\u2019s office building. We had all these massive potluck dinners from everyone in her firm, and I had managed to get Emma to move in so she could help take care of me. I could pretty much go wherever I wanted and eat for free\u2014who\u2019s to say that I <i>couldn\u2019t</i> convince a few more people into becoming full-time skinnies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, I had just the skinny in mind...</span></div></div>",

But first, let me just clarify, I moved in with my Aunt because she kicked me out. Yeah my Mom was a pathological bitch, but I didn\u2019t exactly mind living there for the two-point-five seconds that I stayed after getting out of Buttercombe. A lot of my old stuff was there, and so were what little friends I\u2019d kept from Middle School\u2014plus, now that I lived in SC, that meant I wouldn\u2019t be able to see Alice on her holidays home from Buttercombe. Living with my mom entailed a lot more stuff than just her fat-shaming, force-dieting, aggressive-aggressive assholishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, that was kind\u2019ve the whole point. My Mom had been trying to make me feel bad about my weight since I came home for Christmas freshman year fifty pounds heavier than when my skinny ass had left, and as I got bigger she became exponentially worse about it. Her shitty attitude and snide remarks were probably one of the biggest reasons that I started gaining intentionally, just to spite her, before I realized how much I enjoyed it. Getting her on my side\u2014on the fat side!\u2014would not only be an achievement for present-me, but it would be a delicious treat for past-Mel, and probably a treat for my sister if she was having as good a time at Buttercombe as I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, trust me, I knew I was being a little manipulative. This whole aura business was still pretty new to me, even if I had abused it to all get-out as I got fatter and fatter, and I\u2019ll admit that I wasn\u2019t exactly using it responsibly here. But you\u2019ve gotta understand; my Mom\u2019s a bitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I suggested to my aunt, ever so sweetly, that it was time we called Mommy Dearest and invite her out here for a little session of catch-up. My Aunt was probably about as wary as anyone who had spent an extended amount of time with my mother would have been, given that they were sisters and all, but she relented without too much of a fight. Not two hours after my conversation with Lily, my aunt was on the phone with my mother, telling her about her new place, new roommate, and how <i>I</i> had extended the invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieve it or not, my Mom agreed. Probably some snide remark about how she \u201cknew it would just be a matter of time\u201d before I came \u201ccrawling home.\u201d Ugh. But still\u2014it was more than likely she just didn\u2019t have anyone else to bother. With the divorce, and Alice away at Buttercombe, I can imagine that she was probably lonely and bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would be <i>more</i> than willing to give her something to fill her time with. And after a few weeks, Aunt Rhonda came back from the airport with my mother\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And after a few weeks of anticipation, my Aunt Rhonda came back from the airport one day\u2014my mother in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I hated to admit it, I got most of my looks from her. She was shorter than my Aunt Rhonda, with blonde hair and a naturally round face. We both had the same green eyes and an equal propensity for a powerful resting bitch face. That was, fortunately, where the similarities stopped between us. And considering that I had finally managed to pass the half-ton mark, the differences between us were about a hundred and fifty pounds shy of being as vast as I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had developed a nice little routine in my new place. I would wake up, gorge myself, and be waited on hand and foot by my aunt and her coworker Emma, who I had done well to convert to my cause. I slept in the living room, propped up on a mattress with pillows providing further support behind me. I was getting pretty fucking huge with Emma and my Aunt taking such good care of me! I hadn\u2019t tried to move on my own since the big move, and honestly? I didn\u2019t want to. The feeling of knowing that I was pinned down by my own immensity was this amazingly huge feat (and amazingly huge turn-on) I was just content to lay back and eat, eat, eat myself into further immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since I\u2019d hatched my little plan (half-revenge, half pragmatic!) I\u2019ll admit that I started working Emma and my aunt a little harder than normal. I was always insatiable but, for the past few weeks, I\u2019d been <i>insatiable</i>. Maybe it was nerves, or maybe it was the knowledge that I\u2019d finally gotten so fat that I needed another zero to accurately weigh it, but I\u2019d been on eating overdrive. I needed a constant stream of calories to keep myself appeased, otherwise I got a little bitchy. Emma and my aunt were more than happy to oblige me (thanks to my handy-dandy blessing from Ceres. Thanks babe!) but even I was aware that I\u2019d been a smidge more demanding than normal. Just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when my mom  came through the door, my aunt holding the door for her, you can probably imagine her surprise when she saw me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been eating when she walked in (because, in all honesty, when <i>wasn\u2019t</i> I eating anymore?) so as much as I anticipated her arrival, it took me a minute to register that she was actually there. Emma stood at my bedside with a giant tray of her grandmother\u2019s practically patented buttermilk griddlecakes, which I\u2019d further improved upon by slathering them in butter and drowning them in syrup. I was only just barely decent, covered up just so by the bedsheet. It was so much easier to stay undressed when I didn\u2019t have to go anywhere. My gut roamed the expanse of my mattress freely, pouring onto its expanse in a pale, jiggling avalanche of sweet delectable fat. Every so often, I would just cup one of my many rolls and or folds, and press it. Feel it yield to my touch before it started a soft wobbling that seemed to carry through my entire body. My chins bunched as I leaned forward, my arms pumping and wobbling as I fed myself like a hungry locomotive. My Mom had been standing in the doorway for about two minutes before I realized she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she kicked me out, I had only weighed four hundred pounds. My ass had gotten so fat that I crushed our old measly couch beneath me, and she had decided that she was through with me. Not only had I doubled my old weight, I\u2019d doubled it half over! I had put on more than six hundred pounds since the last time my mother laid eyes on me; every one of those extra pounds had been bought through a life I could have never dreamed of having at home, or even at Buttercombe. I\u2019d finally found my true calling in life\u2014being a monumental fatass\u2014and judging by the look on her face, my mother was none too pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mel?\u201d she just barely choked out my name, \u201cI-Is that\u2026 <i>you</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mom!\u201d I snorted, not stopping my feasting even as I made my dramatic reveal, \u201cSurprise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know, I could actually <i>see</i> the gears turning in her head? Like, she was sputtering and smoking. Like she couldn\u2019t <i>comprehend</i> how fucking immense I had become. Which was, you know, understandable given the fact that I weighed more than the rest of our family tree put together. I gave her my best smarmy, shit-eating grin as I let one hand fall from my feasting to jostle my oceanous belly. The look on her face was <i>priceless</i>. She was trying to hard to chew me out, to tell me off, to rip into me about how fucking enormous I\u2019d gotten myself, but she couldn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t know if it was my Blessing or if she just honestly was at a loss for words. I didn\u2019t know which one I would have liked better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re having an aneurism, do you think you could  get me the donuts?\u201d I pointed with a sausagey finger, \u201cYeah, right there on the counter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d my mom snapped out of her stupor, \u201cOh, um\u2026 sure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to my surprise (and unadulterated delight) my mom actually walked her skinny ass over and grabbed the box of donuts from the kitchen counter, <i>and started walking them over to me.</i> Mom probably hadn\u2019t willingly touched donuts in years, and here she was bringing them to her whale of a daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have a hug, at least?\u201d I asked in my most pitiful voice as she set the donuts down, my arms spread out like jello-filled wings \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in, like <i>forever</i> you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can, sweetie\u2026\u201d my Mom said softly as she wrapped her arms around me (well, as best she could manage) and wrapped me in the tightest hug she could, \u201cOh Mel you\u2019re so\u2026 so\u2026I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no sweat.\u201d I was pretty nonchalant about the whole thing now\u2014it probably had something to do with the fact that I was a living acolyte for a goddess of bounty\u2014and it was much easier to talk about my parental abandonment issues now than it had been, \u201cJust\u2026 you know, happy to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could almost see Ceres\u2019 magic working its wonders on my mom. Where once she had been neglectful and shrewish, enough to chase away my Dad, she was suddenly overwhelmed with a rush of emotions. A need to care for me. Cook for me. Make sure I was comfortable. Did I need anything? I\u2019d never seen anything like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t worry Mel, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d My Mom said, breaking the hug, my Blessing in full effect, \u201cI\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have been so hard on you. And it\u2019s clear that you <i>need</i> me. Now more than ever\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the donuts on my bed, and my greedy little hand just couldn\u2019t help but dive right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you know, if you\u2019re serious\u2026\u201d I looked longingly over to the fridge\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without another word, my mom got right to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more weeks and a round-trip plane ticket later, my Mom was moved in, and I found myself one more helpful hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was Lily, but it had been a damn long time since I had heard from her, and I was half tempted to ignore the call.  But, at the same time, I hadn't met anyone quite like Lily (well, let's be honest, I hadn't really met anyone since I got here besides her, I was too busy eating) so I finally answered my cell.  \"What's up?\"  I answered, a bit more curt than I had intended.  I had texted her a few times since we ran into each other, but she had never responded, so I was a little pissy about it.  But here she was, finally calling me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry I've been kinda quite lately, I, uh-\"  I swear I heard a small belch, but I couldn't be sure.  \"I've been busy.  But hey, we never hit up that buffet, did we?  We should definitely go there today.\"  By her tone, I could tell the apology was sincere enough.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'd be good, when?\" I asked before i took a bite out of my third bagel of the morning.  I could tell my Aunt wouldn't be thrilled that I cleared out her cream cheese and half of her bagels, but whatever.  It's not like she didn't make enough money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I was thinking, like, in a half hour?\" She grunted, and this time I was positive I heard a burp afterwards.  Was she seriously eating, before we even went to the buffet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we met up, I was positive she was eating while we were on the phone.  Hell, I had to brush off a lot of crumbs before rolling up to the buffet, but Lily hadn't even tried to look like she hadn't been eating.  She was wearing a nice blouse along with the same shorts she had been wearing the first time we met, but they looked a little tighter than I remembered, and the blouse was clinging to her sizable chest in a way that implied it wasn't quite so tight when she bought it.  \"Alright, well let's get going, I'm starving!\"  Lily said happily as we walked in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sheesh, if you were hungry, you just had to say so, I'm pretty much always hungry!\"  I said jokingly, but Lily couldn't have heard me- she was already paid for and waddling towards the main line.  And she wasn't kidding!  I mean, I can eat, but this girl didn't just eat- she inhaled.  Biscuits, potato, pasta, cookies, she practically drank a bowl of soft serve- this girl was a machine.  When I was almost done eating my first platter (given a few small breaks to check on Lily's progress) she was already back with round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I got up to go again, I had to ask.  \"So Lily, you didn't quite eat like this before... What's up?\"  My stomach was grumbling, but curiosity was killing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-\"  She started, before shoveling some french fries into her face.  \"I just...

Y'know, surprise pregnancy type of thing after there wasn't meant to be any more kids blah blah blah. Anyway, so Rhonda is only like in her mid 30's so we always got on well because she was the cool young aunt who totally got my young free spirit. Secondly, she did...god only knows what for a living but she worked from home, did very little actual work and earned a crap load of money doing it, so basically my dream career. And thirdly, last time I saw her she was with some dude called Mark or Mike or something else beginning with 'M'. He seemed like a nice guy, we never really met properly but he seemed cool and Rhonda seemed happy with him.<br>\r\nAnyway, after hours of been stuck in this damn car I roll up in the drive of my aunts house, switch the ignition off and close my eyes for a breather. It's hard work driving when you're this fat y'know? Whilst my eyes are closed I'm oblivious to the world and nearly jump out of my skin when I feel two arms around my neck.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god babe, sorry I made you jump!\"<br>\r\nThe familiar sounds of my aunts voice calm me slightly as her arms retract out of the open window.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, I was way out of it then. Been driving for hours\" I respond, taking my first look at the woman who I hadn't seen in about 18months. She looked as beautiful as ever, because yes, she was beautiful, there's no shame in finding a female relative attractive ok? Like all the Carlisle women she was blonde, and if I recall rightly of moderate height at about 5'5 but, unlike last time I saw her, her face looked a little...chubby?<br>\r\n\"Well come on then sweets, let's get you inside!\" Rhonda chirped, opening my door and making it clear that it was just her face that was looking more weighty.<br>\r\nPeeking not so subtly out of her white t shirt was some serious pudge, we're talking curving over waistbands, belly button indenting so hard its visible through said t shirt, muffin topping your hips to some serious thickness pudge. Unaware of my staring, Rhonda turned to walk back up her drive, giving me front row seats to her frankly huge ass. Each step caused ripples to move through each fattened cheek as her yoga pants cladded rear sashayed back to the house. Fuck me, Rhonda had gotten thick!<br>\r\nIs I followed her into the house I estimated she must have blown up nearly 100lbs since I'd last seen her which was mind boggling considering how thin she used to be.<br>\r\n\"You're looking good Aunt\" I said, testing the ground desperate to find out more about this sudden and impressive (for a thin girl) gain.<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks sweetie! You're looking rather good yourself\" she said with a smile \"but please don't call me aunt, it makes me feel like a million years old\"<br>\r\nShe laughed then proceeded to give me a tour of the house which proved tiresome, I'd been in the car for hours remember, but finally we settled back in the living room.<br>\r\n\"You must be hungry Mel after all this time, want me to order some food in?\"<br>\r\nBefore I could even open my mouth my stomach did the talking, rumbling like a disgruntled beast under my shirt.<br>\r\nMy aunt laughed again, grabbed the phone and plopped heavily down in a seat causing her belly to slap onto her thighs. She dialled a number, waited a moment and then started to order.<br>\r\n\"Hey Gino, how you doing? I know, it's been a couple of days, I'm practically wasting away here!\" I noticed her absently rubbing her belly as she said this. Well she's not in denial at least. My trance was broken by my aunts voice reeling off food options which was making me hungrier.<br>\r\n\"Anyway sweets, I'll take an extra large pepperoni, a bucket of fries, four cheese burgers and your special ultimate cheesy garlic bread. Yes that'll be...no wait!

Rhonda's voice broke me out of my temporary trance.<br>\r\n\"Well until I got where I am today, a 240lb ass that just keeps growing and I love it.\"<br>\r\nRhonda smiled gleefully at this announcement and hunkered down in her chair slightly more, causing the overtaxed white tshirt to slide up her front that bit more.<br>\r\nI nod, mostly to myself, as I mull over what I've just been told. Could this really be happening? A member of my family that totally digs the fat life?<br>\r\n\"So is there still a guy?\" I ask<br>\r\nWith a slight snort mid sip, Rhonda shakes her head \"nah, been a couple since the first but the last was about 3 months ago, had to climb over 200 on my lonesome.\" The words sounded sad, but the smile told me they weren't. Living here had a lot of potential.<br>\r\n\"What about you Mel? Any significant others?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm a lone wolf at this point\" I pat my, admittedly, more sizeable belly with a matching smile to my aunt's<br>\r\n\"Nice going girl!\" The doorbell rings \"I think you and me are going to have some fun Mel.\"<br>\r\nShe throws a wide grin my way over her shoulder as she goes to the door. Weirdly now knowing Rhonda's actual weight made her look bigger; there was a good plump belly and hips to go with that behind and she looked good for it.<br>\r\nAs I waited for food to come I was left with my mind and, with the words of my mum ringing in my ears still, my stomach rumbled.<br>\r\nJiggling back, Rhonda placed the pile of boxes on the table with a slight skip (for a woman of her size) in her step, \"we got cakes too Mel! Argh, I love these guys!\"<br>\r\nI laugh, seeing someone this excited about food was refreshing and a little bit arousing to be honest.<br>\r\n\"Here, start eating or I'm having it all!\" Rhonda pushed my share into my ribs to get my attention.<br>\r\nAnd so we ate.<br>\r\nTime passed by, we talked, we laughed, we watched films and the copious amounts of food started to dwindle. The evening continued and we lost track of time until all had been eaten, well, mostly.<br>\r\nI'd not binged that hard in a while so was breathing hard whilst leant back into my seat, belly rounded and exposed the elements as i lazily stroked my ballooned sides. I was impressed with myself, mentally marking it as an impressive feast, but the title of the evening was definitely taken by my aunt.<br>\r\nHaving eaten the lions share she was currently handballing dense chocolate cake into her mouth, her face smeared in chocolate like a true glutton. Eating on autopilot she seemed blissfully unaware of the fact her tshirt, now stained brown in places, resembled more of a bra as her spherical belly rose with each gentle breath pushing the stretched fabric over her girth.<br>\r\nEating always had a drowsy effect on me and I was unable to fight the heaviness of my eyelids as they closed, leaving me with the last image of my gluttonous aunt chowing down. As sleepy brain took over it dawned on me that my aunt may have been sat opposite me but I had a feeling that I was actually sat across from a true binge sister.<br>\r\nThis was going to be fun indeed.</span></div></div>",

Groggily rolling over on the couch so as to face into the room rather than the back of the couch itself I feel my gargantuan gut spread over the edge with a slight pouring effect towards to the floor. I crack a smile of arousal in my half asleep state at the sensation as my eyes start to open, allowing my field of vision to be filled with a deep belly button and inch after inch of belly fat.<br>\r\n\"Wake! Up!\"<br>\r\nWith each word I feel Rhonda slap my thick thigh for effect which causes impressive jiggles to roll through her expansive belly. Shit, the girl's got far more energy than someone her size deserves to have. Hopefully she wasn't joking about liking being fat so I might see a day when she outgrows her current energy levels.<br>\r\n\"I'm awake, I'm awake!\" I lethargically swing my legs off the couch and stretch to the not so delicate chorus of creaking couch springs.<br>\r\nRhonda claps excitedly (genuinely considering sitting on her at this point) and grabs my hand and pulls me, with difficulty, to my feet.<br>\r\n\"Come on\" she breaths heavily \"weigh in time!\"<br>\r\n\"Whuu?...\" I trudge a couple of steps forward after Rhonda's wobbling arse.

That's bigger than expected for sure...NICE!<br>\r\nI come out of my own head to the sound of Rhonda clapping<br>\r\n\"Wow! Wish I'd gone to that Buttercombe now\"<br>\r\nI try to act coy but my pride burns through as I slap my belly triumphantly<br>\r\n\"Ok move, my turn now.\"<br>\r\nRhonda hip checks me as I step off the scales and I lean against the bath as the numbers roll by for my plumped up aunt. It's odd watching as her excitement bubbles up, aside from myself I can't remember the last time I'd seen anyone so enthusiastic about personally gaining. It was nice to have a friend on my level, even if she was a hyperactive crazy to boot.<br>\r\nThe scales beep and I lean in to read for her...<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not bad skinny, 266.9.\" I throw a playful wink for the skinny comment but Rhonda doesn't even notice as she squeals with excitement, stepping off the scale as she glances over her body cradling handfuls of fat in her hands. Damn she really does dig the fat life doesn't she?<br>\r\n\"Well we're both going up, got to just keep it up now.\" With an arm around my hip I get pulled in to a one sided hug, a 726lb hug for anyone keeping score.<br>\r\n\"First on the agenda though for today is breakfast\" Rhonda declared<br>\r\nWithout breaking habit my belly rumbled aggressively at the mention of food, a sensation that was audibly copied in my aunt.<br>\r\nWe both laughed at the unison of our stomachs whilst pondering the situation<br>\r\n\"Well I've barely been here 12 hours so I'm in your capable hands Rhonda\"<br>\r\n\"Well in that case then...\" Rhonda bit her lip in thought, a hand on one bloated hip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>30 minutes and a change of clothes later we were stood outside of a building that instantly piqued my early morning attentions, the smell alone was intoxicating enough.<br>\r\n\"The Cake Hole?\" I look to Rhonda who's practically drooling already. Fingers squeezed into fat hips, her enthusiasm was inspiring when aimed at food and not my sleeping body, a travesty that had not yet been forgiven. Bitch.<br>\r\n\"Yep! This place is practically my church\" her stomach gurgled at this announcement and, as if on autopilot, her feet started heading towards the door. Curious, I waddle after her, provoking a response from my own gigantic belly. Surely this rather simple looking diner couldn't stand up to the praise Rhonda had given it on the way here<br>\r\nUpon reaching the door Rhonda placed a hand on the steel handle put didn't pull it open, why is she making us wait?! The smell was so thick I could chew the calorific trail it left in the air!<br>\r\n\"Now Mel, I know you're used to eating and all that and gluttony is a common part of your life after Buttercombe but...\" she threw the door open \"this is next level.\"<br>\r\nTwo laboured steps in and Rhonda had not been wrong about the diner been 'next level'. Surrounded by the familiar sights and sounds of feasting if I'd closed my eyes it would have been like I was back at Buttercombe BUT here there was nothing but enjoyment. No remorseful students having fallen victim of the all inclusive meal plan, not forced fat victims of the schools domineering feeders, just sheer decedent  indulgence laced with enjoyment bristled the air. This had to be heaven.<br>\r\nAs we headed for a table I noticed a few stand out patrons amongst the fray of a surprisingly busy breakfast crowd. At the first table left of the door sat three girls looking fresh from a hard night of drinking and dancing. Common for young people right? Well the impressive food babies the three were sporting certainly weren't common. With high heels discarded under the table to let their feet breath, all three girls were laid back in their booth as the table was cleared only for each place to be refilled with a fresh plate piled high with breakfast food and grease. Eagerly each started to dig in to their refills between small chatter between one. One particular brunette of the group let rip a burp I'd be proud of which had the added bonus of popping the side seam of her green dress. As we passed I caught a glimpse of her fingering the hole in the material and touching two noticeable rolls that were not damage of a single morning.<br>\r\nAs I followed Rhonda across the floor a particularly large lady in the back corner caught my eye, partly due to her impressive size (by my eye somewhere near the 500lb mark, go that chick) and partly by the waitress stood at her side funnel feeding her thick milkshake. It was obvious even at a distance that both girls in this equation were enjoying the arrangement with the one on the feeding end drinking deeply and groping the uppermost roll of her impressive belly whilst the waitress caressed her back rolls whilst handling the funnel.<br>\r\nAs Rhonda finally found us a table we sat down between an empty booth and one occupied by a couple comprising of a cute short red head in sports wear pushing doughnuts through her bloated boyfriends mouth. Over the chatter of the diner I could just make out comments of encouragement and teasing about the amount already eaten and how fat he was getting. Yep, definitely died and awoken in a fat girl fetish paradise porno.<br>\r\nIt took me far too long to realise that Rhonda was staring at me with a wide grin on her lips.<br>\r\n\"Told you it was different sweets\"<br>\r\nI sit, mouth slightly agape in wonderment of this frankly insane place I had stumbled upon. Mum was going to regret sending me here, my mouth was full of anticipation and saliva at this point. However, all the waitresses (because all the waiting staff were of a female persuasion *shrug*) were busy so naturally curiosity got the better of me once again.<br>\r\n\"So what is the deal with this place?\" I ask my aunt<br>\r\n\"Well\" she looked like she was considering her words carefully \"I really don't know. All I know is that whether intentional or not this place has attracted the fat lifestyle like no other and larger people or just their supporters flock here daily to get their fill\" she sipped surprisingly conservatively at a complimentary cup of coffee from the table and continued to look at me over the rim of the cup<br>\r\n\"Soooo...it's a fetish club then?\" A girl's got to ask right?<br>\r\n\"No, don't be silly\" Rhonda chastised \"that would be unsavoury\" she said, winking as she took another gulp. It's totally a fetish club.<br>\r\nAs we waited, we talked, just casual chit chat of relatives catching up, talking school and work and preferences in food. Turns out we were quite in sync but we decided jokingly that in our current states Rhonda would always beat me to left overs.<br>\r\nWe continued like this for what seemed like an eternity as our bellies had a sideline competition of who could make the most noise in protest but finally the best words in the world brought us back into the diner...<br>\r\n\"Hi guys, may I take your order?\"<br>\r\nInstantly excited, I glance to my right to see my in the moment new best friend...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing at the end of our booth at a tall girl height of about 5'10 to my unprofessional eye this brunette babe was straight popping and rocking some serious extra poundage.<br>\r\n\"Charlie?! Oh my god, when did you get back?\" squealed Rhonda, surprise surprise my aunt knew her.<br>\r\n\"Well well, not soon enough it seems\" Charlie smiled wryly, leaning into the table and playfully patting Rhonda's belly who giggled coyly in response. The waitress had something of a velvety voice that felt like it was hugging my ears, providing a minor distraction as I checked out her figure. The aforementioned poundage seemed predominantly piled up on her wide hips and mahoosive tits combining together to form a seriously exaggerated hourglass, but hadn't failed to contribute to some seriously thick thighs and the starts of a cute pudgy belly that was already slightly creased around the waist due to her swelled up hips curving up her sides. Needless to say Charlie was also rather pretty, chubby cheeks, full lips and button nose with ironic nerd glasses perched along the bridge, cascades of brown curls of hair rested on her shoulders to top the look off. Fuuuuuu...I was girl crushing hard.<br>\r\nMy daydream was broken to the sound of Rhonda and Charlie laughing together (damn those boobs bounce) and seemed to come back part way into a conversation.<br>\r\n\"...anyway, I've only been back from uni a couple of days, managed to get my job back straight away and couldn't wait to see my regulars again\" Charlie explained, hand on hip, notebook in the other.<br>\r\n\"Well it's good to see you, you can expect a good tip today sweetie as a welcome home and a leg up into the real world now you've graduated\" Rhonda smiled as she spoke, they obviously knew each other well and who could blame anyone for that?<br>\r\nCharlie laughed again, cradling the slight belly hang above her skirt \"I would say I've had enough 'tips' at uni but how can I say no to you?\" She looked off to another table before turning back to us \"I'll be back in just a sec, you guys are in for a treat when I get back!\" I watched as the bubbly waitress wobbled away, hips swaying wide with each step.<br>\r\n\"So that's Charlie, real sweet girl and it seems that Stuffington has agreed with her\" remarked Rhonda.<br>\r\nYou don't say<br>\r\n\"She used to be thinner?\" I ask, intrigue.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, like a rail when I first met her, she looks good now though. And to think she used to only like OTHER people piling on the pounds.\"<br>\r\nI nearly spit take at THAT little chestnut, although that would explain a few things. Before I got chance to ask anything else about the apparently feeder inclined babe serving us, the woman in question was back at the foot of the booth finishing off what looked to be a waffle from her free hand.<br>\r\n\"So, what will it...\" Charlie swallowed the waffle \"oh, where are my manners!\" She looked at me squarely for the first time with a playful grin to say the least and with a fake southern drawl \"who is this purdy lil thang Rhonda?\"<br>\r\n\"This is my niece, Mel\" answered my aunt with a coy smile<br>\r\n\"Hello\" I manage, somewhat lost for words. Never could I have imagined to land in a place like this even if I had known about it, never mind by chance. Who knew dreams come true.<br>\r\n\"Well\" Charlie stepped to my side and, without a moment of hesitance, placed a hand on my overflowing muffin top bulge and another square on my belly which sent shivers up my spine \"looks like she knows her way around a dinner plate.\" I can make out Rhonda giggling as Charlie's face filled my field of vision and pinched my cheek, god she was pretty...<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna look after you two good today ladies\" announced Charlie, lingering a moment longer in front of me before striding off towards the kitchen.<br>\r\nAbsolutely dumbfounded I just stare across the table at Rhonda who is trying not to laugh too hard into her hand.<br>\r\n\"She likes you sweetie\" Rhonda winked at me<br>\r\nStill overcome by the buxom waitress, me and Rhonda idly chat, mostly to fill me in on the catch up I'd zoned out of earlier.<br>\r\nTurns out Charlie is 24, little older than me, just graduated from Stuffington University and had left quite the impression on many of the student body who were now larger than their freshman selves had been before meeting Charlie, something she was quite proud of. Rhonda had also ascertained that Charlie enjoyed her own growth equally to her pet projects starting to pudge up deliberately once her hips and boobs bloomed. Blissfully unaware of passing time as I daydreamed about this dream girl I'd been introduced to, Charlie was walking back towards us with a large platter cradled on each arm. With a wide smile raising her cheeks subtly, Charlie placed a platter in front of each of us with a thud due to the weight of food on each one. The mountains of food set my senses alight.<br>\r\nSat before us was a plethora of breakfast foods from sausages and bacon through to hash browns, waffles and pancakes. Salivating hard I turn my fat ass straight to the table and hungrily grabbed my cutlery ready to dig in. I'd been waiting far too long for this beast as my belly roared in desperation of the feast before me.<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy your meals ladies, I've been your server Charlie and don't hesitate to ask if you need anything else\" Charlie rattled off in a mock habit, her own eyes swimming in wonderment at the gluttony she was about to witness.</span></div></div>",

I caught a glance of the woman across the table from me and saw a large dint in her breakfast platter already missing and, with a glimmer of pride, I up my own game. No way was I getting out eaten by a woman half my size. Fork loads of eggs, sausage and syrup drenched waffle passed my lips, each greasy mouthful met with a moan of appreciation only to be muffled by the next meaty mouthful leading to yet another moan. I love food ok? You don't get this huge without enjoying putting things in your mouth!<br>\r\nOut of the corner of my eye I catch a glimmer of Charlie moving and waddling up the diner again and out of sight. I think nothing of it, burp loudly and continue to tackle the now smaller mountain of food in front of me. Time starts to blur between mouthfuls and I hit my autopilot stride, a rhythm matched by Rhonda, and just eat oblivious of my surroundings as we both cross the half way mark with the breakfast feast.<br>\r\nNext thing I know my trance is broken by a hand on my shoulder and I see Charlie placing a large basket of muffins by my platter. Charlie smiles at me and returns to the table opposite, perching on the surface before producing three muffins for herself which she starts to eat not so delicately. Aware of her creased tummy sandwiches between her massive rack and hips I become aware of my own tightness and take the time to roll my stretchy bottoms off my growing belly which allows it to surge forward slightly, resting against the table when breathing out. Gotta eat more!<br>\r\nAttacking the muffin basket with new gusto I inhale five without realising then down an extra three before hitting the remaining platter in front of me. Having eaten all liquid foods I lose the cutlery and get my hands in there which helps my speed with fistfuls of breakfast meats and batter products disappearing in my ever expanding stomach. Alternating between muffins, burping and the remnants of my plate I'm nearly done and in good time but just a few mouthfuls from finished...<br>\r\nThe relatively quiet diner is shook by a right ripper of a burp and I know Rhonda has beaten me to the end. Feeding the last of the breakfast to myself I look up at my unintentional opponent, hands gently caressing her dominating belly with the buttons of her shirt stretched wide, displaying diamonds of taut skin the length of her front.<br>\r\nLooking slightly dazed, Rhonda sticks her tongue out at me tauntingly and the sound of clapping erupts from the side of us. Charlie was now on her feet, her jaw working on chewing god knows what now, and clapping to our victory.<br>\r\n\"Well done ladies! I'm impressed\" Charlie declares as she starts to clear up our plates<br>\r\n\"The question remains though, do either of you want anything else after that?\" This question was posed with a hand on each of our bloated stomachs, giving a gentle jiggle to each as if gauging our fullness.<br>\r\nRhonda and I share a glance over the table, deeply contested about what to do. We were both kinda full at this point but the food here was to die for!<br>\r\nI feel Charlie drum lightly on my belly with her finger tips waiting for an answer</span></div></div>",

Each plate stacked high with either pancakes or French toast, all drenched in syrup and butter. She deposits the plates quickly before turning off again and collecting another couple of muffin baskets, one each to go with the replenished plates.<br>\r\nBoth me and my aunt look in awe at the piles of food before us, slightly taken aback at the quantity. Needless to say neither of us were expecting that much when we asked for more BUT like good fat soldiers we ploughed on, face first into our second course.<br>\r\nI'd not noticed how orgasmic these pancakes tasted before when they were mixed in but having them on their own was a whole new experience and brought to the surface a new wave of enthusiasm for eating. Rhonda seemed to be following my lead and was currently lent up against the table, her hands on the back of a monster stack of pancakes holding it steady as she pushed her face deep into the pile taking big mouthfuls of sweet batter. I'm thinking this woman could one day be my idle, like, if she gained 500lbs and managed to over take me or something. Anyway, seeing the advantage I adopt her technique and drive my face into the sweetness.<br>\r\nDeep in gluttonous nirvana neither of us noticed our empty plates being rotated out with fresh stacks of pancakes and French toast, and neither of us cared...that is until we hit the wall.<br>\r\nAlmost identically Rhonda and I collapsed back in our seats, groaning and rubbing our heavily distended stomachs. Remember when I released my belly and it was touching the table? Well now it was trying to eat the fucking table! Rock solid with sweetness my heavy lower roll was pressed hard against the table edge which was causing some discomfort and yet all I could think was I wanted more pancakes!<br>\r\nRhonda wasn't fairing much better. A button from her shirt had burst off from the pressure of her rounded belly and shed left sticky finger prints over the tight surface like badges of honour to her feast.<br>\r\nBreathing heavily and struggling to stay focused on anything we only just register Charlie trotting back to the table with her usual bounce<br>\r\n\"Well well well, are my girlies struggling to eat up?\" She asked us, knowing the answer, as she lent into the table with her tits nearly falling out whilst grabbing a pancake between her teeth.<br>\r\nLethargically we both nod, clutching our bellies delicately.<br>\r\nLaughing softly, Charlie swiped another couple of pancakes \"well I can help if you want, you thirsty?\"<br>\r\nLooking innocent I completely missed her point and nodded my consent.<br>\r\nThe point also evaded me when another waitress, a rather heavy bellied blonde for anyone keeping score, brought a large blender to the table and dumped the remaining pancakes into the jug.<br>\r\nI started getting suspicious when ice cream, milk and cream were added into the jug.<br>\r\nMight have started to regret my decisions when Charlie hopped up onto the table in front of me and placed the jug to my lips.<br>\r\nAnd, just as I should have really started reevaluating how I make life choices...the creamy liquid hit my throat and I hit pleasure again.<br>\r\nRelaxing slightly in my seat I felt Charlie caress my bloated belly as she continued to pour which helped the pleasure side considerably.<br>\r\n\"That's my girl, not so bad is it?\" Charlie's soft voice rang in my ears and I drank deeply from the jug, vaguely aware that Rhonda was moaning on the other side of the table as she received the same treatment from the other waitress.<br>\r\nAnd, just as quickly as it had started, it had ended. Almost sad it was over the heaviness in my belly suddenly hit again and I felt the drowsy hit. With a playful slap to my skin tight belly Charlie hopped of the table, propped herself against the opposite table again and indulged in a pancake milkshake of her own. I couldn't help but watch as she did and swore the girls waist swelled as she drank.<br>\r\nOnce Charlie had finished she licked her lips clean, put the jug down and, with one hand on her slightly fuller belly, looked at the two hugely engorged women before her.<br>\r\n\"Anything else for the two queens?\" She asked with a Cheshire Cat smile</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So far past the ability to talk at this point, Rhonda and me both shook our heads which was a hard task in itself. Jesus, I've not been this full in months and judging on how badly she was flagging my curvaceous aunt had probably never been this full in one sitting ever. It suited her.<br>\r\nBoth of us were sweating pretty intensely and our faces were plastered in syrup from the pancake binge which lured us to lick our lips for traces of the sugary fluid which was enjoyable and regretful all at once.<br>\r\nCharlie was stood over us at the foot of the table, hands on her hips and the same Cheshire Cat smile from before.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm a little sad that I can't keep doting on the pair of you but I guess there will be more opportunities later\" fuck me, the feeder vibes...<br>\r\n\"How's about you two take a lil siesta before you try to get up?\" Charlie suggested, not that getting up was likely at this point anyway.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds like a good *burp* idea\" Rhonda's voice nearly made me jump having not heard her talk the entire meal but I was flagging more at the idea of a nap right now...<br>\r\nAnd just like that my eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*two hours later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sleepy heads!\"<br>\r\nI barely felt my eyes flicker before Charlie's voice cut through the air<br>\r\nI sat up slightly, hands on my belly as I groaned into a seated position. Rhonda was groggily sat up across from me barely awake herself whilst Charlie was on a loose chair at the end of the table with three or four empty plates sat in front of her which the prominent food baby indicated she'd emptied herself<br>\r\n\"Tips sweetie\" she'd obviously noticed my confusion and chuckled<br>\r\nI go to start talking but am stopped in my tracks as a huge belch bursts through my lips, tasting sugary with a hint of bacon grease. The mouth eruption seems to please Charlie, obviously a believer in the whole compliments to the chef thing, and I'm far too weighed down to care still.<br>\r\nMy aunt is fighting her own battles at this point, every button on her shirt was long gone now revealing her lacy bra perched on top of her bloated stomach which had forced her thighs apart for extra breathing room. I remember those days of such a stance being optional rather than compulsory a la me, they were good.<br>\r\n\"So\" Charlie broke the silence again, chewing on a seriously thick burger as she did \"when will we be seeing you two for food again then?\"<br>\r\n\"Well after this morning I'm pretty sure I'm set to hibernate\" declared Rhonda, cradling her stomach with a face caught between discomfort and pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Pffft, you'll be back in no time Rhonda, I've seen you eat big girl\" Charlie teasingly nudged Rhonda which provoked a small smile of knowing. In all fairness she wasn't wrong or so I hoped because I could eat here every day.<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, you two take it easy for the rest of the day and I'll come round tomorrow and check on my new favourite customers?\" suggested Charlie, peering over the remnants of her burger.<br>\r\nRhonda's eyes instantly lit up at the thought of that and smiled an acceptance of the offer, a glimmer of her former energy shining through the pounds of breakfast food sat on her waist.<br>\r\n\"Great! So, you two shift your asses out of my booth so I can earn more 'tips' and I'll see you tomorrow!\" Charlie chirped.<br>\r\nI glanced at Rhonda then down at my swollen gut wedged against the table still...<br>\r\nGetting home was going to take a while...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The front door slammed shut and Charlie came striding in, greasy pizza dripping in one hand and a giant milkshake that were all too familiar at this point.<br>\r\nIt's also worthy of note that striding was something of a generous term as three months of hanging out with me and Rhonda had been quite...damaging.<br>\r\nClad in a sports bra and yoga leggings, Charlie's natural hourglass was still dominating her figure and swelling as such but the most interesting development around her body was the plump belly sandwiched between her wide hips and ample boobs. Forming a perfect smooth curve from under boob to hips, said belly had started to form from the first time Charlie had made a house call to the Carlyle girls and hadn't stopped since to this day where it sat punctuated with a deepening belly button in the lowest third of said curve and was starting to hang slightly over her groin.<br>\r\nAnd best of all, she didn't care in the slightest, if anything only exhibiting enjoyment for the gain.<br>\r\nWhilst she hadn't held back on feeding herself, Charlie had not neglected us.<br>\r\n\"Hiya sweetie!\" Rhonda cooed across the room as she waddled out of the kitchen. Waddled was definitely the word for Rhonda at this point. Currently bottomless, Rhonda's vast rear quaked with each laboured step with ripples of fat jiggling through the cellulite dimpled backside as the two huge cheeks ate her underwear, leaving the impression she wasn't wearing any. Her thighs weren't to sniff at either and, much like her arse cheeks, jiggled with each step and were gently kissed with cellulite. Like Charlie, Rhonda had also picked up some belly fat in the three months but, unlike our waitress friend, her middle had formed two thick rolls which creased at the belly button, the lower exaggerating her huge pear figure more and the upper supported her larger breasts, at least when she went braless.<br>\r\n\"Hey Rhonda\" smiled Charlie, watching the bubbly pear take a heavy seat (which she filled with ease) and assumed a stance behind her and proceeded to feed my aunt a slice of pizza over the back of the chair.<br>\r\nRhonda moaned softly as she chewed with her hands gently rested on the sides of her stomach.<br>\r\nHaving witnessed enough of this after two slices I cough to catch their attention, not that that should be required.<br>\r\nWithout a doubt I had maintained my status as the largest of our little crew and only looked bigger in my seated position. In said position I just looked like a mountain of fat, limbs and chins. I was fucking sexy!<br>\r\n\"Oh melly\" cooed Charlie, sliding round Rhonda's chair \"I'm sorry, I hadn't seen you there, you must be wasting away\" she winked whilst biting her lip, she knew that that made me hot. I could just make out Rhonda behind the plump waitress approaching me starting to tuck into one of the many bags of fast food Charlie had brought with her as she casually observed the scenes unfolding before her with a wry smile.<br>\r\nCharlie continued \"well this just isn't acceptable\" she sat on my knee and groped my belly rolls rather forcefully \"we better get some food in you, hadn't we?\" Her eyelashes batted innocently as my belly growled in her hands and I couldn't take it any more.<br>\r\n\"Damn right, I'm fucking starving!\" I shout.<br>\r\nCharlie nearly rolled of my lap laughing, sprung to her feet and tossed four bags my way.<br>\r\n\"There fatty, stuff your face\" Charlie teased back, plopping down herself and dug into her own feast hungrily.<br>\r\nFor a moment we silently feasted, nothing but chewing could be heard through the living room mixed with the sounds of the tv which was playing to itself at this point but Charlie soon broke the silence.<br>\r\n\"So\" she drank deeply from her milkshake, a trickle escaping her lips and dampening her cheek slightly \"I just came from the gym before getting the food\"<br>\r\nMe and Rhonda spit take, nearly showering the brunette in the process.<br>\r\n\"You're loosing weight?!\" Panicked Rhonda, setting a burger down with the seriousness of the moment<br>\r\nCharlie nearly choked on her mouthful and had to wipe her lips with the back of her hand \"oh god no, don't be crazy. Turns out gym guys love them some big girls, so I was told, so figured I'd give it a try and...\"<br>\r\nMe and Rhonda were practically falling of our chairs at this point waiting for an answer, this sounded like an opportunity for free food and we don't pass up on that.<br>\r\nReading the room, Charlie chuckled before carrying on \"well it obviously works. I've been to the gym twice this week and had like five cheat days\" this was dropped with an affectionate belly rub before carrying on eating.<br>\r\nRhonda and I looked at each other in awe as we slid back into our seats, both minds racing as we tried to process this new knowledge. We were snapped back promptly though as Charlie continued.<br>\r\n\"...but yeah, if you're interested I can take you some time and see what happens with a posse of fat girls descending on planet fit.\"<br>\r\nThe two Carlyles nod enthusiastically before returning to the food.<br>\r\nCharlie chuckles at our response - bitch - and swaps to a dozen doughnuts, still stroking her bloated belly as she diverted into sweet.<br>\r\n\"Oh! This is more for you now Mel.\" I vaguely turn to my ample hourglass shaped friend to acknowledge her<br>\r\n\"I was talking to an old friend from StuffU the other day, happened to mention a cool fat blonde chick I hang with now and she said that she remembers you from Buttercombe.\" Ok, now my interest is piqued.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, what's the name?\" I slowly pick food from my teeth with my tongue as I focus on the conversation.<br>\r\n\"Some chick called Hannah...\" Charlie began<br>\r\n\"Hannah Hammond?!\" I practically screamed, VERY interested now.<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's the one, you knew each other well then?\"<br>\r\n\"You could say that...\" I idly grab at my at rolls, deep in thought. Charlie knew Hannah and wasn't the size of a bus? This was turning into a strange day indeed.<br>\r\nNoticing my groping Charlie nodded knowingly \"ahhh, I get it\" she throws a wink at me and goes back to her doughnuts.<br>\r\n\"You talk to her often now you've left university or?\" I enquire.<br>\r\n\"Surprisingly not much to be honest, we were roomies in my last year\" that sentence alone saw the demise of three doughnuts. Was always hypnotic watching Charlie eat, she had a grace to it that couldn't be explained.<br>\r\n\"She was actually just letting me know she was back on campus and wondered if I wanted to meet her some time soon.\" I didn't realise Charlie gazing deeply at me, trying to read my thoughts. \"You could come along if you want Mel?\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yeah, sounds good\" I mumble, not all there lost with my thoughts<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Charlie sat back with a bounce, discarding a now empty doughnut box and taking another in her hands.<br>\r\n\"Oh, just as a warning, she's changed a bit since you last saw her\"<br>\r\nHmm, the plot thickens indeed. How could Hannah have changed in like 18 months or whatever it had been, something wasn't right but I'm not sure...<br>\r\nA thick fabric ripping sound tore through the room, the sharpness of which made me and Charlie jump slightly and we looked over to Rhonda. Swallowing hard my aunt shifted slightly in her chair then shoves a chubby hand down the side of her hip. Tongue stuck out from concentration as her arm moved, indicated by periodic twitches in her shoulder. Captivated, me and Charlie both watch my engorged aunt pull a strip of red lacey material from under her gargantuan arse cheek. The remains of her panties ripped again slightly on a seam as she rested all her weight back on the dangling fabric prematurely but swiftly whipped the last of it free. Without missing a beat she tossed the shredded fabric to one side, edged herself off her chair onto her knees and, belly rested against the edge of the table, pulled a family sized cheesecake towards herself and proceeded to chow down on it straight from the packet.<br>\r\nLost for words, we watched the pear shaped woman continue her gorging, whisps of hair trailing in the creamy surface as she ate.<br>\r\n\"How is she not a complete land whale yet Mel?\" Asked Charlie, I could hear the amazement in her voice mixed with a little bit of swoon.<br>\r\nI really don't know\" I glanced over to see Rhonda push her full face into the cake, smearing her face with cream but still doesn't miss a beat.<br>\r\n\"I have no idea at all\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Welcome to Stuffington University ladies!\"<br>\r\nCharlie was stood under an ornate arch, grinning ear to ear with her arms up pointing to said arch as me and Rhonda waddled towards her.<br>\r\n\"Argh, this is so exciting coming back here! I love it!\" Charlie was seriously squealing at this point, not that she'd particularly stopped from the moment I agreed to go with her to meet up with Hannah. Rhonda had come just for the food, although she wasn't alone on that front. Charlie had promised us some good eating on this trip as well as socialising so we were instantly more sold although her comment about Hannah having changed had me hooked enough.<br>\r\nWhilst Rhonda and I had squeezed ourselves into whatever we could fit into with relative decency, Charlie had gone all out patriotic for her alma mater. Her shapely top donned what must have once been a loose fitting basketball vest now stretched tightly across her heaving tits and also gave away that her stomach had grown out a fair amount since buying the vest. She was also sporting some damn tight tracksuit bottoms that were struggling with the bottom half of her hourglass figure.<br>\r\nThe brunette squealed some more as she slid her phone into her bra.<br>\r\n\"Hannah's here, she's said to meet her at one of the canteens. Follow me!\" I swear if she wasn't now so fat she would have ran off ahead.<br>\r\nThe three of us slowly made our way through the crowds of people swarming around the campus, weaving between equally excited people reuniting with friends from the previous year or obviously freshman students tottering around looking nervous as all hell. It didn't take long for me to notice something as we wandered along and I shot Rhonda a glance. She had also noticed.<br>\r\n\"So Charlie\" inquired Rhonda \"I notice that a lot of the people here are rather...plush?\" I could tell she got a bit nervous on the last word although I sensed nobody would be offended here, everybody plus sized seemed far too happy to be selfconcious of their weight.<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh yeah, you bet. The meal plan is extremely extensive, particularly since I pushed for some improvements\" Charlie shot us with that roguish look she had and a little wink followed as she turned back to focusing on her route.<br>\r\nRhonda dropped back to me again and shrugged \"I mean, I knew she was totally into other people putting on weight but this is next level\"<br>\r\nI snort a laugh \"sounds like a place we could get used to\"<br>\r\nMy aunt nodded before cracking a smile, she wasn't weirded out REALLY.<br>\r\nThe surrealism of the campus could not be ignored though as we walked past student after student.<br>\r\nA typical sporty couple, a cheerleader sweetheart and a football jock, walked past us hand in hand with a slight difference of at least 200 extra pounds between them, mostly distributed to her bulging belly but not missing him out by a good margin. A beautiful Hispanic girl waddled past outweighing Charlie and Rhonda comfortably whilst stuffing herself from a stack of syrup drenched pancakes in one hand. I also caught sight of a huge dude sat on the grass with what appeared to be a chubby goth girl and rail thin blonde mercilessly stuffing food in his waiting mouth. That was pretty hot.<br>\r\nI didn't go amiss that Charlie was also frequently approached by people of varying sizes and, like always, she managed to snag food on the way. She did filter some of it back and even indicated for some people to give directly to us which went down well as this walk was taking for-fucking-ever!<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet Charlie?\" I huffed, dragging my feet more than when we started. Rhonda wasn't much better but had apparently made friends with a couple of jocks who had spent the past 10 minutes running her food whilst their girlfriends, both of a bottom heavy persuasion seemed to be having a divine epiphany in her presence and were grilling her about her gain and how she got such a huge arse blah blah blah. I wanted some hot jock food servants and basic bitch sycophants!<br>\r\nCharlie chuckled, adjusting her bra under her vest and flipped her phone out. \"Yes we are fatty, you can sit down now\" she beckoned to a low wall which she propped herself against, her own impressive arse spreading on impact and she started texting away.<br>\r\nI took a seat heavily next to her and waited.<br>\r\nWe were indeed sat outside a canteen, the cruelty of which was not missed as the smell of food wafted our way. I was distracted though in part with a bit more people watching. A typical looking rocker guy walked past with a cute gut and threw me a wink which made my cheeks burn. Three nerdy type girls walked past in varying states of fat, none of them less than 250lbs by my eye and appeared to be arguing about some superhero stuff, I don't know, I'm not a nerd ok? The Hispanic girl from earlier came back and entered the canteen, joining an equally large black girl who slapped her on the arse with a cute laugh.<br>\r\nCloser to home, Rhonda was now pigging out with her new girlfriends whilst Charlie was mid hug with a pretty chunky jock of her own. I sigh in my direct loneliness but find myself liberated as a very familiar voice pierces the air, even if the words are unfamiliar.<br>\r\n\"Char, sweetie, is that you?\"<br>\r\nI look around to try and find the source of the voice, the very distinct Hannah Hammond, but find it impossible amongst the crowd of people milling in and out of the canteen.<br>\r\n\"And Mel? Char said you'd be here!\"<br>\r\nSuddenly from behind I feel a soft warm body embrace me, that can't be Hannah this soft...can it?<br>\r\nI turn to face my mystery hugger and well, Charlie wasn't wrong when she said Hannah had changed...</span></div></div>",

She was still sweet and cute looking and was currently sporting her hair slicked back into a ponytail that trailed down past her shoulders. She wasn't heavily made up, a slight touch of lippy, a hint of mascara and her trademark sharp eyebrows but still so typically Hannah. Well, if Hannah had been swallowed by a whale.<br>\r\nThe formerly thin Buttercombe senior was an absolute heifer!<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Mel, you didn't think you privatised fat did you?\" Hannah giggled with a slight flick of her hip causing her huge weight to jiggle. It was fair to say if I had privatised fat then Hannah had bought huge shares in it and I had no response to it so I just soaked her enormity in.<br>\r\nBelow the neck was where it started happening. Even beneath her clothes he weight in her shoulders was betrayed by the trademark bite mark of a too tight bra strap weighted down by some not too small not too big boobs. Her arms were also impressively fat and thick, straining her thin jumper/white shirt combo where her bingo wings sagged under their own weight as they hung away from her body, still maintaining the hands on hips stance. Her hips weren't to sniff at but Jesus they were dwarfed by a frankly enormous belly which obviously dominated her figure by a country mile. Unlike most, her belly was one single rounded form leading her figure and giving her an immensely wide girth to boot. The jumper she wore didn't even stretch over the crest of her huge stomach and was only held down at the back where a roll of fat pinched it slightly lower than it rested on her front. The bottom of the underlying shirt was also stretched, forming a triangle opening that was held dubiously by the button just above. Swear that poor button was a burger away from freedom. Although not dominant, her bottom half, that was desperately packed into a pair of jeans, was huge in itself. Thighs nearly as wide as her belly stretched the denim to its limits whilst her rear filled out in a modest peach compared to the rest of her body.<br>\r\nI was practically drooling at this point, seeing my teenage feeder so fat was something of a revelation.<br>\r\n\"Hannah!\" Charlie squealed and lept at her college roomie, colliding with the huge belly with a solid skin on skin slap and wrapped her arms around as much belly fat as she could grab.<br>\r\n\"Heya sweetie\" Hannah hugged the taller brunette back \"you're looking thin\"'she teased.<br>\r\nCharlie shot her a mock pout \"well you make anyone look small hippo hips, even Mel is barely bigger\"<br>\r\nI didn't want to admit it but she wasn't wrong. What was even stranger was that I didn't actually mind too much because Hannah looked SOOOO good. I felt Rhonda come up behind me, a hand on my shoulder and I felt a little better.<br>\r\n\"So ladies, are we gonna eat or what?\" Hannah idly scratched the lower curve of her enormous belly, revealing her poor punished jeans were unbuttoned and mostly unzipped, Jesus she was big.<br>\r\n\"Yes we are\" Charlie declared, pushing me and Rhonda forward towards the canteen.<br>\r\n\"Good because I am starving\" cooed Hannah as she led the way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And, more importantly, since when did Hannah Hammond enjoy being the fatty in her life? Whilst all this was going through my mind, Charlie slid a thick arm around the infinitely bigger brunettes hips and grabbed a meaty muffintop, squeezing it forcefully making fat to ooze slightly between her fingers. The two girls in front giggled and I got a bit of an insight into the how and why of it all and instead found myself wondering how Charlie had managed to stay AS thin as she had.<br>\r\nThe four of us found a table looking like a real motley crew as we took seats. Me and Hannah, as the biggest pair, squeezed our huge bulks into the relatively small space, bellies pressed against the table, thighs barely sliding under said table. It was a feat in itself and we shared a look, smirking at our position and we were instantly transported back to Buttercombe in our heads. Meanwhile, Rhonda was having her own struggles as her huge pear shaped booty spread on the seating, stretching her already taxed bottoms further as they let out a creak under pressure. Her freshly developing belly was also sat on her thighs and she hadn't stopped rubbing it as hunger gnawed away at her insides. In relative terms Charlie looked positively thin even if her hips were the complete opposite and her massive tits looked ready to sit on the table with cleavage on full display as she leaned forward slightly.<br>\r\nWe'd barely got ourselves comfortable before a towering plate of food was placed in front of each of us and I'll be damned if we didn't all nearly foodgasm there and then.<br>\r\nA more patient group would have observed the mountains of food before them, taking in all the different options available from fried chicken to pizza to burgers to cheese drenched fries to god only knows what as we were not those patient people. We were four gluttonous babes and we were starving.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I want to move back here\" moaned Charlie, blindly stuffing her mouth whilst groping her modest in comparison stomach.<br>\r\n\"You couldn't hack it babe\" teased Hannah, licking her lips as she inhaled food at a startling rate.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Charlie raised an eyebrow, burger in hand raised just shy of her lips \"you're on bitch\" and she dove in with new vigor.<br>\r\nHad me and Rhonda been paying attention we would have witnessed one hell of a binge but we were infinitely more intrigued by our own plates.<br>\r\nRhonda's gluttony had turned her into a bit of a slob, hey some people like that, let's not judge because she's sure as hell happy, and she was hunkered down more than the rest of us dragging food into her hungry mouth. Currently I was laid back in my seat as far as I could as I rolled my waistband down to expose the entirety of my mammoth gut which surged forward and slapped against the edge of the table. Content I resume my pig out as a fresh wave of plates gets delivered.<br>\r\n*some plates later*<br>\r\n\"Ohh god, I can't move\" groaned Rhonda, cradling her bloated middle.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about *urppp* it, we can hang around for a few hours then *urpppp* join the dinner crowd\" declared Hannah, seemingly largely unphased by the enormous quantity of food she'd just consumed aside from the vast expansion of her belly pressed heavy against the table.<br>\r\n\"Pfft\" came a snort from Charlie's corner as she stripped a chicken leg clean before tossing the bone \"time for dessert!\" Shouted the tall brunette, seemingly also unphased although, as the smallest to begin with, the aftermath was the most noticeable and she was sporting a monster food baby that was causing her heaving boobs to part slightly over the curve of belly and her thighs were also slightly parted to allow it to drop down under its own weight.<br>\r\nAs if on cue, dessert arrived and it was not a disappointment. Sat before each of us was an entire cheesecake, presliced and thick as a doorstep with a thick layer of biscuit topped in dense flavoured cream. We all hesitated, well, all but Charlie anyway who grabbed a slice and hit food ecstasy immediately. Not wanting to disappoint, the three of us followed suit to varying levels of enthusiasm. Rhonda caved quite early, already looking like she'd swallowed a beach ball she gave up after two slices and shoved the remaining cake into the centre of the table. I followed on not too far behind, mostly out of discomfort as my spherical midriff pressed hard against the table. Had it not been for that I could have easily beaten that cheesecake. Totally, I huffed to myself feeling more full than I care to admit.<br>\r\nAnd so just the two college girls were left, I should I say Charlie was left as Hannah was ALSO flagging.<br>\r\n\"Alright sweetie, you win\" Hannah patted Charlie's arm as she spoke.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The taller brunette mumbled through a mouthful of cheesecake before swallowing hard.<br>\r\n\"Oh this isn't a competition, this is getting fat. Period.\" Charlie clumsily mounted the table at this point and slid on her bum to position herself in front of Hannah.<br>\r\n\"Well that's all well and good but I think I'm fat enou...\" Hannah didn't get to finish as Charlie crammed a slice of cheesecake into her friends mouth.<br>\r\n\"Silly girl\" Charlie rolled her eyes as she wriggled forward, resting her thighs around Hannah's belly, as she bit into her own cheesecake \"you've a LONG way to go before you're fat enough.\" The bigger girl didn't even protest and actually formed a wicked smile with her full mouth as she chewed and swallowed. With a short laugh Charlie then lent to Hannah's ear and whispered \"don't worry, I have a long way to go too\" as she playfully fingered her belly button and pinched a thick roll of belly fat.<br>\r\nAs all this unfolded, me and Rhonda just stared dumbfound at the scene unravelling before us but, unable to move, we watched as the two college girls fed each other the rest of the cakes scattering the table as their respective figures continued to balloon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slow heavy footsteps echoed through the lavish student apartment of Hannah Hammond, serious money meant serious luxury it seemed even for young college girls with an eating addiction.<br>\r\nThe footsteps came to a halt, the sound of female grunting replacing them which was then swiftly followed by the loud groans of sofa springs obviously under immense strain which, given the place in question, could only mean one person was responsible. With this in mind one can only imagine the confusion at seeing a taller, ironically bespectacled, glaringly beautiful brunette taking up most of the suffering sofa by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was enormous, and it was Hannah's fault. Well, 'fault' was maybe harsh as Hannah had mostly just provided food that Charlie's ferocious appetite had consumed. Also, fault would imply that Charlie was unhappy with her size which was just completely wrong, she'd never been happier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in her seated position it was clear that her bottom half had won the battle of the brunettes natural hourglass figure. With thighs thicker than the average girls waist (not a Stuffington girl yet, just for clarity), coated in cellulite and creased up their length in heavy rolls anyone seeing her for the first time would be right in expecting a seriously large individual. If only they knew. As big as her thighs were, her arse was next level. Spreading wide on the sofa, the two enormous swelling cheeks were Charlie's favourite as they'd grown to dominate her figure and take the lions share of calories. Be it convenient not to bother or simply unable to dress her enormous rear in conventional sizes, Charlie had gone without wearing anything on her bottom half for a while now which proved to be rather stimulating for the huge girl and simply allowed her to coo over her own arse. Second to her enormous lower half was her belly which had exploded with fat despite her naturally thinner waist. Whilst seated the lowest roll took up a large portion of her lap and her muffintop/hips even rivaled the spread of her arse with a dense thick roll of fat that was more than a handful by a considerable margin at this point. Carrying on up, her belly formed three large rolls in total, a deep deep belly button buried between the lower two with the lowest curve kissed with the all too familiar cellulite. Her back formed rolls up the entire length where fat settled, creasing her smooth skin in cute layers. Despite falling behind, her ample chest was not to be frowned at having ballooned into huge spheres that still held their shape despite her weight and claimed one of her few allowances of clothing in the form of bra's which she was still quite comfortable wearing when effort permitted. Her arms had thickened beautifully into another unexpected favourite for the ex waitress and she often enjoyed having her underarm fat massaged and groped whilst she stuffed her face which had naturally followed suit in fattening up, although not extremely and she was more than noticeably still Charlie by facial appearance. Also worthy of note, despite her immense weight, Charlie was not suffering with sagging features or an overdose of cellulite. Her entire body had maintained a shapely form and cellulite was sparing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You comfortable sweetie?\" Hannah's voice called from the kitchen<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Charlie chirped excitedly, her immense belly roaring from hunger as the shorter brunette waddled into the living room, a service trolley in tow alighting the air with the smell of sweetness.<br>\r\nNow Hannah, despite being the bigger girl to start with, had actually slimmed down slightly, partly due to doting on Charlie and partly not getting a look in at such large portions with which to maintain her size. In contrast to popular belief this also was not a result of Hannah backsliding into old exclusively feeder tendencies, she simply found great enjoyment in watching Charlie grow which was definitely mutual.<br>\r\nWith the serving trolley situated in front of the enormous Charlie, Hannah teasingly lent across the trolley, took a large slice of chocolate cake and slowly ate it in front of her hungry room mate. Charlie licked her lips hungrily as this panned out, her stomach loudly protesting the lack of food coming her way.<br>\r\nHannah giggled as she swallows the last bite and slowly closed the gap between them, body jiggling in tandem with her steps. She picked up the remaining chocolate cake as she passed and, with some effort, straddled the much bigger girls lap putting the two belly to belly, causing the girls to moan subconsciously at the sensation of inches of soft fat pressing together.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Hannah continued to tease, lifting another slice of cake and taking a large slow bite. Caught between arousal and hunger Charlie nodded in response, parting her lips in anticipation.<br>\r\nSeeing an opportunity, Hannah kissed the enormous girl beneath her causing her cheeks to flush slightly. Charlie responded and returned the kiss in kind until Hannah broke their lips apart and crammed as much cake into Charlie's face as possible.<br>\r\n\"Good, because Momma's got work to do\" she smiled, her bulk rising and falling subtly as Charlie chewed thinking about the second serving trolley of cake waiting in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my eyes snap open and body lurch forward as I jump awake, the faint chill of the night catching me as the film of sweat chills on my body. Jesus that dream was intense. Rubbing my eyes, I absently check over my body, making sure I was awake and not the size of a frigging sofa. Despite being my normal size again I could feel my thighs tingling as I mentally recall the image of me looking fit to be banned from IKEA for life and find myself having to resist not to act on it. Aside from being a volume risk Hannah was laid next to me and it just didn't seem right getting off with her there. As that conundrum passes I feel my stomach growl, making yet another demand which I was more than happy to indulge, might as well enjoy that pleasure at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy bare feet pad across the cold hard floors to the kitchen and I'm aware of my body jiggling with each step, belly wobbling, thighs jiggling and boobs bouncing free of their daytime confines. I cup my sweater stretchers to readjust them for comfort just in time to open the fridge and, as I browse, I hook my panties out of my arse crack to relieve the wedgie that had created itself from the bedroom to the kitchen. Unashamed I fish out a left over pizza, three quarters of a cake, a litre of ice cream and grab a bag of Doritos on the way to the sofa. Putting my food down, I lie on the sofa again getting flashes of my dream as I do and, in the interest of future proofing, I stretch my arms out to simulate dream me's girth.<br>\r\n\"We've got a long way to go Han\" I whisper, glancing at each stretched hand with a smile.<br>\r\nShrugging I start to eat, taking from the pizza first as I contemplatively rub my belly. It had only been a couple of weeks since I'd brought Mel and Rhonda to see Hannah but already we had had a 'bad' influence on each other, mostly due to the fact I kept staying over with my old roommate at her flat. I curled up slightly as I reflect, still cupping my belly as it squeezes against my thighs. The weight didn't bother me in the slightest, if anything I was game for that and wanted more. The odd thing though was how dream me and dream Hannah seemed to be together. Whilst eating, I ponder that as well. Despite being active at college and indulging in feeding guys and girls I'd never actually properly had a relationship with another girl, not even Hannah when we lived together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*some hours later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding myself having fallen asleep I rub my eyes again and brush off many more food cartons than I remember getting. I hear rustling in the kitchen and, with difficulty, hoist myself up and head to the kitchen. Bent over, Hannah's arse is sticking up in the air as she forages on the fridge for breakfast.<br>\r\nCradling my food baby I stare hypnotised at that arse and the bulging hips exposed above it and I feel my mind make itself up there and then.<br>\r\nI want to get fat, I want Hannah to get fat AND I want Hannah<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon realising this new 'life goal', I find myself caught off guard. You're not like this Charlie, you're confident and dominant and know what you want and how to get it. And yet, stood before Hannah's jiggling behind with her head in the fridge had me weak at the knees and chewing my lip. Was this REALLY such a weird thing? Nooo, I've dated before, I've been the one to ask people out and yet...this seemed different. Hannah was blissfully unaware of me as she searched and I took some tentative steps forward. See? This is good, just stay calm Charlie and it's all going to be ok. It's all going to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I tripped over a kitchen chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor fucks sake Charlie! My head screamed at me as I fell through the air, everything feeling like slow motion as my foot untangled itself from the furniture catapulting me forward. Instinctively I put my arms forward but it took me a little longer to work out where this was going. I didn't realise before my hands grasped bum flesh anyway, followed swiftly by my face connecting with the same bum I was holding onto. The momentum also had a pushing effect on Hannah who dipped deeper into the fridge before steadying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Hannah! Are you ok? I'm so sorry!\" Freaking out, I helped the larger girl stand.<br>\r\n\"It's fine sweetie, I'm fine! See?\" Hannah turned to face me, arms outstretched with most of her face covered in what appeared to be chocolate cake. Nervously I started chewing my lip again and crossed my legs slightly, mumbling some agreeing sentiment, trying not to lock eyes. Although on second thought, eyes might have been the safest bet as she stood there in a pair of panties and a highly stretched sleeveless top that barely covered her belly button.<br>\r\nHannah laughed to herself \"anyway, I finally found my prebreakfast snack thanks to that little push. You want some Char?\" I glance at Hannah's cake smeared facing wantingly knowing that wasn't what she meant but knowing also that that was what I wanted rather badly at this point.<br>\r\n\"You in there Char? Sweetie?\" I'd started daydreaming. Jesus, such a loser.<br>\r\n\"Huh? I'm just tired...\" I lie, still stood awkwardly which she must be able to see.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, ok then. You want some cake then or not?\" I was barely hearing her words at this point and then suddenly my body was on the move again. Uh oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing I was aware of was my hands groping a heavy muffin top, my eyes closed and my lips attached to a second pair of chocolatey lips. Shit!<br>\r\nI leap away from Hannah, shocked at myself and come over severely embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"You did know I meant the cake in the fridge right?\" Asked Hannah<br>\r\nI nod, staring intently at my own feet<br>\r\n\"And you still went for the cake on my face?\" A smile forming on the corner of her lips<br>\r\nI nod again, god my toe nails need painting.<br>\r\n\"So I'm going to guess that you actually intended to kiss me there then?\" <br>\r\nI wonder if painting toe nails is a reasonable excuse to get out of this conversation...<br>\r\nI feel Hannah's belly push against my bulging middle and force me backwards until my back is against the wall where two thick arms come up either side of my head as Hannah's face fills my vision. I feel my knees go weak and my thighs start to burn with excitement.<br>\r\n\"Well you better get used to it\" Hannah says as she places a chubby hand on my cheek and initiates kissing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you got seriously fat?\" Asked Hannah as she gently fed me a slice of cake.<br>\r\nI nod as I swallow \"yeah, it was incredible\" I reply, slowly massaging my belly whilst fondling the rolls running up Hannah's sides which elicited soft moans from my feeder.<br>\r\n\"Wow, Charlie the feeder gets fat\" Hannah smirked \"bet there's a few people that would want to see that\" she commented idly whilst continuing to feed me.<br>\r\nI snort with laughter, having to swallow again \"this from Hannah the heifer?\" I playfully slap my now girlfriends bulging stomach which was now firmer than it had been this morning.<br>\r\n\"You make a fair point\" Hannah said as she lent in to kiss me which I receive longingly.<br>\r\n\"Think it's fair to say that, with our reputations, neither of us is going to go hungry in this new...arrangement we have going here\" I say, tracing the edge of Hannah's deepening belly button, causing the belly heavy girl to moan some more.<br>\r\n\"I hope not\" cooed Hannah \"because I am absolutely ravenous.\" We both laugh at this and feed cake to the other, eying each other lovingly in the process.<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which\" the larger brunette started \"when do you next have work sweetie?\"<br>\r\n\"They're just going to call me when they need me at the moment, they aren't desperate. Why?\" I tilt my head inquisitively<br>\r\n\"Because I have an idea\" Hannah lent forward to grab her phone, punched in a number and waited all whilst I continued to enthusiastically put cake away, taking my head to the other side of the sofa we're sharing, using my toes to tease the rolls of fat up Hannah's side.<br>\r\n\"Hey there, I'm gonna need a lot of food.\"<br>\r\nMy ears prick up at this and I just catch Hannah winking at me as my stomach growls loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*three weeks later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's apartment laid quiet, the midday sun breaking through occasional gaps in curtains throughout the many rooms in a peaceful autumnal sense. And then the phone rang, cutting through the silence. More specifically, my phone rang. And it rang. And it rang. The ringing chorus was enhanced by the groans of two girls who both sounded short of breath.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" I ask into the phone.<br>\r\n\"Oh hiya! How's the diner? Good, good. You need me to come in? Tomorrow? Cool, I'll see you then!\" I toss the phone to one side and wander into the living room. The light was warming on my skin and I stretched with a smile, forming an impressive silhouette. Although it had only been three weeks, Hannah had not disappointed when she said she was ordering a lot of food and the reality had been that we had spent the entire time eating or feeding each other. And this is why I looked 11 months pregnant. Being thin in the waist meant little to declare in the belly front but I was working through a serious deficit at this point causing my normally pudgy belly to be round, firm and hanging over my waist band. I had also been informed that the outer curves of my food toddler were visible from behind at my absolute peak. The speed of the growth had also caused stretch marks to burst across my hips and sides like red thunder bolts. My natural assets had padded out from the already digested calories causing my panties to disappear further between my thighs and blossoming arse cheeks whilst my boobs were tightly squeezed into a lacy bra which was biting into the tops of my bountiful chest. I proudly caressed my body, taking pleasure in squeezing myself as I go.<br>\r\n\"Work tomorrow then?\" called Hannah<br>\r\nI turn on my heels to see my girlfriend stood in the doorway, or more taking up most of it. I'd made sure she had her fair share of food these past weeks. Hannah was largely unchanged, apart from her belly that is. If I was 11 months pregnant then Hannah must be expecting twin elephants at this point. Her belly preceded her greatly at this stage in a huge spherical curve and it was enormously sexy. On more than one occasion I'd greased her belly up and slid up and down feeding her until she passed out, and then a little bit more whilst her reflexes were still awake. Urgh I can't wait to be that big. Her hips were enormous rolls that were deeply creased from the weight of her belly and her belly button was to die for, I could tease that for hours....<br>\r\nHannah coughed, causing her belly to jiggle and bringing me back to earth.<br>\r\n\"So you have to go to work tomorrow sweetie?\" She asked again with a wry smile<br>\r\nNow I had a conundrum...</span></div></div>",

I mean, I am COMPLETELY obsessed with piling on the pounds these days but that's not all that I do.<br>\r\nIn the two months since getting canned (nearly three months since we last spoke by the way) I've taught myself the ways around a kitchen and I'm quite the dab hand in there now.<br>\r\nYeah, thats right, I can cook and bake now AS WELL as eat and let me tell you there are a few fat inches accountable to my culinary skills on me and Hannah thank you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhhh, speaking of Hannah<br>\r\n\"Evening sweetie\" called Hannah from the hallway as she lumbered in through the front door, the great weight that she was causing floorboards to creak and moan.<br>\r\n\"Evening Hannah bear\" I coo as saliva starts to form in my mouth at the meer sound of her voice.<br>\r\nWhether Hannah had worked her feeder magic on me or whether the insatiable nature of my appetite was self inflicted, I was a complete slave to her and to food.<br>\r\nAnd then, there she was, the woman who made me feel like a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roguish smile adorning her lips with a slightly more pronounced double chin hugging the bottom portion of her face, Hannah gazed at me with a blazing combination of adoration and lust.<br>\r\n\"Well\" started Hannah, hand on heavy hip as she spoke with teasing allure \"I hope you've been eating whilst I've been out\"<br>\r\n\"Oh I have\" I purr, passions burning as my hunger rises again just from Hannah talking \"but I need more\"<br>\r\n\"Need?\" teased Hannah again \"Or want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMhmph, the girl knows what I like.<br>\r\nAnd with that, I take to my feet for the first time and slowly make my way towards the much bigger girl in the door.<br>\r\nOh yeah, check out how FAT I've gotten too!<br>\r\nUp nearly 60lbs, 247lbs in total, curves for days.<br>\r\nI mean, seriously, I drank melted ice cream until my ass ripped a pair of leggings clean off not that long ago.<br>\r\nMy boobs are bigger, my thighs rub like all the time now and those love handles, umph.<br>\r\nI'm no slouch in the belly department these days either, all soft and full alongside those hips, but lets be honest, I'm a princess in a queen's world as far as bellies go in this flat.<br>\r\nAnd what a queen she makes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's be honest, I'm, historically, primarily a feeder so Hannah had to take some pounds in this relationship too and boy did she.<br>\r\nI mean, I've probably gained more as far as numbers go but she had a serious head start and she wears it so well!<br>\r\nDid I mention that, on her hands and knees, her belly pools on the ground? Like literally spreads out underneath her.<br>\r\nLooking at that I don't know if I want to match it or watch it grow more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, whilst I've been monologuing...<br>\r\nThe gap now closed with barely a food baby between us I glance up at Hannah longingly before whispering \"Need\"<br>\r\nWry smile already painted on Hannah leans forward ever so slightly, nudging me with her immense belly \"Good, because food is on the way\"<br>\r\nExcitement overflowing I just HAVE to hug her and, throwing my arms around her neck, I do.<br>\r\nI hear Hannah chuckle softly as I do, a faint flow of air from her nose tufting my hair before she steps back, dislodging me from my position around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh uh little missy\" taunted Hannah with an authoritative wag of her finger \"you know the rules; don't burn calories\"<br>\r\nI giggle softly, putting my hands coyly around my back, teasing my ass as I do.<br>\r\n\"How about I give you something to aspire to though?\" asked Hannah, innocence dripping from her tongue as she took a gentle step towards me again.<br>\r\nCurious, I cock my head slightly.<br>\r\nHer smile never wavering, Hannah simply took hold of her shirt hem and in one, albeit troublesome, move, discarded the item of clothing to reveal her extensive pale belly.<br>\r\nWell, half of it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout breaking character even once and with her thick fingers gently pressed into her bulging muffin top, Hannah continued the tease.<br>\r\n\"So? Inspired enough yet?\" teased the brunette \"or do you NEED some more?\"<br>\r\nEmphasis laden on the word 'need', Hannah proceeded to hook her thumbs into the overtaxed waistband of her leggings which were pulled over the hang of her belly all the way up to her belly button.<br>\r\nMy face apparently gave it all away though as, with my lip nearly ripped to shreds by my teeth, Hannah simply laughed heartily before continuing her little show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Hannah proceeded to roll the mightily stretched material down inch after inch of bulging flesh, sucking in gently to ease the passage of material.<br>\r\nUnable to break my eyes from the scene playing out before me, I simply watched as more of Hannah's immense belly slowly bulged out of her leggings, the sheer weight of itself causing it to rest against and bulge over the waistband she pulled down, teasing me no end as my desperation to be that big and to stuff Hannah beyond full clashed in an erotic maelstrom.<br>\r\nThen, with one final heave, Hannah had exposed herself entirely, the vast quacking mass of her belly fat still wobbling as it bounced against her thighs as her sizable hip rolls took to covering her leggings waistband.<br>\r\nWell aware of what she was doing, Hannah then asked me the one question she knew the answer to<br>\r\n\"Do you want to be this fat Charlie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords eluding me completely, I simply nodded as I fidgeted from one foot to the other, lip still been mangled between my teeth.<br>\r\nContent with the extent of her teasing, Hannah took the heavy steps required to close the gap between us<br>\r\n\"You best get eating then\"<br>\r\nAnd I swear to God, as soon as she said that, the doorbell rang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably about 20 minutes had passed but I really wasn't sure.<br>\r\nGod, I didn't even know which hands were putting food in my mouth at this point, whether they were my own or whether Hannah was doing it.<br>\r\nThe reality of it was that we were both cramming me full of greasy takeaway products like they were going out of fashion.<br>\r\nWhich, maybe they were, because Hannah had gone to the door another twice since the initial delivery with more food in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular feast pause was delivery number four which, whilst Hannah collected it, left me attended to by a large box of noodles.<br>\r\nThe damn things were near gone by the time she returned.<br>\r\nAs Hannah laid down the latest line of pizzas and kebab meat, she couldn't help but pass comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good girl Char, keep eating like this and you'll be my size, hmm, by the time you're 30\" chimed Hannah as she stroked my developing food baby fondly.<br>\r\nSlightly enraged by the suggestion, I bore down even more, attacking a poor unsuspecting chicken kebab with gusto<br>\r\n\"Skoo da'!\" I shouted through my many mouthfuls as Hannah dived into a particularly greasy and meaty calzone<br>\r\n\"Now what have I told you about burning calories darling?\" teased Hannah as she took a large bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI roll my eyes at her comment but swallow my kebab before diving against Hannah's belly.<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you should stop stealing my calories then\" I suggest with a hint of seduction before, hands on her knees, I lean in and bite the half protruding calzone, pulling it clean from her mouth and eating it whole.<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose if you want to be bigger than me by making me waste away\" started Hannah, rather downtrodden before been cut off by a returning slice of folded pizza.<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh, don't waste calories\" I chime before forcing the meaty dough into her mouth and chasing it down with a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least I got fired before I got too big for the place, as amazingly hot as that would be.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I feel like my Aunt needs a little backstory here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo like I said, we never really got to bond much when I was a kid. Mostly because I spent ages fourteen to eighteen in a ritzy isolated preparatory school in the mountains, but also because my Mom never really made it possible for my Aunt to visit us, or vice versa. I never really thought much about it, being a kid and all, but as I got older and I started to awaken to my own peculiar desires, I began to notice some striking similarities between my Mom's relationship with her sister and my Mom's relationship with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever Aunt Rhonda came over, my Mom would make me and my sister (and my Dad too, now that I mention it) watch our portion sizes. She always got super crazy about how much we ate whenever Aunt Rhonda came around, and at the time (in my younger, more naive days) I thought that it was because she wanted to make sure that her sister got enough to eat. Forgive me, I was like five. But what was actually happening was a lot more indicative of how she'd treat <i>me</i> every year I came back heavier for Christmas. My Mom wasn't making sure that Aunt Rhonda had enough to eat, she was trying to curb our appetites so that <i>we</i> didn't end up like Aunt Rhonda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since I was a little girl, my Aunt had been a big woman. Like, a <i>big</i> woman. Compared to my cutting-board Mom and my then not-Dad-bodded father, my Aunt had to have been the biggest person in history to itty bitty me. She was about as tall as mother but, to put it bluntly, she was so big around that no one knew how to give her a proper hug. My Mom would always falter and my Dad just sort've avoided it altogether, but little me? Little cute, chubby, nine year old Mel? I just wrapped my arms around her belly and gave her big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I guess it was then that my Aunt decided that I was her favorite niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll growing up, my Aunt made sure to ask about me. How I was doing in school, what I was going to do when I graduated, how I was handling living away from home. It was like poor Alice never existed! Which was only fair considering I got little to no maternal interest or guidance at home before I moved out. It was only fitting that I got love from <i>someone</i>, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, it wasn't like we didn't have anything in common. As I got older, I found that I was very much cut from the same cloth as my aunt. We both loved food to the point of excess, and we both loved to fuck with my Mom. What more in life was there? By the time I was eighteen and ready to move out (read: be kicked out) of my Mom's, I was even about her size--four hundred pounds of pure, unadulterated lardass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that had been a while. In fact, I hadn't seen Rhonda since my Junior year, when she came over for Christmas dinner. But she had been ready and willing to show us all four hundred pounds of hungry hungry hippopotamus that she was as she scarfed down the lion's share of the meal, leaving only myself and Alice keeping up behind her with varying amounts of success. Needless to say, I suspected her to be a bit bigger by now, but I digress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps being more <i>sensitive</i> to the prospect of breaking furniture with nothing but the sheer weight of her ass, my Aunt Rhonda was gracious enough to let me live with her in the low-country. She'd moved there a while back and had found it most \"appeasing\" (no shit, she actually said it with a wink) for her appetites. So naturally, when I told her I was having a spat with my Mom, she was the first person to suggest that I come live with her instead. After all, graduates were <i>supposed</i> to move out of their parents' house, right? I wasn't doing anything illegal or anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo my Aunt was nice enough to splurge on the plane ride up here (not an easy feat! My ass alone takes up two seats!) and even sprung for a car to take me home to her beach house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know what my Aunt did, but I could see she put it to good use. Phew. Seriously, my Aunt must have been loaded. It was one of those old houses by the ocean--the ones painted all the funkadelic colors? Yeah, she lived in one of those. Quite ciomfortably, but the looks of her pristine yard and immaculately painted brick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just barely gotten out the obligatory \"I think I'm gonna like it here.\" nod when a voice called out from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melly!\" I heard her say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie!\" I held up my arms, letting my luggage fall as a....</span></div></div>",

She thought jokingly that, that was just what she needed, so she bought it for the hell of it and what do you know! She actually won, now she has enough money to retire for 10 lives and no bills to pay, since she was never married she was ok with moving south, after settling in town she didn't really have anything to do anymore, so she would just lay around, watch tv, go into town, and stuff herself with greasy delivery food or some of the few recipies she actually knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Mel, not having to work was not as wonderful as you may think, ITS SOOOOO boring\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she didn't noticed her weight, until after a few months, her usual clothes wouldn't fit anymore, she was back at weighing 400 pounds and just wore her old clothing, a few more months passed and she even outgrew those by 450 lbs, thats when she realised she had to do something, and she did, she gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of having to constantly watch her weight due to her sister's (my mom btw) nagging, or her work, or the idea of having to look for a husband to maintain her, she just let go and she enjoyed herself, and what she really enjoyed, was being fat, so she started her dream life, stuffing her face with whatever was nearest, and only 2 months after that she had already hit 520 lbs, and she noticed the mobility changed, how small walks would tire her completely, and the way people stared at her, but that only made her want to gain more, and in only about a month and a half she had hit the 600 goal, and she says she hasn't been happier, although she has had to slow down since incidents like the one today were becoming more of a daily thing, and she was living by herself with no one to help, her which brings us back to today, the 2 whales seating on a couch gorging and chatting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about you?, i mean, i know you were at buttercombe, but how was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her my whole story and all of my gains, even if i was put to shame by her when she doubled her weight in a year while it took me almost 4 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, even if your mother likes it or not, in our family the fatter ones are always the *BURP* jolliest, excuse me...\" still jiggling her belly while stuffing a fried chicken breast on her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what? I still think YOU could use some more weight... and so can i...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made me an offer, we both wanted to gain weight, she worried about her mobility, and i needed a place to stay, SO i help her when she needs help, and she takes me under her flabby wing to get me to be as huge as her, honestly it wasn't much of a question, i said yes on the spot and this marked the begining of my new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mel!

While she had always possessed a large appetite on the rare occasion my Mom would let her come round to see us, but I never would of thought that she would actively try to put on weight, On purpose, out of <i>boredom!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t complain though, just getting away from my controlling Mother was thrilling enough, but the fact I would be moving from a home which limited and shamed my gluttony and decadence to a home that encouraged it. Talk about full circle. Besides, I\u2019m always eager to help my favourite Aunt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo once I got settled after a couple days in my new digs, the first thing my Aunt decided to introduce to me was the local South Carolina cuisine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is to say every take-out, diner, fast-food joint and other incredibly fattening business there is in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, two already obese Aunt and Niece combined with plenty of cash and even more greed and extreme hunger will lead to some major gains. If my soaring weight gain at Buttercombe was plentiful, this\u2019ll be <i>crazy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout three weeks after I moved in with my Aunt, I could confidently say with one-hundred percent certainty. I was getting pretty fat. Like really fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way downstairs on this balmy Tuesday Morning, I sleepily trundled down each step. My whole body breaking out into jiggles underneath my ill-fitting red tee. My stomach had begun to stick out more in front, being more obvious as it crept downward over my waist. My breasts were heavier, really pushing the bras I crammed them in to their limits and my ass was jigglier than ever, with more flab meaning all of the pants I wore were at risk of getting ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn\u2019t weighed myself since moving. With Rhonda\u2019s heavy duty scale that had a weight capacity of 1000 pounds, I decided to wait awhile to see what results South Carolina had on Ol\u2019 Melly\u2019s growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way to the living room, I saw an all too familiar sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was of Aunt Rhonda, waddling her way between the Kitchen and the living room, platters full of food in tow, huffing with every heavy foot-fall. During our \u2018Catching Up\u2019 (Which was us pigging out with the occasional dialogue.) She was absolutely fatter, just not as noticeable as mine. But at 600+ pounds, what more could change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was changes, no doubt! All that was left of her stretchy sweatpants were destroyed by her legendary tank ass, her triple-tiered belly was only a few scant lines from touching the floor and her blobby face seemed to have a fourth chin in the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin\u2019 sleepyhead!\" My Aunt greeted me with a smile while she parked herself on the L-shaped couch, it releasing a cry of agony when she made contact with it. \"Morning...\" I replied, yawing and giving my plentiful gut a scratch. \"You haven\u2019t started breakfast... without me, yeah?\" I asked with a bit of concern in my voice. More than once, Rhonda had gorged herself stupid while I slept in, leaving me to munch on scraps! It\u2019s probably my fault for sleeping in, but, then again, asking a ravenous blob of a woman to hold back was like asking a fish to hop on dry land and breath air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Aunt burst out laughing, her acres of stomach flab bouncing with each chortle. \"I didn\u2019t, I held back. But it\u2019s rude to keep yer Aunt waiting like that! Not my problem you sleep so late I can\u2019t help myself!\" My Aunt jeered, Waving a pudgy finger at me. \"You\u2019re sounding a lot like Mom right now.\" I snorted, making my way to the pink loveseat that sat opposite the couch. There was no chance in hell we were both gonna fit on the couch without it exploding into dust, so I was delegated to the other seats in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it don\u2019t matter much now. You\u2019re up, which means we can eat!\" Rhonda said, licking her plump lips. My belly rumbled as the scent of pancakes, bacon and fried eggs filled my nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don\u2019t mind if I do.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Neither has eaten in 8 hours(unless you count our midnight snacks) so you'd understand our predicament. For the first ten minutes I keep up the pace with my aunt, I've been getting better at it but I still cannot fully compete with her monster of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon my stomach is filled enough that my hunger is consuming me anymore and I notice that today there's less food. Usually the table is filled to the brim with more waiting in the kitchen, but today it wasn't as full. I was about to ask but Rhonda still going strong so I dig again in while there's still food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the food runs out and I don't even feel the need to rub my belly. Don't get me wrong, we had just eaten enough to feed 8 people easily, but we usually go for seconds and sometimes thirds. I stare at my Aunt and she's just relaxing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there more?\" I say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles \"Was beginning to think you'd never ask. Don't you worry.\" she smiles and closes her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope whatever you have planned is big. I mean I love my new size but my belly isn't quite covering my lap just yet and by next week I want that but on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says \"Maybe you'd get there faster if you woke up sooner. More time for eating.\" Now I'm starting to believe she and my mom actually have a few more things in common than I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI roll my eyes and right about then we hear the doorbell. My aunt says \"Do you mind getting that sweety?, I'm not exactly presentable at the moment\" she slaps the side of her gigantic belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I say while rocking my obese body. I waddle to the front door and take a short breather before opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm met with a small stack of boxes hovering in front of my face. I look down and I see small hands holding them up. \"Hi, Rhonda! pleasantries aside, could you help a girl out please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um sure.\" I take all but the bottom box which reveals a slim brunette woman. \"Nice to meet you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiles \"Oh that explains why the door opened so quickly. I'm Laura, nice to meet you and you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mel. I'm guessing this is more food, it smells great by the way. Let's put these inside.\" my arms are beginning to hurt. We put the boxes beside the door and I stare down at them. \"Oh, I'm going to regret putting them there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughs and suddenly my aunt yells from the living room. \"Sorry I can't meet you in person right now Laura, I couldn't find anything that'd fit me this morning. Glad that you finally met my favorite niece!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back up and for a moment I see Laura biting her lip before saying \"I didn't know you had niece! oh, I see the resemblance. You take after your aunt so much. I'm so happy\" she steps forward and gives me her best attempt at a hug and I swear she squeezed a bit of fat for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bill is in one of the boxes and I wish you both a nice meal!\" and just like that she left. \"Um, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groan before bending down. With the stacked boxes safely locked between my hands and belly fat, I waddle back to my Aunt. She says \"Finally, I was beginning to feel absolutely ravenous again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little confused I say \"She is nice, very\" my aunt continues \"Clingy?\" I giggle while opening the box \"I was going to say friendly, but yea, clingy.\" Especially after she saw me from head to toes I think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's harmless, don't worry. Now, let's dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe eat and we eat, this food is delicious. After an hour and we still are only a third of the way done. My stomach is already beginning to really stretch, completely covering my lap and still I'm eating like mad. Though I was ecstatic I had kept up with my behemoth of an aunt for so long it was time for me to call it quits right before Rhonda was finishing the second to last box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fall asleep in a food coma. I have crazy dreams about food and about growing. Then my dreams cycle back to home and my family but I was to deep to feel anything. A cracking noice starts to pull me away from my dream when suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrash!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wake up immediately to my huge favorite aunt laying down between couch debris in all her obese glory.</span></div></div>",

Thank god she was leaning forward and fell on her colossal behind still sitting up. I'm serious when I say that if she fell on her back she might have smothered herself with her own boobs, or at least she'd gotten a good smack on the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, we even considered calling the fire department my lovely aunt had the brilliant idea of calling Laura instead. I'm not really sure where she lives but she came suspiciously quickly with some hardwood planks. When she came into the living room she almost collapsed at the sight of my nearly naked aunt in al of her glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill weak on the knees she got straight to work. We put the same boxes from earlier in front of her and then with some lever action, she was leaning against them. She struggled to put her feet below herself, but with her belly spreading on the floor below her I couldn't really blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming to our aid so quickly Laura. If not for you I think we would have had to call 911, it's one thing for a friend to see me in this state but complete strangers, that's too far.\" Who knew my aunt didn't like showing off skin in front of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I could help, anything for you Rhonda.\" She stood there hesitant a little too close to her and my aunt finally caved it and gestured her forward. She hugged her like I would when I was a tiny 9 year old shrub, just barely reaching below her arm fat. That image alone gave me the thrills, I was so jealous, but in a \"glad that you're there but I'm dying to get there myself\" sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you two will get hungry in no time. When you got your wardrobe problem solved be sure to pop by my buffet, it'll be on the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught myself just pondering about how my life will be when I'm so huge. Imagine getting stuck on doors because my ass is so massive it barely goes halfway through a doorway before getting wedged in tightly. Imagine a belly so monstrous I even struggle to go in sideways, so obscenely big it hides my feet not just from myself but from the rest of the world. Thighs so thick that even chubby people's waists are thinner than each of them. Love handles so filled with love that my arms are permanently resting at an increasingly odd angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want that so badly. I need that now! I will try harder!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My alarm rings earning a rough groan from a very sleepy me. I check the clock and it's freaking 5 in the morning. You may be thinking, Mel, an early bird? impossible. I have a well-thought-out plan you know. My generously sized aunt had managed to grow a whopping 300 pounds in over a year, something which took me around 4 years to do, I was clearly doing something wrong. I know the gap between me and Rhonda had gotten bigger, not smaller in these past 3 weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did some research yesterday and this is step 1. Step 1 is waking up at this insufferable early hour in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... f**k yesterday me, seriously.\" I say while sitting up on my bed. \"Sun's not even up yet, goddamnit.\" I know I'm not known for my vulgar vocabulary, but I'm used to sleeping 'til 10 or later, I cut 5 precious hours of beauty sleep. Could you really blame me for being particularly grumpy?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething I'm not really used to though is that I wake up not feeling particularly hungry at all, that's a first in a very long time. I grab my phone and I start browsing social media to pass the time until my aunt woke up to cook us breakfast (step 4). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Hillary Heart was doing a concert this week back home. Maybe you don't this, but I used to be the absolute biggest fan. Back in Buttercomb I even had this bright pink poster of her in a very sensual pose, I'm not really sure how I got dad to buy it for 14 year old me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the nostalgia this brings me, for a moment I'm just dying to go back home, but that's beside the point. I wonder what my childhood idol has been up to for half a decade so my stalking begins. On her own page, I do not find any current photos of her, only fresh pictures oh her \"H in a heart\" logo and a few different variants of the thing. It's not a dead-end though, because it leads me to an acceptance movement. A <b>HUGE</b> size acceptance movement with her as the face of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could probably guess why, as of 6 months ago she had gotten huge apparently. Near my size but still noticeably smaller than me. Who knew she'd Be All I Could Be, I'd show myself out but that would be too much effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI check the clock again; it's only 6:30 and I'm starting to get painfully hungry. My poor stomach cries and howls like a wounded animal and I try my best to soothe it. \"Shut up, you'll wake her up!\" I whisper at my own belly. This is step 2, skipping a meal. Who knew that a common practice in people's diets could be such a huge mistake. Considering how much I eat and how quickly I get hungry again waiting for my aunt is going to feel like skipping 2 instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot going to lie, trying my hardest to keep my crybaby of a stomach from waking my favorite aunt up has been really stressful, why do I do this to myself I wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To become the biggest bitch in the world, that's why.\" I remind myself out loud, maybe to better convince myself. Regardless, this sucks. I wonder if Alice will go to the concert, wish I go with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, I hear my aunt's bed creaking as she surely wakes up and wiggles her colossal body out of bed. \"Oh thank God!\" I swear I haven't gotten out of bed so fast in a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to get out of my bed, waddle to the bathroom and splashing my face real quick before Rhonda sidesteps out of her room. I peek into the hallway to say \"Mornin\u2019 sleepyhead!\" oh the satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slightly recoils in place, pressing on the wall the part of her ass that was still in her bedroom. \"Mornin\u2019 Mel, um, how good to see you awake right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, could we maybe get a bigger spread for breakfast? I'm absolutely famished right now.\" Step 4, stupidly large portions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day goes more or less like usual, us binging on food until inducing a food coma. This time though I try my hardest to reduce my downtime and I even had drink some coffee to stay awake until my usual bedtime. This masterplan should slow my metabolism to a halt practically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm planning on struggling like this for </span></div></div>",

Usually, I can last just fine until breakfast but you're such a bad influence on your niece.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both laugh and Rhonda snaps back \"Oh my niece was already a terrible influence on herself darling.\" she flashes a warm smile \"I can't fix your hunger right this moment but if you helped me peel and chop a few things while I prepare our food we could fix your boredom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? I swear the last time I cooked something I wasn't even allowed to drive. I'd even hesitate to trust me with the microwave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright sweety, I'll guide you and things will turn out great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a little too crowded in the kitchen with both of us in it, by most people's standards it is a big kitchen, but when either your ass, your thighs or your belly touch at least 1 or 2 counters all the time like my Aunt you'd understand why it could feel small. It is one of those big kitchens with a huge fridge, a fancy stove in the middle of the room surrounded by sleek counters. By far the most modern-looking part of the house<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know there used to be another room here, from where the stove is to that corner over there. I wanted a big kitchen open to the dining area, but there's a structural collum in that wall so the entrance remained a tad too narrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooner rather than later, that is going to really suck for us.\" I say considering that on day one I already had to push her humongous ass through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough I'm sitting back in my loveseat after doing everything Rhonda told me. I haven't told her I've been waking up at 5, starving myself until 9. I don't know how I've somewhat kept my cool until now but as soon as the food is served I become a beast unleashed. For a few minutes I eat even faster than my gigantic aunt but she still has vastly higher capacity so soon enough I lower my pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour I regain my composure enough to remember the clothing we had ordered a couple days ago. \"almost forgot, our clothes got here just before you woke up. Looks like we'll finally be able to visit your friend's buffet. Laura, right?\"</span></div></div>",

I stare at her massive blubber bouncing up and down gracing both sides of the double doors<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yep, I don't anyone could enter anywhere by her side. Maybe a kid ducking bellow her hip?</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after I make my entrance with a dissapointing amount of space to spare by my side. The place looks like as if the 50s style had been invented today. Still, the unique unorthodox homey decorations only held my attention for a hot second before I noticed the large clientele. And when I say large I mean LARGE in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is FAT, men but mostly women. Some are pear-shaped like me, others are apple-shaped, a few are just round with fat accumulating evenly pretty much everywhere. There are a few skinnies but considering just how excitedly they are running to and from the serving tables back to their respective fattie or group of fatties I'm pretty sure I know why such a place appeals to them so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear that I'm just barely above the size average (without counting the skinnies of course). There's only a handful near Rhonda's size but I think my aunt and maybe 2 that are fighting for the fattiest person in the premise. There's also a woman which soon catched my attention, she has short dark hair and is somewhat smaller than me in size everywhere but her bust. I swear those monster tits are bigger than my own ass, she was just leaning forward a little to let them rest on top of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I see why you like it here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt responds \"I love this place for the amazing food. I know I'm a pretty good cook, but I don't even hold a candle to Laura.\" she giggles \"But being the largest woman in a place full of whales is definitely a nice bonus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can smell it alright. Let's dig in, I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already ahead of you sweety,\" she says with a tray stacked to the max already and she's already beginning to load the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going like that and you'll get stuck in those doors in no time.\" We both laugh. I could see my aunt grinning as she struggles to waddle to a nearby table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt is many things, but being a liar or humble about her cooking is not one of them. I can only say that my mouth just reached the peak of its lifetime, there won't ever be anything else that can top this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try everything Laura has to offer, and though I liked her turkey and her beef tenderloin I dedicated myself to stuff myself as many desserts as possible. I read somewhere this morning while I waited for my aunt to wake up that sugars get absorbed the fastest. The body really can't store a lot of sugar but it quickly turns it into more fat. My aunt has possibly the biggest sweet tooth ever, so I guess it makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I don't want it all to go to my belly, one day I want to be a blob of fat, not a fat person attached to a huge belly. Therefore I focused only on the desserts with the highest concentrations of fat in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later we both pause our feasts to let our stomachs digest for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear a female voice \"I trust that you have been enjoying yourselves.\" I look to the right and I see our brunette hostess standing there smiling. You know, now that I'm not focusing on moving boxes or getting my whale of an aunt off the floor I can finally check Laura out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's...</span></div></div>",

Any favorites?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so damn hard to choose! I've never eaten steak so tender and so full of flavor. The turkey was amazing too, I don't how you managed to turn the lamest type of meat into something so amazing without adding some type of stuffing or sauce! and of course, your desserts are nothing to scoff at, no wonder I've eaten so many of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I noticed, but I see you more of a meat type of gal. Why not eat more of that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but I'm thinking these will do wonders for my physique.\" I smile back rubbing my own distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes closer \"don't worry about that darling. My food is like no other.\" She leans over my ear and whispers \"You should follow your tastes if you care more about the endgame. \"  she leans back and says \"I'll bring some goodies for you, I bet you two are not even close to full! Can't have my lovely clients starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda leans back, rubbing her poor stuffed belly which is spreading over and under the table. \"Now I remember why I don't come here every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that? you love stuffing yourself silly even more than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried it once. On the fourth day the strain on my poor stomach was so big I could barely eat anything for a few days while I recovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura appears serving trays on our table. Mine was packed with everything I could drool over if I wasn't so stuffed. There's even an entire rack of ribs on top of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe take our time to give our bellies a fighting chance and we chat between bites. She asks me a lot about Buttercombe. I had already told her roughly about my weight gain journey but we hadn't really talked about my fat girl adventures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, I may be the biggest but after I quit my job to start gaining I've just been eating like crazy every day. Sure it's been absolute heaven but not as exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mentioned your job, how was it? what did you do every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worked for this big company, not quite big enough to be involved in that artificial isle that companies like Yeng are building mind you, but big enough to make hostile takeovers. I had to lose weight back then because we had acquired a relatively big online media company and I oversaw the transition between administrations. I had was required to fire many workers including some of their veteran editors and they didn't take it nicely. Really tense atmosphere back there, people did not make my job any easier so I had to run around all the time. Winning the lottery was such a huge godsend. I rushed to finish my duties and a couple weeks later I handed in my resignation letter and moved south to here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*<i>munch</i>* that sounds awful. Why would they hate on you, it's not like you were the one to acquire them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They absolutely hated my bosses but they were not around ever, I was though. I skipped meals, I simply didn't have the time some days and I've always been a big eater, even back then, it was so stressful. They teased me for being a fat cow, *giggles* imagine if they saw me now. The moment I \"let myself go\" I gained like crazy. I swear I gained like 150 pounds in just 3 months. I was just about your size right now and full of stretch marks. Good times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, if only I could pull that off. I'd actually stand a chance to catch up to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continue picking at our food, too stuffed to see straight, much less have a meaningful. After a lot of struggle, we both finish our massive feasts and we both start to doze off in the middle of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I feel very awake, kinda like those moments of clarity you often get when you're silly drunk. My aunt was asleep as well as quite a few other obese customers, Laura is doting on the busty woman, giving her the largest milkshakes I've seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start thinking. \"<i>but what if I could actually pull it off? Sure I'm basically skipping a meal(already breakfast) already and resisting my hunger is stressful already but I could get used to it and it's so freaking boring waiting for Rhonda to wake up. I'm already torturing myself enough, I bet I could get a big growth spurt this way. I could get busy though, I may be in hog heaven right now but gaining back in Buttercomb really was more exciting</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... \"</span></div></div>",

My adipose will hang off its edges! but for now, I'm testing out what I wrote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump* *Thump* *Thump*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' !\" I yell from my bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' sweety!\" my aunt answers back. I hear her waddling sideways into my room, her flesh oozing through the door, another 50 pounds and she'll get stuck walking sideways, 2 to 3 months tops I'd say. \"Whatcha doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a little boring waiting for you to wake up so I enrolled in a few online courses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy bed creaks behind me as she sits and spreads on my bed. Her monster belly covering her legs beyond her knees, her ass reaches my pillows on one side and the edge on the other. \"Uhh, what about?\" She rests her hands on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move away from my desk and on the screen, there are a few short lines of code. \"It's python, from what I read in a subredit it's probably the easiest programming languages to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the sudden interest? I thought you were more into economics and the like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not wrong, but most serious courses only start with college semesters and I kinda missed that window. Besides, it's a lot of tedious work so why not program something to do it for me? or at least most of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles \"Ahh I get ya, work smarter, not harder. What are you making then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab my laptop and approach my aunt \"Here let me show you. Press enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, it says \"Hello World\"? that's, umm, great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally! I mean, I know it's a little underwhelming, yes, but I made my computer do that, no one else. No one instructed my computer to ask me what I wanted it to print, I made it say what I wanted. That's huge!\" Being honest, it's just 2 lines and 5 words in total. It's should be so lame but it doesn't feel that way. Just in time both our bellies cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for you sweety. Breakfast? I'm famished!\" Rhonda starts rocking back and forth to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, rrrright behind you.\" I put my laptop back on my desk and I re-run the program again. \"Hello World!\" I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming, don't tell me you've forgotten about being the fattest girl on Earth so soon.\" Rhonda waddles to the door and I stand up rather quickly, for my size at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I can't have more than 1 goal? One day I'll be bigger than you, I will leave on the dust!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles \"Oh, sweety.\" </span></div></div>",

I don't have a way to measure but I'm pretty sure you haven't kept up with me as long before today.\" My aunt smiles, before cramming another slice. The past couple weeks she's been complimenting her own cooking with lots of take out to spend less time standing more time eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did tell you I'm going to leave you in the dust someday, *urp*\" I finish a cinnamon roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep dreaming, sweetheart.\" She reaches for a chocolate cake but it is just beyond her grasp. \"Mind helping your poor old aunty get her dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" she just glares at me. \"I'm kidding! I'm kidding.\" I rock back and forth until I'm standing I pass her the large cake on her belly. \"Anything for my favorite aunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit back down struggling to breathe a bit. Rhonda remarks \"Uff, shouldn't do that on a full stomach\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever invents a robo-maid to pass food and the such will make soooo much money\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you get good enough with your programming you could make it happen, you know.*munch* You'd still need someone to build it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'll ever be able to, that sounds really complicated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? sure, you're not crazy talented but you're crazy determined to see things through. Trying your hardest to keep up with me on a feast, or even better pursuing the fat life living with my dear sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both laugh. \"You're not wrong there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at her, just a couple slices of cake left on top of her tummy, and her eyes are already half-closed. How I'm still awake? I've no idea. Usually, I'm long gone before she finishes her meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just remembered, coming all the way here I saw a Mall before reaching the town. Can you believe I haven't visited it at all after almost 2 months living here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been busy.\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could go there, check the stores out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sweety, I'm no condition to go there, not until I get a scooter that can hold me. I'm too heavy for the ones you can rent there anyway.\" She smacks her massive ass which covers most of the 3-sitter couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, umm, I don't really know anyone else around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could get Laura to show you around. I'll call her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh yeah, sounds great, thank you.\" I blow a rogue strand of hair away from my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you borrow my car, hasn't been used in a while.\" she laughs \"I doubt I fit behind the wheel anymore.\" she types on the phone and they start talking. A minute later she holds her hand over the phone and tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asks where you'll meet her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think for a moment and I respond \"I guess I'll...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's called Ocean Express, I've heard they make the best frappuccinos in the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk \"I might change that, I bet they haven't seen my legendary blueberry blast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hangs up \"Uhh, what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I get them to make one for me I'll bring one for you and tell you all about it. How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got yourself a deal, young lady. Don't disappoint your dear aunt.\" We both laugh \"Ok the keys are in my purse in the kitchen and feel free to grab some cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up and step towards her \"Thank you, auntie\" I bend forward and we awkwardly hug trying to avoid bumping our overfed stomachs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you Mel.\" After grabbing the keys I walk to the front door and Rhonda says \"If you take care of it, I'll let you keep the keys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, bye!\" I step out with a smile in my face, my massive ass touches both sides of the door. \"Soon I'll have to sidestep through doors, nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open the blue Honda SUV. The seat is already pushed as far away from the wheel as it goes. I strap myself in and notice that on one side I'm spilling over the console a little and on the other, my adipose is gently caressing the door. I rub my belly and notice that there are still a few spare inches between it and the wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder Rhonda doesn't drive anymore, I'm around 200 pounds lighter and there's barely and wiggle room in here. On my way to the mall I see a MacDonald's drive-through and I order myself a coffee and 2 cheeseburgers. They are long gone by the time I park at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk all the way to the entrance and already my feet are sore, great. 2 lazy months will do that to you I guess. Didn't Rhonda mention you could rent scooters here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waddle past an elevator and right around the corner, I see my poor legs' salvation. A scrawny elderly man sitting between a small desk and a plastic cabinet half full of small keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, *pant*, could I rent one please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but aren't you a little young to be using one of these, young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be young, *wheeze* but my feet are killing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks me top to bottom and says \"Hmm, I know weigh is usually a touchy subject but how much do you weigh, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile still breathing fast. \"Don't worry about that, I like my size. I haven't weighed myself in a while, I'm guessing around 440?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" He says, is that a hint of surprise? or maybe astonishment? \"I got just the one for you, girl.\" He picks a key from the mostly full bottom half of the cabinet. \"Yours is the lucky 13, the blue one. It should hold you just fine.\" he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" I waddle over to the scooters and notice that there are 2 variants, red ones which I'm guessing are almost all taken and blue ones which are bulkier and wider. Already on the heavier duty scooters, nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI park my wide ass on its vast shelf with some room to spare and I drive off. Now without having to struggle to waddle everywhere I have time and energy to check the place out. The architect of this place is either old or really likes Back to the Future, looks like hoe the 80's thought buildings would look like, kinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot gonna lie, I like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also notice some people staring at me. Nothing I'm not used to, of course. I'm a certified fatty, this kind of attention is my jam. These people are staring at me in awe, shock, and sometimes disgust, but also it feels different somehow. They first look at my. bottom half, my signature part, no surprises there, but their faces don't show any strong emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil their eyes land on my face that is. I think it shocks them someone my age is so big, not the fact that I'm this big to begin with. Maybe Laura's clientele has something to do with that? maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking of the devil, I roll around the corner and I find myself in front of the movie theater. I turn to the other side of the hall and see a neon blue sign \"Ocean Express\" with an \"O\" at the end turned off. It's not even connected to anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find my guide Laura, she's....  </span></div></div>",

Again, her hands kinda linger on my adipose, still not sure how to feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too Laura, thanks again for, well, coming to show me around.\" My mouth's already watering from the delicious smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'd come, anything for Rhonda and her lovely niece.

There's nothing more distracting than an empty stomach.\" she pushes the trays towards me, a piece of brownie falls from the mound of food packed on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let this go to waste.

I'm not really hungry, but who am I to reject about 3 to 4 pounds of free sweets and desserts. A dark forest cake disappeared into my stomach, handful of carrot and red velvet followed soon after. Meanwhile, Laura brings me like 3 huge frappuccinos of varying colors to wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are great and all, but I can make something sooo much better.\" I sip the pinkish drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Laura asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blueberry blast, it's my signature drink. After I finish I'll get them to make one for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through my second try and my stomach is already feeling stuffed hard. I swear I had to reverse my scooter away from the table a couple of times because the table was digging into my poor tummy. Now, I'm pretty sure Laura has a few stuff in common with Hanna my lovely highschool feeder but there's only a way to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff, Laura, I don't think I can finish this. My poor belly is already rock-solid over here.\" I say massaging slowly and haphazardly, \"accidentally\" letting my shirt ride up my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks a few times and swoops in \"Now, now I've seen you eat before. I know you have a great appetite, you made sure to let more than half of my regulars know that. Besides, there's always space for dessert, no?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't seem like she's the guilt-tripping type, nice. \"I don't know, I kinda already had a big lunch with my aunt before coming. Maybe it's time to call it quits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mel, I know that you must look up to your Aunt, but her appetite isn't as big as her. Yours though.\" She smiles again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might be toying with her, but that caught my breath a bit. \"Well, ummm, can't stain my reputation, right\" I wave some air to my face before reaching for some caramel mousse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! you'll be done in no time, you'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough I push away my empty and defeated pair of trays away from with a victory grunt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm a f**king genius for renting this scooter, there's no way I'll be walking the next few hours after such a binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes are fighting to stay open and I hear Laura asks me something, but it might as well be in Russian for all I care. I just politely say yes, or something close to it, I hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did I agree to? she helps me pull my seat as far back as it would go, now I can't even reach the, umm wheel? crank? how do you call this thing again? Oh! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura interrupts my drunk thoughts with sitting on my lap, well, the half that isn't covered by my fat rock solid belly (but it's not exactly 50 50 anymore might I add). I'm not in any state to really object so I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see a movie! the seats should be comfy enough for you to sleep this off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok...\" I close my eyes and rub the side of my poor tummy. When I open them again I'm relieved we actually are in the movie theater ordering tickets. I caught a glimpse of Laura talking to the cashier, he eyes me before saying something like \"She'll need 2.\" I don't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough we're parking my scooter at one of the handicapped spots, I really hope someone doesn't need that today. Laura helps me to my pair of seats, any other moment it'd arouse me the fact that we have to sidestep between the rows or the fact that my belly is bulging on top of the backs of the front row. I think I hit someone in the head before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost 2 hours later I wake up just a couple minutes before the ending of a movie I really didn't see. I look down and her head is laying on my now comfortably less filled stomach. Still a red flag but this isn't the first time something like this happens to me. I caught my dear old friend Hanna doing similar stuff back when we hadn't really talked about each other's views on fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look to my sides and I'm a little disappointed that my sides aren't filling both seats, I bet Rhonda would be spilling over the retractable armrests on both sides. I look to Laura again and say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least buy me some dinner first... <sup>ignore the feast you just bought me</sup>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jumps back to her seat, as far away as she can from me. I can't really see her face but I bet she's either blushing or completely pale right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Mel'! That was waaaay out of line. I'm sorry, um please forgive me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh \"Calm down, Laura. I'm aware of my soft belly\" I pat my middle \"I'd sleep on it if I could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no excuse, that could qualify for harassment. Let me make it up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ummmm... sure. Buy me a few shakes to go and we're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's too little. How about this, eat free on my buffet on the weekends, for the next months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure can make an offer a girl can't refuse! haha. Let's go, help me up please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she rushes to my aid and pulls me up. I did my part don't worry. She offers to help to my scooter but I decline. \"Hey, Laura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue sidestepping between the rows. \"It's been eating me since I ate at your place, but what is up with your cooking and your meats and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you're asking for trade secrets. Can't tell you just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI park my big ass on my scooter \"I'll be eating there every week for the next month, shouldn't I know about what's in my food?\" I adjust my seat back in position. \"Especially after today's events? It's not like I'll tell anyone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around in the empty theater. \"This is something I'm very proud off. You know Yeng food, right?\" I nod. \"Stuff is really addictive and fattens people up like no other. I should know, I made the exact same recipes for a while and didn't see the same result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that; they have some sort of deal with the school I came from, all food was theirs. Barely anyone graduated with a thin waist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! I figured out they put aditives of some kind. So I buy they're stuff, and incorporate it into the buffet's meals. Insanly good for business let me you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, and what is up with your meaty dishes then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way I treat most meats really fills it the Yeng stuff, probably has more of it than the original but I haven't been able to properly test that theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I did?\" I turn on the scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be lovely\"</span></div></div>",

Ugh, why do I do this myself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wrestle with my boob to scratch my belly bottom but it's just out of reach. I try to bend forward and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*shshsrrrg* I smile \"it was getting tight back there.\" sitting up I finally reach and finally scratch my poor belly bottom, man it's been getting hard to reach these days. \"Ahh wardrobe malfunction, music to my ears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm\" my hands rub my wide hips and my monster ass in a better mood. I can't quite reach the mattress beyond my own flesh. \"That's new, hmm\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance at a corner in my room and I just can't resist this anymore. I wiggle and rock my fatass out of bed and fish out the scale from between my desk and the wall. There's no way I'll ever see the digits, but generations of innovation have led to heavyduty scales that record the last measurement. Or at least for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step in it, give a few seconds just to be sure you know, I haven't weighed myself since I lived with my mom 3 months ago, I haven't really used this thing yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shove my boobs out of the way and no, my stomach easily hides the thing. I take a step back and I still can't see it, is it hot in here all of sudden? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother step back and I bend forward as much as my flesh will allow and I gasp. \"<b>463 pounds</b>! ha ha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pitiful little dance, I settle my ass back on my bed. My hand starts to gravitate to my nether regions but I stop myself. This calls for a different type of reward first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear furniture groaning and then a different type of groan. \"Mel? are you up?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, oh yes I am!\" I waddle as fast as my tubby feet will allow, slightly turning sideways to go through my door. Fortunately, my aunt's has been widened recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mound of flesh slowly turns, a massive stomach spills over the mattress right past the edge. My aunt rubs her eyes and asks \"What's going on sweety?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile \"I finally weighed myself today, I'm at 463 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy for you Mel! Congrats, you've definetly worked hard for it. Tell you what, give me a few minutes to dress and I'll make sure to have the biggest feast you've ever seen for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already drooling.\" I wink.</span></div></div>",

Ups!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see her slightly bent forward letting her generous bust rest on the table while sipping one of multiple fat-filled drinks. Her boobs squished between her elbows but soon enough she notices me sliding towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura puts the milkshake down on the table and waves at me with a smile on her face. She sees me rolling but she ain't hating, she pulls two chairs away from what I presume is my side of the table to let me park my fatass on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mel, so good to see you!\" she hugs me. Again, her hands kinda linger on my adipose, still not sure how to feel about that, but I can ignore that with hugs from those twins on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you too Laura, thanks again for, well, coming to show me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'd come, anything for Rhonda and her lovely niece. Here, I bet you're starving. There's nothing more distracting than an empty stomach.\" she pushes one of her shakes towards me, tiny droplet shots out of the glass and lands on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I was getting a bit peckish\" I laugh and sip \"Hmm! Rhonda wasn't lying about these. Still doesn't top my Blueberry blast, not going to lie, but it's close\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it dear. It's my favorite place in the Mall.\" She eyes me and says \"I bet you could go for something solid to eat, I'll bring some goodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm too focused on my drink to really notice her absence until 2 trays filled to the brim with a wide variety of desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! I'm so sorry Laura, I wasn't expecting this much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff. I've seen you eat, this should be a piece of cake.\" she laughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of cake, seriously?\" I roll my eyes \"Anyway I can't accept all this. Let me pay at least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crosses her chubby arms on top of her big fat tits \"Consider this a welcoming gift. Be my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been like what? an hour since my lunch feast with Rhonda, maybe two? I'm not really hungry, but who am I to reject about 3 to 4 pounds of free sweets and desserts. A dark forest cake disappeared into my stomach, handful of carrot and red velvet followed soon after. Meanwhile, Laura brings me like 3 huge frappuccinos of varying colors to wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are great and all, but I can make something sooo much better.\" I sip the pinkish drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Laura asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blueberry blast, it's my signature drink. After I finish I'll get them to make one for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe one for me too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through my second try and my stomach is already feeling stuffed hard. I swear I had to reverse my scooter away from the table a couple of times because the table was digging into my poor tummy. Now, I'm pretty sure Laura has a few stuff in common with Hanna my lovely highschool feeder but there's only a way to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff, Laura, I don't think I can finish this. My poor belly is already rock-solid over here.\" I say massaging slowly and haphazardly, \"accidentally\" letting my shirt ride up my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks a few times and swoops in \"Now, now I've seen you eat before. I know you have a great appetite, you made sure to let more than half of my regulars know that. Besides, there's always space for dessert, no?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't seem like she's the guilt-tripping type, nice. \"I don't know, I kinda already had a big lunch with my aunt before coming. Maybe it's time to call it quits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mel, I know that you must look up to your Aunt, but her appetite isn't as big as her. Yours though.\" She smiles again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might be toying with her, but that caught my breath a bit. \"Well, ummm, can't stain my reputation, right\" I wave some air to my face before reaching for some caramel mousse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go! you'll be done in no time, you'll see.\" She returns to her drink. She sure likes her milkshakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough I push away my empty and defeated pair of trays away from with a victory grunt.</span></div></div>",

I'm a f**king genius for renting this scooter, there's no way I'll be walking the next few hours after such a binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes are fighting to stay open and I hear Laura asks me something, but it might as well be in Russian for all I care. I just politely say yes, or something close to it, I hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did I agree to? she helps me pull my seat as far back as it would go, now I can't even reach the, umm wheel? crank? how do you call this thing again? Oh! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura interrupts my drunk thoughts with sitting on my lap, well, the half that isn't covered by my fat rock solid belly (but it's not exactly 50 50 anymore might I add). I'm not in any state to really object so I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see a movie! the seats should be comfy enough for you to sleep this off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok...\" I close my eyes and rub the side of my poor tummy. When I open them again I'm relieved we actually are in the movie theater ordering tickets. I caught a glimpse of Laura talking to the cashier, he eyes me before saying something like \"She'll need 2.\" I don't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough we're parking my scooter at one of the handicapped spots, I really hope someone doesn't need that today. Laura helps me to my pair of seats, any other moment it'd arouse me the fact that we have to sidestep between the rows or the fact that my belly is bulging on top of the backs of the front row. I think I hit someone in the head before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost 2 hours later I wake up just a couple minutes before the ending of a movie I really didn't see. I look down and her head is laying on my now comfortably less filled stomach. Still a red flag but this isn't the first time something like this happens to me. I caught my dear old friend Hanna doing similar stuff back when we hadn't really talked about each other's views on fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look to my sides and I'm a little disappointed that my sides aren't filling both seats, I bet Rhonda would be spilling over the retractable armrests on both sides. I look to Laura again and say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least buy me some dinner first... ignore the feast you just bought me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jumps back to her seat, as far away as she can from me. I can't really see her face but I bet she's either blushing or completely pale right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Mel'! That was waaaay out of line. I'm sorry, um please forgive me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh \"Calm down, Laura. I'm aware of my soft belly\" I pat my middle \"I'd sleep on it if I could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no excuse, that could qualify for harassment. Let me make it up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ummmm... sure. Buy me a few shakes to go and we're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's too little. How about this, eat free on my buffet on the weekends, for the next months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure can make an offer a girl can't refuse! haha. Let's go, help me up please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she rushes to my aid and pulls me up. I did my part don't worry. She offers to help to my scooter but I decline. \"Hey, Laura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue sidestepping between the rows. \"It's been eating me since I ate at your place, but what is up with your boobs, like did you win the genetic lottery or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs \"or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause to look at her \"What's that something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you're asking for dietary secrets. Can't tell you just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI park my big ass on my scooter \"I'll be eating there every week for the next month, I'll nagging you about it every chance I get?\" I adjust my seat back in position. \"Especially after today's events? It's not like I'll tell anyone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around in the empty theater. \"This is something I'm very proud of. You know how some foods fatten certain places, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod. \"Like beer to bellies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continues \"Kinda like that, yes. Milk products help my girls develop, but I mix an interesting hormone cocktail into my shakes sometimes.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that umm, safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is! totally! It's not a fast process but I've been doing it for 5 years. No harmful side effects and the twins have quadrupled in size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice, could I try it too?\" I turn on the scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crosses her arms under her huge boobs \"But yours are already pretty big, we could almost share bras!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but unlike you, my boob to body ratio is downright abysmal. Am I wrong for wanting to fix that?\" I rest my arms on top of my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine, but only because I'm curious. Just don't tell your aunt.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I guess I'll pick her up. At her size I'm not sure she fits behind the wheel either\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy aunt laughs \"Especially with how her fat is distributed\" she repeats, the first half only of course. \"She says she'll send you her location. You too should go to a coffee place called Ocean Express, I've heard they make the best frappuccinos in the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk \"I might change that, I bet they haven't seen my legendary blueberry blast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hangs up \"Uhh, what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I get them to make one for me I'll bring one for you and tell you all about it. How about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got yourself a deal, young lady. Don't disappoint your dear aunt.\" We both laugh \"Ok the keys are in my purse in the kitchen and feel free to grab some cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up and step towards her \"Thank you, auntie\" I bend forward and we awkwardly hug trying to avoid bumping our overfed stomachs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you Mel.\" After grabbing the keys I walk to the front door and Rhonda says \"If you take care of it, I'll let you keep the keys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, bye!\" I step out with a smile in my face, my massive ass touches both sides of the door. \"Soon I'll have to sidestep through doors, nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open the blue Honda SUV. The seat is already pushed as far away from the wheel as it goes. I strap myself in and notice that on one side I'm spilling over the console a little and on the other, my adipose is gently caressing the door. I rub my belly and notice that there are still a few spare inches between it and the wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder Rhonda doesn't drive anymore, I'm around 200 pounds lighter and there's barely and wiggle room in here. On my way to the mall I see a MacDonald's drive-through and I order myself a coffee and 2 cheeseburgers. They are long gone by the time I park in front of her garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go through the effort of getting out of the car and walking to the front door to ring the bell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" I hear some furniture groaning and I yell back \"It's me, Mel !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI catch my breath for a moment, Laura's house is nice and cozy. No dreaded second floors, definitely smaller than Rhonda's house but what did you expect, not every extreme fatty is rich like my Aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge shadow looms behind the door and I step back. The door opens and I'm met with a wall of flesh covered with a humongous dark blue blouse. I can't really see anything behind Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mel, looking good, love the outfit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking great too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs \"I dress to impress. Shall we? um, give me a moment.\" she hesitates, making a short step forward with her adipose already flowing and jamming on the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say \"Sideways, maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweety. Maybe your aunt can pull that off, but with a shape like mine, there's not much difference really. Pull me out, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" I grab her hands and a couple of minutes later she's out and free. I wheeze \"How do you do this every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles between heavy breaths. \"I don't. I usually walk out through the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the struggle of getting inside the car, I notice that Laura on the back seats. She completely covers the middle one and a little more than half of each of the other 2. <br>\r\n\"Do you mind pulling your seat forward, Mel? it's a little tight back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little more?\" she says with pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no. Wheel's already digging into my tummy a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way we talk about our \"fat girl problems\", like never finding stuff to wear, being hungry all the time, stuff like that. We pick some goodies (and when I mean some, I mean a full lunch for each) on the way which gets eaten long before she parks at the Mall. As close to the entrance as possible of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk all the way to the entrance and already my feet are sore, great. 2 lazy months will do that to you I guess. Didn't Rhonda mention you could rent scooters here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say \"Be right back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waddle past an elevator and right around the corner, I see my poor legs' salvation. A scrawny elderly man sitting between a small desk and a plastic cabinet half full of small keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, *pant*, could I rent one please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but aren't you a little young to be using one of these, young lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be young, *wheeze* but my feet are killing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks me top to bottom and says \"Hmm, I know weigh is usually a touchy subject but how much do you weigh, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile still breathing fast. \"Don't worry about that, I like my size. I haven't weighed myself in a while, I'm guessing around 440?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" He says, is that a hint of surprise? or maybe astonishment? \"I got just the one for you, girl.\" He picks a key from the mostly full bottom half of the cabinet. \"Yours is the lucky 13, the blue one. It should hold you just fine.\" he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" I waddle over to the scooters and notice that there are 2 variants, red ones which I'm guessing are almost all taken and blue ones which are bulkier and wider. Already on the heavier duty scooters, nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI park my wide ass on its vast shelf with some room to spare and I drive off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rejoin Laura and she looks down at me \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, my legs are killing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow without having to struggle to waddle everywhere I have time and energy to check the place out. The architect of this place is either old or really likes Back to the Future, looks like hoe the 80's thought buildings would look like, kinda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot gonna lie, I like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also notice some people staring at me. Nothing I'm not used to, of course. I'm a certified fatty, this kind of attention is my jam. These people are staring at me in awe, shock, and sometimes disgust, but also it feels different somehow. They first look at my. bottom half, my signature part, no surprises there, but their faces don't show any strong emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil their eyes land on my face that is. I think it shocks them someone my age is so big, not the fact that I'm this big to begin with. Maybe Laura's clientele has something to do with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminds me, we roll around the corner and I find myself in front of the movie theater. I turn to the other side of the hall and see a neon blue sign \"Ocean Express\" with an \"O\" at the end turned off. It's not even connected to anything. \"Let's eat, I'm feeling a little peckish right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe order a bunch of stuff and park our expansive asses on a table meant for far more people and we eat. Soon enough we start chatting again.</span></div></div>",

I'm not really hungry, but who am I to reject about 3 to 4 pounds of free sweets and desserts. A dark forest cake disappeared into my stomach, a handful of carrot and red velvet followed soon after. Meanwhile, Laura brings me like 3 huge frappuccinos of varying colors to wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Laura is digging into a similarly sized feast on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are great and all, but I can make something sooo much better.\" I sip the pinkish drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Laura asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blueberry blast, it's my signature drink. After I finish I'll get them to make one for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through my second try and my stomach is already feeling stuffed hard. I swear I had to reverse my scooter away from the table a couple of times because the table was digging into my poor tummy. Now, I'm pretty sure Laura has a few stuff in common with Hanna my lovely highschool feeder but there's only a way to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uff, Laura, I don't think I can finish this. My poor belly is already rock-solid over here.\" I say massaging slowly and haphazardly, \"accidentally\" letting my shirt ride up my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinks a few times and swoops in \"Now, now I've seen you eat before. I know you have a great appetite, you made sure to let more than half of my regulars know that. Besides, there's always space for dessert, no?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't seem like she's the guilt-tripping type, nice. \"I don't know, I kinda already had a big lunch with my aunt before coming. Maybe it's time to call it quits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mel, I know that you must look up to your Aunt, but her appetite isn't as big as her. Yours though.\" She smiles again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might be toying with her, but that caught my breath a bit. She continues \"I know your tastes girl, I know you want to be bigger than Rhonda. Try to match me bite for bite\" She pats her huge stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ummm, yeah. I-I'll do it\" I wave some air to my face before reaching for some caramel mousse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just focus on me, you'll be done in no time. You'll see, it'll all be alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough I push away my empty and defeated pair of trays away from with a victory grunt. Laura had finished 5 minutes before me and she's looking at me grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, how about those Blueberry Blasts you mentioned. I could go for the largest size!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If I wasn't full before I'm definitely stuffed now. I've been getting pretty good at resisting the food drunkness but it's too much today. I'm a f**king genius for renting this scooter, there's no way I'll be walking the next few hours after such a binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes are fighting to stay open and I hear Laura asks me something, but it might as well be in Russian for all I care. I just politely say yes, or something close to it, I hope. She squints her eyes a second, or maybe I blinked, I'm not sure, but suddenly she f***ing slaps my stuffed tummy hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says \"Let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell!?\" I rub my sore belly, barely able to reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Needed to shake you up, you were a little too far gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are nicer ways of doing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but a slap works just like that. Now, let's go! the movie will start soon, you could sleep it off there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ok...\" I follow Laura behind, drowsiness slowly returning to me, only thing keeping me awake is Laura's slap and also kinda her ass too. Woobling up ad down, each giant cheek alternating heights between each step. Up and down, up and down. Ohh! a boy got hip-checked by Laura. Did she even feel that? I mean she doesn't react or budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we find ourselves at the theater with Laura talking to the cashier, he eyes both of us before saying something like \"You'll need 4.\" or something like that, I'm not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I park my scooter at one of the handicapped spots, I really hope someone doesn't need that today. Any other moment it'd arouse me the fact that we have to sidestep between the rows or the fact that my belly is bulging on top of the backs of the front row. I think I hit someone in the head before sitting down, por person probably got double slapped by two stuffed bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't fall asleep for 30 minutes, I spent the time grumbling and rubbing my belly, especially the hand-shaped bruise. Hour and a half later I wake up to one of the nicest belly rubs. Staying still I look down, seems Laura pulled my enormous shirt up to my fat tits. There's also a nice and sweet smell to it, maybe oil of some kind? uhh is that vanilla? maybe white chocolate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look to my sides and I'm a little disappointed that my sides aren't filling both seats, I bet Rhonda would be spilling over the retractable armrests on both sides, I mean, Laura's lovehandles already do slightly. I look to Laura again and say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least buy me some dinner first... <sub>ignore the feast you just bought me</sub>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura jumps away from me, or at least she tries, she's still kinda jammed in place. I can't really see her face but I bet she's either blushing or completely pale right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Mel'! That was waaaay out of line. I'm sorry, um please forgive me, I just felt bad for slapping you so hard and even worse when I saw the bruise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh \"Calm down, Laura. Waking up to a belly rub is awesome, no harsh feelings.\" I touch the now slippery surface on my tummy and bring my hand to my face to smell. \"What is this by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<sub>It's made with cocoa butter mostly.</sub> *sigh* but that's still no excuse, that could qualify for harassment. Let me make it up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ummmm... sure. Buy me a few shakes to go and we're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's too little. How about this, eat free on my buffet on the weekends, for the next month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure can make an offer a girl can't refuse! haha. Let's go, help me up please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she rushes to my aid and pulls me up. I did my part don't worry. She offers to help to my scooter but I decline. \"Hey, Laura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue sidestepping between the rows. \"It's been eating me since I ate at your place, but what is up with you moving like you're like half your weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you're asking for trade secrets. Can't tell you just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI park my big ass on my scooter \"I'll be eating there every week for the next month, shouldn't I have an easier time refilling my trays?\" I adjust my seat back in position. \"Unless you use like a secret pill or something, I don't know why it's be a big deal to tell me, <sub>but if it is a magic pill It's not like I'd tell anyone</sub>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around in the empty theater. \"This is something I'm very proud of. It is a slow process and it involves some routine which is especially strict when you're starting out but if you keep it up, you'll move like a feather before you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask \"Does it involve exercises of some kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and some stretching too but it'll get easier I swear\" I grunt annoyed. \"Don't be like that, it'll help you digest things faster! you'll even be able to eat more often. Here's my number, send me a text and I'll text you the info...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI write it down \"Ugh, I'm going to regret this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks \"Trust me, you won't.\"</span></div></div>",

No wonder she was such a great help getting my aunt off the floor, she must have practice with other huge customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's not slim herself, I bet Rhonda was about that size before she quit her job to gain weight. Her belly is there but it doesn't really stand out much, her tits though, those are freaking big, like noticeably bigger than my aunt's bust, they jut out even farther than her belly, and wider too. So are her thighs too, she's freaking thick, does she have latino family by chance? she kinda looks like those indigenous statues depicting a goddess of fertility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm still fatter though, thank God. Those tits though.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes Laura. I hadn't realized just how I missed coming here.\" my aunt lets out a short but strong belch \"Oh excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughs while patting my aunt's massive and stuffed belly. \"That's how I only I'm doing my job right.\" She turns to me with a smile, her tits lumbering over the table \"What about you, darling? Any favorites?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so damn hard to choose! I've never eaten steak so tender and so full of flavor. The turkey was amazing too, I don't how you managed to turn the lamest type of meat into something so amazing without adding some type of stuffing or sauce! and of course, your desserts are nothing to scoff at, no wonder I've eaten so many of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I noticed, but I see you more of a meat type of gal. Why not eat more of that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but I'm thinking these will do wonders for my physique.\" I smile back rubbing my own distended belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes closer \"don't worry about that darling. My food is like no other.\" She leans over my ear, my shoulder sinking into her boob, and whispers \"You should follow your tastes if you care more about the endgame. Look at me, I know what I'm talking about\" she leans back and says \"I'll bring some goodies for you, I bet you two are not even close to full! Can't have my lovely clients starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda leans back, rubbing her poor stuffed belly which is spreading over and under the table. \"Now I remember why I don't come here every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that? you love stuffing yourself silly even more than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried it once. On the fourth day, the strain on my poor stomach was so big I could barely eat anything for a few days while I recovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laura appears serving trays on our table. Mine was packed with everything I could drool over if I wasn't so stuffed. There's even an entire rack of ribs on top of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe take our time to give our bellies a fighting chance and we chat between bites. She asks me a lot about Buttercombe. I had already told her roughly about my weight gain journey but we hadn't really talked about my fat girl adventures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, I may be the biggest but after I quit my job to start gaining I've just been eating like crazy every day. Sure it's been absolute heaven but not as exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mentioned your job, how was it? what did you do every day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worked for this big company, not quite big enough to be involved in that artificial isle that companies like Yeng are building mind you, but big enough to make hostile takeovers. I had to lose weight back then because we had acquired a relatively big online media company and I oversaw the transition between administrations. I had was required to fire many workers including some of their veteran editors and they didn't take it nicely. Really tense atmosphere back there, people did not make my job any easier so I had to run around all the time. Winning the lottery was such a huge godsend. I rushed to finish my duties and a couple weeks later I handed in my resignation letter and moved south to here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*munch* that sounds awful. Why would they hate on you, it's not like you were the one to acquire them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They absolutely hated my bosses but they were not around ever, I was though. I skipped meals, I simply didn't have the time some days and I've always been a big eater, even back then, it was so stressful. They teased me for being a fat cow, *giggles* imagine if they saw me now. The moment I \"let myself go\" I gained like crazy. I swear I gained like 150 pounds in just 3 months. I was just about your size right now and full of stretch marks. Good times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, if only I could pull that off. I'd actually stand a chance to catch up to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continue picking at our food, too stuffed to see straight, much less have a meaningful. After a lot of struggle, we both finish our massive feasts and we both start to doze off in the middle of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I feel very awake, kinda like those moments of clarity you often get when you're silly drunk. My aunt was asleep as well as quite a few other obese customers. I see Laura chatting with that busty woman, both downing milkshakes like crazy. As big as she is, she still does not have the biggest tits in the buffet, how massive is this woman up close?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start thinking. \"but what if I could actually pull it off? Sure I'm basically skipping a meal(already breakfast) already and resisting my hunger is stressful already but I could get used to it and it's so freaking boring waiting for Rhonda to wake up. I'm already torturing myself enough, I bet I could get a big growth spurt this way. I could get busy though, I may be in hog heaven right now but gaining back in Buttercomb really was more exciting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... \"</span></div></div>",

It's probably the second best cake i've ever had\" and as soon as we steped through the door i started to see why my aunt talked so mighty about this place, i was bombarded by smells of food that were damn near orgasmic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was also really fat friendly as all the seats were tables and all of them were near the food bar, and speaking of fat friendly, there are alot of fat people here! Not one person that i saw was under 300 lbs, most of them being women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of the gossip groups hotspots\" my aunt said as we passed a table with 5 women seating there talking, laughing and eating, all of them so large they could probably give my aunt a run for her money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe go to the bar and grab a tray, we take about 5 plates for each and grab as much as our greedy fat fingers can get on, pasta, smashed potatoes, several slices of pizza, meat loaf, potatoe salad and fried chicken were my choices, aunt rhonda's tray was about the same, except that she had grabbed a considerable amount of sweets, from ice cream to brownies and chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me sweetheart, i got one hell of a sweet tooth, i just can't help myself around anything with sugar\" she said as she ate a brownie in a single bite, moaning at how delicious the sugary chocolate treat was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooof... yeah... thats the stuff, let me go pick up some more, and then let's go to our table\" she said licking the whiped cream and powdered sugar off her fingers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back with considerably more sweets and we sat down at the table, the chairs were pretty wide and seem really sturdy, but me and my aunt, much like a lot of people here, needed 2 of them to hold our girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as my aunt seated herself properly started to inhale food like she had gone mad, my young spirited, cool and usualy relaxed aunt, had transformed into an eating monster, she only stopped eating to drink some soda, burp or to take a big gasp of air now and then, she wouldn't talk more that yes or no grunting noises, every bite she took, she moaned in pleasure and she would rub her massive belly every few bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as i tried the food, i saw exactly why she was like this, this had to be the best meal i've ever eaten! The steak was soft and super juicy, the mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery, and the pizza had a crunchy crust, thick sauce, was super cheesy and just amazing in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ate like if we hadn't eaten in a month, and greedly grabbed and ate everything in front of us, we even took food from each others plates with out realizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this wasn't as greedy as my aunt got, as soon as she ate all her food she moved on to the sweets, and man! She was crazy about them, all little sense of modesty and manners she still had went out the window, she picked up a thick slice of chocolate and crammed all of it into her mouth, her eyes rolled back and she moaned heavly, she also started dipping brownies into the melting ice cream and eating it whole, making a mess of the table and her face, but surprisingly none got on her clothes, we ate, then ate, and finally ate some more until all that was left were our stuffed, bloated bellies and my aunt's messy face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... *huff* that's how... *wheese* a fat girl *urp* is meant... to eat...\" i said rubbing my painfully stuffed belly and so did my aunt, we took a bit of a break, when suddenly a female voice was heard behind me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rhonda!\" A womans voice was heard, i was too full to turn around and i asked my aunt who it was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, this is Laura, she owns this place\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura came around the table and i got a good look at her, she was....</span></div></div>",

But her gaze quickly shifted towards me. \"And who is this little lady you've brought with you today?\" She said, very obviously sizing me up, wearing a seductive look the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my niece, Mel. She's going to be staying with me for awhile, so I of course had to bring her here.\" Rhonda cheerfully revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you girls certainly can't be full yet. Rhonda, more sweets my dear?\" She said as she snapped her fingers over her shoulder. Not a moment later a young bus boy was sliding a large refill of desserts in front of my aunt. \"They are fresh from the back, absolutely to die for.\" Laura gushed as aunt Rhonda instinctively reached forward and started filling her mouth again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you little one, what is it that you desire?\" She said with a wide grin as she peered into my soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWise enough I made sure not to play into her hand. \"I mean I'm pretty good. Pretty full if you know what I mean.\" I said as I rubbed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you didn't like my food.\" Laura retorted back, sounding quite offended. Now I didn't know this woman, and she sounded genuine, so I let my guard down for just a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it's not that. I mean I really loved everything, especially the steak and cuts of turkey.\" Instantly her pout turned right around back into the off putting grin she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a girl who likes her meats, I can jive with that.\" She gave an eye to one of her bus boys and before I knew it there was a plate loaded with different cuts of meat in front of me. \"Well what are you waiting for?\" Laura noticing my hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bus boy had taken my empty plate, along with my utensils, so I guess I needed to use my hands on this one. I picked up the juicy steak and brought it toy lips. I knew how good the first one was, and could only assume this one would live up to it, and it totally did. From there I was picking up what ever my chubby little hands could reach. Bits of turkey, cuts of pork, chunks of chicken. Everything was so tasty I couldn't stop myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the plate was empty and now I really felt like I was going to burst. I had gotten so much in the zone I hadn't realized that Laura had left to go vulture on another rotund customer of hers at another table. I also didn't realize that my aunt had finished her massive plate of sweets and looked almost like she was in a diabetic coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a minute of regaining our composure, we were both able to get our well fed bodies up from the table and waddling towards the door. Of course we were lucky enough to catch the attention of Laura before we were able to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you guys could come in.\" She said as we departed. \"It was a pleasure to meet you Mel.\" I don't know what it was but for some reason the woman was creeping me out a little, but she was really just overly nice. \"Hopefully we will see you back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe tomorrow!\" My aunt gested as she waved at the stick thin owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or even tonight for dinner!\" Laura playfully, but sincerely replied back. By now we were letting the door close behind our massively round bums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you imagine that? Coming back for dinner? I mean I'm a pig, but holy cow, you'd have to roll me out if I ate here that often.\" My aunt theorized as we made our way to the car.</span></div></div>",

It was insane even for me, and if there was any doudt that i was related to my aunt before, by now... i pretty much look like a blond version of how she looked when i arrived, my gut covered my croch and i couldn't see past my doughy mountains called \"breasts\", i was constantly and painfully full, and since i gained so much in only 2 months, my body hadn't adapted yet, my mobilty was extremely limited, it took me a while to get off the couch, and even more out of bed in the mornings, while i enjoyed my new weight, it was an absolute hasle to keep up with my aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel, i think you've been putting on alot of weight recently, but don't worry about it, i think it looks good on you\" she said as she finished the last cinnamon roll of the box, and i pulled out 2 for myself and started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*burp* I don't know why, but i've been really hungry recently\" she pulled out a box of extra large pizza from her side of the couch, and i could only think to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was either a great or terrible idea\"</span></div></div>",

Just like when you get drunk and sometimes and you get a strangely clear head for a minute, that hits me in my faded food high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down at myself. My belly is almost at \"chin level\" and spreading far beyond my knees, I could barely see my toes. Then I put my arms down at my sides but they don't fall on the matress. They land on my extremely wide hips and on my monster ass. I finally did. I'm wider than I'm tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" is all I could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen my nose picks up some heavenly smells which fully wakes me up. \"So glad Rhonda wakes up early to cook.\" I rock my body out of bed, using the momentum of my belly to stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI approach the door sideways and it's still a tight squeeze between my gigantic ass and my belly. Very slowly waddle to the stairs, mentally preparing for my daily torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt the quakes bellow which reminds me. I had completely overdone it with this plan. Sure I wanted to get as fat as possible, I just never imagined it would happen so quickly. I had become trully massive. Forget me being proud of my 400 pound body, I had left that on the dust now.

I hear heavy breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, a couch bellow creaks in agony. I hear the sound of metal being bent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crash!* the house is shaken so badly I'd think it was a minor earthquake if I didn't know better. A few specks of dust fall from the ceiling accompanied with a frustrated grunt coming from the first floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel? could you *pant* help me out, *wheeze* please?\" I hear my aunt downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" I say. Thank god I managed to convince Rhonda to install an elevator in the house, the stairs haven't seen any use in a little over a month now. I shuffle in sideways and it's a tight squeeze alright. When the door closes my ass is touching the door, the oposite wall and spreading on the wall behind me. The elevator has a 1000 pound capacity. Not strong enough to hold my aunt but I barely fit in, with 150 pounds to spare by the way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, there's no way my aunt could use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ooze through the door and I'm met with my whale of an aunt sitting on the ground between the 4-sitter couch's debris. First I see her monster ass, so wide I doubt she could ever fit into anything smaller than a bus, so big that I don't think she could ever fall on her back even if she tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, I'm here.\" I say waddling to her side, or at least as close as I can get without tripping on her flesh. Her neck long gone, like this, her head slightly sinks into her shoulder fat. Her eyes are red and glassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was sitting on my couch, I'm so sorry Mel, I crushed your couch.\"  tears start running down her puffy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that thing? don't worry about it, I had already weakened it a lot. I could have broken it easily myself.\" It was in perfect condition, at this rate it was supposed to hold me for a couple more months but I don't have the heart to tell her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no excuse, where are you going to sit now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I can figure that out later, but first we need to get you on your feet again.\" I unhook some straps from the ceiling and I hook them together under her ass. The heavy-duty straps are attached to some multiple pulley contraption on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhonda continues crying \"I still think the extra weight looks good on you, but I can't help but feel that I'm such a bad influence on you. You should not have to take care of me so much, you're so young and full of energy. You should be out there enjoying life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI position myself in front of her. Her belly reached farther than her own legs and covered most of her legs and spreading them apart. \"Don't say that, I love being here with my favorite aunt. If not for you I don't know where I would have ended up after my dear mother kicked me out.\" I hook the other end of the straps behind my own ass. \"Helping you here and there is the least I could do. Now grab my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start pulling, using my weight. This is the toughest bit, I have to pull her just enough for the contraption to do its thing. \"Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain suddenly decreases as the pulleys and the straps use my weight to help my aunt up. \"See, *pant* the hard part is over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be so hard on you sweety if I wasn't so big. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weight looks great on you auntie, and besides, this contraption uses my weight to help you stand up. You can't be that big, I'd never be able to do this on my own if that was the case.\" I'm really sure how it does it, but apparently the pulley somehow multiplies the force I can apply on the other end of the straps. Of course, my favorite aunt doesn't know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right, sweety.\" We pull on each other to stand up. Her 3-tiered belly pools on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" just in time both our bellies rumble. \"Let's eat! I'm starving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I grab a few chairs to accommodate my own bulk my aunt is sitting on the other \"couch\". Not exactly your regular couch since it's a large slab of concrete with cushions and blankets on top to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tray on her bust and another on her belly, she digs in hard. I have created a monster it seems. The whole table is also filled to the brim with trays of food and I know it won't be enough to sate her, much less both of us, so I place a few large orders from a few diferent restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say \"You know, I've been thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

I moved downstairs to the living room over 2 months ago, I knew I had to move from my room upstairs when my adipose wouldn't let the doors of the elevator close and there was nothing I could do on my own. Andrew had to mess with the doors to close very slowly so he could push my hip inside without it flowing back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yes, Andrew is part of our 4 person staff, he's like my righthand man in the house. His main occupation is to cook. Before Rhonda finally lost her mobility she taught him all she knows about the art. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even has an assistant, Max (Maxine really, but we don't call her that) a short modestly chubby woman. She seems to have fallen for Andrew, not that I blame her, he's gentle and definitely handsome with a trim build. I have to admit I had a bit of a crush on him the first few weeks that he worked here, but I soon found out his heart belongs to some else in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 2 clean the house and most importantly, me and my Aunt. Do you really expect me to be able to clean myself? I can't even reach most of my thighs, much less my back or most of my stomach. Jorge a surprisingly tall man for a Latino, he's not from Mexico and he's very adamant about not being called one, from where he's from I have no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last is Helen who weighs around 400 pounds I think. Don't let that fool you though, she's built like a tank, definitely one of those obese women who frequent the gym a lot but never lose weight. When brute force is required she's our gal. Anywhere else she'd be considered huge but since I'm almost 3 times bigger than her (only 100 pounds short!) no one really gives her crap about her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday I wake up in a haze from the enormous feast I had for lunch. I'm sitting on my Aunt's former concrete-base couch. My massive tummy spreads my legs as far as they can go and still covers my thighs almost completely. You can still see them from the sides I guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wipe a few crumbs left on my fat tits which finally are big enough to function as a (modestly sized) shelf. I smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm assuming you had a good nap, Ms. Carlyle?\" I see Andrew walking out of the (newly renovated) kitchen with a cart full of goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that's part of it. Damn, another feast for my lovely Aunt? she's so lucky to have you cook for her so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles and is that a hint of pink on his cheeks? \"It is, wouldn't want the lady of the house to go hungry now would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Hey, could you tell Max to whip up something for me? I'm a little peckish.\" Anyone else would be surprised at that request after eating enough to feed a small army for lunch but for us is just Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you will Ms. Carlyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the cart in front of my Aunt's room, which used to be the guest's room. We had its door and wall torn down and replaced with curtains. She wouldn't fit through its original door and I wanted to see her progress from the couch. I'll let you know I can still walk up to her, I can still move but it's not a daily occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew pushes the cart through. Shortly after I hear my Aunt thanking him and then munching. 5 minutes later he runs to and from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max is preparing you some snacks now Ms. Carlyle. I'll return the lady now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Andrew. Hey, could you, umm...   \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only natural that I was still having dreams where I was back in good ol' 130B, right? I could still see everything so perfectly. My bed, the window overlooking the Quad, and that godawful yellow color scheme everywhere. I could feel the sheets bunching up beneath me, and the feel of my chubby legs kicked on top of the covers. The lights were out, but in my dreamscape it was morning. The soft blue light of a Saturday before ten am flitted into the memory of my dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Melly.\" I heard, then recognized, a sultry voice purring into my ear, \"You're getting so <i>chubby</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah Hammond was laying beside me, sitting up while I laid porcine on top of the blanket. She was propped up on her knees, stripped down to the buff. Her perfect tits sloped to either side of her chest, splayed out for any and all to see. Her long arms were stretched across the acreage of my belly as it oozed over the blanket. I was propped up on one arm, letting my gut pour and fold on top of itself as Hannah rubbed it and rubbed it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. It sounded much more romantic than our actual relationship back at school\u2014which never graduated past awkward groping hugs and longing glances on her part, met with my longing glances towards whatever I <i>wasn't</i> eating. I almost preferred this version. It felt right. Hannah was the only person other than me who liked my body for what it was. And more importantly, what it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" she said back her hands going up and down, up and down, and pressing deep into the malleable mass that was my chub, \"I think it's hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed. A little one; one of those cute little giggles that girls in the movies (or in their dreams) only get right. Using one of my meatier, doughier hands, I locked my fingers between Hannah's and guided her towards my flank as it yielded to its own weight. The soft part between swell of my stomach and the curve of my lovehandles. I helped her rub in slow, circular motions, and let out a slow wet moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...good.\" I purred, \"Because literally everything here is delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah raised an eyebrow, as she tucked into a smile and applied more pressure to my tummy. Her left hand sunk a bit deeper, and her right hand traveled south to just under the fold of my gut. She straddled where my belly lapped and started to jiggle me. Softly, but not slowly. I could feel my gut start to shake ever so slightly as the reverberations built up and up until I may as well have been a waterbed of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are <i>you</i> delicious?\" Hannah's long brown hair tickled my hot chubby cheek as she bent over and purred into my ear, \"Has eating all that food made you taste good too, Melly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" I gasped, my breathing erratic and heavy, \"Why don't you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod I was wet. My chest was heaving, and my clit was as throbbing. It had been so long since I'd been touched by anyone who knew what they were doing. And Hannah's slender fingers towed the line where by belly met my blonde fuzzy crotch. I was so <i>sensitive</i> and she was just teasing me. Her long nails caught against one of my curly pubes, or the pads of her fingers brushed against some of my skin. I was already a wreck, and the foreplay had just started! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd like that, wouldn't you fatty?\" Hannah said with another one of those perfect little chuckles, \"You want me to eat you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuh...\" I nearly creamed at the word, \"<i>Yes</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmmm</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah stretched her hands out wide and caressed my folds more strongly. She pressed deep into my fluffy fat and played with it. Kneaded it. Shook me thoughtfully and roughly, knowing what it did to me. My whole body quaked with movement. My gut, yeah, but my tits bounced and my thighs shook. My chins bunched up together and even my arms were wobbling. Soon, Hannah placed my hands there and I kept the momentum going while she stroked the soft, not-oft-touched small of skin between my two most demanding organs. She traced the crease and then she went down, down, down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with very little provocation, a trickle of cum started to run down her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wow</i> fatty. Has it been <i>that</i> long since you could finger yourself?\" Hannah watched as I jiggled my belly for her, inspecting the small amount of cum on her finger, \"That was <i>fast</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuh... shut up...\" I grunted, \"Just... Just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear the bed creaking and squeaking beneath us. Whether it was my actual bed or just the one in my dream, I still don't know. All my moving around was making it groan beneath me either way, and my trembling tonnage was almost enough to make me cum again. So as Hannah started to kiss the upper part of my crotch, then down a little more, a little more, it wasn't long before I felt the tip of her nose pressed between my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I came again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought <i>I</i> could eat. Hannah (or rather, my subconscious representation of Hannah) was a master of the art. Her slender pink tongue went up and down, and then side to side. None of the alphabet bullshit. Each move of her tiny pink tongue was unique and special somehow, I could feel it. And her hands kept my gigantic tree-trunk legs pried apart, squeezing and groping my pillowy thighs while I bucked and clenched and rocked the bed with my enormous weight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay, so for those of you not in the know, Buttercombe Academy is this really ritzy all girls' school that I went to. It's basically a private school, but it's pretty isolated. There's this dumpy little down a little further down the mountain trail, but that's it. They have credentials out the wazoo, but they only accept the best of the best or the richest of the richest. Occasionally there's a mystery attendant thrown in (me!) who no one is really sure how they got accepted, but I digress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent four years there, and I came home every Summer at least fifty pounds heavier than the year before. Ms. Polluck, the headmistress, lived and breathed politics. A lot of important peoples' daughters went there, so she made sure that everyone was as comfortable and cozy as could be. Nice cafeteria, lots of anemities in the dorm rooms, plenty of \"fun\" classes. It was really easy to gain weight if you didn't watch yourself, which most of the girls did. I was something of a sterling example, considering about half-way through I decided that I liked my body, but seriously, I was <i>not</i> the only girl who turned into a total cow by the time their four years were up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was that I really bonded with a lot of girls over the years. The bad news was that since most of them lived really far away, I was pretty sure that I'd never see anyone ever again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKey word being \"thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of weeks before, I got a Facebook message from one of my old roommates. She were going to be in town for a while, something about her father, and thought it would be really nice if we met up again. I told her that sounded great, and we should do lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I got lunch. The Saturday that she was supposed to arrive, I parked myself in a McDonalds and ordered myself a dozen McDoubles and started grazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I know, McDonalds. Cliche. But hey, we Buttercombe Girls have a reputation of having really big appetites. The only problem being that, unlike my visiting friend, <i>my</i> Daddy didn't sneeze out hundreds whenever I wanted him to. So I knew if we were going to go out on the town, I had to eat cheap. Thus, McDonalds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd dressed nice enough. It was Autumn, and I'd put on maybe another thirty pounds since I'd last seen her. But it was starting to cool off, so I wore my once-roomy Buttercombe Academy hoodie. It was pretty snug now, wrapping all the way around me (just barely) and managing to keep me mostly decent. My yoga pants were paper-thin though, stretched across my massive ass so far you could count the dimples. I attracted some stares, yeah, but I really couldn't blame them. If I remembered our message right, my guest should be dressed similarly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that I needed clothes to pick out my old roomie...</span></div></div>",

Big boobs, full hips and a pert booty; all with a tiny waist and oozing a natural charisma that made it so easy to fawn all over her. She was a hit at the Academy\u2014everyone loved her, and she knew all the ins and outs of the place because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had spent an awful lot of time together before we graduated. She and I met up just about every day after classes for big lunches, went back to our dorm room to watch TV or do homework or whatever, and then we usually had dinner. If you want the truth, <i>she</i> was one of the reasons I was as fat as I was. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, but Hannah was a serious obesophile. So when a big two-thirty-and-some-change me wobbled into her dorm room, all lazy and just coming off of the realization that she liked her body, it must have been her wet dream.

When my mouth wants to do something, be it eating or speaking, it goes for it. And I let it, every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In FACT...\" I continued, taking a quick, huge, greedy burger bite for emphasis (and purposes of seduction) \"...I've been sort of nostalgic about the sort of gluttonous shenanigans you helped me get up to. I mean, as you can tell, I've been doing FINE doing the feedee-life solo...\" jiggling my 30 most recent pounds for FURTHER emphasis and FURTHER purposes of seduction \"...but an appetite like mine really is a two-person job.

That's the thing, I wasn't worried about coming on strong out the gate, because she loves this sort of thing so much, that...worse case scenario?...she'd be flattered and turned on.

What was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to come up with some way to say \"HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SAY NO TO ALL THOSE GORGEOUS, GREEDY AWESOMENESS\" that sounded a LITTLE less horribly arrogant and presumptuous, but ended up just sitting there with a shocked facial expression and cheeks puffed out with a burger I was too stunned to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...I...CHOOSE to believe this looked charming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah wasn't dumb, though, and she both noticed...and probably anticipated...my surprise. So, bracing herself for trying to express herself diplomatically, she rested her arms on the table and began to explain why the 'maybe'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...Mel, you are AWESOME. However much you enjoyed our time together? I enjoy it EVEN MORE. And not ONLY in a sexual way, but also just in a friendship and intimacy way. And I know I helped you grow LITERALLY, but you also helped me grow, as a person. Helped me be a bit more...forthright and open and honest in my desires, rather than being a sneaky, conniving creep about them. As I am now mature enough to admit, yeah, I kinda WAS that for a time. But...and I know this is ironic...it's BECAUSE of the impact you had on me that I'm not just instantly saying 'yes' and committing myself to anything. I used to grab EVERY available opportunity to feed EVERY fat girl I came across as much as POSSIBLE, like some mindless magnet just snapping onto every attractive force that showed up. But now, I want to devote myself solely to ONE woman. Oh, sure, I'm happy to treat a dear friend to an oversized meal now and then, but anything beyond that, I'd need to think about. Rather than go a little bit in a bunch of different directions, I'd rather go in ONE direction now, as FAR as possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, find the one single PERFECT fat chick and put aaaaall your effort into helping her become, like, the fattest woman EVER?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yes.\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. And be real, the only reason you wouldn't accept ME as your life's great work, making me your weight gain MASTERPIECE, is if you already have some OTHER fatty you're smitten with who you think might have more potential. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...might be SOMEONE I've been getting to know recently who might be The One...\" she murmured, showing uncharacteristic shyness. And she was blushing. She was ACTUALLY blushing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAggravating. And disappointing! I thought this would be a slam-dunk! But though it might have been greedy of me to not give up then, you don't get truly fat without being a LITTLE greedy. Besides, she hadn't said 'no', and she was clearly TEMPTED. Maybe I could prove I had more potential than this mysterious Other Woman, and make Hannah see that if anybody was meant to be the fattest EVER, it was me. But before I got too far ahead of myself, I needed to know what I was up against. And besides, if this somebody was a lady Hannah had a real history or deep connection with, I mean, okay, fine, I wouldn't try to butt in THEN, I'm not a sociopath, not trying to be a home-wrecker or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if this was just the latest fat lady Hannah had a crush on? Maybe even an unrequited crush? THEN I had no issue with trying to talk some sense into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo...\" I said, NOW trying to play it cool \"This lady...is she fatter than me, or--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, much!\" Hanna replied, enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck. Alright, maybe best NOT to dwell on that angle, then. Okay, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you known her a long time?\"</span></div></div>",

She seemed to sink into me a little as we hugged, trying to nestle herself into my body as much as she could. The hug lasted for a few seconds before she stepped back and said, her eyes roving over my body, \"You're looking good, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I responded, flushing a little. Full disclosure, Hannah and I were kind of a \"thing\" back when we had been sharing a room during our Buttercombe days. With how... enthusiastic Hannah got about feeding people (and how enthusiastic I got about being fed) it was probably inevitable. It hadn't been really serious, though, since Hannah had been feeding basically anyone who let her. But that's beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah led me back to the table she'd occupied, which was already laden with a vertiable cornucopia of burgers, french fries, chicken tenders, and even a few salads that were laden with ranch dressing (one of the only ways I eat salad, of course). \"You know me so well,\" I said to Hannah, sitting down and tearing into the fast food feast before me. Hannah took some time to eat the one burger and packet of french fries she had allotted to herself. Once she'd done that, she started handing me food and whispering encouragement into my ears, the way she had done back during Junior and Senior years. It was honestly kind of nostalgic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, all good things must come to an end. My Buttercombe hoodie was proving to be a little inadequate at keeping me covered after a hearty lunch, and was riding up a little on my distended gut. I was painfully full, which was kind of nice since I hadn't felt that way once after graduation (stupid Mom and her stupid portion controls). Hannah looked like she had been having fun too, if that unsubtle leering at said distended gut was any indication. We just sat there for a bit, just reveling in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally I said, \"Thanks for lunch Hannah. I needed this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks needed,\" she responded, \"I'm always happy to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that reminds me,\" I said. \"Remember that conversation we had a few weeks before graduation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b>think</b> so...\" Hannah replied, her grin indicating that yes, she did remember it. We had been talking about what we would be doing after graduation, and the topic somehow wandered to our families. Which, naturally, led to an extended rant about my mother and her controlling tendencies. Such rants were nothing new (I had complained about the subject a bit during our very first conversation), but what had been new was Hannah's offer to room with her if I found living at home again just unbearable. Considering how far away from home that was, I had been ambivalent at first and told her I'd think about it. Now that I'd been living under the roof of that tyrant again, moving far away seemed a more palatable option. Sure, I'd miss my dad and my little sister Alice, but I had to spread my metaphorical wings sometime, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took in a deep breath, knowing that these next few words would change the direction of my life. \"If that offer is still open, I'd like to move in with you.\" Hannah's wide smile and big hug gave me the answer before she even said a word. And that was the story of how I managed to get out from my mother's controlling thumb for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was only the beginning of the next part of my life. See, Hannah was moving into an apartment near the prestigious Stuffington University to work on her business degree. I guess you have to go through the proper steps to inherit the family business, even if you're the heiress to the Hammond Hotel chain. Yes, <b>that</b> Hammond Hotel chain. I know, I kind of freaked out too when I learned that fact about my new-old roomie. (How had that subject not even come up during our time at Buttercombe?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after I got myself situated in the new apartment with Hannah after a tearful farewell from my family (I thought I even saw Mom's eyes mist up a bit), I had to figure out what to do with myself. I mean, I could sit around the apartment and eat all day (and Hannah probably wouldn't have minded that), but doing just one thing day in and day out seemed unfulfilling. So I gave it some thought, and finally decided on a course of action. </span></div></div>",

I was eighteen, for Christ's sake! I had just spent four years living it up at a prep school where the only woman I had to answer to (directly, anyway) was my headmistress! That place was great, and I'll be damned if I was going to go back to how I spent all my Summers only full-time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI <i>would</i> miss my little sister, Alice. But then again, she was about to enroll in the same school I went to. <i>Hopefully</i> she'd develop the same independent streak that I did, because I would hate to see her have to live with Mom. I wouldn't wish that on anybody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI <i>also</i> didn't want to live with my Dad. Love him as I do, I really just wanted to get out on my own, you know? He'll always be my daddy, but I didn't want to start hating him like I did Mom. Because honestly, I'm kind've a handful. (Several handfuls. Badum-dum-tss) I really just wanted to start living on my own. I felt like I was ready, and I wasn't one to take no for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo long story short, I got a job. I spent the whole Summer working at this call center, working for some big communications company. I made pretty good money, and I wasn't exactly required to run laps or anything. It was a sedentary position, there was a snack machine right by my booth, and a lot of the folks there were pretty cool. I kept the job after I decided that I was going to move out for, y'know, rent. I had spent the entirety of the Summer mooching off my Mom and a couple of guys who thought I was cute--but really I was just hungry. Girl's gotta eat, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, by the end of the Summer, I had saved up a pretty sizable amount of money. Not enough to move out on my own though. So what did I do? Why, what any other sane person in want of a roommate does, I put out an ad on Craigslist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know, I know, that could have ended poorly. There are a lot of weirdos on the internet, kids. Don't just go and ask \"f/18/usa/400lbs wanna live with me?\" on a sketchy site like that. But I was young, and dumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to get everything worked out, and I wound up staying with my Mom for another month or so before the place was ready to move in. But eventually I had everything packed and ready to go. My Mom was nice enough to help me move, I guess. And she offered to pay for the U-Haul, which was more of a kindness than I ever expected to receive from her of all people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the edge of the afternoon, after a little lunch, I was at the apartment complex, ready to move in with...</span></div></div>",

Apparently, her boss had asked her to take an extra shift at the last minute, and she wouldn't be able to help me move my stuff in like we'd planned (she used a lot more words than that, as well as proper spelling). I sent a message back saying that it would be fine and that I had people who would be helping me move anyway. Moments later, she promised that she'd apologize by taking care of dinner tonight, stressing that she would remember to get \"expanded portions\" for me. We were gonna get along just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the bulk of the afternoon was taken up by moving. Just me, Alice, Mom, and a U-Haul. It was mostly just taking things out of the truck and putting them into the apartment. Which, itself, wasn't too bad. It had a living room with a small kitchenette, bathroom, and two bedrooms. It was easy to tell which bedroom was mine (hint - it was the one that had nothing in it), and by the time 5:00 rolled around I had most of my stuff where I wanted it. During this time, Mom took one last chance to try and shame me into loosing weight while Alice tried to look like she wasn't going to burst into tears at the drop of a hat. Alice finally did start crying (okay, and maybe I did too a little) when Mom announced that it was time for them to go home. I gave her one final hug and an offer to stop by whenever she wanted. Then, finally, I was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I'd spent a good part of the day moving stuff, I was feeling famished. Mandy had mentioned that she'd get the pantry stocked for me, and she did not disappoint. I selected a gallon tub of rocky road ice cream (my favorite flavor, aside from mint chocolate chip, and cookie dough, and pistachio, and you get the picture), and settled my wide ass onto the couch and turned on the TV. I was in the middle of a cop drama when I heard the door behind me open, and someone say \"Mel? Are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here, Mandy!\" I responded, waving my hand in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me! I had no inkling that my supervisor would-\" Mandy said as she bustled over to me, her long red hair pulled back into a serviceable ponytail. Multiple plastic bag loops were hanging off of her arms, allowing her to carry many more containers of take-out than she would have normally been able to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" I said, cutting her off. \"You got my 'expanded portions,' so all is forgiven.\" My eyes turned from the dinner that Mandy had brought, to the rest of her. She hadn't changed that much from the picture of her I'd seen on social media, which was good. She was dressed in a red polo shirt and slacks, which I guess was her work uniform. As for her figure, well...</span></div></div>",

Finally having an opportunity to get a full look at my new roommate, I noticed she had a athletic build (Of course.) with slim, solid arms and a fairly small chest. Her legs were also slim with narrow hips and a flat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was probably staring too long at her, but then again, she just gawked at me for what seemed like forever. Well one thing for sure, utter bewilderment beats the hell out of being chastised by my Mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, I broke the moment of silence by speaking to her. \"Uhh... heeyyy...\" I started, lingering on the last word for an extra second, slowly waving my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking twice, Kirsten shook her head, realizing how awkward and rude just staring at your new roomie is, super-sized or not. I can't say I'm terribly offended though, living with Mom and having to deal with other judgmental assholes in life, this is pretty tame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh I... err..\" she stumbled out. \"I'm so sorry! It's just... well..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, I palmed my fleshy dome of a stomach, rubbing it in quick, small circles. \"The photo I sent was pretty old, but no hard feelings , yeah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! Lets do this over. Start again!\" She stated. Taking a deep breath, she extended her svelte hand towards me. \"Kirsten Tanis. It's pleasure to finally meet you in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little stunned, I extended my much plumper hand forward. \"Melanie Carlyle, Mel's just fine.\" I quickly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten seemed adamant to try and forget the whole 'gawking at my hugeness for minutes on end' thing. I suppose I should be happy that my rommie cares about getting along with me, but this was a little much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe when I get my stuff unpacked things can go a little more smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That your stuff? Here, let me help with that!\" She asked, rushing over to one of my many cases to grab it before I could even open my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.. thanks.\" I responded, taking a huge bite of my chocolate bar.

From the word go I struggled into my ever-shrinking wardrobe and went about my day with my hefty midriff exposed, not to mention not even trying to quash my more ravenous behaviour when around other folks. I never acted like a complete slob, but I always exaggerated my waddle whenever a seam would burst on my old pair of denim-shorts during my daily business when I moved back home since graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when that quiet Monday afternoon home alone (<i>Thank God</i>!) of me surfing the net while stuffing myself with enough brick-sized chocolate bars to build a Jenga tower while only clad in a plain white tee that only covered my jiggly breasts. I happened upon a website titled \"BellyClips4Sale.\" Curious by the name alone, I clicked on the link. I was fairly familiar with the concept of fat models and people showing pictures on social media, hell, I even followed a few accounts of other large users showing their stuffed guts who looked to be smaller than me at about the high 200's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once I got on the site, it was a whole other story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose other people on Twitter and Facebook. Not even close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheses people were gigantic! I said as a fairly obese person myself. Sagging bellies that burst out of spacious dresses, ladies destroying a pair of wooden chairs and slamming on the floor, using her padded behind to cushion the impact and even a couple men who wiped clean a table packed of take-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything there was making me really antsy. Mostly chalked up to jealousy. Not helping was a myriad of comments. Stuff like \"what a hog!\" or \"Where's NASA? There's a new plant!\" \"Shut up and take my bank account.\" Stuff like that drove me nuts and got the gears going in my head that maybe I could do something like this. Looking to corner of some clips and images was a price point. Making money out of being a fat-ass? I'd be filthy rich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really made my mind up was when I saw the most popular subject.

Classes to study for, books to read, television to watch, and snacks (oh, the snacks).

I, Melanie Carlyle, fatass extraordinaire, was about to make my television debut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting across from me undergoing similar preparations was Joy Jones, the lady who was going to be asking me questions. I had to admit, she looked pretty sharp wearing a dark blue blazer, a pencil skirt that matched it, a white blouse, and heels. She was kind of pudgy, true, but her outfit made it work for her somehow. As opposed to me, who'd come over here in the biggest yoga pants I could find and a t-shirt that covered my fat gut if I didn't raise my arms up too high. I will admit to feeling a little self-conscious; I wasn't ashamed of my size, but I didn't want to appear too slovenly on TV, ya know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like a million years, they finally had everything in place. All the production assistants cleared off of the set, the camera guy gave a countdown, the lights turned on, and I could hear the important-sounding jingle that served as a theme song for the local news station that had put this whole thing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Joy Jones, for Channel 5 News, and today I'm here with Melanie Carlyle,\" Joy said, slipping easily into her reporter persona without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, before we continue, I suppose I should let you know just what this interview was actually about.</span></div></div>",
