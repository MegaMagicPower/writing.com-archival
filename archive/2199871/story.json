It wasn't the best thing in the world but he did enjoy it, it was made even better due to him being able to change sizes. He prefers sticking to five inches tall as it made the cardboard box feel like a mansion to him and finding food so much better as half a cookie is a large amount at five inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie White is seventeen years old with short black hair and born with inhuman genes. Charlie has had a rough couple of months. It all started around his seventeenth birthday. His family was getting ready to celebrate his birthday but his older brother didn't make things easy on him. He was always picked on by him causing him to feel insecure about himself and super shy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his seventeenth birthday He had friends over as well as extended family there to celebrate. While he was open with people and did talk to people quiet well he always felt the need to retreat to a safe spot whenever he felt uncomfortable or embarrassed. He had a decent amount of friends but did suffer a bit from anxiety and having the occasional panic attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when his mother brought the cake out and everyone sung happy birthday his older brother made a snarky and mean quote towards Charlie that caused a few people to laugh, some out of nervous and others were genuine. Charlie felt super embarrassed and felt his anxiety slowly rise. He thought he was about to have a panic attack but instead something else happened to him. He started to shrink right before everyone. Everyone freaked out and screamed bloody Mary. Charlie was unsure what to do as he was panicking just as much as everyone else. Everyone got up and left faster than a rocket but he managed to grow back in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents weren't too happy. His mother broke down in tears and his father was yelling and screaming. He tried to explain that he didn't mean to do this but they didn't care. Before he knew it he was tossed out of the house with no where to go. He tried to crash at a friends place but they rejected him. No one would take him in, after what he's seen on TV and the news about Inhumans and people abilities who weren't Avengers, who would? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie found a small cardboard box beside a playground, he moves it inside a bush out of sight and shrunk to five inches tall crawling inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a couple of months ago, ever since that day he has remained five inches tall and would occasionally grow at nights when no one is around to try to control and understand his powers. Because he was living close to a playground he would sneak out at night and pick up some lost toys for his new home making it look more like a home. He would bathe in the fountain down the road and pick up some doll clothes to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea what he wanted to do in the future or how to get there, his trauma has got him down quite a bit as he feels he'll never get anywhere in life due to the person he is now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie climbs into his custom made bed pulling the sheets up to his neck snuggling in. He sighs and just lays there listening to the rain fall, hitting the leaves of the bush above and land on the roof of his home. Luckily he had put a bit of plastic on the roof to stop it getting wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my life can't get any worse.\" Charlie sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie rolls on his side and drifts off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She was quite fond of all her fellow Gryffindors, of course, and had even thought about having a crush on her friend Harry. She did find a number of his personality traits very attractive and endearing. But the first member of the opposite sex who had gotten Hermione's blood racing was Viktor Krum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that anything ever happened between Viktor and Hermione. Viktor was too overwhelmed by Hermione's intellect to give her more than a chaste kiss. And Hermione wasn't attracted to Viktor's personality. But she could not deny she was drawn to his sheer physicality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hermione felt a certain amount of relief when Viktor left Hogwarts, and she could fully focus her intellect again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Hermione had been flirting with the idea of having Ron as a boyfriend. He did have some redeeming qualities, and her conscious mind had almost convinced herself that Ron was the one she was supposed to be with. Her subconscious mind, however, thought the idea was ridiculous, and felt Hermione was only focusing on Ron because of her long friendship with him and Harry, and Harry dating Ron's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another reality, Hermione might have indeed married Ron, if she hadn't met Hagrid's brother Grawp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrawp was a giant to be sure, looking to be eighteen feet tall. But he didn't look to be a typical giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, both Grawp himself, as well the fur loincloth and vest he wore were quite clean. Giants as a rule weren't the fastidious sort. And although giants were, well, gigantic, none would ever be mistaken for fitness models. But Grawp was quite buff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the lack of facial hair. You couldn't believe he was Hagrid's half brother. Of course, Grawp was quite a deal younger than Hagrid, looking to be the same age, or perhaps slightly older, than Ron, Harry and Hermione. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was Grawp's face. It wasn't a bad looking face. It was actually quite handsome, with its guileless blue eyes and topped with a mop of unkempt sandy blonde hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was the combination of all this that caught Hermione off guard. That and the fact that, for his size, Grawp could move quite fast. Whatever it was, when the trio of young magic users back away from Grawp, Hermione stumbled, allowing Grawp to easily grab her om his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione immediately noticed both the strength of Grawp's grasp and its gentleness. She noticed that his breath was actually quite pleasant, smelling of spearmint and wildflowers. And she noticed two of Grawp's fingers were planted firmly on her posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few seconds for Hermione to collect her thoughts as Hagrid chided his brother about what he did. Once Hermione got a hold of herself, though, she quite firmly told Grawp to set her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost disappointed when the young giant obeyed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon blustered at Grawp, telling the giant to keep his distance from Hermione.   Hermione could tell that Ron was obviously feeling emasculated. Grawp didn't take any notice of Ron, instead turning to his collection of objects he had gathered over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrawp turned back around, holding the handlebar of a bicycle in his hand. Hermione noticed that that handlebar had been polished to a bright sheen, with a chain of wildflowers woven around each of the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione deduced that not only was Grawp quicker than one might suspect, but those giant fingers of his were far more nimble than they might seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrawp pressed the little bell on the handlebar, making it ring, then leaned down to hand the handlebar to Hermione. Hermione gingerly accepted the gift, then made the bell ring. Grawp was obviously delighted as he sat down, the look on his face one of perfect contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hagrid said Grawp could look after himself, and only needed company, the three young Gryffindors happily agreed to look in on him. Especially Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><i><b>-------------------------------</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was Saturday, and even though most Hogwarts' students would be enjoying their morning free time, Hermione would usually be buried in one of her independent studies. This Saturday, though, she got up earlier than usual (after a fairly restless night) and, not quite understanding why, entered the forest to seek out Grawp. When she got to the tree where he had been tied up, she found the rope loosened and Grawp gone. Well, that made sense, she reasoned. Hagrid did say Grawp took care of himself. Obviously Grawp had been tied up for the benefit of meeting his three new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione searched around and soon found Grawp </span></div></div>",

The owner of the voice humming was somewhere between a tenor and a baritone, and seemed to have a decent ear, as none of the notes he was humming were off key. Hermione didn't recognize the melody being hummed, but it was a pleasant and happy one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to be coming from behind a clump of bushes up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione gasped when she poked her head through the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the bushes was a pond. The pond fed a small brook, and was itself fed by a waterfall falling down from a height of about thirty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder that waterfall, humming happily as he washed himself, was Grawp. And Grawp was only wearing a happy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione knew Grawp was \"built\" when she saw him last night in just a fur vest and loin cloth. But seeing him in the broad daylight, sporting tanned skin and nothing else, showed he truly was a giant Adonis. He wasn't overly muscled, as if he was a professional bodybuilder. But he did have the defined body of someone who lived an athletic life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was hanging between his legs was <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>huge</b></font></span>! Not overly huge. Hermione's only experience with pensises were from textbooks and at home on the Muggle internet. But she could still tell that what Grawp had was proportional to his size. It looked to be a foot and a half long, and Hermione, virgin that she was, still realized she could never handle <i><b>that</b></i> in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione wondered what had put that particular idea in her head in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hermione continued watching, Grawp finished showering and found a shallow shelf underwater to sit on, effectively hiding everything on his body from the waist down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione found herself feeling disappointed at her sudden loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grawp sits down, he</span></div></div>",

Their mother and father were the King and Queen and they loved them very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few things different about Elsa and Anna, yes they loved each other and played around like most kids, but to the surprise of everyone in the Kingdom, the two sisters were born only five inches tall. This perplexed the Kingdom's doctors but Anna and Elsa's parents loved them no matter how tiny they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't crazy enough. One day the King and Queen saw that there was snow in the dollhouse where their daughters lived. They looked in and they saw them playing in the snow, with Elsa creating ice and snow from out of thin air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother! Father! Look at what I can do?\" the tiny girl said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents were amazed at Elsa's gifts but they also worried about her potentially causing any danger. They tried to keep Elsa's powers a secret, and to protect the tiny Anna, they mostly kept them separate. Elsa would sleep on a small bed on her parents bed side table while Anna slept in the dollhouse in her old room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later. The two girls grew up into beautiful and intelligent young women. The King and Queen knew that the time would eventually come where Elsa (despite being a few inches tall) would ascend to be Queen and she had to be ready for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Anna and Elsa were sitting around on the arm chair of the palace throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you're gonna be Queen soon.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just wish there wasn't so much pressure.\" Elsa responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't worry about it, sis. You've got me to be there for you when you mess up.\" Anna hugged Elsa and kissed her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best, \"little sis\". Elsa joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're both only six inches tall. You're not that much bigger than me.\" Anna laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I am your big sister still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters hugged and laughed. Despite their limited interaction, Elsa and Anna still loved each other and were as close as two doll sized sisters could be. But even though they had a sisterly bond, there was something else that the two tiny royal girls felt for each other but they couldn't explain it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now with our tiny princesses? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least, the original owner of the ring thought it was a cheap ring. When the ring ended up missing, the cart owner consoled himself that he was only missing the cheapest ring in his possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbu was a little disappointed with the ring as well. The little monkey thought he had snagged one of the better rings with his tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the monkey gave the ring to Aladdin, his human friend acted suitably impressed. Of course, Aladdin also thought it was a cheap ring, but he didn't want to hurt his friend's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, the ring was very valuable, and would grant up to three wishes. There were some limitations, of course. The wishes weren't as powerful as those the Genie of the Lamp could grant. It couldn't make you wealthy beyond belief, but it could arrange for you to fortuitously find a small bag of silver coins. It couldn't make you Helen of Troy, but it could give you her hair and figure for a couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring also only had three wishes. Not three wishes per person Just three wishes in the ring. And they could only be activated by someone who was a \"diamond in the rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSound familiar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unfortunate thing for Aladdin was that he was unaware that he had three wishes, or that the three wishes were being granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first wish was granted when he, Abu and Jasmine were making their escape from the city guards. Not only did they escape the guards, the wish would make sure that none of the three could be found in the next two days. Not even the city guards acting under Jafar's direction and guidance could find Aladdin for the next two days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next wish was granted when Abu was obviously resentful of Jasmine's presence. Aladdin was wishing that Abu would give him a little alone time with Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Abu would keep himself busy for the next two days, giving Aladdin plenty of alone time with Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, while Aladdin wondered what life was like in the palace, and relating all the fanciful tales he had heard to Jasmine about it (not knowing she knew all about palace life), such as miniature  people. Aladdin idly wondered what his new female friend would look like miniaturized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that last wish made, Jasmine would find herself shrunk to six inches in height for the next two days,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He tended to be a doter, and his Vizier Jafar found it easy to manipulate the old man, using a combination of flattery, doubletalk and mesmerizing magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the saying goes, you can play the same hand once too often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sultan had been uneasy recently. Jafar did his best to isolate the Sultan, trying to ensure that any and all information coming to the Sultan came only through the Vizier. However, word still got to the Sultan about how Jafar was using the city guard to \"crack down\" on the denizens of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all culminated with Jafar overstepping his authority by ordering the death of a young street urchin. The Vizier had much authority, and the Sultan had given him more (or rather Jafar had weaseled more authority out of the Sultan) over the years, but the decisions of life and death still resided with the Sultan. The Sultan would never relinquish that particular authority, so terrible a power he considered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to the Sultan's worries was his daughter's refusal to accept any of the proposals of the visiting princes. The Sultan knew he wasn't getting any younger, and he worried about his daughter's future welfare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the business of Jasmine getting past the palace guards and slipping into the city. She might have considered that a grand lark, but the Sultan thought it foolish and dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo perhaps what happened next was inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafar was using his staff to mesmerize the Sultan, as he had done countless times before. This time, Jafar was using it to convince the Sultan to force Jasmine to marry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the normally affable Sultan had a lot on his mind. So he wasn't so easily mesmerized. Point of fact, he snapped out of the mesmerization process at a point where he saw the eyes of the staff glowing. The Sultan was not always the swiftest horse in the race, but he suddenly recognized what Jafar was trying to do. The Sultan also suddenly realized what Jafar had been doing to him all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sultan called the palace guards immediately, and Jafar (and for good measures, his parrot Iago) were both summarily executed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody in the palace missed Jafar, but it did make everyone sit up and be a little more respectful to the Sultan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the musical arrival of Prince Ali Ababwa, the Sultan was put in a much better mood. Being able to ride the flying carpet seemed to return the Sultan of old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Jasmine rejected the Prince Ali out of hand, just as she had all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was all her father could stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he issued an official decree. Henceforth, the princess could go anywhere she wanted. She just couldn't wear clothes. Not until she was married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine pleaded, begged and threatened, but to no avail. Her father informed her that she could either surrender her clothes to her female attendants, or he would order the palace guards to forcefully remove them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked more than eager to carry out those orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff, Jasmine retreated to her quarters, where only her female attendants were allowed. A few minutes later, one of those attendants delivered all the clothing Jasmine had been wearing to the Sultan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sultan had just effectively confined Jasmine to her quarters and the rooftop garden until such time as she found a husband. Worse (in Jasmine's eyes at least), she would be forced to entertain a prospective husband with only her hands, arms and carefully positioned stances to protect her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(So what happens next?) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Moana goes against her parents wishes and takes to the seas as a wayfinder to find the Demi-God Maui to help set things right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoana left behind her family and animal sidekicks to go on her adventure. She found her was a natural on the water and eventually found herself to Maui's island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where he is. I'll tell him to set things right in Montanui and everything will be fixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoana goes up to the cave and notices that it's way larger than a normal cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange. It doesn't matter, I just have to focus on my mission at hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoana then looked and saw a giant boulder that was huge to her. Something was weird about this place, but Maui was bound to be somewhere. Soon, she heard a booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where did I put my coconut?\" The voice boomed. Moana looked behind the rock and saw Maui the DemiGod who to her surprise was much taller than she thought he would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoana couldn't believe it. Maui was the size of a giant to her. Moana was a small mouse compared to him. She just had to get his attention. The island princess scaled the giant rock, and eventually stood on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maui, Demigod of the Sea!\" She said as loud as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaui then turned, feeling like he heard something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaui then turned around and saw something interesting, a human girl standing on one of his rocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoana tried to stand tall and proud as Maui lifted her up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is interesting.\" Maui replied. \"Hello little one, and who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Moana of Montanui, Daughter of the Chief and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is great, this is just too much.\" Maui said \"You know I thought humans were done with this kinda thing but hey who am I to say no to tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what?\" Moana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so obvious. I'm sorry little girl, I would've noticed you sooner but I was busy. So, how do you wanna do this. Are you gonna dance for me, give me a blow job, what's your specialty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry what?\" Moana said in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well usually when human beings offer one of their own ladies as a tribute usually that means sexy time for ole Maui, so come on tiny, lets see that hiney.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No no no! I am not here to pleasure you, I am here to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaui dangles her by her leg, peeking up her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shaved clit.

The rose was glowing and Belle inhaled its intoxicating scent and within it, Belle felt herself getting stronger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer posture became more tall, her muscles bulged and her legs became strong like horse legs.

But they had all grabbed their torches and pitchforks and were heading towards a castle that no one knew existed in the middle of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three blonde triplets had remained behind because they were nursing broken hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three had been brokenhearted when Gaston had declared his intentions to make Belle his wife. Each one had hoped to one day walk down the aisle with Gaston.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(On a side note, probably the only reason each of the blondes was still a virgin in every sense of the word was that Gaston wanted to bed them all concurrently, rather than sequentially. The Bimbettes had been willing to do almost anything for Gaston, but they weren't going to do <b>that </b>for him!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Belle turned Gaston down, the girls had been relieved, insulted and devastated. Of course they hadn't wanted Gaston to marry Belle, but who was she to turn down the most eligible bachelor in the region??!!! And poor Gaston! It was clear that the rejection had completely devastated him! And so the girls were equally devastated! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Additional side note: The time period between Belle's rejection of Gaston, and LeFou's subsequent cheering up of Gaston, was possibly the only time in their history together that Gaston could have possibly convinced the triplets to surrender their virtue to him concurrently).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triplets were happy that Gaston was happy again, and again they began imagining Gaston taking one of them as his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they discovered he was going to commit Belle's father to the sanitarium unless Belle married him. O what a cad, Gaston!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when Belle revealed the existence of the Beast, the triplets could tell that Belle had feelings for the monster. Oh, sure, he was big, strong, hairy and a little scary, but so was Gaston. And this Beast was kind and gentle, according to Belle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that Claudette, Laurette, and Paulette realized that they wanted someone who was kind and gentle, and that Gaston was definitely not that man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Side note: It was at this moment, too, that the triplets were relieved that they had never given their virtues to Gaston, either singularly or collectively.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as the girls cleaned the tavern, silently moping, and wondering if they would ever find love, they would discover there was one other person left in the village:</span></div></div>",

Because I have 2 ideas connected to it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Emma turns out to be Maleficent's daughter. It would explain the hair, the temper and the sheer amount of magic she has considering True Love or not her parents are muggles and so is her 'brother'. Her being Mal's kid would be intersting, as well as be a kick in the sensative parts for the Charmings when they realise the cost for putting the darkness in the egg, was putting the dragon in Snow.<br>\r\n2) Lily is Regina's kid. It was a mix of the fact young Lily was a lot more 'Latina' than adult Lily, closer to Regina, plus I was a bit of a DragonQueen shipper (still am to be honest) so it seemed to fit and would have made Lily more important than a plot device that is then forgotten about in season 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to ignore both of these if you have some other interesting ideas.</span></div></div>",

For the most part. clear kryptonite is harmless to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very small number of the pieces of green kryptonite have multicolored particles suspended in their matrices. The particles remain inert until the green kryptonite is made clear. Even then, \"rainbow\" kryptonite is almost identical to clear kryptonite, except that it has an effect on human females between the ages of fifteen through twenty-five who have a long term exposure to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat that effect is, we will discuss in a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story begins in the agricultural community of Farmlet, a small town even smaller than Smallville, It does have a high school, though the junior high and high school are located on the same campus. Events in Smallville required Lana to stay with distant cousins for her senior year in high school. Lana missed everyone in Smallville, but Farmlet was so ordinary, that it was actually quite refreshing. Lana decided to forgo dating, dances and everything else that could be construed as even remotely romantic. But she made plenty of friends, and enjoyed her last year very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana's plan for the autumn was to return to Smallville and attend the community college there, for at least two years anyway. This summer, though she was planning to remain in Farmlet. The reason for that was her fifteen year old cousin Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven's parents, and Lana's cousins, were a couple approaching their sixties, who had run a dairy farm all their live. When Lana graduated, they decided to pass the dairy on to their oldest son, keeping only the farm house, a few outbuildings, and about ten acres for themselves. They also decided to take a vacation, the first one they had had for more than thirty years. While they were gone for three weeks, Lana would be responsible for watching after Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not going to be a problem for Lana. Steven was a very sweet kid, who had only this year grown a few inches taller than Lana. He was polite, shy and had what Lana thought of as the cutest crush on her. Watching over Steven wasn't going to be a problem at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, at least, Lana didn't think it was going to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Lana, her cousins had gotten her a graduation present which they thought was a normal crystal hanging on a silver chain. The crystal itself had started out life as a piece of green kryptonite, but had been transformed into clear kryptonite at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow it gotten transformed is a story in and of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clear kryptonite, however, wasn't completely clear.

Both had also joined Lana in her \"No Dating\" program,  and were going with her to Smallville in the autumn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope was a dark-skinned young woman, with long straight hair, and was two inches taller and a cup larger than Lana's 5'4\" and B-Cup. Hope had a mix of East African, South Asian and Native American that made her an exotic beauty. She had joined Lana's No Dating pledge simply because, in the almost all white community of Farmlet, she didn't care to be \"the dark girl\" that someone would eventually brag that they had got with. So Hope was going to wait until she got to somewhere bigger before she started dating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty (and Betty wasn't a nickname for a longer name) had been dating the same guy for the last two years. Betty was a 5'11\" blonde bombshell, who had only allowed her boyfriend Rob to play on top of her 38D bra, and never any lower on her body than that. Rob was getting a little whiny, but Betty was determined to keep her virginity until senior prom, Then she learned Rob had not only been bragging how far he had gotten already, but he had promised his buddies pictures of her if and when he got her clothes off. So Betty broke up with Rob, and was content to just hang with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the eighteen year old girls doted on Steven, treating him as their shared little brother, and he did appreciate the affection. But he would appreciate it a lot more if any of the three had been willing to give more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven paused in his game when he realized he hadn't heard any sounds from the family room for the last few minutes. There was a good reason for that. The rainbow kryptonite had finally kicked and the three young women</span></div></div>",

Both girls came from very conservative families. Habiba's father was a hydrological engineer who was a refugee from northwestern Africa and now worked for the government in assisting farmers with irrigation projects.

Individuals who might have been reluctant to mingle with wizards and witches felt more comfortable, especially with Dumbledore as head of the school. Yes, there was some push back, but if was marginalized, and not accepted by mainstream wizardry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that a very <i><b>TALL</b></i> and langley Logan Vass reported to Hogwarts the same year that Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger showed up at school, Of course, Harry didn't have a scar nor notoriety, since he who must not be named was now he who never was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Hermione became friends when Harry and his parents encountered Hermione and her parents at Diagon Alley. Ron fell into the crowd when he and Draco Malfoy butted heads, and Harry  took Ron's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps some friendships are always destined to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan had been sorted into Ravenclaw, and he was quite happy with that. He was the studious sort, and able to make rapid leaps of logic. Logan got along very well with his housemates, and was friendly enough with other houses. He had light brown hair, green eyes, lightly tanned skin, and the girls in his year took to calling him Supersized Cedric, after Cedric Diggory, who had been a couple of years ahead of Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the TriWizard Tournament was held, and there was a Yule Ball, Logan stayed back at Ravenclaw House. His reasoning was simple. He was almost twice as tall as anyone he could have asked to the Ball,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(By his final year, Logan was a few inches shy of being eleven feet tall).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny potential date Logan could have had, when dancing with him, would find the top of their heads aligning with Logan's waist. Which meant their faces would have been face to face with Logan's private parts. Worse, Logan was a teenage boy, who got excited in the presence of teenage girls, and his excitement would have been visibly obvious to any potential date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Logan bowed out of the Yule Ball and any other occasion where he might be expected to dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis changed in Logan's seventh year at Hogwarts, when he began dating<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the Voldemort free Universe, it wasn't until her fourth year that Hermione's circle of friends really began expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her housemates, certainly, and thanks to the early encounter between her parents and Harry's, she wasn't quite the obnoxious know-it-all that she had been in the Voldemort Universe. And serving as a mentor of sorts to Harry's little sister when the latter began Hogwarts two years later helped mellow Hermione out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was in her fourth year, when Hogwarts hosted the TriWizard Tournament, that Hermione began to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Voldemort free Universe, there were only three participants in the Tournament, and it would be Cedric Diggory who would win it free and clear. Harry was already enjoying a certain amount of fame as one of the best Seekers the Gryffindors had ever seen. And, along with Ron and two other male Gryffindors, Harry had revived his father's Marauders. Hermione was enjoying academic success at the School, and could always be counted on to earn points for her house in the classroom. And she had plenty of people she was friends with in Hogwarts. But in this universe, she wasn't as close to Ron or Harry or anyone as she had been in the Voldemort universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed when Viktor Krum asked her to accompany him to the Yule Ball. Hermione suddenly found herself in the midst of other young women of Gryffindor preparing themselves for the ball. And she found herself making new friends, talking about the most profound and silliest things and, for the first time in four years, not worrying in the least about mastering this wand technique or that potion combination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Hermione's fifth year, she decided to take the advice offered by Angelina Johnson and take a fairly rare potion. The potion only affected young women going through the latter stages of adolescence, and its effects were gradual, not immediate.  Hermione was becoming a lovely young woman, but the potion helped her become just a little bit more so. By her seventh year, Hermione was sporting a full C-Cup, as compared to the modest B-Cup she had in the Voldemort universe. And though still narrow, her hips weren't quite as narrow as they were in the Voldemort universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione dated a bit more, but never seriously. She had never let a boy do more than kiss her. Not even Viktor. Though her dates never fit a \"type,\" Hermione secretly preferred physical men. Like Viktor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd especially like Logan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan would have been handsome, even hot, if he had been human sized. Standing at almost eleven foot, Logan was literally larger than life. In addition, he was the archetypal Ravenclaw, and not even Professor Snape had any problems with Logan in his classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's only problem was that he didn't date. It seemed he had a problem dating women half his size. Ironically, many of the young woman at Hogwarts would date Logan despite his size. And one or two would date him <b>for</b> his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncluding Hermione. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's best friend at Hogwarts was his fellow Ravenclaw, Luna Lovegood. Though there was never any romantic inclinations between the two, their \"outsider\" perspective drew them together in friendship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Luna who convinced Logan to ask Hermione to the Harvest Gala in his seventh year. Hermione happily accepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to the practical problem of how Hermione and Logan were to dance. Luna provided the practical solution that Logan would carry Hermione in right hand for slow dances, while the couple would sit out and talk for the fast dances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan for one enjoyed having Hermione sit her cute little bum in his right hand as they danced. And Hermione enjoyed having Logan's large, strong right hand on her bum every time they danced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their first date together, Logan and Hermione's was a chaste romance, limited to holding hands and sharing quick kisses. This was about to change when the pair went home for the winter holiday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Logan and Hermione were going to spend the winter holiday separately with their respective family. However, before they went home, they were going to spend a three day weekend together, just the two of them, in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn't even offer sympathy without being accused of rubbing in her sister's misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shared silent look, they gestured for Harry to lead them onto the platform. With glee he charged towards the pillar, dragging Dilly behind, just slightly reluctantly.</span></div></div>",

How's the best boy in the world doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClifford barked his loud booming bark in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what today is? It's my birthday.

We'll still play.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on, Clifford would stroll around the house greeting Emily Elizabeth's friends. As Emily Elizabeth came outside, she was wearing a brand new one piece light blue swimsuit that perfectly fit in her cute butt and perky a cup boobs. Clifford's big red dick got really hard as he noticed his owner's swimsuit. It's true that Emily Elizabeth was a human and a relatively small one at that, but Clifford's love and primal instincts gave him an animalistic desire for the tiny blonde 15 year old human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily Elizabeth splashed around in her one piece bathing suit, she looked up and saw her towering red dog standing over her and her friends blocking out the son, with his mouth wide open drooling at her. Emily Elizabeth was always in awe of how gigantic and wonderful her dog was. It was her love that made him so big. Clifford wasn't just a dog, he was like a godly creature, towering red and smiling down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

She pulls out a knife from her boot and cuts down the surrounding branches and bushes. Lara smiles as she sees a small concrete pillar blocking the door with a small symbol on it. She smirks and pulls out her map, the map has an identical logo on it what in the shape of a small eagle. It had only taken her a couple of days but she had finally found it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara reaches out wiping some dust around the logo to reveal a few smaller logos and patters, she hums and looks back down at the map seeing the same patterns on her map. She glances up at the pillar then back down at the map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder.\u201d Lara whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches out and presses the four logo pattens in the order it shows up on her map, lion, bear, snake, wolf and finally eagle. All five symbols light up glowing bight and the pillar starts to rumble. Lara takes a step back, the pillar shifts backwards and slides into the wall revealing a staircase leading into darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done it again Lara.\u201d She smirks to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara picks up a stick that she had cut off and wraps a bit of fabric around the end of it. She pulls out her lighter and sets the end on fire creating herself a torch and ventures into the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara has been meaning to search this island for a while now, she\u2019s had the island on her radar for a long time but she never got around to it. Every time Lara was about to dedicate her time to this island something else came up that needed her attention more, after about five years of distractions she has finally made it. She\u2019s at the tomb ready to discover what is inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe island Lara is on is nothing too mysterious, while it was easily located on a map it spends most of its time deserted and unpopulated. Lara is interested in what lies within the island, there is nothing documented about what lays there as it all is surrounded in mystery. All that\u2019s been documented is that there is a treasure that lies within a hidden tomb on the island. No one knows what is inside or what could happen as on one has discovered it yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara has spent the past couple of days decoding some messages and clues for the tomb, she figured the inside the tomb wont be as easy as she thinks. She knew that there was the passcode but had found hints and clues towards keys to unlock what lies inside. Though out the island Lara found a total of four keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst door.\u201d She sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara reaches into her pocket and pulls out one of the three keys with little icons on the end of them, Lara looks up and sees that this door has a little skull on it. Lara smirks and inserts the skull key into the key hole. She turns it and hears a click, the door squeaks extremely loudly and swings open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell that no one has been here in a long time.\u201d Lara says walking though. \u201cThat door needs a bit of oil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara ventures into the cave more, she expects to be stopped by some traps or something but to her surprise nothing has attacked her. She steps on what feels like a pleasure plate and hears a loud creak and click causing her heart to sink. Nothing happens. She holds her torch to the wall next to her only to find a broken and rusted contraption. She takes a further look to find that a spear was supposed to come out and stab her but because it hasn\u2019t been in use its now rusted over and stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close.\u201d Lara sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara wanders down the long corridor for what feels like a solid ten minutes and nothing has happened, no traps set off, no doors, nothing. Lara sighs but continue to venture forward, while she does feel that there may not be anything at the end she wants to see for herself and not give up on a hunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara arrives at the end only to find a small little treasure chest sitting on a solid concrete pillar. Lara hums to herself, she looks around trying to find some sort of trap around it as she knows this can\u2019t be that easy. She looks around only to find that the pillar rests on a rusty pressure plate that looks to set off some sort of trap. Lara smirks, if this was set to be like the last trap she should be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound the last matches.\u201d Lara smirks seeing the two key holes on the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inserts both keys into the slot and turns them until she hears a click. Lara smiles widely as the lid of the chest slowly opens. What could the secret be that is hiding within, what mystery has been hidden for thousands of years only to be discovered now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fucking necklace.\u201d Lara sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at it with disappointment, she had spent a couple of years trying to find clues and whatever she can to find the great mysterious treasure only to discover its a necklace. It is a decent looking one but nothing too special, its gold with a little diamond in the centre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara reaches in and takes it out with ease. She hears a little creak coming from the pillar but doesn\u2019t think too much of it. She grips the necklace as she turns around only to find that the whole tomb is starting to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d Lara gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rocks start to fall and Lara runs down the long corridor dodging rocks and stones as they fall. Lara feels the necklace slowly slip out of her hand so she puts it over her head for safe keeping. Lara yelps as she feels the necklace shrink a little tightening around her neck. She tries to get it off regretting what she has done but it doesn\u2019t budge. Her body jolts but Lara keeps running trying to avoid the falling stones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease no.\u201d Lara begs seeing the exit in the distance slowly being covered by rocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara gets close and jumps diving though a small opening at the door. She lands on the ground with a hard thud and knocks herself out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Lara wakes up later feeling completely fine <br>\r\n2. Lara wakes up only to find that she is in a different location <br>\r\n3. Lara wakes up only to find some drastic changes to her body <br>\r\n4.

And it definitely did <b>not</b> involve tomb raiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was taking her tea on the deck of a schooner in the local marina, going through the mail that had accumulated in her absence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the mail was a package with no return address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the package was a notebook with the words \"Recusata Ring\" hand stenciled on the cover.

One author in the book suggested the ring was somehow connected to the Sibylline Books, while another thought the ring was in the legendary Soria Moria castle during that time period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura's tea went cold as she delved into the various and often contradictory tales of the Recusata Ring contained in the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe notebook itself was about two thirds filled, with the other third of the pages blank.

That's my aaaasss!!!\" Richie enjoyed looking at the tiny pucker peeking out between the tiny stretched out cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that's one itty bitty butthole, way too big for my dick. Could probably fit Tom Thumb's dick in there. Ha ha ha, little little Chloe with a little little butt hole.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe held back the tears as her shrunken butt was being opened up by two hideous pudgy fingers from a dirty janitor. She could feel herself being treated like less of a human. She was a doll in the eyes of this pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God please don't let me be stuck like this forever.\" Chloe thought in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Richie stuck his eye up to Chloe's opened up butthole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, wonder if I can see the ocean ha ha ha. Nope just some tiny Hitgirl's butthole. Damn its deep in there.\" Chloe didn't know what to do, she was six inches tall without any clothes and no way to reach anybody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile this evil middle aged man was spreading apart her ass and squeezing her young tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe Grace Moretz was a tiny woman in Hell.

The giantess shut the door, before holding the tiny actress in her hand and holding her phone up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She clicked on it for a quick minute, before the flash went off, taking a photo of the shrunken lady held in the giant palm of her captor, before she forcefully knocked her over onto her stomach, taking a photo of Emma's nude butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And you're online!\" Ruth said joyously, happy at her own self deemed entrepreneurial wit, whilst Emma was amazed that this chick had just decided to join a slave trade. Making sure that her tiny companion couldn't escape, the older woman set the girl in her back pocket, and walked out to the bookstore to finish her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was hell for Emma, sitting against the backside of some stranger as she could do nothing but wait for her fate to be revealed, but Ruth was having the time of her life. The feeling of control over another person like this enthralled her, and the money she was certain to make was also a nice touch at the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually, Ruth closed down the store, driving everyone out of the premises and locking the doors behind her before walking to her car in the front of the parking lot.

First I got a lot of business driven in through that book signing of yours, then I got a sale on Facebook for $500!\" She laughed, as Emma realized that she had already been sold and for a price as lousy as $500.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who bought me?!

There was nothing that she could do but sit back and listen to the crappy radio station Ruth was blasting above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon, the car rolled to a stop and Emma was retrieved by the wrinkly fingers she had previously been held by, and brought up to a house, where out walked a</span></div></div>",

Emma's locks were still long, but she had been musing about getting a pixie cut. Mind you, she was thankful for the fame the Harry Potter movies had given her, but the tour she was on was her last hurrah as Hermione Granger. After this, she wanted to pursue a career that would allow her to be Emma Watson, not merely a character in a successful franchise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happened, the universe was going to step in and change her future radically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eclipse that changed the world that year happened out of the blue. One moment, it was a sunny day in Earth's Western Hemisphere. The next, a moonlike object blocked out the sun. And it wasn't just a small portion of the world that saw the eclipse, as would normally happen. Everywhere in the world where the sun was shining experienced a brief total eclipse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll over the world, female singers, actresses, starlets and celebrities found themselves shrinking out of their clothes, down to the height of six inches. It would probably be small comfort to Emma, though, that she wasn't the only one going through the shrinking experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's size wasn't the only thing that had changed. Her shoulder length hair now hung down to her back. Her body remained slim and fit, but all the hair on her body below her neck had disappeared. Her breasts had slightly enlarged, so that if she had been her normal height, she would have worn a C-cup (though not required. Her newly grown breasts were quite firm, though her nipples were slightly smallish).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma hadn't noticed these other changes to her body, though. Her focus was on the fact that she was now only six inches tall, nude and someone was entering the room where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man entering the room was one Steven Meadows, an eighteen year old fan who was a senior from a nearby high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was a very nice, very gentle and very soft spoken boy with green eyes, sandy blonde hair and an ingratiating smile. He was well liked at his high school, and actually enjoyed a small amount of local celebrity, as he had won quite a few obstacle course races in the state, and had been an alternate for the men's Olympic gymnastic team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven was also a huge Emma Watson fan, and had brought a movie still for Emma Watson to sign. Unfortunately, he had gotten to the signing event late, and Emma was already gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bookstore owner had advised him that Emma hadn't left yet, and was still in the small room in back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Emma and Steven were both inside, both had missed out on the brief eclipse outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't missed out on the effects, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven walked up to the door of the room he was told Emma was in and knocked on it nervously. He was about to call out Emma's name as he did so, when he thought he heard a far away voice say \"Someone help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven turned the handle of the door, sticking his head in. \"Miss Watson, is everything all right?\" he asks timidly, ready to duck out in a flash if he gets shouted at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the floor and out in the open, tiny nude Emma looks up at the giant young man looking around the room.

What shocks Brie more is that he hasn\u2019t tried to do more with her, not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re very pretty Brie.\u201d The boy smiles and says softly as his finger brushes her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks.\u201d Brie stutters and blushes a bit not expecting to hear this. \u201cHow much do I need to pay you to return me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPay me?\u201d The Boy says with his face screwed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it sounds like that\u2019s the only way for you to return me home.\u201d Brie grins. \u201cHow much do you want? Five thousand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want your money Brie.\u201d The boy says. \u201cI want you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie\u2019s eyes widen and her stomach drops, she can\u2019t believe what she had just heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fucking way and I being your sex toy!\u201d Brie screams and starts to wriggle. \u201cLet me go you disgusting pig!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said I\u2019m keeping you as my sex toy you bitch.\u201d The boy snaps and gives Brie a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d Brie screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was but not any more.\u201d The boy huffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy swings his bag off his bag and lays it on the pavement. Brie continues to thrash and screaming hoping to be let go or heard by someone else. She feels her heart sink as she is dropped in, the giant fingers around her loosen and she tumbles to the ground with he boy zipping up the bag before she even hits the ground. Brie is tossed around as the bag is thrown on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me out you pig!\u201d Brie screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t get any kind of response from the boy. She lays down curling up in a ball and starts to cry. Her life is now in the hands of a sixteen year old boy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brie is curled up at the bottom of the bed nearly crying herself dry, as the boy heads home. She sighs as she knows that what is coming next wont be best. Because she is found by a teenager she is expecting nothing but the worst. She's expecting that the first thing she is going to see is his giant teen cock and being curled around it right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're home Brie.\" The boy calls out gently setting his bag down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie sits up with her heart sinking, the bag unzips and a giant hand reaches in curling its massive digits around Brie's tiny waist. Brie lets out a little whimper as she is slowly raised in the air. She closes her eyes tight excepting to see a cock. She hears the boy sit down on a chair just as he is unzipping something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!\" Brie screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The boy asks with a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie opens her eyes with a glare only to find that she is still in the boy's hand being held up to his giant face. Brie whimpers and slowly looks down, his pants are still on and sees his jacket on the floor. That must be what she heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, nothing.\" Brie says softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just so glad I can finally meet you Brie,\" The boy smiles. \"I've been wanting to meet you for a while now but I had never had the change because, well. I'm so happy I can meet you even though you are the size of a barbie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Un, yeah.\" Brie says a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie looks up and could tell that the boy was nervous as hell, she could see him trembling a bit but did his best to remain clam. Brie wines quite a bit as she feels the boys hand that is enveloping her slowly become wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry about that.\" He apologises as he sets her down on his desk. \"My palms get sweaty when I'm nervous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Brie sighs trying to wipe his sweat off her. \"So gross.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help?\" He asks reaching out towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me!\" Brie squeaks smacking his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" He sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie sighs and continues to wipe the sweat off her but turns her back to the teen, she felt extremely dirty from that and she has only been held. All of this feels super gross to her, she is happy that she hasn't been fucked or molested yet but there is still time. Brie sighs feeling a little cleaner, she turns around and sees the boy with his head on the desk just staring at her. Brie blushes sightly as her eyes make contact with his. She has to admit that she loves his eyes, they are dark brown and look very kind, hopefully the rest of him is like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Brie asks breaking the long silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" He smirks. \"I just like looking at you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's super creepy, please don't.\" Brie says folding her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy just smiles and continues to stare at the half naked barbie sized Brie Larsen standing in front of him. Brie sighs rolling her eyes and turns her back to him. She stands there tapping her foot hoping he would look away but nothing. Brie frowns and spins around ready to tell him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a lot prettier than I thought.\" He smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" Brie asks with a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always thought you were pretty Brie,\" He smiles and blushes. \"I just think you're a lot prettier in person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrie smiles sightly and blushes, she's used to kind comments but not like this. She gasps when she feels a giant finger collide with her back, Brie is about to tell him off when he starts to gently rub her back gently massaging it. Brie bites her bottom lip doing her best to hold back a moan, she has to admit that it did feel pretty good. Brie's eyes widen as she feels his finger get lower and lower. She turns around and smacks his finger just before he reaches her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck do you think you are doing?!\" Brie shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to pat you.\" The boys says lifting his head up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were trying to molest me!\" Brie squeaks backing up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I wasn't.\" The boy says backing up a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you were!\" Brie shouts. \"Ever since you found me I can tell that you want nothing more than to touch me and use me as a toy, you're a disgusting pig!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy sighs and flops back in his chair. </span></div></div>",

After a couple of seconds Brie lets out a little moan, she closes her eyes and kisses back due to how gentle and amazing Karen's kiss feels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stand there for a bit kissing, Karen's hands are placed on the side of Brie's face gently controlling the kiss and Brie's hands rest on Karen's hips. Brie lets out a little gasp and moan as Karen's hands gently run down her neck to her chest. Karen is nearly at her breasts causing Brie to moan, she wants Karen to grab her breasts badly. Her hands get closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long.\" Charlie says accidentally slamming the door. Karen and Brie jump off each other like nothing had happened. \"The begs were just stored away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie sits back down having no clue on what had just happened between the two. He places two beds down on his desk that are meant for Barbies. There are curtains placed around the bed for some privacy. Karen and Brie walk over to them and check them out. They are amazed how soft the bed is, it feels just like a normal bed just smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Karen gasps. \"This is amazing, thank you for this Charlie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" Charlie smiles. \"My girls deserve the best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren smiles while Brie winces. Karen climbs onto the bed and lays down. She giggles and snuggles in almost drifting off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice peasant.\" Karen smirks. \"I might keep you around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my Queen.\" Charlie smirks. </span></div></div>",

Brie could do nothing but watch as the well manicured hand brought her up, passing the large posterior and ample bosom of the mature woman being held by jean shorts and a tank top.

Before she could even wipe her eyes, the giant face of Beth, her captor, loomed over the two girls with hot breath pouring over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see that one of my two new dolls is awake, but the other just slept through me dumping you both out.\" She boomed, before plucking Jennifer's unconscious body off of the giant bed. Brie looked around to see that she was in a hotel room, no doubt belonging to the woman who had just taken her. \"I know how to wake her up.\" Beth laughed, taking the tiny actress and shaking her around a little, dangling the poor girl by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jennifer's eyes burst open, as she screamed at the scenario, but the giant just laughed. She threw her back on the bed, before standing up next to it. \"I've got like an hour before I need to meet my friend for dinner, and I plan on testing my new toys out in that time.\" Beth said, before starting to undress. She slipped out of her shirt, revealing mammoth sized breasts, even on a normal sized woman, before unsheathing them from the bra that held them. Jennifer and Brie shivered in fear, holding each other to try and gain some comfort, but the sight of the MILF taking off her pants to reveal an ass that could squash them to paste reversed any feelings of ease they might have gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon, the lacy black panties were tugged down, and the giantess held them in her right hand, before tossing them directly next to the women, as to taunt her new toys. The tiny women smelt the feminine scents arise from her undergarments, before the now nude woman jumped on the mattress at the far side from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They cried as she crawled seductively on all fours towards the celebrities, letting them know that she was the apex predator, and currently her hunt was the two tiny women on her bed. She reached out, grabbing Brie Larson and slid off her panties, ripping the barbie sized bra off of her right after. Lying with her legs spread on the bed, she let her toy see the cavernous pussy that awaited her, before slowly bringing the actress to her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With one quick motion, she lodged Brie into her vagina, only legs kicking around on the outside for Jennifer to watch, waiting for her turn as the face and upper body of her shrunken comrade lay inside the pussy of her kidnapper. Brie couldn't help but struggle, the sounds of juices churning and warm liquids overcoming her. Every struggle pressed her against the hot flesh of Beth's inside, being used as a human dildo. Jennifer screamed as Beth moaned in pleasure, pulling Brie in and out of herself to simulate penetration as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jennifer could only escape the torment for so long before the hand that wasn't using her fellow actress to pleasure the giantess came down and grabbed onto her, as Beth leaned onto her knees, turning around and giving the tiny woman a great view of her pulsing anus. There was nothing she could do to escape as Beth pressed her face against her asshole, the smell making the tiny woman want to vomit. That was before she pushed the head into her ass, and eventually her entire body was inside of her butt as nothing more than a buttplug to use while she masturbated with Brie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This went on for forty five minutes,  before Beth realized that she had somewhere to be. She quickly unplugged herself, pulling Brie out and tossing her on a pillow, before retrieving Jennifer from her ass. She pulled the soaking wet women up to her face, before she started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, but I have a dinner to catch!\" She said with a chuckle. \"Better get you cleaned up before I leave, I can't stand to have you smelling like this for our entire time together.\" She then opened her lips and placed the women on her tongue, retreating the muscle into her mouth and rolling the women around. Brie and Jennifer were bawling in tears, not knowing where they began and the saliva being thrown around them in the cavern of this woman's mouth ended. With a spit, they landed on the bed, looking up at their captor once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y'all were tasty! If you weren't so valuable, I might just gobble you up sometime!\" She laughed, before</span></div></div>",

And odd rumours were always floating around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn November 2002, one such rumor floating around was that a mystical eclipse was about to occur and that, when it did, actresses, models and singers around the world were going to shrink down to six inches in height. Not only that, these female idols were going to shrink out of their clothes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumor mill said that a cabal of Hollywood directors and producers were corralling unsuspecting starlets into secret locations so that, when the shrinking happened, they would have their own tiny harems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome minor starlets and rising singers and models would escape this corralling, since it would look too suspicious if all the hot women in the world were scheduled to travel to the same isolated locations on the same day. But all the big name actresses and singers and models were going to disappear on that day. That was guaranteed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut everyone was told to keep an eye open if they saw a minor starlet or such in November. If they were lucky, they would have a tiny plaything of their own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn Fields didn't believe that this shrinking eclipse was going to happen. He was an eighteen year old freshman at the local community college who was saving money by getting his first two years at the local college before transferring to the big university upstate. He was going to get his degree in astronomy. And as a future astronomer, he knew there not going to be an eclipse that month, magical or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't stop John from fantasizing, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn didn't have trouble dating. He was a good looking guy with green eyes, sandy blonde hair, a light tan and a lean, muscular build. He was easy going and got along with everyone. Probably the only thing that stopped John from dating more than he did was the time crunch. If he wasn't at school, he was either studying or at his job, serving as a clerk at a local motel that was slightly upscale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had his Western Civ I book out, studying for the next test, when she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took John a few seconds to recognize the hot eighteen year old girl standing in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know you,\" he said excitedly. \"I saw you in that movie about the giant spiders.\":<br>\r\n]<br>\r\nThe redhead gave him an impish smile. \"That's me. That's actually why I'm here. I have an interview at your local station to talk about the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they had an early watch movie last night for their listeners,\" John enthused. \"You were great in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Anyway, can I get signed in and put my bags in my room? I really need to get to the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded as he watched her sign in, then promised he would get an autograph from this Scarlett Johansson when she wasn't in a rush. Who knows, she might even become a major actress one day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn gave Scarlett instructions on the fastest way to get to the radio station. She flashed him a smile, took the pass key, and headed to her room. About ten minutes later, John saw Scarlett's rental car head out of the motel parking lot and head toward the radio station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John's relief came in at three, there was nothing to tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had the next three days off, but decided to come by the motel the next morning, in the hope of getting Scarlett's autograph as she signed out. He had just pulled into the parking lot when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large object passed between the Earth and the Sun, causing a partial eclipse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn rushed into the motel lobby, where the guests were all staring at the television as the talking heads reacted to what had just happened. The hotel manager behind the desk waved John over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, you're an amateur astronomer. How do you have a flash eclipse?\" the manager said, a hint of panic in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was stunned, as clueless as his boss. \"I have no idea. Maybe an asteroid making a close pass? But it shouldn't have happened that quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager just shook his head, returning his attention to the television. \"What are you doing here anyway?\" he asked John, not looking away from the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was going to---\" John suddenly froze. He was about to tell the manager he was going to get Scarlett's autograph when he remembered the rumor about the shrinking eclipse. John's brain refused to believe that such a thing could happen. But then again, this \"flash\" eclipse had just happened with no logical explanation for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...I was just going to check what my schedule is for next weei,\" John lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Posted yesterday in the office,\" the manager replied, still enraptured by the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn ran into the office, grabbing one of the master passkeys the maintenance and cleaning staff used. His heart palpitating, John went to Scarlett's room. He knocked twice on Scarlett's door and, not getting an answer, warned her he was coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(When John enters the hotel room, where does he find a six inch nude Scarlett Johansson?) </span></div></div>",

She had so many adoring fans and millions of dollars from her hit records, along with beautiful blonde hair, blue eyes, and a gorgeous face. The only thing that she wished was different was her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor had a very flat butt, which had been pointed out in the tabloids, Youtube comment sections, and even on Family Guy. One day Taylor stood in a bikini in front of a mirror and sadly looked at her relatively flat posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit. Why are you so tiny?\" Taylor said to her toneless tush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Taylor walked downstairs from her luxury apartment towards the outside, she saw a strange old woman in a long dark cloak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help you Taylor dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor stopped for a second to acknowledge the old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?

Taylor looked around wondering what that was all about, then she looked and saw a strange mark on her arm that was the intials MR. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that get there?\" Soon Taylor felt something strange from behind her. She felt her ass, and suddenly her horizontal plane was now a pair of tight curvy butt cheeks. Taylor turned around and blushed with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! I have a butt! This is incredible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor rubbed her cheeks giggling and smiling about her new ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the blonde pop star know but the magic that gave Taylor her brand new ass came with a curse. </span></div></div>",

Well, not yet, but it soon would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel Thompson was just your typical eighteen year old boy genius who had soulful brown eyes and sandy blonde hair that just invited female friends to run their fingers through it. It was a fact that Daniel wouldn't have minded if one of the women who wanted to do that with his hair had wanted to become something more than friends. Daniel wouldn't have minded if at least one of those women wanted to be friends with benefits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the women Daniel knew that he wanted to be more than just friends kept him safely in the celibate friend zone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Daniel retreated to the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, before we go further, it should be note that Daniel wasn't a bad looking guy. He was a little on the skinny side, but he ran five miles a day to think (and incidentally keep in shape) and he was really a very nice guy who wouldn't hurt anyone. He was the sort of guy who nursed small wild animals back to health and helped little old ladies cross the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Daniel was a nice guy, but he was still a guy, and  he still had desires. So Daniel turned to the internet to help alleviate those desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that time Daniel developed a fetish for shrunken women. His tastes were pretty vanilla. He had no desire to digest a shrunken woman, torture a shrunken woman, or insert a shrunken woman into any part of his anatomy. His fantasies consisted of gentle caresses, licks and rubs. Daniel even fantasized about restoring the shrunken woman to her normal height afterwards, with a lifetime of alternating between her being full-sized and shrunken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel even had a small collection of items that he kept private that involved his fetish. One of these was a \"shrinking potion\" that he had bought at an online auction for five hundred dollars. It was a midnight blue liquid in an ornate and sealed flask. The instructions said that just a few drops ingested by a young woman in good health would shrink her down to the height of six inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instructions also said the young woman would not shrink instantly, but would feel compelled to travel to the owner of the potion when he was alone. The young woman in question would present herself to him, at which point she would shrink out of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember the part about Daniel being a boy genius? Well, Daniel had developed a number of devices and programs, including a digital anti-piracy program that earned him quite a bit of money and appreciation with the recording industry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd because of his background, Daniel knew that there were no such thing as shrinking potions. particularly ones that did what this one claimed to do. All the liquid did was help fuel some of Daniel's fantasies. Nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2009 was also an important year, in that Taylor Swift and Kellie Pickler recorded a duet entitled \"Best Years of Your Life\" that made it to number nine on the country charts. To commemorate this, an event was held to which Daniel was invited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of event was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Drinks are carried out by waitstaff and plucked off the tray by attendees as the servers go by. Or attendees go to the fully stocked bar and order their drinks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case, in addition to waiters and a bar, there was a punch bowl in the center of the room. The punch bowl was part of an ice sculpture, with drinks being continuously dipped by the serving staff and placed in a pyramidal structure. So no one was actually dipping a ladle into the punch to serve themselves. That sort of thing only happened in movies about high school proms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had already turned off some of the attendees with his technobabble, and the waitstaff had quickly learned to keep their engagements with him brief, as Daniel had continuous questions about the pumping and circulatory system used as part of the ice sculpture/punchbowl centerpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo most people were pointedly <b>not</b> paying attention to Daniel when he poured the potion into the punchbowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, the potion had circulated enough in the punch so as to be undetectable, but with a high enough concentration that it would affect anyone who would be susceptible to its effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel stood in a dark corner watching various people walk by the centerpiece without really giving it a glance. Then his heart leaped when he saw not one but five beautiful women approach the centerpiece. And they actually picked up glasses to drink the punch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor perhaps the first time in recording history, you had a group of five young women singers (Taylor, Kellie, Katy, Renee and Jessica) gathered together, none of whom had a feud going with any of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the five talked about something or other around the bowl, Daniel watched intensely as the five singers sipped out of their cups. Well, four actually. Taylor had lifted the glass to her lips. But before Taylor could sip her punch, Daniel heard Kellie say something about \"pineapple juice,\" at which point Taylor set her cup down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was disappointed when Taylor set her glass down. Not that he was actually expecting the shrinking potion to work. But watching Taylor drink the punch along with the other women would have fired some powerful fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel consoled himself that he had still seen the other four singers drink their punch. Perhaps that would be better in the long room, Daniel consoled himself. He had a penchant for large breasted shrunken women anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the five women moved away from the punch bowl, Daniel decided to call it a night. As he headed home, he had no idea that Kellie, Jessica, Katy and Renee would be joining him...</span></div></div>",

Since they were on two different continents at the time, their disappearances were investigated by two different groups of law enforcement agencies and security consultants. In both cases, there was no signs of how the two women were kidnapped, nor any clues of what had happened to them after they disappeared. But there was no assumption of any connection between the two disappearances<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was a connection between the two. Just none that anyone who didn't have arcane training could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs most people who keep up with the news know, there is a market for almost anything you could want, and someone who will provide it, if you know who to talk to and can pay their price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case, there was a market for young female celebrities who had been shrunken down to (approximately) six inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe price for acquiring such valued objects is high, and there are a lot of restrictions as well. Most of this has to do with the fact that the natural laws that govern the modern world don't allow for the shrinking of a live human being. For that, you have to rely on someone who can manipulate the world around them using magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe widespread use of magic has diminished since the sinking of Atlantis, and has all but disappeared in the modern world. The last true sorcerer in the world was Merlin, and his time ended more than a thousand years ago. The few magicians left in the world who can perform feats such as shrinking a person would barely be considered apprentices during the reign of Atlantis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCase in point, the sorcerer who orchestrated the kidnapping and shrinking of Taylor and Katy. In order to accomplish this task, he first had to arrange certain arcane symbols and movements to be put in Katy's Dark Horse video, to draw on the adoration of her fans. Then he had to arrange a public feud between the two singers, to draw from that negative energy. This was accomplished by getting a handful of dancers to leave one tour for the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even after the singers were shrunken, the magician had to find just the right buyer. The buyer in questions would have to be the gentle sort. who wouldn't try to insert either of the singer into places they shouldn't go, or want to cause them pain.

But finding a person like that in the dark corners of the real and virtual world where two tiny singers would be auctioned off would be almost impossible to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, for the magician, magic has other uses than just shrinking down unsuspecting young singers. The magician who shrank Katy and Taylor found an eighteen year old male tech inventor who was just the gentle sort  that could pay a hundred million dollars for the shrunken pair of singers and, more importantly, keep his mouth shut and not do the sort of ungentle things that would cancel the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo our story begins with David Wilkins, an eighteen year old inventor with blue eyes and sandy blonde hair, who is a little skinny but not a bad looking kid. Among the other things he has recently purchased for the isolated house he bought are a pair of tiny singers. He is about to get a box with a six inch tall Taylor Swift, along with Katy Perry, who has been shrunk down to five and a quarter inches. And both of them will be<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Granted, not all the cryptids encountered had to be world changing, but a ladybug that just changed the size of its spots? That was something only another ladybug could get excited about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some pluses to just studying an insect, Zak supposed. Not for Zak, of course. But Zak's father had been able to leave Zak and his mother alone, taking the rest of the family to a Secret Scientist gathering that had something to do with the ancient Lemurian civilizations. Now that the essence of Kur was finally destroyed, new discoveries about the Lemurians weren't as potentially \"earth shattering\" as they had been when Argost was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Fisk was still interested about the history of his own people, and so had gone with Doc. Zon and Komodo had taken the opportunity to go on extended hunting trips, effectively leaving Zak and his mother alone. Zak wouldn't have minded if they had had an interesting cryptid to study. But all they had was a big ladybug that changed the size of its spots. Which meant Drew expected Zak to spend the time keeping up with his homeschooling and his chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mom, I was going to put a frozen pizza in the oven for supper,\" Zak called out. \"That okay with you? Mom, you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak's mother, tiny and nude, had frozen as she climbed out from underneath her clothing. She had not only realized what had happened to her, but that her (now giant) son was going to be the one to find her in her new state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Drew Saturday gave a smile to the cryptid she had been remotely examining for the last few days. The cryptid didn't pay her any attention, focusing instead on the banana it was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cute little thing, Drew thought to herself. The cryptid looked like a blue Capuchin monkey with oversized black wings and pink eyes. Drew had decided the cryptid was basically harmless, and so was restricting herself to the most noninvasive methods of examining it possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the cryptid wasn't entirely harmless. For example, Drew usually wore a form fitting jumpsuit to the laboratory and around the complex. Today, though, she was wearing an orange blouse and a very short black skirt, along with black stockings that showcased her trim legs. There were a few buttons undone on the blouse that displayed a pair of large, firm breasts encased in a black lacy demi bra. And anytime Drew bent over, she showed off a panty clad ass that would have been the envy of any aerobics instructors a decade or more younger than her thirty nine years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew was wearing a white lab coat over her ensemble, as if her subconscious was trying to tone down the effect of her outfit. If that was what Drew's subconscious was trying to achieve, it failed miserably. Particularly since Drew hung up the lab coat almost as soon as she entered her lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew dropped a pen and bent over to pick it up almost at the same time as her son Zak entered the lab. Zak turned a bright red at the sight his mother was unknowingly provided. It wasn't the first time Zak had been afforded a view of some part of his mother's anatomy, but he never got tired of the opportunity to ogle his mother's body without being caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe homeschooling Zak got from his mother, occasionally supplemented by other Secret Scientists, was better than Zak could have gotten anywhere else. But it stunted other parts of his development. Zak had very few friends his own age, and they were either cryptids, protectors of cryptids, or children of other secret scientists. And Zak usually only got to \"hang\" with his friends when some kind of cryptid emergency was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Zak minded spending as much time as he did with his mother. Zak knew the loss of his father was even harder on his mother than it had been on him. But being a sixteen year old boy with a body saturated with hormones, around a mother who had a body that would be the envy of any lingerie model, was not easy. Particularly since Zak didn't have access to internet porn or girls his own age. Zak found himsef fantazing about his mother more and more often. And those fantasies tried to translate the academic sex education his mother had given him to practical based fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, a few of those fantasies were about his ex-babysitter Abbey. Zak felt almost as guilty about those fantasies as he did about those he had about his mother. Granted, Doyle and Abbey were never going to get back together again. Doyle had made it clear that he would work with Abbey, but he would never trust her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most of his fantasies centered around Drew, since it was just the two of them most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had been strange the last few days. Zak's mother had been dressing...differently. She was even acting a little bit more affectionate, giving Zak more hugs, continuously touching him. Not that Zak minded. It just made things harder. In more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware that her son was watching her, Drew picked up her pen, then began reviewing data that she had been collecting. She sighed, finding herself unable to concentrate. She was thinking about how much she missed Doc. It had been three years now, but Drew didn't want to move on. She had enjoyed every aspect of her life with Doc. Especially the physical. She and Doc had had a very active sex life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been really missing that physical contact the last few days. Her masturbatory sessions weren't helping any more. And Drew was feeling very frustrated. She also felt helpless, because she didn't think there was anything she could do about her frustration. Doc may have been dead, but Drew felt being with another would be the equivalent of cheating on Doc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an image came unbidden to Drew's mind. It was of her son climbing out of the pool after swimming laps. Zac hadn't filled out to the sizae of his father. He was only sixteen, after all. But he was as tall as Drew, and had the lean muscled build of an active teen. And though the swimming trunks weren't skin tight, they were tight enough to let Drew see her son had a man-sized package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew mentally pushed that image out of her mind. This was Zak, her son, her baby boy. Not a man she could use for her own sexual fantasies. Or someone whom she could fulfill their sexual fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush came to Drew's cheeks as she once again had to force illicit thoughts out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to either mother or son, the winged blue monkey had stopped eating its banana and began studying the pair of humans. The cryptid had the ability to sense when a potential sexual relation existed between two (or sometimes more) individuals. Normally, the cryptid's powers were only passive. Humans who remained in its presence would eventually find their general sexual desire being heightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut occasionally, the cryptid would take a more active role, and focus the effects of its powers on those individuals who seemed to have an unspoken sexual attraction toward each other. And the longer those humans remained in the vicinity of the cryptid, the better the chance they would act on those unspoken sexual attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Drew turned her attention back to the monkey, it had gone back to eating its monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak finally shook his head to end his mental fantasy session. \"Hey Mom, I got those analysis you wanted,\" he said, walking toward his mother. Halfway to his mother, Zak stumbled, and<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Fell forward, with his face landing between his mother's breasts<br>\r\nOption 2: Fell backward, making his erection obvious to his mother</span></div></div>",

Then he would be feeling pain, yet as he started to fall he hit something soft and warm. He realized he stumbled into someone, as they both landed on the floor with a thud. Zak heard a soft groan of pain, as he his head rested against something big and soft. He decided just to roll over and quickly blushed. His head was between the glorious mounds of his babysitter Abbey. He looked into her face and saw she was blushing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared into her grey eyes, as she stared into his orange eyes. For several moments neither of did anything. Zak, do to like feeling Abbey's soft marshmallows on his face and Abbey do to her feeling something long, hard and thobbing on her stomach. Abbey realized what she was feeling on her stomach and kicked herself mentally for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDame it, she screamed mentally, if she knew Zak was going to be this well hang. When she babysat Zak, she would have gone along with his attempts to con her into playing strip poker, take a bath with her and him trying to take pictures of her in her lingerie. She haven't had sex in a long time, she tried to get back with Doyle but he had made it clean he would rather jump off a cliff then get back together with her. Yes, this did make Abbey upset. Yet, she could understand why, he thought like that. Being stabbed in the back, if she was in her shoes. She most likely  would think the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her and refocus on Zak, big surprised. Thoughts of her seducing him and riding him a cowgirl flooded her mind. She pretty sure Zak would agree to any sexual act she wanted to do with him. Being a teenage boy with almost no sexual outlet, plus she knew he still had a crush on her. The only problem was Drew, she is the definition of mama bear and she very much doubt she would let her have her way with Zak on any level. Maybe if she could lure Zak to some isolated area and at the same time keep Drew busy it could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time as Zak and Abbey stared at each other on top of each other. Drew just stared at them, she blushed seeing her son's head between Abbey's mounds. Suddenly images of Zak between her's flooded her mind. She tried her best to push them out but no luck this time. She started walking towards them, with plans of helping Zak up but those came crashing down with her too. Suddenly one of her heels broke, this made the white hair MILF stumbled forward. She landed with her own breasts on top of her son's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak was on the verge of passing out, not only from having two pairs of perfect breasts surrounding him but from the fact. That both his mother's and Abbey's  faces where only an inch or two from each other. Zak gulped, as thoughts of his mother and Abbey kissing each other. OK, not just kissing but a full blown make out session. With both of their tongues vying for control. Zak wished they would have accidentally kissed, atleast he would have gotten a great image to masturbate later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Drew and Abbey just stared at each other, their lips only an inch ot two away from each other. They could feel each other warm breath on each other. They both knew Zak was being crushed by their breasts and enjoying it. Drew and Abbey looked into each other eyes and could see hints of lust. Not only for them but for Zak as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they just lay there, the sexual tension was increasing by the second. All where getting hot and sweating, Zak felt like he could bust at any second. The girls o nthe other hand, felt their panties getting wet.

It had already detected the thread of sexual tension between mother and son. But now it noticed it between Zak and his ex-babysitter as well. Zak had always had a crush on Abbey, and as he matured, the crush remained, but now with lustful elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Abbey, her time at the Saturday compound had more or less forced a three year period of celibacy on her. Doyle wanted nothing to do with her, and her sister made sure Abbey never went on any unaccompanied excursions away from the compound. Miranda was only too aware that the Grey sisters had quite a ways to go before they were once again in good standing with the Saturday clan. She didn't want Abbey to have a chance to screw things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo all Abbey had to keep herself satisfied was her own hand and a few fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of those fantasies included babysitter fantasies. And Abbey had to guiltily admit to herself that Zak was growing into a fine young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cryptid noted the competition that had sprung up between Abbey and Drew, not only as caregivers to Zak, but also as his potential sexual partner. The cryptid's powers gave a half turn (for lack of a better phrase) to that potential competitive urge and made it cooperative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result was that the women took turns arousing Zak, rather than try to monopolize his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Zak looked toward his mother, she bent over to pick up something from the floor. If he looked toward Abbey, she would complain about the heat and pull down her top zipper an inch. None of these actions were consciously done, but by the time the trio was through working, Abbey's zipper was pulled down to her belly button, and all but the bottom two buttons of Drew's blouse were undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak had given up trying to hid his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Drew announced the day was done, an impromptu group hug occurred between the three, They held each other for ten minutes, not speaking, and in no hurry to end the embrace. Then Zak's hands, which had been around the waists of his mother and babysitter, began sliding downward, until he had one hand firmly on the firm backsides of Drew and Abbey. The trio remained unmoving until Abbey announced that \"We all need to go to<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It did look so cute, so Drew was taking it easy on the adorable monkey. She was wearing a orange blouse, with a few buttons undone. This showed off her cleavage of her massvie E cup breasts. She also wore a black mini skirt, black thigh high stockings, black flats and a white lab coat. Luckily the monkey was behaving himself, as he a ate a few bananas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew took her lab coat off, a she bended over. This happened right as Zak entered the lab. He blushed, as he got a great view of his mother ass. Zak just stood there and admired his mother's ass. When go up homeschooled, with a mother who looks barely half her age. With a figure that most lingerie models would sell their soul for, giant breasts, long luscious legs, slender but athletic figure and a firm ass. Zak closed his eyes, as he thought when his mother taught him about sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain growing up homeschool, and with almost no contact with other people. Specifically other girls, plus his parents where and his mother still very much against porn. He never had a change to developed \"health\" fantasies about girls. No, almost all where about his mother and a few about Abbey. He still had a small crush on her, naughty babysitter and all. He at least thanked his uncle for telling about that erotic concept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zak stayed silent as he just stared at his mother ass and mentally undressed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew was going over some data, as sighed. Do her husband had been gone along time. Why she did miss him for being a great husband, she also missed him because she haven't had sex since he died. Drew couldn't bring herself to have sex with just any guy. To her that would be cheating, she sighed again. She lost count the times she spend hours masturbating in her bed or shower. It wasn't helping her anymore, she needed a real man but she still couldn't just have sex with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without warning and memory popped into her mind. It was the time Drew saw Zak pulling himself out of the pool. He was wearing only a pair of black swim trunks. She remembered just staring at him, marveling over his chiseled chest, his powerfully built arms and legs and that bulge in his trunks. She grinned her teeth as she gasped softly and rubbed her thighs together. This made her shake her ass, which unbeknownst to her Zak was enjoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked ao much like Doc but wondered if he was bigger. Drew shook her head,  o she mentally scream. Zak was her baby boy, not some sexy and well built stud. A stud she would do anything for if he asked. Drew blushed, as she once again had to banish several naughty thoughts about her son from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to either mother and son, the little blue winged monkey was staring at them. He had a six sense of knowing when two humans where into each other. He also knew he had the power to help them give in their primal desires. So when he sense the sexual tension between the two humen, he released his pheromones. Now they do take time to take full effect but the humen never seemed to matter in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back to eating his bananas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Drew backup into someone, with something long, hard and thobbing in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Zak tripped and fell on to Drew landing in her breasts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zak stumbled backwards, he thought he would being feeling a hard floor. Then he would be feeling pain, yet as he started to fall he hit something soft and warm. He realized he stumbled into someone, as they both landed on the floor with a thud. Zak heard a soft groan of pain, as he his head rested against something big and soft. He decided just to roll over and quickly blushed. His head was between the glorious mounds of his babysitter Abbey. He looked into her face and saw she was blushing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared into her grey eyes, as she stared into his orange eyes. For several moments neither of did anything. Zak, do to like feeling Abbey's soft marshmallows on his face and Abbey do to her feeling something long, hard and thobbing on her stomach. Abbey realized what she was feeling on her stomach and kicked herself mentally for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDame it, she screamed mentally, if she knew Zak was going to be this well hang. When she babysat Zak, she would have gone along with his attempts to con her into playing strip poker, take a bath with her and him trying to take pictures of her in her lingerie. She haven't had sex in a long time, she tried to get back with Doyle but he had made it clean he would rather jump off a cliff then get back together with her. Yes, this did make Abbey upset. Yet, she could understand why, he thought like that. Being stabbed in the back, if she was in her shoes. She most likely would think the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her and refocus on Zak, big surprised. Thoughts of her seducing him and riding him a cowgirl flooded her mind. She pretty sure Zak would agree to any sexual act she wanted to do with him. Being a teenage boy with almost no sexual outlet, plus she knew he still had a crush on her. The only problem was Drew, she is the definition of mama bear and she very much doubt she would let her have her way with Zak on any level. Maybe if she could lure Zak to some isolated area and at the same time keep Drew busy it could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time as Zak and Abbey stared at each other on top of each other. Drew just stared at them, she blushed seeing her son's head between Abbey's mounds. Suddenly images of Zak between her's flooded her mind. She tried her best to push them out but no luck this time. She started walking towards them, with plans of helping Zak up but those came crashing down with her too. Suddenly one of her heels broke, this made the white hair MILF stumbled forward. She landed with her own breasts on top of her son's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak was on the verge of passing out, not only from having two pairs of perfect breasts surrounding him but from the fact. That both his mother's and Abbey's faces where only an inch or two from each other. Zak gulped, as thoughts of his mother and Abbey kissing each other. OK, not just kissing but a full blown make out session. With both of their tongues vying for control. Zak wished they would have accidentally kissed, atleast he would have gotten a great image to masturbate later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Drew and Abbey just stared at each other, their lips only an inch ot two away from each other. They could feel each other warm breath on each other. They both knew Zak was being crushed by their breasts and enjoying it. Drew and Abbey looked into each other eyes and could see hints of lust. Not only for them but for Zak as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they just lay there, the sexual tension was increasing by the second. All where getting hot and sweating, Zak felt like he could bust at any second. The girls o nthe other hand, felt their panties getting wet. All started to breeze heavily, as suddenly the tension of broken when....</span></div></div>",

Drew closed her eyes as well, as both girls just kissed. The monkey saw this, his pheromones removed any sense of jealous. So the girls wouldn't be competing for the male's affection but work together to fulfill any and all of thr male's desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissed lasted for a minute, Zak's mouth ran dry as he stared at his mother kissing his crush. Once again, he had to thank his uncle for explaining what lesbains are. The two girls slowly moved apart. They both where blushing, as they opned their eyes. Three slowly got off of each other and sat around each other. None of them spoke for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Can I get a kiss from each of you ?\" Asked Zak, both girls giggled like schoolgirls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Drew leaned in and kissed Zak on his lips. The kiss lasted for a minute, then Drew pulled back and Abby took her turned. Zak enjoyed both kisses, it was a dream came true for him. He wondered would his mother and Abby go further with him. He wondered what he could do to. Luckily he was feeling incredibly warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Is it hot in here ?\" Asked Zak, with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth looked at each other, \" It's very hot in here.\" Said Drew, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I totally agree.\" Said Abby, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen both girls stood up, then Drew slid off her lab coat letting it fall to the floor. Abby started slowly unzipping her blue jump suit. Zak just looked up as the two women he had fantasies about, where stripping in front of him. He didn't say a thing, not wanting to interrupt this awesome moment. Drew started unbuttoning her orange blouse, Zak could see she was wearing a black strapless bra with green lace trim. Then Drew slid the blouse off, letting it fall on the lab coat. Zak turned back to Abby, she just finished pulling the zipper down on her jumpsuit. Next she removed her black gloves. Then she slid the jumpsuit off her shoulders and pulled it down. Zak gulped, seeing she was wearing a blue lace corset. It pushed her Double D cup breasts up amd out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak turned back to his mother, she started unzipping her black mini skirt. She let it fall around her feet, as Zak stared at his mother's black thong with green lace trim, green garter belt and her black thigh high stockings with green lace trim. Drew then stepped out of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZak turned his attention back to Abby, she just removed her boots. Then she took off her jumpsuit, and stood up. Zak saw she was wearing a blue lace thong. Zak was sweeting like crazy, as he felt incredibly hot. Plus his was blushing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth lingerie clad girls looked down at Zak and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I feel much better now.\" Said Drew, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes, much better now.\" Said Abby, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: They said Zak look hot himself, so they pulled him up and start undressing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Drew and Abby took turns making out with Zak.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three years had passed since the War of the Cryptids, when Argost was finally destroyed. A lot of good people had made the ultimate sacrifice, including Drew's husband Doc. Even after five years, she still missed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew still had her work, of course. There were still cryptids to be discovered and researched. Sometimes the world needed protection from the cryptids. Other times, the cryptids needed protection from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew's family and friends had rallied around her, of course. But after a while, it seemed they all started slowly drifting away. Her brother and Zon were always away, trying to thwart and capture Abbey Grey, who had become an established figure and leader in mercenary circles and the cryptid black market. Whatever affection that had existed between Abbey and Doyle had long since vanished, with nothing but stark hatred between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years ago, a lost Lemurian colony was found, and Fiskerton opted to go live with his own people, though he visits his human family from time to time. At the same time, Drew was able to successfully \"de-mutate\" Komodo, which allowed him to successfully return to his own kind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was now just Drew and Zak. Not that Drew minded. Zak was sixteen years old now, and had not \"filled out\" yet like his father, but Drew could see the potential there. Zak was a tall gangly teenager who was as tall as his mother, possessing the leanly muscled body of a very active young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew herself was still in good shape and, at thirty-nine, was often mistaken as a decade younger. Since her husband's death, she had let her hair grow out, so that it reached to the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Drew and Zak were alone all the time. The divide between them and the rest of the secret scientist community had disappeared after the Battle of the Cryptids. So both her and Zak had a whole community of scientists and their children to interact with. And with the exception of Komodo, Zak and Drew got to see the rest of their family on a regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Drew couldn't help feeling isolated more often than not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny for your thoughts,\" a British voice asked as an arm wrapped itself around Drew's shoulders. Drew momentarily smiled and leaned into the hugger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just woolgathering, when I need to be studying this new specimen,\" Drew told Miranda Grey, gesturing towards the winged monkey that had just arrived at the lab. The creature seemed benign, more interested in the mango it was eating than the two women talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded as she made a minute adjustment on her uniform. Three years ago, during the War of the Cryptids, Miranda had seen the errors of her ways in wanting to neutralize Zak, particularly when she discovered that \"neutralize\" meant \"kill\" to her colleagues. Miranda had rescued Zak at the risk of her own life, and had been very nearly killed alongside Doc and Van Rook at the final battle. This had elevated the younger woman from pariah to sister in the eyes of Drew Saturday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the 38 year old secret scientist was a full time resident at the Saturday residence, working alongside her now best friend Drew. She was more patient than the headstrong Drew, though nowhere near the calming influence that Doc had provided. There had even been one or two times Drew had had to calm Miranda down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miranda had first met Drew, she had been very proper, always wearing her hair up in a bun, as perhaps a contrast to her sister Abbey. Now, like Drew, Miranda wore her strawberry blonde hair down most of the time, and had also let it grow out to the small of her back. Miranda also wore a jumpsuit in the Saturday colors, and filled out as well as Drew did, with her narrow waist and the uniform snugness drawing attention to her fit form and prominent bust line (both Drew and Miranda wear a 34D bra).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is an unusual species,\" Miranda observed, looking at the winged monkey. \"One almost expects to hear a cackling voice in its presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too,\" Drew responded, getting a chuckle from the other woman. When the monkey looked up, then dismissed the two woman in favor of his fruit, both women laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did either woman realize it, but the monkey had begun to work its magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you think of treating ourselves to a spa weekend, next time your brother or Fiskerton comes home?\" Miranda said, her arm moving to snake around Drew's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew responded to the move by cuddling up to Miranda. \"I think that would be a marvelous idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, it's a date,\" Miranda answered, smiling and turning to Drew. Suddenly, both women found themselves face to face, with their faces inches apart. They just stare at each other for what seems like forever before</span></div></div>",

My wife, Megan, passed away only a couple months ago. Which left things really sad and awkward for me and my now 15 year old daughter, Carly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly is just like her mother, long brown hair, wears really cute glasses, relatively short in stature and very pretty overrall. Surprisingly I haven't had to deal with a whole lot of boys chasing after her, which I found strange considering how beautiful and smart she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't be prouder to have her as my daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same way, I surprisingly didn't meet any women after my wife passed. There were honestly no women that came that close for me. So I decided that if the right women fell into my lap then I would proceed but until then I would just raise my daughter as a single man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt bad that Carly and I didn't talk as much as we used to. It was like there was a great distance between me and my daughter. Sometimes I wish that things were more simple, and that it was easier to communicate with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that changed when my daughter shrunk down to five inches tall.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nWhere did he discover her shrunk?</b></span></div></div>",

She's only fifteen, for heaven's sake! And to be honest, I wouldn't want my daughter going to those places even when she became and adult an could make up her own mind about those sort of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, I've been doing a lot of work in the backyard, including putting in a pool. So through Tuesday, Carly and me will be putting on the final touches on the landscape. For the rest of the week, Carly and some of her girlfriends will have the backyard. No boys, though. As I said earlier, Carly has been keeping the boys at arm's length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of late, she's been doing the same to me.

He knows a little bit about everything, but he's very knowledgeable about things on the fringe, if that makes sense. He's not weird or anything, at least not behavior wise. And I guess I'm comfortable with him being as close to Carly as he is because he's gay. Not that he's stereotypical in his behavior or anything. He acts and dresses like what he is: an English professor at a nearby liberal arts college. He smokes a pipe, likes to drink his Scotch neat, and just happens to be gay and has an academic interest in the fringe areas of human knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carry Carly to my home office and set her down on my desk, then pick up my landline phone (yes, I am one of the few who still has one of those) and call Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then begin having one of the weirdest conversations with Al (or anyone, for that matter), that I've ever had in my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began by telling Al that my daughter has shrunken down to approximately half a foot in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl doesn't miss a beat.

He asks me if Carly's clothes shrank down with her, what time of the morning it occurred, location of the shrinking, things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly is listening intently to my end of the conversation, forgetting for a moment her state of undress. I make a point of not staring at Carly's body as her limbs relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of questions to me, Al says, \"I need to ask Carly some questions. And I need to actually see her, Can we set up a video chat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, Al,\" I say, then add, \"Give me a couple of minutes, so we can find something for Carly to wear.\" Carly belatedly remembers she's nude and covers herself up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I need to see her <i>au naturel</i> in her shrunken state, in order to identify and possibly cure her present state,\" Al explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explain to Carly that her Uncle Al wants to do a video chat with her, but that she'll need to be nude, and Carly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she also doesn't want to be stuck at half a foot in height either. So she reluctantly agrees to remain undressed for the video chat with my friend Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo give Al credit, his eyes only bugged out a little when he saw how diminutive Carly had become. He may have stuttered a little when he first started talking. But after that first second, he was all business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started asking questions to Carly while I fetched a ruler and a tape measure to get the measurements he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked Carly how tall she had been before being shrunken, and sharply admonished her not to \"nudge\" the numbers. Carly stated she was five foot two even, no fraction of an inch above or below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was just as strict in his instructions to me about getting Carly's new height. It was five and a half inches on the mark. Al frown at that announcement. When we tried to ask him about it, he waved us off, saying \"Let me get some more information first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked Carly her bra size, which she replied \"34D\" while her entire body seemed to glow red at that announcement. Carly wanted to use her hands to cover herself, but Al kept on asking questions and occasionally asking me to use the tape measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd try as I might, I could not help but gaze in wonder, admiration, and small amount of lust (no pun intended) at my daughter's nude body. Her hips were a little on the narrow side, but she had a firm butt and legs from an active lifestyle, as well as breasts that seemed to defy gravity, with pink nipples made hard by exposure to the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl had more embarrassing questions, such as was Carly normally hairless \"down there.\" Carly turned an even deeper red, saying she normally just trimmed for her conservative bathing suits, and hadn't trimmed in a couple of weeks, since we were in the latter stage of autumn. She then had to admit to being a virgin, with the only person she had fooled around with being her best friend Luci, and that they were \"only experimenting a little, and kept it above the waist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick note about Luci. Luci is actually LuCinda Gonzales, and she and Carly are best friends. Luci is the same age and size as Carly, and like Carly, Luci's hair reaches to the small of her back. Carly is fair skinned whose hair is light brown and wavy, while Luci has light olive skin and straight, shiny black hair. Luci spends a lot of time at our house, sleeping over almost every weekend, and one or two weeknights besides. From what I gather, Luci's homelife is strict and not always a happy one. I know she tends to wolf food down when she's over here, and I've learned what her favorite dishes are and try to make them for her. I think taking care of Luci makes mine and Carly's own lives a little happier. Luci tends to be very quiet around strangers, and has only very recently opened up around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, when Carly says she hasn't trimmed \"down there\" in a few weeks, I notice she's now hairless. And not just between her legs. All the hair on her body below her chin seems to have disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl then asks Carly, \"I want you to think about this very hard. Has something odd happened to you recently. Not bizarre odd, but just a little funny odd. Like someone gave you an early holiday card that had a slightly offbeat message on it, or someone brought a cake from an old and oddly tasting family recipe. Something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's little eyebrows furrowed as she considered the question, then answered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not obnoxiously so. Kathleen was just so full of life that it bubbled over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically at least, Kathleen was identical in build to Luci and Carli, save that she was very fair skinned, with bright, almost flaming red hair and green eyes that sparkled mischief. I suspect that Kathleen could have had boys circling around her all the time (and probably did at school), but she told me one time that she would have \"plenty of time for that later.\" For now, she had her studies, her afterschool activities, and her friends. Kathleen had especially taken Luci and Carly under her wings. I think Kathleen wasn't going to let herself fly romantically until her two baby birds were mended to her satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly explained that Kathleen had recently begun teaching herself Gaelic, which didn't surprise me.

I set her down on the counter and closed the drain of the sink before filling it up with warm water. As I waited for the water to fill up, I noticed her staring at me. She seemed to have calm down, but the thought of a sexy naked lady staring at me made me blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gr, curse my thoughts.</i> I thought to myself. I knew it was wrong of me to think of Carly that way. After all, she was my daughter. When the sink was filled up, I added a little bit of soap and swirled it around in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, climb in.\u201d I told her. She nodded and sat down next to the water, slowly climbing in. Once the water went just up to her breasts, she gave a sigh of relief. I smiled and gave her a little pet on the head. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be back in a couple of minutes.\u201d I said, wanting to be polite. As I started to turn away, I heard her panicked voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Please don\u2019t leave me alone!\u201d She yelled. I hesitated before turning back towards her. She gave me a sad look. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave. I\u2019ll be terrified without you.\u201d She said. I gave a sigh and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I won\u2019t leave.\u201d I told her. She smiled and sank into the water, enjoying the warmth. She popped back out and splashed me, causing me to chuckle. She giggled as well and started to rub herself clean. My thoughts started to wander once more, making me blush. It became even worse as she started to swim on her back, leaving her front exposed to my eyes. She soon noticed my embarrassed face, making her confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d She asked. I blushed even more, trying to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d I said, though that didn\u2019t convince her. She swam up to the edge and looked up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d She asked. I gave a sigh and looked at her, embarrassed of what I was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026you\u2019re so\u2026beautiful.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you?\u201d She said, not really understanding. Though she had been covering her breasts earlier, I assumed she had stopped thinking about it for her bath. She looked down, as if to try and figure out what the issue was. After a minute of silence, she looked back up at me. I was pretty sure she was piecing it together. \u201cOhh.\u201d She said, blushing. Carly sank into the water, keeping her head above. \u201cOh.\u201d She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, do you want me to leave?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No, please don\u2019t leave.\u201d She said. The room went silent as we went to our thoughts. I was afraid she was upset at me, I couldn\u2019t blame her. \u201cDo I\u2026remind you of mom?\u201d She asked. I blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, a little bit.\u201d I saw her smile a little which caught me off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026well for now how about this. Close your eyes and I\u2019ll finish up.\u201d She told me. I leaned in, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026mad at me?\u201d I asked. She shook her head, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later. For now though, please close your eyes. Oh, and set a tissue down on the counter too please.\u201d She instructed. I nodded and did as she asked. As my eyes were closed, I could hear splashing. I couldn\u2019t believe she wasn\u2019t mad though, I didn\u2019t understand it. \u201cOk, open them up now.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I opened my eyes and saw her standing on the counter. Her body was wrapped in the tissue I gave her. I put my hand down, letting her climb on. I lifted her up and stared at her. She could tell I didn\u2019t know what to do and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you get me some clothes my size please?\u201d She asked. I nodded and drained the water from the sink before exiting the bathroom. I took her up to the attic as I knew we had an old dollhouse. When I located it, I opened it up and set her in the bedroom. She gave me a smile, making me feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright now close it up please, and no peeking.\u201d She said. I did as she asked and turned around. I could hear her rummaging around and wondered what kind of outfit she would choose. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d I heard her say. I turned around and stared in awe. Carly wore soft blue pants and a green t-shirt. It was just like what her mother used to wear and I was pretty sure she knew that. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d She asked. I picked her up and gave her a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStunningly beautiful.\u201d I told her. She smiled and sat down in my hand. I asked her what she wanted to do.

As I started to raise her, I gave her a kiss on the forehead and moved her to my shoulder, allowing her to climb onto it. It still felt weird, having my daughter on my shoulder like this. When I knew she was ready, I left the attic and walked towards the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is so big now. I really am just a toy now.\u201d Carly said, noticing how high she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re still human, you\u2019ve just gotten smaller. I promise, I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d I said, trying to comfort her. She gave me a smile, filling me with warmth. I sat down on the couch and placed her on my lap. \u201cAlright sweetie, I need you to be quiet for a minute.\u201d I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up the phone and called work. I told them I wouldn\u2019t be able too come in today because I had to take care of my daughter, leaving out why I actually had to take care of her. Carly patiently waited in my lap, staying silent. After I finished talking to work, I called her school to let her know she wasn\u2019t coming in today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I talked to the school, I thought about her situation. I wasn\u2019t sure if she would ever be able to go back to school. Teenagers could be cruel and ruthless, and to find such a small girl, I feared kids wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take advantage of her. I shuddered, imagining Carly in a strange boy\u2019s hands. I finished the call and picked up my daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to go on a walk?\u201d I asked. She nodded, making me smile. I set her on my shoulder and headed outside. It was a beautiful day outside with the sun shining. I didn\u2019t see anybody at the moment which made me feel more comfortable. Carly was smiling as I walked, though I had a feeling something was on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, will I ever go back to school?\u201d She asked. I sighed, unsure of the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know sweetie. It may not be safe for you anymore. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I said. She started to hug my neck and gave me a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t go back to school. There are a couple of girls that\u2026well, kind of give me a hard time. If they found me now\u2026\u201d she started to say. I started to carefully pet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I promised that I would protect you, and I intend to keep my promise.\u201d I said causing her to smile. I continued to walk pushing my thoughts about school away. It was time to relax and have some fun. As I got to the sidewalk corner, I turned towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how about we\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

I ordered a burger with a side of Mac and cheese and a glass of chocolate milk. After she left, Carly poked her head out. She looked around before giving me a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did we come here?\u201d She asked. I gave her a soft smile, remembering all of the good times, including the one I remembered the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026is where I met your mother.\u201d I said. As the words left my mouth, it was like things quieted down. Carly said nothing, looking down. \u201cI remember it like it was yesterday. I had been having a bad day, even getting fired from my job. I came here to be alone. Your mother though, she seemed to detect my sadness. At the time, she was my waitress here and she ended up paying for my meal.\u201d I explained. Carly looked up, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe did that for free?\u201d She asked, causing me to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. I asked how I could pay her back. She gave me her phone number and said she wanted me hang out with her some time.\u201d As I finished my story, our waitress came back and gave us our food. I waited for her to leave before pulling Carly out. She stared in awe at the delicious looking food. \u201cThis is the exact meal I had that night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly turned around and motioned for me to get closer. When I didn\u2019t, she gave me a hug, causing me to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s make this night special then, just like before.\u201d She responded. I nodded and gave her a smile.

Do you think I could wash up?\u201d Carley asks me as she looks down at her miniature body with a bit of disgust. Its hard to notice but her hair is a little greasy and could use some freshening up. Smiling down at her, I get up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, anything you want,\u201d I tell her as I walk off to the bathroom again. I guess we both are a bit dirty but it\u2019s hard to notice the little things when my daughter is no taller than my finger. I place Carley by the sink and then pause as something suddenly occurs me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I\u2019m not exactly sure how we can wash you,\u201d I mutter. It is possible to leave her in the sink and let her wash up there, but that seems weird. Then again, this whole thing is bonkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a shower together, dad? No offense, but I could smell your boxers when I was standing on your knee and so gross,\u201d Carly made a face as she said this, sticking her tongue out. I chuckle at that and sigh. I guess it couldn\u2019t hurt and you can make sure your daughters safe while she\u2019s getting cleaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but be careful. I don\u2019t want you to start moving around and slipping out of my hand,\u201d I tell her before removing my top. My boxers come next and as I\u2019m standing there naked my daughter strips off everything. She\u2019s carful to fold up her clothing, it might be the only clothes in her size for a long time until we figure out how to help her. I take her once more into my hand, this time her body completely naked. As we step into the shower, I turn on the tap and warm, soothing water cascades down on both of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is nice,\u201d Carley says, finding a bit of normality in the shower even though she\u2019s taking it in her father\u2019s cupped hands. I look down at her as water droplets the size of her fist run down her naked body. This is the first time you notice your little girl is growing up. Her body is starting to mature with her once flat chest pushing out slightly and her hips widening. She was turning into a mature adult woman and that thought was both comforting and scary for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then just watch her, seeing her caress her naked body, Carley looked incredible at this size, like a fairy or some mythical creature. I kept looking, watching her tiny body move around my palm carefully. Without thinking, I tilt my hand to the side and she stumbles, falling to her hands and knees. Her little butt is pushed out right at me and I look at it wiggle around as she gets back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, be careful,\u201d she huffs, looking cuter then angry. \u201cYou tell me to not goof around and then move your hands around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I was just distracted. You look more like your mother every day,\u201d I admit, a stirring deep inside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarley blushes slightly but doesn\u2019t look embarrassed, she just grins and says, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But otherwise, it was like she was rescuing a baby bird who had fallen from a tree, not a human being who had been shrunk down to five inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter's bedroom was very neat, and had all the toys one would expect of a little girl in grade school to have. In the center of the room was a very, very nice dollhouse. Not a plastic one, but one of those wooden dollhouses that either someone put a lot of work into, or someone was paid to put a lot of work into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just about the right size to fit into one of the outfits that her dolls wear,\" Mary told me, as she set me down at the base of the house. She then paused, cocking her head to one side. \"Do you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened, and I could just barely make out somebody playing Wake Me Up by Avicii. As I paid closer attention, the song got louder and louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing I knew, I was sitting up in my own bed, the alarm function on my smartphone sounding, playing Wake Me Up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a few seconds to orient myself. I'd been having one very, very weird dream. And so realistic! It really felt like I was half a foot tall and that my stepfather had tossed me out the window after he tried to seduce me and then I seduced him or something weird like that. And throughout the entire dream, I didn't look anything like myself. I looked like Emma Watson, or how she looked in the Half Blood Prince. And in the dream, I was Arnold's biological daughter, not his stepdaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Arnold hasn't always treated me the best. Especially when my biological mother abandoned us both three years ago. Now I'm sixteen, and I take better care of the household then she ever thought about doing, all the while acing all my classes at high school, thank you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, weird dream or no weird dream, I can't stay in bed all day. It's Saturday, and me and Arnold have a lot of spring cleaning to do. So I need to go get a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happens, Carly's dream was rather prophetic, as she is about to be shrunk down by forces unknown to the height of six inches. Shall we follow the story from the viewpoint of Carly or her stepfather Arnold?</span></div></div>",

I'm an accounting and auditing expert for one of the big national firms, and my job is such that I can telecommute a lot, only having to go into the local branch once every week or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince I work from home a lot, I make sure my office is very comfortable. To that end, I have a very nice home gym attached to my office, and it gets put to good use, both by me and my stepdaughter Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly is heaven sent. She's smart, beautiful, strong willed and independent and, although she has all the sass you would expected from a sixteen year, she's a really good  kid. She doesn't socialize as much as she could or should. I think she still feels guilty her biological mother left us three years ago. Personally, I think I got the better end of that bargain. I got to keep Carly, who is one of those kids that makes you happy that you're a parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have liked to out and out adopt Carly when her mother left, but the laws in our area don't allow that unless one of the parents signs a waiver allowing you to do so. We had no idea where Carly's mother was, and her father was in a different country entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead, Carly sued for emancipation and got it, and I have custody of her. The first thing Carly did when she was emancipated was change her name to Carly Cover, as a sign that she was severing all ties with her nowhere to be found parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I said, Carly is beautiful. Myself, though I'm fit and trim, I'm just your basically boring white guy.

She had a killer body with large boobs, a curvy ass, and a beautiful face with long flowing dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also one of the top real estate agents in the city. She didn't need a man to take care of her, and she was making her own way even though her husband had left her to raise their thirteen year old son alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Jessica's son Tyler was her biggest problem. Tyler was lazy, messy, and didn't always do what he was told. She could often find him sneaking around jerking off to Playboy magazines, to which Jessica objected. Tyler found his mom annoying but he was impressed by how attractive she usually looked. In fact, Jessica could also catch Tyler peeking at her ass as she bent over one day last month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Jessica after got home from work, she put on her favorite light blue bathrobe and proceeded to lounge about the house, when suddenly something very strange happened. In what seemed like an instant, the beautiful mother found herself falling a great distance until she landed and found herself trapped in a sea of blue fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?! Where am I?\" Jessica then looked at herself and realized that she was totally naked. Jessica ran scared screaming while covering her boobs and vagina, until she found an opening but once she got out she realized the terrible truth. She was no longer the same six foot tall woman that she was but now she was a five inch tall naked doll. \"Oh no! I've shrunk! How did this happen? Women don't just shrink! This isn't natural! What am I going to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly booming foot steps thundered in the distance. Jessica recognized the whining voice of her teenage son, Tyler <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOOOOOOM!\" The voice roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nude lady knew her son was approaching and soon she saw who was her short thin little boy now stood as a Godzilla sized monster to her. Jessica was scared out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! My son is huge!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her giant son looked around for her, Jessica quickly ran away from her bathrobe and under her bed. She's amazed at how big her son is and how small she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\" Jessica thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the mini mom do in regards to Tyler? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Braskor, a musclebound orc, seeks to gain power so his tribesmen can advance in their technological prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's just one problem. The kingdom doesn't look kindly on ruffians or monsters and given the orcs' infamous history of plundering and pillaging that may not be easy. Especially when the orc war goddess Oboska demands that her children tear the lesser races to shreds and enslave them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that fact, Braskor plans to annihilate anyone who impedes his mission to make a technological prc military orcish state that values honor and valor. What awaits Braskor on his journey? Will he succeed or be a pawn to Oboska?</span></div></div>",
