            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The streets were packed with stragglers and civilians, dull and frumpy normal people to fill the pavement with their own lack of interest. Innovation, progress, invention and novelty, not a thing any of them could offer the all feared and nefarious Mob Boss of the Lucifer den, Gio Giovanni Lucifer. All of them went about their lives, comfortable in their own skin and careers as if not a thing ever bothered them, or would ever change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Well for some of them they'd soon find wouldn't hold true.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGio raised his crisp crystal glass up to his mouth and took in a refreshing sip of wine. He tapped his cane to his left on the knee of his Son-in-Law, Dante Lucifer and elbowed his top brass to his right, Mario Esposito, his burly muscle. They nodded and took the hint, along with Lucifer's own niece, Maria Marino, With her slick black suit, tied back blond hair and sharp features, she adjusted her glasses and shone the light forward, reflecting it towards four searching people, who took note of the light and started walking towards the outdoor cafe where Gio's troupe waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the four of them came upon the mysterious Gio, his large 6 foot stature repressed as he sat down leaning backwards, his bulky shaven hands signaling for them to come forward. He took off his shades and rubbed them against his hawaiian shirt, kicking his sandals slightly below his cream colored khaki pants. For an intimating all powerful Mob boss whose influence and name were known globally, he has a very unusual sense of humor. His three associates around him were dressed in sharp clean suits. The tallest of them, Maria lifted up a briefcase and placed it on the table. Gio smiled, he knew his newest 'Clients' would find some very interesting opportunities within the briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way through the streets and concrete, walking carefully around crowds of people and careless traffic, they now stood before the Crime Lord underneath the slight shade his restaurant offered them. They were still outdoors, but now the seclusion from the rabble would allow them to strike business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them\" being the four individuals complicit and resigned to come towards him. One of them, a man by the name of Stan Machlovitz had requested a miraculous favor granted for him, and now it was time to pay up. Two other younger adolescents, Sharon and John, were rather strapped at the moment and could use his unique, assistance, despite hearing that there would be a 'cost'. The fourth was Sarah Savitch, a nervous, slightly older conservatively dressed lady stood ready, having quite a history with these mobsters herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever there reasons for being there, Giovanni was delighted. There'd be plenty of time for jokes and greetings later, but for the particular moment, he was all business. Maria clicked open the briefcase behind him, and Giovanni raised out his glass. Taking one more sip, he asked outloud,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciao friends! Now than, who wants to go first?\"</span></div></div>",

He was a rather eccentric and worn out man himself, with his slightly dirties raggedy clothes, his weakly shaven beard and unkempt hair, it wasn't difficult to see he wasn't in the best of luck these days. He was rather frigid and dirty, looked like he hadn't bathed in a good while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll go first? Or I'll pick you first.\" The mob lord said, pointing his finger at him and sending him an intimating look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll..pick me?\" Stan said as Gio crossed his arms in disapproval. \"No, I'll choose first. I came here, I might as well be chosen. You can give me what I need right?\" Stan said as if pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, there there we'll get there. But you should know there are two things in this world a man's gotta learn. Obedience, and respect. Self respect is important. Builds confidence, gotta be headstrong. But respect for others goes hand and hand with obedience. Let's see if we can train in you some respect.\" Gio sternly lectured. He snapped his fingers, and his humble Niece snapped open the brief case, revealing a wide variety of assorted items inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me again, tell us all so we all know. Why do you want to go through with this?\" The Don inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I, well I need the money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all it's about? Is that all people are on about, just the money? Darn shameful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no I mean-\" Stan spoke up finally. \"I need to impress her..Silvia. We were in love, I mean I love her! I love her with all my heart and soul and truly want to be with her, but you see, right now she don't love me back. Well I'm sure she loves me plenty, but I've fallen under hard times, and she just cannot be with no beggar or pauper that cannot foot the bills or put bread on the table. I've tried my hardest at the studio, but my paintings just ain't selling no more. And jobs are hard to come by, so I just, I just need a little of that green stuff you know?\" Stan explained, rubbing his fingers suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni looked at his assistants, each one at a time. He gave a brisk smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Stan. And what are you willing to do to earn that money my good man?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything sir. I mean, well almost anything. No, just about anything! I'll dirty my hands and do what I gotta do if it means earning her love again! Don't care if the fatcats or dem Po-Leece wind me back in the slammer, it's gotta be done. No objections here, no exceptions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 3 visitors stood behind Stan and listened, taking in his situation. John wondered if his own resolve was that strong, but swallowed hard and watched patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni rested his hands on the table as if praying and looked his client sternly in the eye. \"I like you Stan, you're an honest guy. Understand love and all that, you've got spunk. I may have a job for you, and it may pay the bills and get your sweetcheeks back in the door. However, it's gonna cost you Stan. Are you ready to be a member of my family? Because those hands of yours, I tell you there gonna get mighty dirty this evening I ain't fibbing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no pause or hesitation. \"If it's what it takes to woo Silvia and make a living, just what I gotta do.\" Stan stepped forward with full confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like this guy. He'll do great.\" The Gio announced, shaking his hand. A strange blue glow of light emitted from his arm and transferred to Stan's own before fading out. Gio snapped his fingers again as Maria brought the suitcase forward and presented it to the client, who looked in awe at it's trove of antique wonders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the family.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the four visitors to Giovanni's presence stood before him, he waves his hand and enjoyed his drink. He had a pistol slightly visible out of one of his jean-pockets and at six feet tall, was a mammoth presence to them even sitting down and dressed so casually. Terrified at engaging the most dangerous man at the world and upsetting his meal at the slightest whisper, the four of them stood petrified and despite having approached him freely at his prior request, were unwilling to be the first participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Did you hear me, which one of you wants to go first? You all have things I'm sure you want, you need from me. I'm the man to get them to you, and I'm a very busy man at that. So what will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four just stared at each other. Stan stuttered something, but held his tongue before voicing himself and the four simply hesitated to step forward after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni took a bite of a burger on his plate and simply ignored them after that. Dante, his slick right hand man raised up his hat to get a better look at the four clients who were paralyzed in his presence. He tucked his collar slightly. Mario shifted his hand into his pockets, one of which held his gun in case anything went violent or confrontation. Maria merely stood immobile and emotionlessly, not invested in the awkward scene at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm..Man oh mama, these fried are so so crisp. Aunty Anna always does cook these to perfect.\" Giovanni said, wiping his mouth with a napkin as the four simply eyed him nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn raised his hand for a moment, but still at the last moment returned it and failed to speak up. Meanwhile, a small crowd had been gathering around the restaurant, with a few slight onlookers popping in themselves. Some had taken an interest in the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, enough of this than. If none of you are going to speak up, I'm simply going to enjoy my meal. Danny boy, Mario, Maria sweetie, go take these loafers to the back of the restaurant and have them do business while I enjoy eating. They clearly don't want to show me no respect or love, so teach them some. Maybe they'll get a word in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith slight protest, the three occupants took the four clients out back to deal with matters secondhand. Maria took her briefcase, but Giovanni had kept some items of his own, spinning around a gold encrusted ring as if it was a mere coin. He raised his eye, as some of the other guest seemed to take an interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you fellas?\"</span></div></div>",

Members come and go, and naturally numbers are thinned. However, this extraordinary boss has a capability for magic, and has found a way to remedy their lost numbers. By trading with people demands or calling in favors, they can strap a 'Cursed' item onto them and make them new Mafia members, willing or not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powers behind this magic are limitless! And what he uses them for is rather special, inducing a transformation on the victim that will soon change into a more useful form. Because Gio is a clever thug, he has a wide use for all sorts of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result can be anything he desires, male or female, younger or older, orientation, race, 'class', appearance g, mind, all changeable. He can turn a client into a little girl, or a buff adult. It might benefit them to be a <i>Femme Fatale</i> or run of the mill slick male grunt. They can change into an old lady, or a seemingly innocent teenager, there are no limitations, so long as it's physically permissible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catch is, regardless of their new form they will carry out his orders. Be it a robbery, con job, trailing, investigation or even murder, the mental changes will gradually take place so they cannot help but do it and see it as perfectly natural, even if they know themselves not to be in control. The form doesn't matter, they can become a young girl brainwashed into assassination, or an elderly person with no qualms about robbing and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are two other magical effects at play,reality altering magic which makes the world more natural for whatever state their in which changes memory and reality so people question it less (varying), and the second being slight mental changes which make the person more adjusted to their new form. These will never conflict with their new allegiances and job however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a person fulfills their job and does their time, they MAY be turned back, if only a slight chance. They might be rewarded or respected, but it's more likely Gio will keep them that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome basic guidelines about this interactive:<b><br>\r\n1.The story will revolve around the client's recruiting and slow change into a mafia member, as well as their life. Body and mind will change to meet Gio's needs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.The item itself can be anything, but is usually something small like a watch, pin, ID card or ring, mobile enough to be carried around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.Once the changes start they cannot be reversed from the Client unless Gio is persuaded, and mental affects can be fought for so long but the victim will always ultimately succumb<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.Changed clients will be obedient and subservient to Gio, and also respect or atleast acknowledge any other Mafia members as their own. Along with 1, they'll lose their morality and have no qualms about doing their job. They will also become much stronger, smarter and more naturally capable of doing it, even if they weren't before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.There should be some kind of intended goal or objective for the recruited to do, which they'll eventually be forced to carry out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.Recruited members, once sufficiently changed have the ability to change or recruit other people. After they *unwittingly* agree to it, Gio can give the final go ahead and start to 'Recruit' them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.Go light on swearing/crude violence/sexual content, keep it clean within reasonable limits<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.To elaborate on 7, things like murder, violence, or some cruelty may be shown but don't go all out gore or torture prone, the changes make the recruited treat it like a job or profession, but won't make them unbearably sadistic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.No spam, keep it classy and keep it fair. Respect others, use readable grammar and spellcheck, go with the flow, yata yata have fun with it. Also don't do several Chapters of only options, I hate that and you should too. Try to contribute please.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, who is ready to join the Mafia?</span></td>",
