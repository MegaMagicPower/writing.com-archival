The popular crowd likes to act like you don't even exist. That would be fine with you, if it weren't for the fact that you were head over heels in love with Chris Odaire the leader of the group. Chris had never been rude o you like the rest of his crowd but he never stopped their endless torture. Today was the last day before Christmas vacation and their was only one class left before you could go enjoy the season. Unfortunetly you couldn't get to your locker because the popular crowd was blocking it, all listening to Chris's rendition of all I want for Christmas. You can't help but swoon a little as you watch Chris sing, but he suddenly points to you while saying all he wants for Christmas is you. Your face goes red from embarrassment as the rest of the crowd now notices you and decides to shove you against a locker just as the bell rings for class to start. Your books and go all over the floor and instead of helping you retrieve them, everyone else just laughed and went to class. Now being alone, you open your locker and bend over to retrieve your books when you are blinded by a sudden flash of light.</span></div></div>",

Just then the floor starts to shake and you hear the loud booms of footsteps coming your way. Before you could find a place to hide, you see none other than Chris Odaire coming around the corner.

While trying to run backwards, you trip over what you assume is a wrinkle in the comforter and you fall backwards slightly over the edge. Luckily for you Chris has sharp reflexes and he catches you in the palm of his hand and places you back on the bed in front of him.

You hear him take in a shaky breath and say that he had no idea how it happened. He had been coming back to help you with your books and found you passed out ontop of your books. Lowering his hand back down to you, he says may I take a closer look at you Callie? You astonished that he knows your name you actually nod your head yes before you realize he wants you in his hand. His hand is as big as a truck with his fingers as wide as tree trunks. You attempt to climb into his palm but loose your grip and roll to the center. You can feel the heat from his hand envelop you as his hand moves up like an elevator bringing you up to eye level where you can now see his face. His oh so handsome face, you could get lost just staring into those deep blue eyes of his. You see a huge smile spread across his lips as he stares down at you and you see his enormous pearly whites for the first time. Suddenly afraid again you realize your dress has ridden up your thigh when you had rolled. No wonder he was smiling at you. You shift and pull your dress back into place. In the process, your fingers graze the palm underneath you. It's surprisingly soft yet firm. </span></div></div>",

You can't believe the expanse of his room, it seems like it would take days to walk from one end to another. With escape out of the question, you busy yourself exploring and becoming familiar with Chris's bed. You see a night stand right next to the bed that looks like you could possibly jump to if you had a running start but seeing that the only things on the night stand was a lamp and an alarm clock. Not seeing anything interesting, you continue your exploration of the bed. From the looks of it, Chris is absorbed in whatever book he is reading and is leaving you alone. Wanting to see what is on the other side of the bed but not wanting to walk all the way around Chris's form, you grab handfuls of his shirt and start to climb up onto his chest. Once you reach the top, you have a better vantage point to see the rest of the bed. The bed is enormous, but you can see that the other side is pushed up against the wall, thus leaving no need to explore that way. Turning to face Chris's face he still doesn't seem to notice your presence.</span></div></div>",

Who knows why he brought you home with him. Lost in thought, you walk further down his chest towards his abs. You notice his shirt has ridden up and you can see some of his smooth tan skin. In fact you can see the beginnings of what looks like his happy trail. Your mind begins to wander again, just thinking about rubbing your hands over his exposed skin. You are so caught up in your thoughts you don't even notice Chris put his book to the side and stare at you exploring until he speaks to you. It wasn't the words he said that startled you but the rumbling that went through his body as he spoke that threw you off balance, sending you face first onto his shirt covered abdomen. Apparently Chris is very ticklish on his abdomen because he goes into a fit of laughter tossing you off of him and back onto the bed with all of his laughter. </span></div></div>",

You feel his warm fingers wrap around you and bring you back to his chest, where his face is now visible and he is looking at you with the kindest smile on his face. Getting up the courage, you finally ask, why did you bring me here? How can you ask that he says. Surely you must know how much I've always cared for you. You are the sweetest girl I've ever met and couldn't help wanting to protect you when I found you in the hallway today. Not to mention your drop dead gorgeous. This caused your face to turn bright red in embarrassment. Surely Chris didn't mean all those nice things. He had so much more experience than you. You know for a fact that he has dated most of the popular girls in school. But the look on his face said that he was being sincere. So what do we do now you say.</span></div></div>",

Do you trust me he says. You don't know what to say, you want to trust him, but how can you? Meanwhile your head is nodding a yes. Close your eyes he says, and you comply. You can feel upward motion followed by feeling impossibly warm wind that could be none other than Chris's breath. Then suddenly your face is touched by warm soft skin, and you feel Chris's breath intesify on the top of your head, flowing down your back. Chris tells you to open your eyes.

Taking this as an invitation, Chris's fingers start to run all over your legs and then up your front to caress your still fully clothed boobs. He then lets his finger travel back down to between your thighs and increases the pressure as he rubs against your sex. You can't help but blush, it excites you so. Chris takes things farther, by gripping the hem of your dress between his thumb and forefinger, and lifts it over your head in a quick motion. He continues to caress you body, making your skin begin to hum in anticipation. He tells you to remove your bra and underwear unless you want them ripped off. Standing up, you make quick work of taking off your undergarments. Chris takes you by surprise and pushes you with his fingers to lay on our stomach on his palm as he caresses your now naked butt. You feel him lean over and kiss your rear end, but you can't see anything with your face in his palm. He then flips you back over and continues to caress our now naked breasts and pussy. You can feel yourself start I grow wet with anticipation. This brought of another blush to our face since you were still a virgin and didn't know what to do in this situation. </span></div></div>",

You then feel him start to tighten the edge of his lips on each individual breast and the feeling was incredible. Now more relaxed that he knew what he was doing and wouldn't hurt you, you had no fear when his large red tongue slid out from behind his lips and began to trace around your boobs and thickly your now erect nipples. You thought things couldn't get any better, until his tongue started to travel south. Afraid of having it inside you, you quickly close your legs tightly. Sensing your hesitation, Chris pulls his head up to asses the situation. Come on he says, let me in. I promise it will feel good. I'll be gentle I promise. You don't open your legs back up for him, but you at least let your body go limp to not fully block him. Chris's tongue returns, this time spreading your legs wide open with ease.

In the mean time it appears that the entire class including Cadence has made it to the front of the class. You lay your purse down on its side to make it easier for everyone to climb in. They seem to balk at this, not wanting to be carried around in a purse. Just then the bell rings and you here class doors banging open as students start to leave. In one quick motion, you scoop as many of your classmates into your purse. They start to scream but you keep scooping until Chris is the only one not in your purse but it literally can't hold any more students. Just then the door opens and some of the other popular kids onto in this class come in looking for their friends. You quickly snatch Chris up in your hand and drop him into your bra.

While it is fair to mention that roses can be more colours than just red, this particular teenager makes sure that there is absolutely no link between herself and the fragile, delicate flower her name may suggest. <br>\n<br>\nMostly out of spite for her parents giving her such an incongruent name, she tries to come off as edgy as possible, wearing a lot of stark clothing, things with spikes on them, dying her natural <i>auburn</i> - not red - hair varying colours, including black, blue, and even lime green once, and she listens to a lot of grunge and heavy metal music. <br>\n<br>\nSo it's safe to say that Rose doesn't have many friends. Some respect her for who she is, an occasionally see her softer, more compassionate side, where she reveals herself as a closet nerd who loves manga and RPG video games, but most tend to leave her a wide berth, as that just makes life easier for both parties.<br>\n<br>\nAnyway, on with her story...<br>\n<br>\n''Almost... there...'' Rose groans into her notebook as the clock ticks painfully slow. It seems as though an hour takes five hours when you're bored. Or at least that's how Rose sees it. It's a friday afternoon, and like most schoolkids on a friday afternoon, she's bored out of her wits, and just waiting for things to be <i>over!</i><br>\n<br>\nTick...<br>\n<br>\nTick...<br>\n<br>\nTock...<br>\n<br>\nTick...<br>\n<br>\nThe seconds crunch by, so slowly that several students look as though they're ready to burst a vein when, at long last;<br>\n<br>\n'Ringalingaling!'<br>\n<br>\n''Alright, class dis-'' The teacher calls, only to be blown over by a whirlwind of students out the door, ''...missed.''<br>\n<br>\nAmong the swarm of students is Rose, however she's suddenly not feeling so great. Slowing down behind the crowds, she shuffles to a stop and presses her hands against her stomach, where a gut busting pain is searing through it like a circular saw she's sure she hasn't ingested!<br>\n<br>\n''God... damn!'' she gasps, falling to one knee and gasping for breath. Her vision starts to blur... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fifteen year old Tawnee Wiliams was a dreamer. Not a fantasizer. A dreamer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams were of a softer, brighter world where things were prettier and happier. There were some romantic and sexual elements to her dreams, but those were both fuzzy, and Tawnee was a virgin with no romantic experience and very little passive knowledge about sex, and no active knowledge at all/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawnee came from a broken home with five siblings, each with a different father, and a mother whose various habits and interests made her indifferent to what happened in the lives of her children, except for the subsidies she received for her children each month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo dark haired Tawnee, the skinny little fifteen year old girl in raggedy clothes went to school every day, ignored by teachers and her fellow students alike, and retreated into her dreams every chance she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawnee knew who Rose was, of course. Everyone knew who Rose was. She was the badass senior who everyone avoided. Even the teachers seemed to go out of their way not to antagonize Rose. Secretly, Tawnee wished she was more like Rose, and not just a little mouse of a girl who was afraid of her own shadow. Of course, when Tawnee worked Rose into her dreams, Rose didn't look quite like Rose. Rose was still strong and badass, but Rose's appearance and language wasn't quite as jarring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawnee wasn't exactly stalking Rose that day. Not exactly. She was just sort of in the same hall at the same time. I mean, school was getting out, and she had to catch the bus. So of course she and Rose would be in the same hall. And the fact that Tawnee's last class of the day was two corridors over from Rose's didn't mean anything. It was still a coincidence that they were in the same corridor when Rose went down on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rose did hit the floor, Tawnee's first instinct was to rush to help her. There was no one else left in the corridor, after all. Even the teachers had left as fast as possible at the last bell. But something held Tawnee back. Meeting and becoming best friends with Rose was a very nice dream, but Tawnee had no idea how to interact with real life Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Rose just disappeared, like she had gone up in invisible smoke after some kind of flameless spontaneous combustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Tawnee, it was like she was watching another person control her body. She heard herself yelling \"Are you okay?\" before running over to the pile of clothes. Just as she got there, she saw something she couldn't believe was true. A six inch nude version of Rose came crawling out of her pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawnee didn't know why she didn't go screaming down the hall in terror. What she was seeing didn't happen in real life. It didn't even happen in dreams. And it certainly didn't happen in the cute little movies she downloaded from the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawnee went to her knees and heard herself saying, \"What happened?\" And she reached out to touch tiny Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Tawnee touched Rose, there was an explosion of light in Tawnee's eyes. It was a multicolored light, and there was sweet music accompanying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew, Tawnee was climbing out of her own clothes, also only six inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it wasn't Tawnee who climbed out of her clothes. And it wasn't a six inch nude Rose who was facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTawnee had had a rough life. During the summer, meals were sporadic and unpredictable. During school, she got a free lunch and breakfast, while dinner and meals on the weekend were unpredictable. So Tawnee's skin, skinny build and blemished skin were the natural byproduct of such a \"regime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's appearance, too, was a product of her lifestyle, though at least in Rose's case at least her lifestyle choice was voluntary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the shrunken Rose and Tawnee who stared at each other were the product of good diets and plenty of rest. Rose had always been big chested, but her body was firm and toned. Tawnee was big bosomed now as well, with the same taut, firm body. Both had long hair, clean and healthy, that reached down to the small of their back. To Rose's disgust, her hair was it's natural auburn color. And not only had Rose lost the edgy hairstyle she liked to sport, all the tattoos and piercings on her body had disappeared as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fu---- fu--- fu---?\" Rose shook her head, staring down cross eyed at her nose. Try as she could, she found her mouth refused to form any of many curse words that were the mainstay of her vocabulary. After a few second , she gave up and heard herself using language she hadn't used since elementary school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck did you do to me?\" Rose asked. There was a certain five letter word Rose wanted to end that question with, but her brain refused to even think the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tawnee had a chance to formulate an answer, a male's voice from above asked, \"Well, well, what do we have here?\" Both girls looked up in time to see two male hands reaching down towards them.</span></div></div>",

Flinching slightly as a large hand wrapped around her waist, she already lamented her lack of clothing. Next thing she knew, Rose was pressed into the younger girl's chest, as the fifteen year old dashed down hallways and out of the school grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's things remained in a pile on the floor; something she was less than ecstatic about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards...</span></div></div>",

He has a few close friends but that is it. Jake isn't that intelligent but he dose manage to pass all his classes. He isn't muscular but does have an avarge build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a normal school day and Jake was heading to class. It was the last period of the day and Jake couldn't be happier. School was almost finished for the day. Jake doesn't like school much but he does his best to get through the day. Jake walked into the class and it wasn't that full. Most students at his school don't usually turn up to last period. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way through class Jake started to feel strange. His head was pounding and he had a strange feeling in his stomach. Not like he was going to throw up but like someone was punching him in the stomach over and over. Jake stood up and ran over to the teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I go to the bathroom?\" Jake asked. \"I don't feel to well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quick.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake runs to the bathroom and his headache was getting worse and he wasn't able to see straight. He tripped knocking himself out cold on the concrete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake woke up later and he felt fine. His headache was gone and his stomach felt fine. But something wasn't right, something was covering him and he didn't know what it was. Jake stood up and threw the giant fabric off him. He looked at it and realized that it was his school shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Jake said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself and saw that he was naked. He looked around and saw that everything was huge. He had no clue how this happened but he knew that he was tiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how small? </span></div></div>",

Classes are still running, should I wait out in the open or run into a classroom and find someone to help me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know but it could be worse.\" I heard a voice say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around and saw two giants walking my way. They were too distracted with each other to notice me. They were two girls who looked like they were a few years younger. I was paralyzed with fear, I couldn't move. The two giants stepped over me and carried on walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly stood up and looked at the giants walking away. I couldn't believe how huge they were. They could've crushed me without realising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over to my left and saw a giant door next to me. I looked up and saw the sign to the girl's bathroom. I had to go into the bathroom and find help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally I wouldn't go into the female bathroom but this was serious. In needed help from someone larger than me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over to the door and grabbed the edge of the door. The door was open enough for me to grab onto the door. I used all my strength to pull the door open and quickly jumped in before the door closed behind me. I stumbled and landed on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell.\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the floor was wet. I heard some dripping coming from above. I looked up and saw the tap dripping. The sink was over flowing with the water slowly falling to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over at the stalls and saw two pair of legs. One of them should be able to help me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stall should I go to? </span></div></div>",

I look up to try see who it was but their breasts are in the way. I fall back on my ass in fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches down and picks up my uniform. She tosses my uniform to the side and places Ber hands on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they streaking?\" She cries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl bends down and I manage to see her face. It is Kristen. She is is a girl who was in a few of my classes. I have talked to her a few times and admitly have a crush on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen picks up my clothes and places them in a pile. I am sitting on my ass between Kristen's feet and I am terrified. Kristen looks down and stops me. My stomach drops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen reaches down and wraps her giant fingers around me. I shiver as her soft skin makes contact with bare skin. She raises me in the air and stands up. She brings me to her billboard sized face and gives me a soft smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy.\" She says softy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing as I am paralyzed with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" She asks. \"Are you even real?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-y-y-y-yes.\" I stutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" She says. \"I mean that's terrible, I mean it's good your real but...

During the rest of the day Kristen went to her class and talked to her friends. After that she went on the bus. I was sure that she would take me out and show me to people on the bus and luckily for sake she didn't. The bus ride home was feeling very long. Sometimes Kristen would take out her phone then put of back in her pocket pressing me against it but that's all that happened during the bus ride.  As the bus came to a stop Kristen jumps up from her seat and leaves the bus. I hear her walk down a long road then open a door. She must be home. I hear Kristen walk up some steps and close a door. She unzips her pocket and wraps her giant fingers around me. She pulls me out of her pocket and I am blinded by the light. It had been a while since I had seen light. I look up at the giantess and she is smiling down at me. She places me on her desk and I fall back on my ass because of the lose of balance. Kristen giggles and she drops her bag on the floor. I look around and see all the crap that is on her desk. Papers, books, cords pencils, pens and a heap of other things. She pulls the chair out from her desk and sits down on it. I stare up at her with my mouth dry, I still couldn't believe how huge she was compared to me. I wrap my arms around my legs covering my penis from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's you name little guy?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know who I am?\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I know?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen leans right in and takes a good look at me. Her nose is touching my knees and I can feel her warm breath on me. I start to go hard so I pull my legs closer to me to hide it from her. I look at her and smile. I can see every little detail on her giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I remember.\" Kristen says as she pulls back. \"Your names Jake right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't remember you straight away, its that your so tiny I can't really see your face.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get so small?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I say. \"I started to feel strange so I headed to the bathroom but ended up passing out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\" She says. \"Were you exposed to any kind of radiation?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" I chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what else can it be?\" Kristen asks. \"Did someone drug you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have remembered that.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probley.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you drug me?\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No.\" Kristen says. \"Why would I drug you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" I say. \"You could have had your reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had a drug to shrink someone you wouldn't be the person I would try it on?\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would it be?\" I say. \"Your boyfriend so you can have a boy toy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had a boyfriend I would.\" She giggles. \"Keep him all to myself and let no one else have him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up at Kristen and smile. We both sit in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kristen,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For not treating me like a toy.\" I say. Most people who would find me at this size would want to use me as a toy or personal doll.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome.\" She says. \"I was tempted for a minute though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you?\" I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I like helping tiny creatures.\" Kristen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I say. \"It means a lot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to take you home?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing. Thoughts go though my head about all the things that could happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to?\" She asks again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" I sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you don't know,\" Kristen says. \"Won't your parents be worried.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents aren't like that.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you parents they will miss you.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my parents.\" I say. \"They hardly pay any attention to me as it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they do.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I spent the entire holidays on a camp I didn't even want to go on only to have my parents not pick me up at the bus stop. I walked home and saw that my brother's birthday party was happening. What happened to me? Well I was sent to my room form the rest of the night because I missed his birthday.\" I say as I burst into tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry.\" Kristen says as she places her giant finger on my back and starts to rub it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if you do give me to my parents,\" I say. \"What will they do to me? Put me in a jar? Give me to my brother? Be a dogs few toy? Sell me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cried more and placed my head on my knees. Kristen placed her thumb on my head and rubs it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Kristen says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up and see that she is holding a tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I say as I grab the tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can look after you of you want?\" Kristen says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" I say as I wipe my face with the tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep you safe, I'll feed you, I'll play with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making it sound like you want me as you pet.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean,\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at her and think. What other option do I have? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay.\" She says. \"But don't worry you'll be safe with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to do some homework,\" Kristen says. \"Could you help me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chemistry.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I know nothing about chemistry.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen reaches into her school bag and pulls out her books. She lays them next to me and opens it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be too long, its only one page.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit there and stare up a Kristen. I can't believe my crush is looking after me. I sigh knowing that everything is going to be okay. Kristen is keeping me safe and that's all I ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She is in her school uniform. Kristen reaches for me and wraps her giant fingers around me. She brings me to her billboard sized face. I look down and see that she is unbuttoning her shirt. I see the top of her breasts and she starts lowering down. She places my feet between her breasts and slides me down. I slide down until my head is poking out the top. Her breasts press against me enough to hold me up. Kristen's breasts are nice and warm. I start to go hard and my erection rubs against her breast. Kristen buttons her shirt up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you in there little guy?\" Kristen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to meet up with Jade before school.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't want to but please do this for me.\" She says. \"If you do you can spend more time between my breasts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Jake.\" Kristen says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen throws her bag on her back and heads off. I can't see a thing but guess that she is heading to the bus stop. After a while I hear a bus pull up and Kristen walks on. As soon as Kristen gets on the bus I can hear kids screaming and talking. I feel Kristen sit down and I rest my head on her breast. After a while the bus comes to a stop and Kristen hops off the bus. I can feel Kristen walk into school. I can hear Kristen talk to someone. I assume it is Jade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see him?\" They ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Kristen says. \"Just let me get him out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen unbuttons her shirt and light floods in.

I am being pressed on her phone and get tangled up in her head phones. I try to move but end up making it worse. I feel Jade walk off. After a few minutes of walking Jade enters a classroom and I can feel Jade sit down. She reaches into her pocket and takes me out. She dumps me of the desk and I am still tangled in the head phones. Jade giggles and pulls me out of the tangled head phones. I sit there in fear and stare up at the giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to have to be quiet little guy,\" Jade says. \"You don't want to draw attention to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" I sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade!\" Someone yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jade says as she looks up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay attention.\" They say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Jade says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade looks at the front of the class and pays attention to the teacher. Jade places her giant finger on my chest and begins to pat me like I was a pet. Jade smiles as she places her finger on my crotch. Jade shifts her attention to her school bag and grabs her maths book out. She places it on the desk and dumps me on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look ridiculous in those clothes.\" Jade says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade tugs at my shirt and rips it off my body. Tears roll down my cheeks from the pain. She does the same to my shorts and places the clothes next to me. I pick them up and look at it. It is torn up. I look back at Jade and she is smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your penis is cute.\" Jade whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cover my penis with my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cover it.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade pushes my hands off my penis and places her giant finger on my penis and begins to rub.

Jade pinches my penis with her thumb and fore finger and begins to pump up and down. I lie there balling my eyes out. Jade begins to jerk me off faster and I and about to cum. I cry as loud as I can and orgasm on her fingers. Jade smiles and licks up my cum from her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty.\" Jade says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lie on my side balling my eyes out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up,\" Jade says. \"I know you enjoyed that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing. I lie on my back and look up at the roof. I can't believe I was raped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the bell ran and Jade wraps her giant fingers around me.

I look straight a head and see Emma's black panties. Emma places her finger on my head and begins to stroke my hair. I look up and see that Emma is smiling down at me. After a few minutes Emma brings me up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so cute.\" Emma says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Jade says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma opens her hands and lays me on her open palm.

I start to shake. Jade lowers me down to her waist and opens her waistband. I try to struggle but Jade tips her hand. I tumble down and land on her panties. She lets go of her waistband and I am forced on her pussy. I feel Jade shiver. I manage to pull myself to her thy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss can I go to the bathroom?\" Jade says standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach drops. I know what she is going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quick.\" They say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade runs as fast as she can to the bathroom. It doesn't take too long for Jade to get to the bathroom. Jade runs into the stall and takes her skirt and panties off. I am still stuck to her thy but Jade peels me off. She places me in front of her pussy and then forces me in. I try to scream but it's useless. Jade uses me a a dildo and forces me in and out. Jade moans and pumps me faster. I try to scream but her juices full my lungs. She screams out and orgasms. She leaves me in there and catches her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jade says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade pulls me out of her pussy and holds me up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears roll down my cheeks and I burst into tears. Jade pulls her panties and skirt up. She steps out of the stall and dumps me in the sink. She turns the tap on and cold water forces on me pinning me at the bottom of the sink. Jade turns the tap of and I spit the water out of my lungs. She lifts me out of the sink and holds me under the hand dryer. It turns on and the heat was powerful. I think it's cooking me. Jade pulls me away and holds me up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good toy.\" Jade says. \"Perhaps I'll.....</span></div></div>",

I put the black shorts on and turn around. Kristen had her shirt off and I can see her beautiful breasts. I smile. Kristen puts on a shirt covering her breasts. She slides off her skirt and I can see her blue panties covering her ass. I couldn't help but smile. Kristen put on some shorts that came up to her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate wearing that skirt.\" Kristen says. \"So tell me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen sits down at the desk and smiles down at me. I sigh and look up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She raped me.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kristen says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ripped the clothes off my body and played with my penis,\" I say. \"I tried to force her off but she threatened to kill me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then later she forced Emma to give me a blow job.\" I say. \"Emma refused so Jade shoved me in her vagina and used me as a dildo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure your talking about Jade?\" Kristen asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am,\" I cry. \"She used me as a sex doll.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit down and burst into tears. Kristen cups her hands around me and brings me to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Jake.\" She whispers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places her finger on my back and begins to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you don't have to see her again.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" I say. \"I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have to be sorry about?\" Kristen says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for dragging you into this mess.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" She says. \"I'm just glad your safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen places her lips on my head and gives me a kiss. I look up and smile at her. She smiles back and keeps rubbing my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your day?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine,\" Kristen sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't sound like it was.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found out I have a lot of tests coming up.\" She says. \"Pretty much every subject and is not even big tests, its end of topic shit and it's pointless. We haven't done too much on the topics and they expect us to have exams on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At lest I don't have to do any of this.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lucky son of a bitch,\" She says. \"I can make you do them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good,\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure,\" She giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to think twice on that,\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry?\" Kristen asks. \"I'm Hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am.\" I say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go and get us some food.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen places me on her desk and walks out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the door opened and it was...</span></div></div>",

She is carrying folded clothes and she is walking my way. My stomach drops and I quickly fall on my back. I pull the blanket up to my chest and remail still. I can feel the draw under me open.

She had no idea how to feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler zipped up her pocket and walked out of the bathroom with a huge smile on her face. Em gave her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you so happy about?' Em asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Tyler said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your smiling over nothing?\" Em said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I be happy on this wonderful today?\" Tyler asked as she placed her hands on Em's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a shit day like this? No way.\" Em said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Tyler laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler and Em walked off laughing and talking. Meanwhile in Tyler's pocket Katie was alone and cold. She wrapped her arms around her naked breasts and started to shiver. Katie was pressed against Tyler's phone with not much space to move around. Katie let her hair dangle in front of her face. Katie had no idea how to feel at the moment. She was terrified being four inches tall but when Tyler found her she was nice to her. Katie ran her hands up and down her sides trying to calm herself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang sometime later and Tyler walked into her classroom. She sat down at one of the desks and adjusted herself so she wouldn't crush Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon class.\" The teacher said walking into the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler reached into her pocket. Katie started to panic as she saw the giant tree trunk fingers wrap around her. Katie closed her eyes and waited to be lifted out of the pocket. Nothing happened. Katie opened her eyes as saw that she was still in the pocket with Tyler's fingers around her. Her fingers felt warm of her naked body. Tyler placed her tumb on Katie head and began to stroke it. Katie began to relax, it felt soothing to her. Katie closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed and Katie woke still in Tyler's pocket. Kate rubbed her head and took a deep breath. She could feel Tyler laughing and talking with her friends. Katie sighed and relaxed.

She only had a few minutes left until class started, but she couldn't finish her make-up in a rush! It was the first day back from winter break after all. After a few more moments, she deemed herself good enough and checked herself out in the bathroom mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer short blonde hair hung just above her shoulders, complementing her blonde eyes. You could call her a bit of a stereotypical popular girl in appearance, always wearing flashy clothes that showed off her nice curves. Plus there was the fact that she was a cheerleader, a blonde, and a senior. But having a single conversation with her would prove that she is actually a kind and intelligent girl. However there were times she could be a bit conceded...kinda like when she smiles at her own reflection until she's late for class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second bell went off, signaling that class had already started. A second later another girl pushed open the door, grabbed Brittany's hand, and was already leading her down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Brit, just because we're getting back from break doesn't mean you be late! Ms. Morrison might actually give you a detention at this rate, and she never gives those out!\" The one saying this was her best friend, Emily. It was a bit comical to see the dark haired girl pulling someone a foot taller than her by her hand. Her blue eyes shot back to her friend, waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Em. Debbie will understand that this kind of pretty takes time!\" she exclaimed. Emily let out a low grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been best friends since elementary school, even after their interests split. While Brittany was outgoing and spent time in a large group of friends, Emily was more the shy type that only hung out with one person at a time. Outside of school they always made sure to have quality time together without anyone else. There seemed to be a faint blush on her face as she pulled Brittany's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the door to their first period, they were greeted by the pouting face of Pr. Deborah Morrison. The prodigal genius that cleared her Ivy League school at the age of 13, gained her masters at 17, and was now teaching Brittany's class at 19. She was trying to gain some teaching experience before moving on to a university. Always trying to look older than her students, her long brown hair was held back by a hairband and fake glasses hung on her face. She was wearing a beige blazer and matching business skirt. Genius or not, she was pretty immature. After talking with her alone, she had found the Professor to be a pretty normal teenager with common interests. They had gossiped many times when the other students were away. Once she graduated, she would likely hang out with the teacher outside of a school setting. It always made Brittany a little resentful that someone a year older than her was her teacher, but it was also pretty interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was clear to both of you before the break that I wouldn't put up with any more late entries...\" she growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah c'mon Deb! Cut a girl a little slack\" Brittany taunted. Before the young teacher could retort, a loud gurgle shot through the room as Brittany began to clutch her stomach. Pain was shooting through her insides like wild fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolting for the door, the only thing she could do was yell \"NURSE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off at full speed down the hall, her vision started to darken. Her body felt heavier before she finally collapsed. Just as everything faded into black, she could have sworn that she heard footsteps coming in her direction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany shot up while hyperventilating. The events that had happened before felt like they had only happened a moment ago, but she soon realized that the pain was gone. But then again, so were her clothes. Her arms snapped around her sensitive areas, afraid of some pervert that could spring on her. But something was even more off. Looking around her dark environment, she could only smell leather. Also, looking around her were miscellaneous items scaled up to a giant size. She had shrunk! Comparing herself to a tube of lipstick, she deduced she should be around 3 inches tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, light poured into Brittany's purse prison as her captor's face filled the sky above her. As her eyes adjusted to the light, she made out that it was...</span></div></div>",

The two of them had been chosen to stay behind to clean up the drama room that had been left in a mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Chloe packed up the class in silence. The only sound that was being made was the movents of the objects. The two sixteen year olds smiled at each other and picked up the costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's been going on with you?\" Chloe asked trying to make conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" James said. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much either,\" Chloe said as tried to pick up a box. \"Cloud you please give me a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" James smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames walked over to the box and picked it up as if there was nothing in there. Chloe was surprised. To her the box felt like it had bricks in it. James threw it on the top shelf and carried on packing up a few of the costumes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are strong.\" Chloe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" James smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you work out?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" James said sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell if James had any muscle or not. Their school uniform was large and very bagy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the first time we talked to each other?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think so,\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Chloe sighed as she threw a dress on the floor. \"We're in three classes together and we pretty much see each other everyday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's because your with your group of friends and I'm just the shy kid that everyone ignores and forgets.\"  James sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you,\" Chloe smiled. \"And from what I remember from the small talk we had you were a nice guy. Do you have friends you talk to our are you the the stereotypical shy guy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have friends.\" James laughed. \"I'm just shy around people I don't really know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad thing,\" Chloe said. \"Trust me I can relate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call bull shit on that.\" James laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I can be very shy around new people.\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every class I see you in you are talking to someone new.\" James laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay let me explain,\" Chloe smiled. \"I find it hard to open up to people. I do talk a lot of people but I don't really tell them anything personal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you haven't told anyone anything personal about you?\" James asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few close friends I talk to about that but not anyone else.\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even your boyfriend?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a boyfriend.\" Chloe sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" James said. \"I thought you had a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you think I had a boyfriend?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\" James said sheepishly. \"You're always out their talking to people and your really pretty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm pretty?\" Chloe blushed curling her long blond hair with her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah,\" James blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks James,\" Chloe smiled. \"Could you help me with this box?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames walked over to the box and gripped the sides. James lifted the box and stumbled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is heavy.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be if you're struggling.\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames smiled and threw the box on the shelf. As the box dropped on the shelf it landed on another box with some sort of spray in it. The pressure sprayed the liquid all over James and Chloe. Chloe tried to cover her face with her hamds. James grabbed the box and threw it off the shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" James asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine.\" Chloe said wiping her face. \"What is that stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames opened the box to see what it was but to his surprise nothing was in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is in here.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames pulled the box off the shelf and showed it to Chloe. Chloe was stunned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what sprayed us?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames threw the box behind him and searched the shelves. Chloe picked up one of the dresses and used it to clean herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James.\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling a bit......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe trailed off and passed out. James turned around and caught Chloe before she hit the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got you.\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames lowered Chloe to the ground. James started to feel strange as well. His body started to shake and he fell to the ground next to Chloe. James passed out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes James woke up with a pounding headache. The first thing he saw was Chloe lying in the same spot as before. He sat up and rubbed his head. James looked around the room and realized something was wrong. Everything was huge compared to him. The spray somehow shrunk the two to the size of Barbie dolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" James cried. \"What the fuck?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames turned around and grabbed Chloe's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe wake up,\" James yelled. \"Wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chloe said half asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe opened her eyes and saw James with a scared look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Chloe asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow that spry must have shrunk us.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames said nothing and looked around the room. Chloe sighed and looked around. Here heart sank as she realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What? What?\" Chloe panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe it's going to be okay.\" James said wrapping her arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe placed her head on James's shoulder and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not going to be okay.\" Chloe sobbed. \"We're dolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" James said as tears rolled down her cheeks. \"But we can find someone who can help us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone in there?\" They called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe looked at James with a horrified look. Chloe wrapped her arms around James and squeezed as tight as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was at the door?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James and Chloe froze as they heard the door slowly open. The door opened and in strolled a large cart rolled in. They looked up and saw a giant cleaning lady behind the cart. She had gray hair, had a lot of wrinkles and was wearing a dark blue shirt. She looked like a stereotypical cleaning lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess no one's here.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cleaning lady sorted through her trolley and didn't notice the tiny couple on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to hide.\" Chloe said without taking her eyes of the giant woman. \"There is no way I want her to find us, I've seen how she treats other students.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where should we hide?\" James asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Chloe quickly scanned the room. On the wall behind them was a table in a open and a lot of boxes surrounding them with no place to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go under the stage.\" James said. \"We can hide right at the back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Chloe said. \"Let's quickly go before the cleaning lady turns back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames helped Chloe up with out taking their eyes off the giant lady. Chloe shifted her attention to James and gave him a nervous look. She wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. Chloe held James's hand and the two headed to the stage. James was focused on the stage while Chloe had her eyes locked on the cleaning lady. She couldn't believe how huge she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Chloe said without taking her eyes off the lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus on the stage.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" She said looking at the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heard the lady's legs crack as she stood up and move a few of the bottles. Their hearts sank and they bolted to the stage. When the lady stood up she knocked over a bottle. It was heading to James and Chloe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?\" The Lady said looking back down in the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Chloe didn't hear her. Chloe and James weren't too far from the stage. James heard something coming their way. He looked to their right and saw the giant bottle heading towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames looked in front of them and saw that they might not make it. They might get crushed by the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Chloe.\" James said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shoved Chloe forward. She was tossed a fair way, far enough from the bottle. Chloe tumbled to the ground. James ended up falling over from  the amount of force throwing him off balance. Chloe turned around and saw the giant bottle heading towards them. James tried to stand up but the bottle rolled over James's foot. James bit his bottom lip. He tried his best not to yell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James,\" Chloe panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and ran to James. James stood up and tried to walk. He was in to much pain. Chloe grabbed James's arm and put of over her shoulder. Chloe helped James over to the stage. Lucky for them they didn't have far to go. They made it to the stage and walked under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage was huge. It was half a meter off the ground and had no front. It was very dark under the stage and you were unable to see much without more light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Chloe walked under the stage until they were in the dark. Chloe helped James down and she sat down beside him. They waited for the giant to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks form the save.\" Chloe said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome,\" James said. \"Thanks for helping me under the stage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome,\" Chloe said. \"Let me look at your foot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe places her hand on James's foot. James let out a small cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a baby,\" Chloe laughed. \"It's only bruised.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" James asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure.\" Chloe smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames gave Chloe a smile. Chloe sat down beside James and they waited for the giant cleaning lady to leave. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a warm summer morning and Olivia sat in her class trying to pay attention. She wasn't having too much luck since the teacher had such a bland monotone voice. Olivia stared off into distance trying to keep herself awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia!\" Her teacher snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what?\" Olivia said bringing her attention back to the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still with us or are you off in dreamland?\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here.\" She said. \"Carry on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher gave Olivia a sharp look. Olivia replied with a nervous smile. As soon as the teacher carried on with his lecture Olivia let out a sigh of relief, she couldn't believe she had gotten away with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was seventeen and had long blonde hair. She was you're average high school student, get decent marks, enjoyed spending time with friends. She wasn't considered a popular girl but a lot of people knew who she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes had past and Olivia started to feel a bit strange. Her stomach started to hurt and her vision started to spin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir!\" Olivia yelled raising her arm in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I please go to the bathroom?\" Olivia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quick.\" He sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia jumped up from her seat and sprinted out of the classroom. Her head started to pound faster and faster. Olivia picked up the speed hoping she could make it in time. She could see the bathroom in the distance as her heart almost skipped a beat but not in the way she had hoped. Olivia started to have trouble breathing. Her legs started to become weak as she aproched the bathroom. The door was in arms reach. She reached out to the door and pushed it opened and tripped over the step. Before she hit the ground Olivia blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia woke up sometime later. She had no idea how long she had been out but she didn't care. All she cared about how she was feeling and to her surprise she was feeling fine. Her headache stopped and her stomach felt better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god.\" Olivia sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia opened her eyes. Something wasn't right, everything looked white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\" Olivia thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia reached out in front of her and touched the large object. It looked alien but yet felt familiar. Olivia stood and the giant object came up with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Olivia panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked around a saw a light at the end of her tunnel. She walked to the light and hoped she would find some answers. Olivia ran out of the tunnel but she was blinded by the light. It took here a few seconds to get her eye sight back but when she saw what had happened her stomach dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Olivia cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked around and saw how huge everything was. Somehow she had shrunk and now she was the size of a doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" She yelled. \"What the fuck?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked and saw that she was under her giant shirt. She looked down at herself and realised that she was naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a plan, she needed to find help. Olivia looked around to see if anyone could help her. She saw the three stall lined up with three pairs of shoes under them. One of those giant shoes should help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stall zones she choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olivia looked over at the first stall, she had no idea who was there but it was better than no help. Olivia took a deep breath and headed over to the stall. While on the way to the stall a thousand thoughts went through her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be nice,\" She thought. \"Please help me and not use me as a toy. I hope she is nice. Please be nice. Please be nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia made it closer to the stall and started to hear something. She poked her head under the stall and saw a young girl who had long brown hair. She had her face burred in her face and was crying. Olivia felt sorry for the girl. For a second she forgot how small she was and she wanted to confront the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia walked under the stall and stood between the giant's feet. Olivia's stomach dropped as she saw how huge the feet were. She looked up at the giant. She was still in tears. Olivia wanted to do something. She reached over to the giants huge leg and gently placed her hand on it. Olivia sighed and gently rubbed the giants leg hoping it would get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sobbing stopped crying. She felt something on her leg. She thought it might have been a bug but when she looked she saw something she never expected. A doll sized girl rubbing her leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" The giant said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's stomach dropped as the giant's eyes locked on her. She wanted to say something but she was paralysed with fear. The giant slowly reached her giant hand towards the tiny girl. Olivia closed her eyes and let the giant wrap her giant fingers around her waist. The giant tightened her grip on Olivia and gently raised her in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia let out a small moan. She couldn't believe how warm the giant's hands were. The giant's hands were a bit wet from her tears but the warmth on her bare skin felt incredible. A warm feeling came over Olivia. She felt like she was in good hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant brought Olivia up to her giant face and opened up her hand. Olivia sat on the giant's open palm and looked up at thee giant. Her face was the size of a billboard compared to Olivia. She could see could see every detail on the giants face. The small freckles on her cheeks and dried up tears running down her face. The giants eyes were still red from crying. Olivia started to feel sorry for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little girl.\" The giant smiled. \"What happened to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Olivia said not taking her eyes on the giant. \"Can you please help me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the words came out of her mouth Olivia was scared to hear the response. The giant could easily say \"no you're my toy now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure sweetie.\" The giant said. \"What did you want me to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Olivia sighed. \"I honesty don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about if I take you home and we can't sort something out there.\" The giant said. \"How does that sound?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not to sure.\" Olivia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll be nice to you and take extra care of you.\" The giant said. \"No one will be home it'll be just you and me. I know that sounds weird but I'll do whatever you want me to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um okay,\" Olivia smiled. \"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" The giant said. \"I'm Natalie by the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia,\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty name.\" Natalie smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Olivia blushed. \"Natalie is a pretty name as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Natalie smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang breaking there focus from each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should go.\" Natalie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Olivia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sit in my bag if you want. I have my PE gear in there so it'll be more safe for you.\" Natalie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Olivia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie reached over and unzipped her bag. She did her best not to move the hand Olivia was sitting on, she didn't want the tiny girl to fall off. Natalie gently and slowly moved her hand towards her bag. Natalie gently lowered Olivia in her bag and gently placed the tiny girl on her uniform. Olivia look up at the giant and smiled. She couldn't believe how nice Natalie was being to her. Natalie smiled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll be careful.\" Natalie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Olivia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be a long ride though.\" Natalie said. \"I have to take the bus so we might not get home till late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright.\" Olivia smiled. \"Thanks for doing this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Natalie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie zipped up her bag and gently put her bag on her back. She didn't want to hurt Olivia. Natalie left the bathroom and headed to the bus. </span></div></div>",
