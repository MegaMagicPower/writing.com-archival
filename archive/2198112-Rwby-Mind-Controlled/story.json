You were average height with short messy black hair and light brown eyes. Your favorite colors were purple and black. Your right eye was wrapped in bandages due to it getting injured in a Grimm ambush during a first year mission. It will heal, but the doctors warned you that it would be after the festival. For now, you had to fight without your full vision. It was a challenge, but you persevered. The Grimm attack did have an upside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock allowed you to unlock your Semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind Control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found out you could control the minds of Grimm. It saved your life. When you took over the Beowolf and used it to kill the others while your arm, too badly damaged, hung at your side, You duel wielded one handed axes that were also short range guns, but could be combined into a sniper. Without use of one of your arms, you would have been toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at school, you never told anyone about it. People were sure to stop trusting you if they knew you could control their mind. During your free time, you experimented to see what you were and were not capable of. What you found was the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tYou could not directly take control of more than one person at a time.<br>\r\n\u2022\tIf you took direct control of someone, you could see through their eyes and feel what they were feeling. Your body collapsed where it was so there were limits to this ability. As far as you could tell, once you took control, there was no range limit.<br>\r\n\u2022\tYou could influence around half a dozen people at once with limited mental orders. Example: If you told people to ignore you, they would. Complicated orders reduced the number of people you could affect. When you started, you could only affect 2-3 at a time. Practice helped a lot.<br>\r\n\u2022\tWeirdly, you couldn\u2019t read minds. You could order people to give you information or write it down, but you couldn\u2019t get it directly from their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Atlas, their regiment was strictly structured. In Vale, he had a lot more freedom and was interested in seeing what kind of mischief he could use his powers for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, who were his teammates?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were one of the lucky one. All three of your teammates were girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl in his team was Ciel Soleil.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/d/db/Ciel_ProfilePic_Normal.png/revision/latest?cb=20151206161202\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel had dark skin, short, navy blue hair and blue eyes. She also had a gold marking consisting of an oval shape surrounded by four smaller circles in the center of her forehead.  She tended to wear a blue beret, a plain gray button-down shirt with an asymmetrical collar and matching leggings, a blue combat skirt, and fingerless, elbow-length black gloves with a wristwatch on her left hand and black shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one thing that bothered you was Ciel was very regimented and by-the-book. Her tone was usually monotonous and she didn\u2019t seem to understand common sayings. Like if you asked her to wait up for a minute, she would literally time you for a minute. Most people would just stop and wait. Other than that, she seemed to be loyal to the team. Her timekeeping also came in handy. There were many times you would have missed class without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next member of your team was a strange girl. Penny Polendina.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/4/44/Penny_ProfilePic_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20151214091735\" target=\"_blank\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had short, rather curly orange hair with a small ahoge on top that came down to her chin, and she liked to wear a pink bow on the back of her head. She also had bright green eyes, light skin and freckles. Her traditional outfit consisted of a whitish-gray old-fashioned blouse with short gray feminine overalls as well as a black and green collar with a matching pair of stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was amiable, excitable, kind, and curious, but had a distinct lack of social awareness. The concept of personal space and the difference between a boy who is a friend and boyfriend concept escaped her. She also didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with the team outside of class. From what you gathered, she was related to  a famous scientist and might even be the niece of the famous General James Ironwood himself. The main thing that interested you about her was the fact your power didn\u2019t work on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never found out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl on your team was a wolf Faunus. Lana Lupin.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/qiiiEx5XnqsYaHbE7\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/qiiiEx5XnqsYaH...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long silver hair and two wolf ears on the top of her head. Her eyes were also green, but not as bright as Penny. She tended to wear a grey corset, a revealing red top that opened around the corset, and covered her shoulders, along with matching red gloves. Long white pants with brown belts completed her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a Faunus, a lot of people didn\u2019t trust her. The White Fang was not popular up there. You got to know Lana and discovered she HATED the White Fang. They only made life difficult for other Faunus. Plus, if you didn\u2019t agree with them, you were against them, even as a Faunus. While she always acted like she was somewhat of a fashionista, she also kicked your ass at video games constantly. Out of your team, she was the one you got along best with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where are you starting your adventure?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Back home, while you did have free time, it was kept in certain areas. Here people could travel between the school and Vale without any sort of reason. It felt\u2026 nice. You liked having freedom. This also gave you a great opportunity to test out your new power. The goal was to keep it hidden except as a final trump card if it meant the difference between winning and losing the Vytal Festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, it seems like the training hall would be a good place to check out. There was bound to be a couple free rooms to do some practice. The ride over here had been long and you might get the opportunity to see how strong the Beacon students were. If you could get some one on one time with them, there was a chance you could practice your Semblance. Using your Semblance would actually allow you to convince them to spar with you if you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked by several groups of people, you couldn\u2019t help admire the sights. Many of the girls wore very revealing clothing, unlike the Atlas uniforms. This could be fun. Unfortunately, most of the training rooms were locked. Privacy was respected here and it was to keep people from spying on others. Eventually, you came to an unlock room. Smiling to yourself, you entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, the room was occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was there?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Underneath this, she wore a low cut yellow crop top with her emblem on the left breast in black. Below that she had on a brown belt and black mini-shorts.  Lastly, she had knee-high boots and orange over the knee socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew.\u201d The girl wiped her brow with her arm. \u201cThat was a good warm up. Time to start the real work out.\u201d She noticed you standing in the room and you realized she had lilac eyes. \u201cHey. Occupied, dude. Wait your turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d You apologized. \u201cThe door was unlocked and I didn\u2019t realize anyone was in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s my bad then.\u201d She grinned at you. \u201cI would let you stay, always more fun with an audience, but my teammate of mine would have my head if she found out a competitor was watching me train. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d You nodded and then realized you were in a great position to practice your Semblance on the girl. Looking at her, you pushed your thoughts into her mind. Willing her to let you stay. Keeping suggestions vague tended to make it easier for you. The target would make up a reason for it. \u201cSorry for bothering you.\u201d You pretended to turn around when the girl interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou know what? Screw Weiss. Want to come hang out a bit? Name\u2019s Yang. Yang Xiao-Long. What\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyrian Clematis.\u201d You answered and shook her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d Yang said to you with a grin. \u201c<i>Xiao-Long </i>have you been watching me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost considered seeing if you could erase your own memory of that pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got here.\u201d You answered honestly. \u201cSaw a few punches that turned those bots into scrap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely. You might actually stand a chance against one of my teammates. She\u2019s super strong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Yang raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow about you and I spar a bit? I could use a real workout. Unless you don\u2019t think you can handle a girl like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty strong.\u201d You countered. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be a team leader if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, want to accept my challenge?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. Practicing using your ability in a fight would be good practice. You might be able to figure out the most efficient method in fighting people with it. Of course, your eyes traveled down the girl\u2019s frame. She was really attractive. You could use your ability to make her want to talk and get to know each other instead of fighting. Then there was the erotic option. Your Semblance could encourage you to have some naughty fun with each other behind closed doors.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon enough the cloth came off and she was fully naked before you, desire and hunger in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn.\"  She purred.  You couldn't take your clothes off fast enough as you rushed to get yourself naked immediately, once you did become naked she had nothing but approval in her eyes, she focused heavily on your erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma likes.\" She licked her lips at the sight of your manhood.  \"Now shall we begin?\"</span></div></div>",

You remember someone saying the first thing you should do is go talk to Professor Ozpin, the headmaster or Glynda Goodwitch, the highest ranking teacher. You think about it for a minute then decide to go talk to Glynda. You got some time to kill anyways scenes the rest of your team hasn't shown up yet. You start talking to people and find out that Glynda is in the teachers break room, so that's were you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrive, you begin to look around and there are no other students or teachers around, prefect. So you just walk up to the door and begin to knock, but before you do, you hear not just one voice but two voices. You recognize one of the voices as one of your teammate, the redhead with glasses, Mirai. (Future)(You can develop her more later) \"Shit I might have to use my semblance.\" You think. It dose take a lot of energy to use it on just one person and there's two people in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere conversation ends and the door opens and out comes Mirai with Glynda right behind her. \"And who's this.\" Glynda asks. Before you even have time to answer, Mirai dose \"This here is the leader of my team, he's name is Mathew.\" (Gift of god) You can tell she seemed a little sacred as she spoke and Glynda could tell too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the guy you told me about, nice to meet you Mathew. My name is Glynda.\" She says cautiously.  \"Well I'm going to head back to my dorm room.\" You hear Mirai Say, as she backs away, clutches her book in hand. \"Where are you going, Mirai.\" You couldn't help yourself. \"Nowhere.\" She says, as she stops moving and her eyes turn pitch black. Glynda turns and sees the color return to Mirai's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the semblance she told me about.\" Says Glynda as she keeps looking at Mirai. \"What Semblance?\" Right as you say that your head started throbbing with pain, your legs become shaky and your vision becomes blurry. \"What are you talking about sir...\" Even thought it's a blur you can still see Glynda shut her mouth as only one eye darkens. \"What the fuck is going on? Why didn't it work.\" You say as you fall to the ground. You feel like you want to pass out, but don't. Not yet anyways, You keep your blurry eyes on Glynda as you can see that her legs are shaking. seconds later she falls to the ground. You eyes close as all you can hear is heavy breathing coming from Glynda. Mirai is still not moving or saying anything. The last thing you can remember hearing/seeing is Glynda's eyes start to tear up as she starts to moan and starts to slowly *cum. Glynda now just sits there as the ground is all wet she doesn't move or say anything just like Mirai.          <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I better go there and wait for the rest of my team to show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you begin to walk to your room, you watch as a girl swings a giant scythe right over your head. The scythe weapon then slowly starts to shrink down. The girl puts it on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around. \"Sorry for almost hitting you, are you ok? My name is Ruby by the way.\" She looks worried.  \"Ya, I'm alright, cool weapon you got there. The girl Ruby's eyes light up as you mention her weapon. \"You like it.\" \"Ya, that weapon is super neat. I especially like how it fold like that.\" Ruby spouts a fact about her weapon. \"Did you know its also a gun.\" \"Cool how did you make it.\" You ask. \"I got some help form my uncle Qrow. I don't see any kind of weapon on you. So if you don't mind me asking, whats your weapon.\" That made you excited, but as excited as Ruby, as she responds with... \"Yes\" \"Ok, then i will show it to you, but you can't tell anyone else about it, ok. She nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \"pull out\" your weapon. \"I don't see anything.\" Ruby says confused. \"Are you sure.\" You say back. \"Yes I'm sure I...\" Ruby stops what shes saying. You start to see her eyes darken. \"Your right Ruby my weapon is not on me because I left it back in my room. You can see my weapon if you want. You just have to follow me to my room.\" You smile. \"Sure I'd love to.\"Ruby says as the color returns to her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, lets go Ruby.\" Ruby doesn't say anything and just follows you to your room. It takes you a minute to find, but you eventually find your room. Ruby is still right behind you, not saying anything. You unlock the door and see a redheaded girl (One of your teammates. You can develop her later) sitting on one of the four beds. \"Hi Thanos.\" (Immortal) You look over at her. O, Hi Mirai.\" (Future) You don't sound interested. \"Who's the girl you got there.\" She points to the girl standing behind you. \"Her name is Ruby, \"Ruby, what a nice name. Hi Ruby.\" She waves. \"Ok, that's enough it's time for you to leave.\" You sound mad. \"But...\" \"I don't care get out.\" You see Mirai's eyes darken as she gets up off the bed and walks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits by the door in the hallway with her book. She sees a faunus girl pass by reading a book. She could tell she was faunus even though she was wearing a bow on her head. The bedroom door closes.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",
