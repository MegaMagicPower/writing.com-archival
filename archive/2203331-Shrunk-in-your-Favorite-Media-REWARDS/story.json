You have a variaty of spells and just aquired a new one called shrink. In the booklet, you read that the shrunken object/person becomes immune to damage or pain, so it was perfect for a macrophile like yourself. You also had the ability to enter different realities by the form of the spell teleportation, which you had confirmed also worked on fictional works such as anime or cartoons. Even books or live-action shows weren't exempt. If you went to a live-action show there would be no sets, the characters would just be themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you had recently acquired the power to shrink inside your favorite forms of media you decided to transport into a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Anime<br>\r\nB: Cartoon<br>\r\nC: Live-Action<br>\r\nD: Book<br>\r\nE: Something Else?</span></div></div>",

The main reason for this was that it would be much easier to find who you want to find by simply going to the ninja academy since most of the main characters were still in school. Of course, the fact that they were still pre-teens was a little bit of a turnoff, but at the size you are, anything is big, including both male and female body parts from all ages. You easily navigate through the village, using a flying spell to get a high vantage point and Zeroing in on the Ninja Academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou propel yourself forward through a window and you find yourself in the class of the main cast of characters.

A sharp breeze of cold wind pierces you, which makes your tiny body shiver in shock. Wanting to get shelter, you spot a nearby cave and run your little legs as fast you can towards it. Once inside you take a rest as you get some momentary relief. A groan of pain startles you as you hear it coming from deeper in the cave. Following a path of blood, you see a giant woman laying against the cave wall. Blonde hair flows from her head and golden eyes look dazed as she holds her arm against a wound on her torso. Her torn robes gives off a tremendous view of breasts that are gigantic even for a regular sized person. Her hips are pretty big too, with some extra padding on her thighs. She seems to have a lot of other wounds on her, ranging from cuts to even burn marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only know a few healing spells but you decide to do your best to help this giantess. Walking towards her, you do your best to assure her that you\u2019re here to help. \u201cUm, hi there. I\u2019m gonna try and heal you up as best as I can, just please don\u2019t move too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant woman\u2019s eyes look down and widen at you in surprise for a few seconds before returning back to her previous dazed look. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but simply nods her head slowly to show agreement. With a grunt, she slowly removes her arm to reveal a deep gash with strange symbols around it. You get as close as you can to it and cast the best spell you can think of to heal it. It takes a few minutes or so but you managed to close most of the wound. As you work on healing some of her other wounds, you feel yourself losing your senses and as you start casting another spell near one of her thighs, you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold sensation makes your body shiver and starts to wake you as you hear the voice of a mature woman talking to you. \u201cHello? Are you alright down there? Finally, you\u2019re waking up! I was beginning to think you\u2019d never wake up again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes, you\u2019re greeted with the sight of a giant woman and her golden eyes looking down at you with both curiosity and concern. You appear to be laying in her giant set of hands as you feel the strange texture of the ground you\u2019re laying on. Her thick lips form a curved line to give you a cautious yet relieved smile. Your eyes are having a hard time peeling away from staring at her giant breasts as they sway side to side as she moves her face closer towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name\u2019s Tsunade, I\u2019m a medical ninja from Konoha. Now who are you? And why are you so small? Don\u2019t get the wrong idea, I\u2019m quite grateful for you saving my life, but it\u2019s not everyday I meet someone as tiny as yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my names Y/N, I\u2019m a mage, well, a mage in training. I wanted to go explore different worlds so I made a teleportation ring to travel here. But I think I messed up my spells again because now I\u2019m as small as a toothpick. I think it\u2019s safe to say I still need some more training along with some better habits...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be true, but I think you\u2019ve done a wonderful job with me. You managed to heal wounds that were bigger than your entire body! So don\u2019t feel too bad, you just need some more experience.\u201d she reassures you as she pats your head with one of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of pride strikes your heart after you hear these words and can\u2019t help but feel more optimistic about your future with magic. \u201cThanks Tsunade, that means a lot to me, really it does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try standing up but after 5 or so steps you fall back down. Your body seems to be pretty weak at the moment and moving too much seems to wear you out. A frosty breeze flows through the cave which makes your body shivers in the cold as your skin turns frigid underneath the thin clothing you\u2019re wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there little guy, you probably used up a lot of energy patching me up. Just take it easy until I heal you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey Tsunade, can we move s-someplace warm? I\u2019m kinda freezing my butt off at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think I have an idea that\u2019ll heal you as well as warm you up. I don\u2019t have as much energy for my usual healing techniques so I\u2019ll have to use one that\u2019s a little...unique.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnique?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, basically, I\u2019m gonna help you using my....\u201d</span></div></div>",

She brings her hand closer to it until you are brushed against the doughy flesh. It\u2019s incredibly soft, not to mention warm, and you wouldn\u2019t mind snuggling up against her belly in order to warm up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean...you\u2019re gonna eat me?\u201d you ask as you hear a few gurgles and groans emit from inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but there\u2019s nothing to worry about, you\u2019ll be fine. With this technique my stomach becomes a place where the occupants are healed as well as protected. I can tell you it\u2019s not a technique I\u2019ve ever had the need to use before until now. So what do you say? Up for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take much of the piercing cold to convince you to go along with her promise of someplace warm and bale to rest. Besides, it doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad idea to be in the belly of a beauty like Tsunade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I trust you Tsunade. I just hope it\u2019ll be comfy enough...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me kid, you\u2019ll be in for a real treat. Conveniently you\u2019ll also be a treat for me, hehe.\u201d Tsunade reassures you with a slight chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a firm yet gentle grasp of her fingers, you are brought towards Tsunade\u2019s plump lips. Suddenly, she leans in closer and soon enough you\u2019re enveloped by her pillowy lips in a massive kiss. The two walls of lip cover your entire head and most of your torso as they envelop you in a hug. Her lips feel warm and you can\u2019t help but lean into the kiss to soak up the warmth and enjoy the softness around you. A few seconds later she brings her lips back with a sultry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy that? Just consider that one of my ways of thanking you for saving my butt earlier. So, you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart flutters from that wonderful experience but you manage to answer back quickly with a reddened face. \u201cY-yeah I\u2019m ready when you are Tsunade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Y/N hope you taste as sweet as you look!\u201d she says as she opens her mouth in preparation. Inside her mouth rests a long, meaty tongue as her throat pulsates in anticipation of your arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is placed inside her mouth and onto her saliva drenched tongue. You can\u2019t help but let out a small shriek of surprise as you feel it move and rub itself against you. It\u2019s slimy and soft surface gives a long lick all over your body and eventually your entire face. It\u2019s a nice sensation and feels like a massage that relaxes and above all warms your body up. You can hear a distinct humm come from Tsunade as she continues to savor your taste with more licks. After a few more licks, her tongue rests flat for a moment until it rises to slide you down Tsunade\u2019s throat. Her throat caresses your tiny body as it slides down slowly until you pass through the esophagus and finally drop into her stomach with wet squelching sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back onto your feet as you try to adjust yourself to your new surroundings. Pink, fleshy, slimy walls surround you in a spacious area that seems to be as big as a house to you! Your body becomes relaxed as the warmth courses through it as well as feel something else inside your body being restored. The walls in here look puffy and even pillow-like. Curious, you press against the walls and find that your hands sink into the squishy flesh like some sort of slimy beanbag chair. You decide to lay against the wall and to your surprise and delight, it contorts around your body like a meaty hug. Just as you\u2019re starting to relax and take in the softness of stomach flesh, the entire stomach suddenly shakes as you hear a sound rumble above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Tsunade lets out a satisfied, wet belch that echoes throughout the cave. \u201cUUURRP! I gotta hand it to you Y/N, you taste pretty good! You feel pretty nice in there too. So, how\u2019re you holding up in there? The quarters to your liking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! It\u2019s a bit strange, but it\u2019s actually quite cozy here in your stomach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to hear it sweetie. Now, it\u2019ll be a long trip back to the village so just kick back and make yourself comfortable.\u201d she replies with a pat of her plump belly and makes her way out of the cave with the speed only a ninja could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuggle back against her stomach walls and start to drift off as you soak in the soothing flesh and heat of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Also, the Galor region will be included, but there is no Elite 4 members in Pokemon Sword and Shield. Brock and Misty are in this selection as well as in the \"Anime Characters\" Choice. Other characters like; Cynthia, Diantha, or any Gym Leader/ Elite 4 member will be in the 1st choice. The Alola Region has a unique version of this. Instead, they are called, \"Trial Captains\" and \"Island Kahunas\". However, they fall within this category.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.Pokemon Professor: When you start your quest, you are greeted by the regions Head Professor as he/she explains what Pokemon are and helping you set up your character. Meaning that characters like Professor Oak, Juniper, etc. will be her. This also includes Professor Burnet. Even though she's not in the introduction, she is considered a professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Anime Characters: Like it says, this choice includes all the character's from the entire Pokemon anime series (so far). Not only will it include Team Rocket, it will add other characters like: Lillie, Lusamine, Bonnie, Max, Miette, and other characters are in this choice.</span></div></div>",

As they opened again, you were in a small village by the ocean. The town was named Foosha Villiage, or Windmill Villiage. You see where the windmill part came from, as there were many windmills scattered along the town. The area was quiet, the only sound you heard was the calm wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the silence, however, was the shrill voice of a young boy that you recognized as Monkey.D.Luffy.

WHO OR WHERE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spread your arms out and knocked into a shelf, which knocked down a few disc covers onto the floor. You proceeded to clean up after yourself until one cover caught your eye. The cover was labeled, \"No Game No Life.\" You remembered that this was the first anime you watched when growing up. You also remembered that you had a crush on one of the character's; Shiro. Too bad it only had 1 season. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both questions have been answered. Without hesitation, you grabbed your staff and focused your power on both your size and dimension. After a few brief moments, you were absorbed by a blinding light. When you recovered your vision, you were standing on a fancy looking chair. You looked around your surroundings, but it's hard to tell, you believe it to be some sort of outdoor patio of the castle. Not even long after, you heard footsteps approach you. It's Shiro! And she has no idea that your there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe positions her dress so the back of the dress is on the seat. Now you are face to face with her white panties. You looked at the bottom of the chair to find that she has taken her shoes off revealing her purple feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Panty shots and feet?! How could this get any better?\" You thought to yourself as you were filled with joy. As luck would have it, Shiro was eating a small snack, when a chunk landed beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Enter Shiro's Panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: Jump down and enter Shiro's shoe. (I'm not a big foot person, but I know people like this, so why don't you guys try it?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Hop onto the crumb and give it a little bit of a \"kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Before long a shadow grew over you and looked up to see a giant hand. You quickly crawled toward the other side to avoid detection and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro didn't see you, but it looked like she did. Her red eyes observed the cookie piece with a blank expression. Without any warning, she threw the cookie into her mouth, unaware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of her tongue threw you off the crumb and you almost fell down her throat, but thankfully, you were able to roll to the left and grabbed the back tooth. You didn't want to enter her stomach yet. You then hurled  yourself back onto her tongue. It last long because after 2 or 3 bites, you and the crumbs were thrown toward the back of her throat and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the walls of her throat squeezes you further down. You could hear Shiro's heart beating as you traveled further in. Eventually, you were dropped into her stomach. Bits and chunks of other cookies were already turned into mush, ready to be delivered into her body. You were about to get comfortable until a waterfall of white liquid fell from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this......milk?\" You asked yourself. It smelled sweet, but with the strong odor inside her stomach, it was hard to tell. Good news was it wasn't sticky. (Too far?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Wait it out. (Let nature takes its course)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB:Continue deeper.

Your room wasn't very spacious in terms of storage.  You opened the closet to find random junk you summoned while you tested the teleportation spell. You scavenged through the pile of weapons and potions, some were random items that you knew like a 4-Star Dragon Ball (I am hilarious and you will quote everything I say), while others were weird like a stone mask. You still have no idea how that thing works, but you swore that you heard someone whisper \"Muda Muda\" behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, where is tha-OW!\" You yelled as you hit your head on a shelf. The staff fell into your hands. You rubbed your head from the injury, now you know to place your staff next to your bed. You focused on the manga as a green, water-like aura began to surround you.

You started to focus your spell on where you want to go and its obvious; The School! You didn't need an object for this spell, you already know the series by heart. As soon as you started focusing on the smell, you were immediately engulfed in a blinding white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your vision returned, you were standing in the middle of the school's hallway. You immediately noticed the classroom on your left. The door was open wide enough for you to squeeze through and see who's there. However, you were only able to see one person and that was Tearju Lunatique. She appeared to be at her desk, grading some papers. You could sense some form of magic inside, which would mean that Lala, Momo, and Nana are there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the hallway, you could see two girls talking to each other.

It looks like the hallway continues past them, probably if you explore, you could find more girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was the holy land for perverts; the girl's changing room! The door was closed, but you could slide under it and do some peeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Enter the classroom. (There are more girls there then what I listed, so Mikan is there also.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB:Head down the hallway (Like I said, if your not interested with these two, you could head further down to probably the nurse's office, plus she's hot!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC: Crawl into the Girl's Changing room (Do I need to explain this one?......... ok: Mio, Risa, Saki, Rin, and Ayako are here.

Nepgear was having a chat with Compa and IF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompa was one of Neptune's friends. She's a nurse-in-training who you had a crush on.

She was standing above you, thinking on what her to add for her comic. Her figure was amazingly beautiful from her pelvis to her large bust. The downside was her mask. Murakumo wears that orge mask to give her more confidence when fighting. When the mask comes off, she becomes insecure with looks and would try to hide her cute face. You probably might have a hard time putting it off, but you'll think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your right was Minori. She was drawing some sort of picture. Probably it's for her friends since she acts way more of a child than Hibari. (Even though she's actually 16, but I can't explain why.)

Once again, you recieve little fanfare as you are plunged into the crevice of this fat, disgusting ogress. This time, Fiona lets go of you and allows you to stew in this hell. The stench is nearly unbearable, even for someone with as sick and twisted desires as yourself. After nearly passing out, she withdraws your tiny form from her folds and repeats the process on her other armpit. When she finally finishes that armpit, she pulls you out yet again and gives you a sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, looks like you're doing your job in there! My stink is even more attractive than usual.\" She sniffs you again. \"But it looks like your fairy dust got washed away, which means you're nearly useless to me.
