Ben is a tall quiet kid, his pale complextion and meak demeanor tend to give off the impression that he is always tired. He gets out of bed excited to hangout with his friends on a weekend with no painting, art history, or design classes to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this morning wasn't like other mornings, things were about to get really strange for Ben as his stomach suddenly started to churn. \"Stupid meal plan,\" he grumbled to himself. Ben did live off of the schools food plan, but he often found it to be gross and has gotten a stomach bug from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think it to be odd at first, walking into the middle of his single dorm room, but the feeling in his stomach started to spread to his whole body, and he passed out on the floor. When he awoke everything was different, his surroundings had grown to unbelievable sizes. He heard massive banging as tremors soaked the ground which sounded like footsteps from outside in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized in that moment that things hadn't grown, but infact that he had shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is outside?</span></div></div>",

Every Saturday his teammate Natalie who he had befriended the first practice gave him a ride in her jeep to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen just remembered that it was game day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banging and earth tremors stopped outside his door and a gigantic Natalie burst into the room. Natalie was tan and had an athletic build and slim figure with long brown hair tied back in a ponytail. She had full lips and beautiful blue eyes and as great as an athlete as she was, she could sometimes be a total airhead, which wasn't boading well for your current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, guess Ben forgot to lock his door,\" said Natalie strolling into your room. She was in generic Nike athletic wear with long soccer socks rolled down to her ankles, yet to put on her cleats and shin guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Bens not here,\" she said aloud realizing the rooms emptiness, \"well I guess I'll just get ready here and head to the game, Ben must have gone on a pregame jog to the field or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get her attention before she leaves do you...</span></div></div>",

You exhale a sigh of relief, not knowing how you would have dealt with someone entering your room with the state that you're in. But you need to do something about your current predicament. Taking a few moments to calm yourself down and come to terms with your situation, you realize you must leave but where too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining hall is an option, considering that weird food they serve is the only lead you have as to figuring out why you shrank. On the downside its breakfast time and there would be a lot of people there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go to Urgent Care, but those people never really help with much, and they might do weird medical experiments on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could go across campus to a classroom and find a trusted professor, but that's a lot of walking and there's a high potential of being stepped on, our caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a friends dorm, but who?</span></div></div>",

Molly is wearing a plain white crop top, showing off her exotic belly jewelry, with blue booty shorts and pink flip flops that she immediately kicks off when entering your room revealing the dirt caked bottoms of her feet.

Unfortunately, or fortunately for you depending on how you viewed it, Molly's aim was a little off and your head smashes against her two front teeth, completely snapping your neck and killing you instantly. Your limp and lifeless corpse landed on her moist tongue, and is pushed toward the molars were Molly bites down mashing and crunching your body into a delicious mush that coats her tongue and fills her taste buds with delectable flavor. She savors the moment for a while mixing your mush in with her saliva, a few shards of bone getting lodged between her teeth before she finally swallows you down her throat and into the pit that is her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied and very turned on by the though of her former customer and friend's remains swimming around inside of her, she shuts the door to your room, lies down on your bed and begins to pleasure herself. She finishes on your bed not at all bothered to clean it, after all you wouldn't be needing it anymore. After cleaning herself up, she raids your room taking your money, clothes, posters, books, anything she felt like taking. Molly even found this necklace that your mom had given to you as a good luck charm, that she could use as anal beads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning after getting super fucked up at a party last night, a hungover Molly uses the rest room and relieves herself of Bens remains.
