Suddenly, you feel tingly. You black out on the ground. When you wake up, your sight is a little blurred, but it seems like no one saw what happened. You shake your head, and when the blurriness goes away, you find that everything is 100 times bigger! you have a giantess fetish, so you have always wanted this to happen to you, so you decide to make the best of it. Why not, you say to yourself, you're going to die someday, why not the way you've dreamed of dying? So you head off to one of the three girls on the bench. But who will it be?</span></div></div>",

You end up right under the ball of her foot, and you smell a strong smell. She's been walking a lot, you say, because that smell is sweat. It took a while to pinpoint, because at your size, it smells ten times worse than normal. Vannessa plays with the sandal more, trapping you there. You don't mind, since the sandal its soft, and she isn't standing yet. But right as you think that, her foot starts to move differently, and then you feel the weight of a hundred tons press down on you. Strangely, you don't die from that. When you shrunk, you must have gotten some resistance to pressure. You thank that, for you can now enjoy some more of this. You were pushed forward, and now you are underneath her gigantic, beautiful, bitter-sweet smelling toes. Her toes seem to feel you, like she's trying to see what you are. Oh no, you think, she feels me. She might think you're a bug. She might crush you, and at your size, you'd be crushed into paste.</span></div></div>",

You then get the chance to see that she's wearing toenail polish, blue with stars on them. \"Alright, I think that's good enough, you pest. I'm going to enjoy this. You get the chance to be crushed under the sole of me, your goddess, and have your crushed body paste all over my foot and sandal. Goodbye, you bug!\" And then she presses down with all her weight, and you are crushed into pulp, which is splattered on her toes, sandal, and toenail polish. She moans with pleasure as she thinks to herself, maybe I'll wear these sandals for a few more days, just to cover it's body with my foot. Maybe I'll run a mile, too, just to make my feet sweaty and smelly. And that was the end of you, and you stayed on her feet for many weeks, with her not knowing she crushed her friend under her beautiful feet.</span></div></div>",

Didnt wanted to wake you up. But now tell me... how the hell did you get so small?!\" \"I don't know\", you tell her truthfully. \"You should be glad that I recognized you fast enough,\" she sayed while standing up. You where overwhelmed by the speed and the sheer size of this action and of her. You now realized that her beautiful legs and feet where bare and she just had some white, cute panties on. Little hearts where sprinkled all about it. Her belly was bare and her breasts where covered with a matching bra. \"Because I nearly smashed you beneath my little cute stompers\" You saw her smile before the view of her beautiful face was blocked by the sole of her foot. It was clean and you could smell the peach aroma she had used to shower. \"You where just about to become one of countless bugs beneath my divine foot.\" She giggled as she circled her foot around her ankle, teasing you in a life endangering situation. You really felt like a bug towards her and you was frozen in a mixture of fear, fascination and erotic. \"But I hate it if they dont move\". She lowered her foot again onto the sandals. The straps above you bend down beneath her foot and with a slight creaking of stressed leather it was planted nearly in your reach. As her foot moved you could see a short glimpse of her biting her lip, before she smiled back at you. You could see that she was thinking about what to do with you</span></div></div>",

You swallowed nervously as the silhouette of her sandal-clad foot covered your vision. \"V-Vanessa..?\" Before you could protest, the hard, crushing sole of her sandal had pinned your puny body to the floor. You struggled in vain to move, but with every movement you felt you were becoming more and more stuck. The bottom of her sandal that rubbed against your face was covered in dust, dirt, and even a piece of bubblegum or two. You feared that soon you would end up as nothing more than a piece of debris stuck to the surface of her sandal. You could hear Vanessa's laughter ringing out and see the tips of her toes wiggling above you. She smoothly rubbed her foot down the length of your body and now rested it on your legs -- it felt like the weight of a car was sitting on them. You looked pleadingly up at her face, which looked more divine than ever at the moment. She responded by pressing ever so slightly, making your little bones shudder under the weight. You could only whimper in pain. \"Oh, am I hurting you?\" she sneered. Her wiggling toes gave the indication that she simply enjoyed making you suffer. Having you completely in her power, Vanessa deliberated over what to do with you next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You squirmed helplessly, trying to wriggle free, but to no avail. You even grasped the rim of her sandal, trying to lift yourself up and crying out a painful sob in the hopes that she would be merciful. But her powerful toes forced you back to the ground. The worst part of it was that she was only teasing you... only lightly stepping on you. She hadn't yet placed her full weight on top of you. You wondered what that would feel like... and you soon found out when the pressure all at once suddenly became unbearable. \"Mmm...\" she moaned with pleasure, now standing on her tiptoes as your legs were being slowly crushed beneath her sandal. \"Am I crushing you?\" She grinned, detecting the slightest vibrations of your collapsing frame. You gasped for air. \"Is that a... CRACK I hear?\" she taunted. As if on queue, your legs popped as Vanessa placed her whole weight on top of them. \"Oops!\" Amid your tiny screams, she twisted her sole mercilessly, making a sound like bubblewrap. The lower half of your body went completely numb as you watched her grind the crushed remains of your legs into a messy pulp smeared between the ground and her divine sandals. \"That was fun,\" she remarked, rubbing her bloodstained sandals over your face as you lay there weakly, the life slowly draining away from you. You looked in horror at the flattened remains of your legs that she so proudly displayed on her soles. Your body ached with pain and your breathing slowed. It was some relief when she lifted her sandals off your tiny stump of a body and kicked them off, revealing her bare feet. You guessed that she was planning to...</span></div></div>",

You are somewhat aroused, though, and you start running faster. You manage to get to her sandal, which is twice as big as you, and you start climbing it. You get up on top, and then you see it- Vannessa's gigantic, beautiful, great soles. You drop to your knees and bow to them. You then crawl over to your goddess's toes and start kissing them, one by one. How lucky you are to worship your goddess like this! Then you remember your goal at hand- climb her titanic foot and wait there for a while. You continue your climb. Maybe, you think, you could become her slave and live life like that. You ponder that as you lay, exhausted, on top of her foot. Then, you hear a rumble. Her foot lifts up, down, up, down, again and again with you clinging on for dear life.

The day you and Vannessa met; it was the turning point of your life. You started schooling in kindergarten, and the place seemed a bit frightening at first. You watched as your parents waved goodbye, their car going away until it was out of sight. Right after, the bell rang, and the school teachers calmly directed to inside the school building. You walked inside the bricked structure along with the other children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a brightly colored room, and wide too. The teacher went through her lessons, and eventually, before you knew it, it was time for a break. Most of the kids went outside to recess to play basketball, 4-square, etc. You didn't feel like doing much, so you sat down and observed the room. Everything was strange and new. You know what was the strangest thing though? This was the major changing point and your life would revolve around them every day since then. You spotted a girl at another table, alone, her feet in flip-flops. She scrunched her toes, and wrinkled her soles. She played with her shoes, inserting her feet in and out. You felt something and it was a weird sensation to say the least. Your heart was strummed like a harpsicord, and soared like an eagle, something that had never happened to you before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vannessa?\" the teacher asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" The girl with flip-flops answered back.<br>\r\n\"Can you be a dear for me, and take this folder to the office? I need to look after the other kids.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" She took the folder, and the teacher went with her out the door.<br>\r\n\"You sure you'll be okay in here?\" the teacher asked you, a little worried. <br>\r\nYou nodded. She shut the door, and you went to acquire your prize...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter break was over, the bell rang, signaling everyone back. This was the bell to go home. Everyone got their backpacks, including you. As you headed out a door, you heard a voice ask confused, \"Hey, has anyone seen my flip-flops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after, you returned to school with a spring in your step. A cricket laid on the sidewalk, so you carefully cupped it in your hands. It chirped, and you continued onward. You went into the school building, and sat down. You saw Vannessa was barefoot this time. You felt guilty, yet, at the same time, glad. You went through the routine of lessons. Then, the bell rang and you decided to go out with the other kids to recess. You searched the area and found Vannessa sitting out in the field. After some peptalk, (It is indeed an art to persuade yourself to do something), you walked over there and joined her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face illuminated with a smile. \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you sat down with her. \"What you doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, me?\" She slided her feet across the grass. \"Nothing much. Just relaxing, you know?\" She picked up a particular yellow flower. \"My mom says that this is a Chrysanthemum. It's supposed to be a sign of happiness. Although, she also says that they won't grow back if you pick them. That's why this field is plain. I'll give this last one to her.\"<br>\r\n You nodded and unfolded your hands to check if the cricket was still there. As you did, however, he leaped forward, escaping your grasp. As it did, Vannessa's foot came slamming down, silencing the chirping you once heard. A smirk came across her face. \"Hey, what was that for?\"<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"It was just a bug.\"<br>\r\nYou would think you would get angry, but instead, you just said, \"Yeah.\" The bell rang, signaling the end of school.<br>\r\nShe got up and swiped off the dust on her clothes. \"Maybe we can talk some more later?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time flew from then on. We became friends, and not long after, best friends. We usually hanged out at your house.<br>\r\n\"Remember,\" you said as you both reached the house, \"no shoes.\" <br>\r\nShe raised her eyebrow. \"How come?\"<br>\r\nLuckily, you were prepared for this question. \"My mom likes the house clean, so we have to remove our shoes every time we come in.\"<br>\r\n\"Alrighty.\" She took off her flip-flops, her favorite shoes to wear, and sat on the couch, scrunching her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.\" You went to your room, and got her flip-flops from kindergarten. You decided it wouldn't be right to have them anymore. Wrapping them in a box, you attached a tag that said, 'Do not open till you get home.' You gave her the box, and she had an expression of wonder upon her face. She shook the box, trying to figure out what was inside. <br>\r\n\"What's inside?\"<br>\r\n\"You'll know when you get home.\" <br>\r\nShe smiled and said, \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on the couch beside her feet, and tried your best to not look at them. \"Hey, do my feet look big to you?\" she asked out of the blue.<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, my friends said they looked ginormous. I wanted to see what you thought.\"<br>\r\n\"I think they okay, I guess.\"<br>\r\n\"You guess hmmm? I'm not buying it!\" Then, to your surprise, she pressed her sole against your face against the couch. It was exhilarating, and you tried to push it back to make it seem like you didn't like it. She would push with more effort every time you did. Then, for the first time ever, you licked her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and scooted back a little. \"D-did you just lick my foot?\"'<br>\r\n\"Well, I...\" your face flushed a bright red.<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence.<br>\r\n\"I better be getting home,\" she said, getting up, taking your gift, and putting on her flip-flops that she had left at the door.<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow then?\" You asked. She didn't answer, instead just closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe matured as time went by. She improved in all aspects of the body, if you know what I mean. <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*BigSmile*\" title=\"BigSmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\nShe grew prettier everyday until she was a bombshell, which led to my problem of mustering the courage to ask her out. In class, you would sit diagonally back from her seat, allowing sneak peeks of her soles when she played with her flip-flops, sandles, etc. Sometimes, it seemed deliberate, but maybe that was just your imagination. You would try to talk to her when class was over, but you usually lost her in a sea of people. However today, when the bell rang and you went out into the hallways, a warm hand clasped yours. You looked to the right and saw none other than Vannessa! She winked at you slyly. At lunch, you and her talked about classes, how you both were doing, and such.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you doing anything today?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n\"Uhh,\" you checked your phone, both to see if you had anything to do today and to make it seem like you weren't desperate. \"Nah, why?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm going to the park today to study for the test. I thought it would be nice if you would come along too.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll see you then.\" She walked out, and you decided this would be the day you ask her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories were all crystal clear. Those were good times. When you were done reminiscing, Vannessa came out, her feet a welcome sight. You walked forward, and hugged them, feeling the warmth course through your body. You kissed the toes one by one, softly and each foot. She lifted her feet, allowed you to lick and enjoy them thoroughly for about 5 minutes. \"Just like when I was at your house, huh.\" Vannessa smiled.  \"Before you die underneath my foot,\" she wiggled her toes in the air for you, giggling, \"I wanted to fullfill your fantasy before I did mine, which is to squish a tiny, helpless man at that size. I also wanted to say this.\" She firmly grasped you with her hand and held you to her eyes. Then, she puckered her lips, and kissed you. You embraced back, however difficult it was to do so. Time was frozen and it seemed like it would never end. Then, she looked back at you and put you on the floor. \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear drifted slowly down your cheek. \"I love you too.\" She raised her foot above your head. You saw how perfect her feet were and that this is how you were going to die. You could see how even though you licked the soles, they were still just a tad dirty. You liked it like that, since it reminded you of your childhood together. You closed your eyes, and felt the force of her foot mesh with you until your consciousness went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVannessa went out into the schoolyard that she had known before. It was the kindergarten school that she used to go to. She went out into the field and found the spot where you and her first talked to eachother. She dug a hole. Opening a box, she placed both her flip-flops from kindergarten inside, and placed your body in between them. She whispered a few words, closed the box, put it in the hole, and buried it. Then, she left. Over time, a yellow Chrysanthemum bloomed over the grave, standing there for the test of time.</span></div></div>",

You knew there wouldn't be much time, so you sprinted as fast as you could out of her bedroom door. Unfortunately, the carpet slowed down your progress a bit. As you made your way across, you heard movement from Vannessa's room and her voice. \"Hey, where'd you go?\" She had a doubtful tone about her. Then, you could tell she caught on to what you were doing. Furiously, she said, \"Oh, when I get you, you're going to wish you died under my feet!\" You finally made it across the carpet, but Vannessa had already caught up. Her footsteps made the ground shake underneath you. \"Ah! There you are.\" She grinned wickidly. She was about to reach for you when Vannessa's sister, Lucy, walked right into her. Lucy was blonde, and was a little younger than Vannessa. She wore pink bunny socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Vannessa.\" she said cheefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You used this time to escape.  Vannessa tried to get past, but Lucy kept blocking her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to go shopping at the mall? I heard there were these shoes that looked gorgeous!\" You heard Lucy squeel behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have something I have to do right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Like what?\" By the time you frantically reached the door, you finally noticed it was closed. This wasn't good since there wasn't much time left of stalling. You bit your nails in fright until you saw a pair of shoes next to the door. You weren't sure whose they were, but they'd allow you a hiding place to think out a plan rationally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move!\" You heard Vannessa's annoyed voice say. By the time she was able to look at the direction you escaped, you were already inside the mildly scentful sneakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a sigh, and Lucy's voice. \"I'll just go by myself then.\" You heard some shuffling of feet and, to your surprise, those same pink socks you saw before enter the shoe! It was a tight fit (really compressed); it was just below the unbearable. Her feet didn't smell. She must've taken a shower a while ago. You felt your body rise and crash down repeatedly. It reminded you of someone who had uncontrollable seasickness. Unfortunately, this lasted for about 20 minutes. You would hear her screaming in excitement from time to time, but it was muffled, so you weren't sure what she was all excited about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, you saw stars, and you thought you saw a bright light. You felt like a feather and that all the heaviness was lifted off of you. \"Is this what heaven is like?\" You thought to yourself. You then realize that you were still in the same place, but Lucy had taken out her feet. You decided that this was your one and only chance to escape. You got up and lifted yourself out of the sneaker. It seemed that you were in a dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around to see Lucy again. She had taken off her socks, revealing her nice, soft, barefeet. They were beautiful beyond imagining, and it was hard to come up with words to describe something of such magnificence. It seemed that she was trying on a new pair of shoes. You starred at her wonderful feet, but then you slapped yourself. What were you doing? You had a chance to escape, and you were just standing there! It took a lot of willpower, but you looked away, and focused at the task at hand. You hopped to the ground, and sprinted to the exit door.</span></div></div>",

It didn't take you long to figure out this was a shoe store. You shook your head, laughing. No wonder why Lucy was screaming so loudly back there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw a heaven every person with a foot fetish would kill for. There were so many pairs of shoes, socks, and barefeet that you could barely count them all. You saw a very pretty girl, at about the age of 15, taking off her shoes. \"Man,\" she said in a whiny tone, \"these things are killing me.\" She took off her shoe, and you watched as it tumbled on top of you. You gagged at how strong the smell was, but after that, you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were enjoying your new situation, the shoe was lifted, and you saw the eyes of the girl above you. They had a sense of boredom, then of surprise, then malice. You didn't like that expression one bit, and a new shred of fear enveloped within you. She lifted her foot, and you were just able to jump out of the way. \"So bug, how do you like my feet?\" she grinned. As you ran, she stomped it right in front of you. \"So, you think you can get away? Just like that?\" She grabbed you, showing you the bottom of her sock. \"You see this foot right here? Do you know how many bugs got crushed,\" she snapped her fingers on her other hand, \"just like that under it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to profuse a lot, both from the heat from her foot and the dread of this bratty teenager. \"Maybe we work this out?\" you uttered softly. You were surprised when you were moved away from her foot. With one hand, she took off her socks, revealing her barefeet. You breathed a sigh of relief, until you realized what was happening. She set you on the floor, and the shadow of her foot enveloped you. She waved her hand at you. \"Say hi to your bug friends for me,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shielded your eyes, writing your will in your mind until you heard an unfamiliar voice. \"Honey, it's time to go home.\"<br>\r\n\"But mom...\" <br>\r\n\"No buts young lady, when I say we're going, we're going.\"<br>\r\n\"Can I at least do this one thing really qui-\" There was a shuffle of feet coming closer, and a scream. \"Ow! Mom, my ear!\"<br>\r\n\"I did say it was time to go home, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, put on your shoes, get the new shoes you wanted and we'll get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the conversation was taking place,  you had to think of a hiding spot. Your brain cells accelerating, a lightbulb popped into your head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hid and crouched under the shoe rack, concealed in the shadows. You watched as the girl put on her socks and shoes. When she was finished, she started to look around at the ground. Then, she glanced at your direction and started reaching out to you! You thought she would grab you, but she only grabbed the shoe box above you. She took a final glance at the floor, an expression of disappointment upon her face. She left the store, the ringing of the bell of the door flooding your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was pleasant</i>, you thought to yourself. You decided that you had enough of this shoe store, and thought of another place to visit. It was then you had an idea of somewhere to go, and a grin plastered across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, here I am.</i> After much walking and <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">stealing</span> borrowing some transportation (Who knew mini bicycles from the toy store nextdoor would be so useful!), you finally arrived at your school. Most of the boys dropped out, leaving you in a school where you were the only boy. You knew that, just like America, this was the land of oppertunity. The sky was dark, but beams of light faintly showed; dawn was approaching, and so was the start of school. <i>What am I going to do while I wait</i>, you wondered. <i>I guess I'll make a tent or something.</i> You rode your bike across the blacktop towards the benches. You grabbed a twig, and drew a circle diameter in the sand. Dragging a couple of maple leaves, you formed them into a tent shape. Just like constructing a sandcastle, you formed a chair that was a little too sensative to be sat in. Tiny bits of bushes lined a pathway to your house, and gravel from the playground filled the pathway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back a few steps, wiping the sweat off your brow and admiring your work. <i>That was some tiring work, but I finally got it finished.</i> Suddenly, a flipflop came crashing down, crushing the home that took you a long time (in your opinion) to create. The sound of pulverized leaves and sand filled your ears. You got on your knees, banging your fist on the ground. \"Why?!\" you vented to the sand repeatedly. You looked up, wanting to know the villian that would do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fit of rage then transformed to that of awe. She had straight, auburn hair, coffee brown eyes, and a smooth face. Whoever she was, she must've been a new student since you'd never seen her before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, and smiled. It wasn't a smile of intent, however, but of friendliness. She waved to you. \"Hey there, little bug.\" She lifted her flipflop, a curious look on her face. \"Is...is that a house?\" She glanced back at you, taking a closer look. \"Wait....you're not a bug.\" She grabbed you with her hand, lifting you to her eyes. She gasped. \u201cHow\u2019d you get to this size?\u201d You opened your mouth to speak, but were interrupted. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t believe I almost killed you though! I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d The bell rang, signaling the beginning of school. She expressed a show of concern. \u201cHey, if it\u2019s alright with you, we can talk at recess. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \u201cOkay, where can I put you?\u201d She looked for a hiding place, but just decided to put you in her backpack.</span></div></div>",

You scratched your head, wondering what to do when you were caught off guard by the sudden movement around you, knocking you down. You tried to get up, but just ended up smacking right onto notebooks and textbooks. Stars circling around your head, this reminded you of the ride you took in Lucy's shoe; it was very nausiating and painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought you pass out, everything stopped. The ground stopped shaking, and so did all the objects around you. With one hand on a textbook cover, you stood up, knees wobbling. Everything was spinning and blurry, but you were eventually able to see clearly and regain your balance. With both hands, you dusted yourself off and glanced up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was against you better judgement, but you decided that you'd at least do something instead of waiting around for recess. Surveying the area, you stumbled upon a purple pencilbox. A lightbulb popped into your head, and the gears of thinking started whirling. Opening the pencilbox, you took out a whole bunch of rectangular erasers and stack them upon eachother. Eventually, you were able to reach the zipper and take a peak of where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of desks, people, and a teacher in the front led to only one thing; a classroom. The air conditioner could be heard at full blast. You gazed at all the girls, every single one of them wearing sandals. You smiled, knowing you did the right thing by coming here. Getting up, you slid down the backpack, going to the feet of the girl in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you liked about these feet was that they were french pedicured. You climbed on top of the sandal, relishing the adrenalizing moment. You sniffed the air, breathing in that familiar aroma that you loved so much. You did make one mistake however; you decided to kiss her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up to her biggest toe, you kissed it. Just as you did, her foot responded, lifting and grabbing you with all her toes. She rolled you all of the insole of her sandal, the flesh of her sole semi-comforting you. You were both frightened and having a blast at the same time; just like a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Suddenly, you felt the pressure of her foot baring down on you. That feeling of excitement starting to die down, being replaced with 100% fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, knowing that this was it. This was how you've always dreamed to die, crushed underneath a girl's foot. You didn't realize until now that it would be this painful. You closed you eyes, predicting that you'll end up pulverized as a tiny blood stain under her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a miracle happened. The teacher's barely audible voice asked something, and the pressure was released. The girl above you answered back. You took this time to jump forward, just before her foot came crashing down onto the sandal. You wiped the sweat off your forehead, being thankful for the close call. You hopped down from the sandal, and walked back to the backpack, a little shaken up. You climbed up, opened the zipper, and dropped down. Then, you sat down, analyzing what you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it worth it?\" your conscience asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you faintly grinned whispering to yourself before you dozed off, \"it was worth it.\"</span></div></div>",

As quick as lightning itself, you sprinted over to the tape, ripped some off, and taped yourself to a sturdy textbook. With no time to spare, your surroundings and the ground beneath you started to move again. You padded yourself on the back (well, in your mind; it was difficult to do it physically.), and enjoyed the ride. Instead of a rollercoaster, it felt similar to a carousel, sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you could hear the zipper moving and a hand laying flat at the bottom of the backpack. You were hesitant at first, but just shrugged it off and hopped onto it. You were lifted high into the air, the eyes of the girl from before on you. \"Hey,\" she smiled, whispering.<br>\r\n\"H-hello.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you can talk! That's great.\" She dug her foot in the sand. \"Anyways, my name is Larissa.\" She pulled out a cracker crumb from her pocket. \"You hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"Starving!\" You took the crumb gratefully, gnawing on it with full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa giggled. \"Oh, your so cute!\" She set you down on the table, and watched you. Then, she took off her flip-flops and put them in her backpack. \"I like to feel the sand between my toes,\" she explained. \"By the way, how did you end up this small?\"<br>\r\nYou diverted your attention away from the crumb. \"I-I have no clue. I was just walking at the park, and I blacked out. When I woke up, everything's 100 times bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you doing over here at school?\" <br>\r\n\"I was...\" you tugged your shirt, \"uh...looking for supplies. Yes, that's it.\"<br>\r\n\"Supplies?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like this,\" you lifted your cracker crumb.<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay. What did you do on your way from the park?\"<br>\r\nYou smiled nervously. \"I...well....you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look, it's the new kid,\" a feminine voice called out. Larissa started to run, but was stopped in her tracks. You hid under a giant leaf you found, watching what was happening. \"Where do you think you're going?\"<br>\r\n\"Please,\" she pleaded, \"let me go.\"<br>\r\n\"And why would I do that?\" Two other girls came up, and <br>\r\n\"Hey, my backpack!\"<br>\r\n\"See you later, loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa slumped on the ground, near the tree. \"Man, those jerks. Why did they have to pick on me?\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay. They probably won't make it far in life anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" The bell rang, alarming her. \"Wait, where am I going to put you now? I lost my backpack.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm,\" you walked back and forth on her hand. Just like the genius you were, you came up with another idea. \"Hey, this is your last class right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, then we go home.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me, what class is it?\"<br>\r\n\"P.E. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you'll be okay in there?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be back.\" The locker door closed, and luckily, it wasn't too dark since this was one of the lockers with all the holes. <br>\r\nOnce she was gone, you opened the door. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to explore the school a bit.\u201d You checked your watch. 2:30. That meant you had 40 minutes until the girls came back. You walked out of the locker room, which led you outside. Everything was as you remembered it when you were larger: basketball hoops, trees, the field. Then, something caught your eye. A strange figure laid against a tree. Whoever it was about your size, and seemed to be in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to that direction, and was shocked to see it was another person! He grabbed his leg, some blood soaked into his pants. \u201cTh-there\u2019s not much time,\u201d he said between clenched teeth, breathing heavily. \u201cWe need to get to\u2026to get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you okay man?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to move NOW!\u201d he started to get up, but stumbled and hit the dirt facefirst.<br>\r\n\u201cWha-\u201d <br>\r\nThe ground started to shake, and you could hear the chatter between a group of girls. \u201cHey,\u201d said one of them, \u201cI\u2019m tired. How about we sit right here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d the others said in unison. Before they sat down, one of them screamed. \u201cEww, bugs!\u201d<br>\r\nThe rest of them started to scream too. You carried the man, his arm over your shoulder and started to sprint too. You came within breathing distance of being crushed by the girls sandals, but with luck, you were able to reach the grass, and stay camouflaged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s 300 paces north of here,\u201d the man murmured weakly. You nodded and continued forward. Not long after, you reached something that looked like an ant hill. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; we cleared out all the insects long ago.\u201d You climbed up and at the top seemed to be a makeshift elevator. An old fasion one at that since it seemed to operate on a pulley system with a rope. The man pulled at the rope downward, continuing so. The elevator started to move down with his pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how long have you been shrunk?\u201d he asked casually.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI said, how long have you been shrunk?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe two days.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh, so you\u2019re a new timer then.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026what are you saying?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend, let me behold you to this.\u201d You then saw, after a few seconds of downwards elevation, an amazing sight. An underground city! It all was to scale with your size, and lots of people that were shrunk were there too! You could only gaze in awestruck amazement until you heard, \u201cCome on, this ain\u2019t no time for sight seeing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked with him down a few tunnels and ended up in a dimly lit room. On the walls were maps of your town that had Xs on them. A desk stood in the middle of the room with someone who wore clothes like a general from an army. He had a scar on his right cheek, and a cold stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d the general asked, his voice rough.<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d the man beside you began saying, \u201cis the guy that saved my life, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d he walked back and forth by his desk. \u201cwhat happened to the rest of your men?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll dead sir.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d he banged his fist on the desk. \u201cBoth you and me know we can\u2019t afford to lose anymore men.\u201d He sat down on his chair, his head resting on his left hand. \u201cSend some troops tomorrow and try again.\u201d<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \u201cYes sir, I won\u2019t fail you sir.\u201d<br>\r\nHe pointed out. \u201cGet to the medic room and fix up your legs.\u201d<br>\r\nHe nodded and left the room. Then, the general looked up at you. \u201cI\u2019m glad you saved his life.\u201d He got up and gazed at a dusty portrait of a young man. \u201cHow long have you been shrunk?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh,\u201d you stammered, \u201c2 days.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHa, I\u2019ve been like this for 25 years boy.\u201d He rubbed his thumb gently on the portrait and sat back onto his chair. Then he rummaged through his drawers, and pulled out a book. He glided it over the desk to you. \u201cThis here,\u201d he chuckled, \u201cis something I\u2019ve recorded over those 25 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow Giantesses Kill.\u201d You read aloud. You raised an eyebrow, and opened it. Every page had a detailed desciption of how you could die by a girl. Some you didn't know you could die that way until you read the description.<br>\r\nThe general eyed you while you flipped the pages. \"You can't trust them.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"You can't trust the giant girls aboveground. All they want is to kill you for their own amusement.\"<br>\r\nYou started to agree with him, then an image of Larissa popped into your mind. \"Maybe a few?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not a single one of them.\" He pointed to the book. \"Some of my best men died in situations that book describes. Eaten, butt crushed, crushed between their boobs, crushed by their feet, you name it.\"<br>\r\nYou shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm the creator of this beautiful city you see here. Everyday, I've watched shrunken come in. Sometimes they stay, sometimes they don't. It's usually up to them.\" He turned to you. \"You're welcome to stay here if you wish anytime you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're watch started to beep. You checked it and the time showed it was 3:05. You only had 5 minutes to return to the locker room! \"Well, I'll consider it, but I have to go.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, why so soon?\"<br>\r\n\"I need to get somewhere, but I fear that I won't have much time.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you can always come back if you'd like. We can always use men like you in our troop brigade. If you're in the hurry, I think I know the perfect thing to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is safe?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course. Our troops use it all the time to get from place to place.\" He lit the fuse to the turbo jet paper glider.<br>\r\n\"I'm having second thoughts about this.\"<br>\r\n\"Have a nice flight!\" The turbo rockets activated, and you screamed as you flew at an unbelievable speed. You did loops around in the air, and then flew down. <br>\r\n\"How do I control this thiiinnngggg?\" you stuttered.  Before you hit the ground, you pulled up and were just able to avoid a crash landing. You shifted left and right. You squinted your eyes and flew into the locker room. You let go and did sumersaults on the concrete floor. The glider ran out of fuel and smashed into the floor as well. You climbed up the lockers and got into yours. Right when you closed the door, the bell rang and not long after, the girls came running in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa came and opened the locker door. \"Hey, glad to see you. Probably bored you to death waiting huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, very boring.\" You faked a yawn.<br>\r\n\"Well, class is over, so we can go home now. Want to come with?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Larissa's hands were cupped around you as she strolled along the sidewalk. You could hear the faint thumps of her feet and the roaring of cars going by as she walked. You thought long and hard about what the general said. What did he mean by you couldn't trust them? Not a single one? You knew that Larissa wouldn't do anything that book showed you. Would she? You shook your head. You were still going to accomplish your goal of seeing every girls' feet no matter how dangerous the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much longer until she went up to and opened the door to her house. After she went in and closed it, you heard the click of the locking mechanism. You were placed onto a cluttered coffee table as Larissa laid on the couch. It didn't occur to you until then that she was barefoot the whole time. Now that you thought about it, you didn't get to experience her feet except for the fact for when she almost crushed you at the beginning of school. You reached into your pocket, and smiled when you fished out your phone. By mere coincidence, the phone company cut you off since you didn't pay your phone bill the day you were shrunk, so it seemed completely useless to you. However, since you devoted your life to looking for feet, you decided it wouldn't hurt to take pictures of them along the way. Aiming the phone, you captured a perfect picture of Larissa's slightly dirty, and dusty soles. You looked up from your camera and she turned her head to you, mildly bored. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I take a picture of your face right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all.\u201d You took a snapshot of her face also. Why, you ask? It\u2019s a bonus to every foot enthusiast, including you, if you\u2019re able to see the face of the person showing their feet. You made a digital folder labeled \u2018Larissa\u2019 and put both images into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa sighed heavily. \"I can't believe Ms. Larson gave us that much homework.\" You noddingly agreed, knowing all too well the reputation that teacher had for giving out truckloads of homework. \"Do you know anything about chemistry?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Not really.\"<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Well, I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. All my stuff was in my backpack.\" She then stood up. \"I'll be right back; I'm going to see if the T.V. remote is in my sister's room.\"<br>\r\nSister?, you began to ask, but by then she was already out of earshot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, thunderous knocks enveloped your ears. A muffled voice you could faintly remember shouted from the front door. The lock unturned, and your blood turned as cold as a popsicle in a freezer. It was the bratty girl from the shoe store! \"Larissa, why'd you lock the door? You know I don't usually bring the house key with me.\" Thankfully, the table was a mess, so you just hid under a few papers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarissa came back. \"Oh hey,\" she smiled nervously, \"what are you doing home so early?\"<br>\r\n\"Me and Mom were speed shopping today.\" She sat on the couch and plopped her feet right next to you! You almost yelped, but quickly covered your mouth.<br>\r\n\"Where's Mom?\"<br>\r\n\"She went to take care of Grandpa. She'll be gone for today. Here.\" She handed her a piece of paper.<br>\r\nLarissa raised his eyebrow. \"What's this?\" <br>\r\nShe turned on the T.V. \"A list of chores to do.\"<br>\r\nLarissa quietly read the note. \"It says here that we'll be splitting the work.\" She looked up from the note. \"You're going to help me, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" She began surfing the channels.<br>\r\n\"But Mom-\"<br>\r\n\"Mom doesn't know you snuck out when you weren't supposed to last week. It would be pretty unfortunate if that information accidently slipped out, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I...,\" flustered, Larissa stomped out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving slowly, you crawled underneath the paper. You were making progress, and you thought you were actually going to escape unnoticed until felt the paper above you lift, and those toes grasp you from above. \"Ah bug, you thought you would escape from me? I'm afraid not.\" She rubbed her chin. \"Let's see, what can I do to you? I can squash you, but I feel that you need something a little more. Maybe a night in my old gym socks?\" She inspected you a little closer, and her face turned to complete shock. \"Hey, you're not a bug...you're a human!\" <br>\r\nYou nodded. \"It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, and you could talk too! Tell me,\" she asked flirtatiously, \"do you like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scanned her up and down. Even though she was a total jerk, it was obvious she was beautiful. As much as you resented her, you nodded. <br>\r\n\"If my theory stands correct, every guy has some of fetish.\" She made herself more comfortable. \"Yours would be-\"<br>\r\n\"I like feet.\" you blurted out, unconsciously.<br>\r\n\"Reeeeeallly? Well, I'll give you two choices.\u201d<br>\r\n\"I can squash you under my foot, and I'll forget you ever existed...OR you can become my foot slave. Either way, I get some form of enjoyment out of it.\"<br>\r\nAfter some thinking, you decided....</span></div></div>",

As much as you hated her, you swallowed your pride and said yes. \"Oh, this is going to be so much fun,\" she grinned. You didn't like that look as it gave you a cold chill down your spine. Also, it alerted the <b>Stay away as far as possible</b> sensors in your brain. \"By the way, you can call me Jessica.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay Jess-\" her toe collided into your chest, crashing you into the floor. <br>\r\n\"You will only talk when I ask of you or when I give you permission to speak.\"<br>\r\nYou stood up, and pointed a finger at her. \"Hey, that-\" With that, she rammed you again, knocking you back down on the dense coffee table top. With a cautious stance, you stood up, put your hands in your pockets, and stayed silent.<br>\r\n\"Now, let me clarify something real quick.\" She pulled out a bag of chips. Taking a handful, she munched in contemplation. \"Okay, if you disobey me in any way or do a horrible job at whatever task I give you, you'll be given a punishment. How bad that punishment is will be dependent on my mood.\" She took another handful of chips, and munched again. \"However, if you're a good slave, I'll think of maybe giving you a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stuck her right sole in front of you. \"For your first task, you'll be cleaning my sole.\"<br>\r\nSeeing the very sole that almost crushed you in the shoe store from yesterday, an inner flame within you rose to a dangerous level. Unfortunately, it got to the point where your stubborness and resentment snapped and took over. \"No.\"<br>\r\nJust like that, her cheery mood turned cold. \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I said no!\" You stomped in fury. \"I hate how you treat people, and I hate your attitude as well. I'm a human being, and I fully well expect to be treated as such!\"<br>\r\nShe scoffed, then sighed. With two fingers, she pinched the back of your shirt, carrying you. She walked to her room and pulled something from under the bed. Your eyes watered from the stench. It could bring grown men to their knees. The toughest of the tough would run as fast as their legs could carry them in the other direction. If I had to use words to describe it, I would call it a second hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that?\" she smirked. \"That, my friend, is my gym sock.\" Then the realization of what was going to happen next hit you like a fully-loaded brick truck speeding at 100 miles per hour. Hands clasped, you did what anyone would do. \"Please!\" you pleaded intensely, \"anything but in there.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. Just remember that this is what you asked for when you didn't do what was asked of you.\"<br>\r\nYour worst fears became a reality as  the grip on you was released and you fell inside. She lifted the sock, sending you rolling into the toe section. You didn't even know it was humanely possible to have a scent magnified that much. You began to gag, and searched franticly for something to get a footing on to climb out of there. Sadly, there was nothing to grip onto. <br>\r\n\"Get me out of here!\" you screamed with all the lungpower you had. This led to the air entering inside you. Wheezing, you pounded at the wall with feeble attempts. Your side blurred, and darkened. On your back, you reached out to the faint light above until your arm went limp at your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, my head,\" you mumbled, feeling the heaviness of a hangover. Your surroundings were shrouded in darkness and silence. You stood up, and started to walk forward until you were jolted by an invisible wall. Putting your hand on it, and observing the lid above you, it was then you knew you were in a glass jar. Jessica's faint snores could be heard as she laid in bed. The door creaked slightly, and a beam of light flashed forward. It searched all over until it came upon the jar you were in. You shielded your eyes with your hands. After that, you smiled wholeheartedly. The dark figure holding the flashlight was no other than Larissa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to her snoring sister, and back at you. She smiled as well, and grabbed the job. Sneaky as a mouse, she tip-toed out and into her room. It wasn't until she turned on her bedroom light that you noticed how exhausted she looked. Her face had splotches of dirt along with her hair, which didn't so great either. She unscrewed the jar, and cupped her hands around you. She lifted you up, and held you in front of her face. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n\"I should ask the same thing,\" you replied worryingly.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" She glanced at her bedroom door, then back to you. \"I'm so sorry about my sister. She's kinda...well, you know.\" She put you on the pillow next to her.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\nLarissa yawned silently, hands behind her head, and laid down on the pillow that was beside yours. \"Don't worry about my sister. I'll hide you from her whenever she comes around.\" She then switched the lamp off, turned to her side, and went to sleep. Fishing out your phone again, you went through the digital folder, and smiled at the pictures of Larissa and her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightbulb then flashed through your mind. If you had Larrisa's pictures, then why not take some of her sister? You shook away the horrifying images from earlier out of your head. As much as you hated it, she was beautiful and so were her feet. Her soles and toes would make an excellent collection to your adventure. With renewed vigor, you climbed down, jogged across the wooden floor, and entered your \"master's\" lair. Her snoring could be heard, and you walked towards the sound with fear, hate, and lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up the bedsheets that were drapped at the side of her bed, you reached the top. Her feet were within your sight, illuminated by the faint moonlight that was shed by the open window. You could feel the draft of the frosty air as it touched your face oh so delicately. You pulled out your phone, and took snapshots of her soles and, once you were able to get into position, her magnificent toes. You felt overwealming feelings while doing so. Steadily walking, you came up to her face. You sighed, wondering how such a wonderful looking girl could have something so hideous inside her. You aimed with precision, and took a picture of her. To your horror, she twitched slightly. Fortunately, it was a false alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew your luck would run out sooner or later though. Just as you were returning to Larissa's room, you turned back, climbed up the drapes, and stepped onto the window ledge. With your heroic pose, dashing smile, and good looks, you decided to investigate the general's colony a little bit more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You climbed down the window to the outside. It was a bit chilly, but that wasn't going to stop you. You wondered how you were going to make it all the way to the school when an idea popped into your head. \"It's crazy, but it's the only one I got,\" you thought to yourself. You walked out into the sidewalk, and waited patiently. People walked by, and passed. Then, a girl came by with her sneakers. She was walking in the direction of your school and had a backpack on. Your school did nighttime tutoring, and you were glad now that they did. \"You only got one shot at this; don't screw it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaped forward, and with lady luck on your side, were able to grab onto her shoelace. If you jumped a second later, you would've jumped right under her shoe and become acquainted with the sidewalk as a pancake. You hung on tight, and the bumpiness didn't settle well with your vision and stomach. You held on just a little longer before you fell. Dizziness and lightheadedness kicked in, but they went away after a bit. You walked to where the colony was and for the first time, saw people digging around and carrying sand into the elevator. You went with one group and descended downwards. You saw the bright, bustling city, once again, right before your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of going straight to the general, you decided it wouldn't hurt to take a detour through the city. People walked to and fro just as if they were going through a normal day. All of them were different ages of men. They wore straggly and unkempt apparel, but they didn't seem to mind. Merchants chanted their wares, the scent of spices filled the air, people chatted casually in hangout spots. You saw the transactions within the marketplace. The currency was an odd spectacle as it seemed to resemble rectangular shards of glass. Then, your eyes rested upon a huge, shining sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giant pearl,\" an auctioneer shouted from on top of a crate boldly, \"12 shards of glass!\" People crowded around and shouted prices. <br>\r\n\"15!\"<br>\r\n\"16!\"<br>\r\n\"18!\"<br>\r\n\"21!\"<br>\r\n\"23!\"<br>\r\n\"We got 23 shards here. Will anyone match it? Going once. Going twice. Sold to the gentleman in the red vest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked past, and entered another section of the town. There was silence, and a dust dune rolled past you; there seemed to be no one here. \"Where did everyone go?\" you asked yourself. Then, a slight noise of someone talking fell upon your ears. You walked towards it, and stumbled upon what looked like a makeshift structure. Entering, you found all of the people in that section of the town on their knees, bowing towards 2 gigantic flip-flops. You gazed in awe and wonder at the scene. Then, enormous brass bells rang above, and the crowd filtered out of the building. A person stood in front of you, just noticing that you were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" you asked him.<br>\r\n\"This? This is a club or hangout for foot enthusiasts.\" He pointed behind him. \"That over there are flip-flops from a giant girl.\" He pointed towards the ceiling and walked towards the shoes. \"Every day, this part of town gathers around to worship the only connection we have from the feet above. Come over here.\" He motioned you closer. \"Put your nose right here.\" You did so, and to your surprise, a strong, familiar scent filled your nostrils. You could definitely smell a young teenage girl's foot upon it. You had a feeling on whose they were, but you couldn't put your finger on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just got them a couple of hours ago,\" he said warily. \"Some soldiers found it and were able to bring it in here. Don't ask how we were able to fit it inside.\"<br>\r\nYou gave a nod. \"Ah, okay. Just so you know, I'm an enthusiast myself.\"<br>\r\nThe man smiled. \"Welcome to the club then.\" He stood in the doorway. \"I'll be heading out. Take care of yourself.\" Then, he walked out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had reached the office were the general resided. Opening the door, he grinned at you, exhaling some smoke. \"You came back, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then. You proved to me you're quick on your feet, and strong enough to carry a soldier away from a danger. I'll let you in on something.\" He pulled out a map and pointed to a few circled locations. \"The soldier you saved was receiving supplies from these locations. If you didn't know, these locations are all treasure troves as well as death traps. We got your cafeteria right here, a place where we get our food, and the classrooms, where we get our wares to help suppot our economy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that stealing, sir?\" you asked casually.<br>\r\nHe stared at you silently, then gave a chuckle, moving his head from left to right. \"Why, in the hell, would you care if we stole something from those...monsters.\" He then proceeded to furiously swipe the things on his desk in one movement. \"We're trying to survive while they're up there, spoiled; they don't know what it's like to be so tiny, watching your back every second of your life, not knowing every second could your last. What it's like to see your comrades...\" A tear glided slowly across his cheek. \"to see your comrades squished slowly, and mercilessly under their soles, a smile of pure enjoyment upon their faces as they grinded their feet into those you traveled and talked with for so long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few deep breathes, then became calm. \"Tomorrow, that's all going to change. Take a look at this.\" He guided you to a scientific research facility. Scientists and workers were in a whirlwind of activity. Inside the glass window, you could see they were constructing something, but you weren't sure what it was. \"That, my friend, is the bomb that will pave the way to a road of safety and the ability to live our normal lives,\" the general proclaimed with confidence in his tone.<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't want to have to go through al the details with you, but it'll cause all human life on the surface to go,\" he snapped his fingers, \"poof, just like that. All structures, along with everything else will be shrunken by the explosion.\" <br>\r\nYour jaw dropped upon hearing his plans. \"That's crazy! Anyways, we'd eventually all die of old age.\"<br>\r\nThe general stood with an amused expression. \"Of course. One thing we did found out though, was that 5% of the girls affected by the bomb would shrink instead of dieing. A remarkable discovery if I do say so myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the people, our size, above the surface?\u201d You asked, concerned.<br>\r\nHe sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, they\u2019d die from the effects as well.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you can\u2019t do this.\u201d<br>\r\nHe stood with no remorse expressed upon his face whatsoever. \"I shall do what I must for the greater good of our civilization.\"<br>\r\n\"This is asinine! You're murdering innocent people!\"<br>\r\nHis ice cold eyes stared into your soul, and his voice was spoke with utmost rigidness. \"We have to strike before they wipe us all out first. Now, either you're with us, or against us. What will it be?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm sorry general, but this is madness,\" you stated boldly.<br>\r\n\"Madness?\" His eyes wandered to his soldiers behind him, then back towards you, amused. \"I'm not going to kick you into an endless pit. However, what I am going to do is this.\" He snapped his fingers, and two guards grabbed your hands and put them behind you back. \"We can't let you go. After all, you've seen too much!\" He pointed to a tunnel. \"Take him to the brig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will regret this!\" you yelled as you were dragged away. \"I won't let you succeed!\" You were taken through a system of dark tunnels, and eventually thrown into a jail cell. You could barely see the soldiers' faces, let alone their entire appearance; that was how ill-lighted the place really was. You took the time to remember the memories you had with giantesses. Sure, they were dangerous, and almost snuffed out your life many times before, but there was something about them, something magical. It was if you couldn't stay away from them, or their divine, and wonderful feet. It was a curse, and a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough what the general was doing was diabolical, you felt a little bad for him, seeing all his friends die under some giant girls' feet. Experiences like that could drive people to insanity, which is probably what happened to him. Now, he wants revenge, but you always knew revenge was never an option. Even after he's killed all of them, he would never truly feel satisfied. There would still be a deep, pitch black hole in his heart. You took psychology classes, so you knew what you were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two guards in front of you fell to the floor, groaning. Another silhouette appeared, and they unlocked your cage. \"Come quickly,\" the silhouette whispered as they dashed away. You followed, and with some sneaking around, were able to escape the base. You were taken to the club with the gigantic flipflops. Your rescuer reveled himself, exposing none other than the guy you met in the club a while back. He smiled. \"During my normal life, I was a scout and spy for the US 8th espionage regiment in Korea.\" He took out some documents and spread them across the surface of the flipflops. \"I heard what happened between you and the general. As you can see here, these documents detail his plans of time schedules and setting. He'll be setting off the bomb in about 8 hours sharp on the surface on Saturday, tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"Why the surface?\" you asked, a bit puzzled.<br>\r\n\"He wanted to make sure the citizens of the city wouldn't notice the launch in front of their eyes, so there would be no resistance.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay. Then what's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 and a half hours till launch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your friend were able to convince fellow foot enthusiasts to join your cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 hours till launch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfiltration of the weapon depot was successful. You and others from the club were able to receive the supplies and replace them with empty crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 hour till launch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou taught the men fighting techniques such as how to hold a weapon (Never point it towards your face!), breathing exercises when aiming, etc. Your espionage friend disappeared; didn't leave a note saying why or where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes till launch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll preparations had been set. You marched your men through the city. Some citizens joined you, others confused, and some trying to make a profit out of the situation. \"Boots for sale! The most comfortable, reasonably priced, and highest quality boots for wartime. Boast as your friends envy your apparel as you march into battle! Buy now, and you'll get not one, but two, yes that right folks, two pairs of boots! Hurry while supplies last!\" one merchant chanted enthusiastically from his store. You just marched ahead on the street, countering any resistance that dared cross your path. All of you took the stairs to surprise the enemy, and you all spilled out onto the surface. The general, along with a few scientists were preparing the giant bomb for takeoff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome to the party, gentleman,\" the general mused.<br>\r\n\"It's over general. The gig is up,\" you said, eyeing him.<br>\r\n\"Oh, ever can I do? You've got me cornered?\" He cackled with laughter. \"Things are not what they always seem, boy.\" He snapped his finger, and soldiers popped out of the tall grass, surrounding you and your men. Evidently, you were outnumbered 3-to-1. \"I always have a backup plan just for situations like these. Now, drop your weapons.\" You and your men did as he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It was a shame, really. You were a fine soldier, and I would've promoted you to be my right-hand man if you stuck around. However, I have to remove any threat that jeopardizes the mission.\" He pulled out his pistol, and pointed it at you. \"I take it you were the mastermind behind this?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" you dully said.<br>\r\n\"Why would you go to lengths for them?\" He waved his pistol at his surroundings. \"They are the enemy! All they want is to have you dead, and you're trying to save them?!\"<br>\r\n\"They're not what you think!\" you bursted out, \"They're loving, caring, and are a part of us. They deserve to live just as much as we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his gun, then back to you. \"R...really?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\nHe breathed a few deep breathes, his face stone cold. \"Blasphemy.\" he whispered through his lips. His fingers reached for the trigger, and you saw your life flash before your eyes. Just when you thought you would feel the impact of a bullet, a shadow enveloped the general and you saw a foot come down from above. It was lightning fast, and it slammed down onto his body. She grind her foot, and you could see the general was no more. Gazing up, you saw your espionage friend and Larrissa. She smiled warmly and waved. The general's army that surrounded you put down their weapons in fear, and one of them hoisted up a white flag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour men shut down the bomb, and Larrissa lifted up her barefoot. The general layed there, a gruesome sight. It was fate that he would be squashed underfoot, just like his comrades.The soldiers escorted everyone, and carried the lifeless general back into the city.Your friend got onto the ground, and winked at you, entering the city also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your friend told me all I needed to know,\" she spoke.<br>\r\n\"Ah, alright. You made it just in time too.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I did.\" She smiled. \"I'm just glad you're okay.\" She lowered her hand to the ground. \"Com'on, let's go home. I got a surprise waiting for ya.\"<br>\r\nYou hopped on top of it. \"Okay.\" From there on, you headed on home.</span></div></div>",

And thinking is not good in this situation. You just gave her the GO! to kill you and she will without any remorse and with an broad smile on her face. Should you really do this? you are young. You have your whole life still to live. But at this size this would happen sooner or later anyways. Or even a worse fate.</span></div></div>",

After a felt year lying under the arch of a red sexy designer boot the door opened. You turned your head aside and just saw the black shoes move into your field of vision. \"Hey little guy, where are you? You didn't run from a little girl like me?\", she giggled as she walked into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled out and looked at her. You almost fainted by the sight. She had put on some black hold up fishnets and a mainly black dress with red accents that was cut diagonal over her thighs. If normalsized you could have barely seen the laced top of the hold ups. Maybe if she was dancing or sitting down. She had put on a silver necklace and some really nice earrings. If you didn't knew she would kill you, you would have been sure she was going out to the discothek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see little men?\", she asked. You couldn't say anything and just barely nod your head as your eyes drifted up and down her gigantic body. She had crossed her arms over her breasts and lifted the sole of her shoe, the heel still on the ground to let you see. She really seemed to use this shoes for dancing usually. There where stains of different liquids everywhere on her almost plain sole. Scratches and some pieces of glass where stuck into the hard leather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be the last thing you'll see\", she said. \"You see, I always dreamed of smashing a guys stuff while he was watching but it never came to it so far. And the best thing is you couldn't do anything about it at your state. You once told me where you have your spare key but I am so anticipated that I want to feel your body squish under me right now!\"</span></div></div>",

This was your greatest wish, but your knees gave a way from fear and tears started to run down your face. It wasn't like you imagined, although you had a great boner in your pants. You didn't scream, just watched as the sole lowered down onto you slowly. \"Ohh this is great!\", she moaned. Vanessa started to rub her huge breast. The anticipation alone almost drove her mad of lust. This power she suddenly had was overwhelming. She often did nasty things to people by breaking their stuff. Walking through playgrounds and braking the childstoys under her shoes or trampling the food in a restaurant in front of the waiter. She loved it being that way and you loved watching her doing this stuff as it turned you really on but you never told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sole was just touching your fragile little body and the pressure started to apply, she suddenly stopped. \"No little one. Not yet.\" You knew it took her a lot of selfcontrol to not turn you into an unrecognizable stain in this instant. But she made it somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole finaly let you free and you could see that she took her hand out from underneath her dress. You where still terrified but also very excited at the same time. \"Let's go she said as she grabbed you with the hand that was in her pussy just moments ago. The smell overwhelmed you instantly and you drove nuts from sexual excitement. You couldn't anything against your hand unzipping your pants and start to jack up. Vanessa looked at you with a broad smile on her face. \"Oh, how cute. Let me handle that.\" Your futile defense was really funny to her. She simply took both of your hands between her thumb and indexfinger and lifted you up a little bit. Then she tore down your trousers and started to massage your little buddy gently with the small finger of her other hand. It was almost as big as you but she really was carefull and you came almost in an instant. \"That was quick\", she laughed. \"At least you havn't done as much mess as men usually do\" She thought for a moment with you still dangling in her hand and placed you into a shoe on the floor. \"Lets go\", she said as she lifted the shoe that was almost the size of an small appartment up and walked out into her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole way she didn't say a word and you could just hear the popmusik from her radio and the noise from the engine and the tires on the streets. Again you had too much time to think about your decisions. You wanted to have kids and make a family. You wanted to only once drive a ferrari and wanted to see Shanghai and Paris, Moskau and other cities in the world. Because of your fetish you where even to inhibitet to start a sexual relationship with a women. Just now was the first time you where ever touched by someone except your self down there and it was great! You will never experience this again. You will never see this citys, you will never drive a ferrari and you will never start a family. Your days are counted. In fact. Your hours or even minutes are counted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car came to an halt. You heard the handbrake crack in and the engine went dead. Your world shook once again. \"Had a nice ride\", she asked without expecting an answer. You couldn't see where she went, but you knew she was on her way into front porch to get the hidden sparekey. The clacking of her heels on the tarmac stopped suddenly as she walked onto the lawn leaving deep imprints in the gras with her stilletos. You knew she wouldn't really care about the flowers in the bed. She made sure to step on as many of them without going to much out of her way. \"These flowers where really nice\", she said with a smile you couldn't see. You felt yourself lowering as she bend down to pick up the stone with the key underneath. \"Bye spidy\", she said more to herself as the 8 legged animal vanished under her shoe and was pressed into her footprint. Then the clacking of her heels started again shortly before you heard the key turn around in the lock. You where at home. </span></div></div>",

Then the clacking started again as she walked into the living room. \"Nice\", she said. You where lowered again and she tilted the shoe so you fell out. She was standing in front of you, still smiling and breathing heavy. \"You don't need this stuff no more anyway. If you don't mind, I take what I like and destroy the rest.\" She sounded like a little girl who just got a real pony. You wanted to say something but she turned around and just thought loudly: \"and if you mind I don't care. What shall you do anyways?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away from your position on the telephone table and looked at the stuff in the room. Opened the closets and searched them, emptiyng everything on the ground. Dokuments, glasses, plates, discs and other stuff landed on the floor and broke or simply lay there. This was horrible. To die a quick death is something. But to see all your private belongings beeing searched and destroyed was something completly different. Especially if you will die afterwards in any case. In any case? You look around and see the phonecord which was reaching almost to the ground before it dissapeard in the wall. This maybe was the last chance to escape.

Well, prepare to enjoy them...forever!\" And with that, she grabs your tiny build and brings you to her bare feet. She positions you right between her big and middle toes, and scrunches them hard. You feel your right arm and pelvis shatter under the stress. After what seems like ages of tourture, she brings you to the ground. The soft carpet relaxes you for a second, but leaves you unprepared for the next bout of tourture. She raises he right foot up high, and brings it crashing down your broken body. She crushed your left arm and both legs flattened and most all of the rest of your body. You begin coughing up blood, and this is just the first. She continues this in rapid succession, breaking what seems like everything, but miraculously leaving you barely alive. You are stuck to the bottom of her sole, and she has to peel your flattened form off of her towering soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how do you like me? You should be grateful that you are being crushed by me, your goddess. And I am a goddess. I shrunk you, just so I could toy with you, and then crush you like a bug. That IS what you are now,nothing more than a crushed bug, squished under my great and powerfull feet. Do you like my feet? How about my toes? My toes are lovely, aren't they? Kiss them. Now.\" She lowers you to her big toe. You slowly reach your head over and give it a peck. \"That was pitiful. Lick it. Lick it good.\" This time, you use all your strength to move your tounge up and down her giant toe. \"Good. Now, you will stay forever on my toe. Hope you got aquanted with it. You'll stay there for a long time...\" And with that, she layed you on her toenail and grabbed a bottle of nail polish. She lowered the brush, hovering over you, and slowly painted right over your body, gluing it to the nail. When she was done, you could barely see your body, except for a slight outline. \"There, that should do it.\" Satisfied, she put her sandals, and went out to show her friends her new toenail polish.</span></div></div>",

What made you not go after her, you weren't sure of. It was an inside gut feeling, and you felt like there was something better out there. A streetlamp's dim light was the only comfort you had. You gazed up to the sky. A shooting star caught your eye, it smoothing gliding across. You crossed your hands. \"Man,\" you grunted, \"I'm crazy if I think this is going to work. \"Star, if you could help out, can you help give me another chance to fulfill my fantas-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then you noticed a giant Latina girl come into your view. You rubbed your eyes, recognizing her as Karen from school. She wore glasses, had light brown hair with dirty blond highlights, had tight jeans she always wore to school, and had the hugest ass you had ever seen. Both you and her <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">are</span>, I mean, used to be best friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during the 9th grade. You would hang out with my friends at the benches under the trees. Usually you would all play card games like Blackjack, War, Poker, etc. You and your friends usually brought a dollar everyday for betting. Some days, you would win, others, you would lose. However, one day, you all didn't bet on cards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren passed by the benches one day, and you watched dreamily as she walked away; one of your friends noticed. \"Hey man,\" he grinned, asking you,\"she has a nice ass huh?\" Your friends looked up from there cards, seeming to agree. <br>\r\nYou nodded, \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\nWhen she was out of sight, your friend put down his cards. \"How about we do a bet?\"<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrow slowly. \"What kind of bet?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, all of us at this table will pay you $2.50 each, which adds up to $12.50. All you have to do is touch her ass as she walks by you in class. If you don't do it by the time the bell rings, you'll have to pay each of us $2.50.\" Surprisingly, you watched as all the other guys agreed to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your jaw wide-open. \"I can't do that...\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like we got ourselves un gallina!\"<br>\r\n\"I am not a coward!\" you retorted.<br>\r\nHe casually smirked, leaning forward and placing his hands on the table, looking straight into your eyes. \"Then show us.\" <br>\r\nYou gulped, and, after a slight pause, agreed to the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was history, the last class of the day. You, Karen, and a few of your other friends had the same classes. You looked at your friend, Karen's, ass. It was a beautiful masterpiece, and your heart beat rapidly and your palms quivered at the thought of touching it. You looked up to her face and at that moment, Karen turned around. \"Hey,\" she said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n\"How was your day?\"<br>\r\n\"Good. You?\"<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Then she turned around. (Odd how most of our conversations seem to end up somewhat similar to this...) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the teacher passed out the pop quizzes. Everyone in the class groaned, but it was back to being silent. You could only focus on the bet, however, and time was ticking. As you tried to figure out ways to get enough money to pass off your friends, there was a faint \"crack\" sound. Karen got up, and walked past you. You heart paced more rapidly, but you couldn't do it. She went to the back and sharpened her pencil. When she came back, you mustered all the courage you could and the deed was done. You touched her ass, which felt like the finest silk ever created on the Earth. She walked pass, and went back to her desk. Your friends bellowed out an \"Ohhhhhh\". The bell rang, and you watched as Karen walked out of the classroom, her face completely red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, whenever you tried to approach her, she would turn back and avoid you like the plague. You sent her e-mails and text messages, which were left unanswered. It continued the day after that, and so forth. Most days, you would see her hanging out with her friends. Looking at your $12.50, it didn't seem worth over losing a friend over. You still had a crush on her, and, because you sat diagonally back from her, you settled for fantasizing being shrunk and exploring her wonderful ass. One day, you were looking at it when she turned around. You turned your head to your paper. Out of the corner of your eye, you could've sworn she was grinning. Maybe she was grinning because her friend told her a joke? To this day, you never really knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. It felt like time was going so slowly. The frosty wind chilled you, and Karen looked even more beautiful from that viewpoint. You continued watching her, and as you did, it seemed like her ass was getting bigger. Wait, no it wasn't; it was descending straight on top of you!</span></div></div>",

Now that you thought about it, you weren't really ready to die yet. As you tried to get up, sudden pressure from above and below kept you laying down and trapped! You felt an increase in elevation, and before you knew it, a chunk of the sandwich that you had within your view had already been bitten off. <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/shock.png\" alt=\"*Shock*\" title=\"Shock\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> You saw May chew, and then swallow, a lump slowly going down her throat. She had a dreamy expression upon her face. \"O.m.g, that tasted SOOO good!\" You saw how she rubbed and patted her belly. It excited, yet frightened you at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled in your direction, still not knowing you were there. Her pearly whites practically said, \"welcome\". Licking her lips, she took another chunk, with you in it. You were falling, but caught onto something slimy; it was then you noticed it was her tongue. You got a better grip, and rode it like the cowboys did in rodeos. You evened yelled, \"Yee-haw!\" as you did. It was a monstrous beast, however. The strength of it was 3x stronger and faster than a regular bull. Also, the sliminess loosened your grip. All these contributing factors weakened you and you couldn't hold on much longer. You fell down the dark cavern, and the walls sent you plummeting down. Eventually, you plopped into her stomach. The acid caused a painful sensation to your skin, so you climbed on top of a piece of lettuce. You were thankful that May always ate fast, so she didn't chew the food much before she swallowed it usually. You saw how the food around you was deteriorating. You layed on the piece of lettuce, watching as the last of the sandwich came down. Sounds came from outside the walls; you guessed it was just May rubbing her belly contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd, the feelings that you had at that moment. You had no regret to being there. In fact, you <i>wanted</i> to be there. Also, May was your always your enemy. You chuckled slightly. \"I guess you won May!\" you shouted, although knowing it was falling on deaf ears. \"You got me.\" The acid level increased, and you noticed how the bottom of your lettuce boat was gone. You sighed, one that you take when you lost a game, bet, etc. Since you played videogames, you knew what you had to say next. You looked above, and said hoarsely, \"Good game.\" You held your nose and decided to get it over with. You dived in, and closed your eyes. The pain was excruciating and unbearable. Through it all, you were smiling the whole time. Soon, it was all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nMay's Pov<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay ate her sandwich and she couldn't believe how great it tasted. She rubbed her belly and sighed happily. She could've sworn she heard someone talking, but she just figured it was her imagination. For some reason, she felt like she had won against someone. It was an amazing feeling for her. She smirked and went outside to go play Tennis with Vannessa.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How cute tell you what worm if you can win at one of my games I might spare your life...how about it shrimp want to play?\" She asked in a sharp imitation of the horror flick Child's Play slowly you nodded it wasn't like you had much of a choice anyway and May giggled and set you at her really big feet <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay good now get ready for we're about to play.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to jump, but seeing as you didn't have any other choice, you closed your eyes and did a leap of faith. It reminded you of Altiar from Assasin's Creed. You wanted to land on the table, but you crashed onto the floor instead. You screamed in agony; your arm felt large spikes in pain. It didn't help that you were soaked to the bone with soup juice either. Everything seemed blurry from the pain, and you almost fell into unconsciousness. Wincing, you dragged yourself to the dark hallway. You heard May still eating the soup that you were just in earlier. To think that you would have died right there, probably in her stomach acids by now. You grinned weakly, thinking about and it, but that grin slowly turned into a frown. \"I didn't have the guts to do it,\" you thought, frustrated. \"I should've let her eat me. At least then, I would die living my fantasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you thought this, you heard a door open in the hallway. A mysterious figure entered your view. You weren't sure who it was, but the next thing you knew, they looked down at you, and slowly grasped you into their hands. You felt the softness underneath you, and there was this warm feeling in the air. Everything was blurry again, and this time, you knocked out for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moonlight reached your eyes, and the chill of the night descended upon you. \"Ugh, my head,\" you moaned, slowly waking up. You sat up, and felt that familiar spike of pain again in your right arm. Your surroundings indicated that you were in someone's room, on their bed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey now, don't rush it.\" You looked around for the voice, but it wasn't until you gazed up that you found her. She had curly, short hair, and coffee brown eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you asked, a bit weary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Amy, you know, May's sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May's sister huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's weird at times, but I still love her,\" she smiled. \"I saw that you had a broken arm, so put you on my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You didn't know anything about her, but she seemed alright for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly rumbled suddenly, which scared the daylights out of you, but it also seemed to excite you... \"You want anything to eat while I make myself a snack?\" she asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good.\" you said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eyebrow, and shrugged. \"Okay then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the room, leaving you to think about how close you were to losing your life, and the events that would unfold in the future.</span></div></div>",

Outside of the bottle, you could see a bed and a dresser. You try to climb out, but the opening is too high for you. Suddenly, the place starts to rumble a little, causing you to fall over. May entered the room holding something behind her back. She got real close to your bottle and tapped it. Her tapping was making it hard to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello little guy? How are you? You know, I've never seen a bug like you.\" She says with a creepy grin. She pulls out her other hand with the item she was holding. It was another bottle with 3 more insects. They were a ladybug, a small butterfly, and an ant. You were scared to see them trapped like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad that all of you could join me for lunch. She sat down on the bed next to you and started to open the bug jar. After she pulled the lid off, she quickly grabbed the butterfly's wings. It desperately tried to get away. She licked her lips and used her free hand to push the butterfly in her mouth. You saw it disappear in her, May's mouth closed and started to chew. She swallowed and opened her mouth to reveal only tiny bits left of the poor creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a shame, I thought it would taste like butter. That's where it gets its name right?\" She shrugged and went for the next insect. Next came the ladybug. It crawled right on her hand, unaware of what was about to happen. She lifted it up to her face and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you are a ladybug. So if I had played with you, would that make me a lesbian, since you're a female?\" She giggled and tossed it into her gaping maw. The poor ant was next. She picked it up and laid down on her back. She gave it some licks. You beat on the glass to try and get her attention. She simply ignores you and keeps tasting the ant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mystery bug. I'll get to you soon enough. In the mean time, I hope this little guy enjoys his new permanANT home.\" She opens her mouth and drops the little ant in. After it lands in her mouth, all you can see is the little lump pass down her throat. She sits up and grabs your bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what you'll taste like. I bet you will taste sweet, after all, you did hide in my breasts before.\" She licks her lips, slowly swaying her hips side to side.</span></div></div>",

You can't see it, but May is a little embarrassed. \"Come on, open up and let me see, or do you want me to force your mouth open?\" Her mother giggles. Slowly, May opens her mouth and pulls out her tongue. Her mother looks in and sees your struggling body. \"A struggling creature? Oh well, that's fine.

May's mother traced the lump of your body going down May's throat with her finger. She then rubbed her daughter's belly and gave her a little kiss. \"How did your little victim taste?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wonderful, it was the tastiest creature I ever had.\" May gave a satisfied burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it knows it's place in the world.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You notice an attractive blonde woman leaning up against a tree smoking. She is wearing nerdy type glasses (they look hot on her), a tight white sweater,tight black skirt, and tight black square toe leather boots.   She looks almost graceful as she smokes. You make your way towards the smoking woman. As you approach you begin to smell the aroma of her cigarette. You cough a little bit. It is enough to get her attention. She looks at you and steps back in shock. Then she kicks you sending you flying through the air. The woman storms over and stomps her high heeled boot right next to you taking another drag off her cigarette. She smiles at you revealing a shiny pair of braces as she bends over and picks you up. The woman then sniffs you very primally then licks you. The smell of cigarettes was heavy on her breath. As she took another drag she blew her smoke right in your face. The woman laughs as she ashes her cigarette on top of you. She then tightens her grip with one hand as she grabs your left arm like a crank ot a wind up car. She twists and breaks your arm with no effort at all. You scream in pain as she bellows out a sadistic laugh. You beg her to stop but she dosent respond. The woman then brings you to her face and qucikly bites your left arm right off. You scream in sheer agony as you watch your captor swallow your entire arm. She turns you upside down and dangles you by the leg above her mouth mocking you as she tastes the blood rushing from where your arm used to be. Then the woman drops you to the ground. As you hit the ground you hear many bones snap. The fall has left you winded and unsure if you are even able to walk. You look up to see  her gigantic cigarette butt coming down. It hits the ground next to you. As she exhales her drag she twists out the butt with her gigantic boot. You notice the twisted remains of the cigarette butt encrusted in the sole pattern of the giant woman's boot. She instructs you to clean them and dangles her boot directly overtop of you. You struggle to get up after the fall but manage to do so. You reach up for her boot when she pulls it away. \"Not with your hand you little dip shit!! With your tongue!!\" You begin to lick her boot sole. It tastes like cigarette ashes and burnt rubber. You lick it for a half an hour straight before the woman moves her boot. You look up at her just as she spits down on you. The ball of saliva exploded with a splash soaking you. You begin to feel queasy from all the blood you lost. You fall face first into the spit puddle. You feel the giant woman pick you up by your head. She pinches your head with her forefinger and thumb and once again dangles you in front of her face. She grins exposing her braces. She holds your head as she scrapes your face across her sharp metal braces. You cut your face badly. She licks you again. The woman then licks her braces then her lips as she dangles your entire body over her mouth. You dangle from your remaining arm. You are slowly lowered towards her mouth. You can feel her teeth with your legs. Suddenly they close around your legs like clamps. You barely have the energy to scream. She swallows with delight. Still being held by your arm, the giantess pinches hard smooshing your remaining arm and tosses you to the ground like a piece of trash. You watch as the giant woman steps over you and walks away with her high heels clicking. She walks over to the three girls on the bench, tells them somthing and walks away like nothing happened. The three girls come rushing over to find you..</span></div></div>",

She tried to eat you again, but broke her teeth and her braces biting on your robotic legs. She dropped you to the ground, and began to lower her heel on you.
