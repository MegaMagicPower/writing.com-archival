The birds in the southern forest were chirping, including the blue feathered, black wing tipped, orange beaked Sirens over by the lake in the middle of the forest.  The city folks were going about their business, just like they do every day, some went to the market, others went to their jobs, and others went to the castle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And out of one of those castle windows, the Princess was watching, waiting for her friend and servant Thomas.  She was a beautiful 5ft. 2in. (about 1.57 meters) slim 16 year-old with olive skin, short wavy brown hair, and somewhat small hazel eyes.  Today she was wearing forest green dress that complimented her eyes and white silk gloves that went up to her elbows.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a knock at the door to her room, \"Come in,\" she said turning around to see a skinny 6ft. 2in. (about 1.88 meter) 17 year-old boy with dark skin, short straight brown hair, and almond shaped green eyes.  He was wearing his usual footman uniform, which consisted of a fancy red coat with a black trim, red knee breeches, and black stockings.  \"Good morning Thomas.  How are you today?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good morning Princess Carrie, I am doing well today,\" the boy, Thomas, said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Princess sighed wishing that he would drop the formalities and relax while he was with her.  Knowing that the order to relax while he was with her would be ignored for the umpteenth time she decided to drop it and move on.  \"What is my schedule for today?  Do we have tutoring today?\"  She was hoping that they didn't, she hated her studies especially math, which looked like Swahili to her; but to Thomas it was a breeze he could do complex math problems in his sleep.  The only subject that the Princess excelled at was languages, which was the only thing Thomas struggled with besides Chemistry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Today you have...</span></span></div></div>",

Charles asked for unreasonable things hoping for Thomas to say that he will quit, just as the other footmen did.  Thomas was the only one that could put up with Charles's abuse; and the one that stopped Miss Moses from quitting when Charles demanded that she teach his sister quantum physics, knowing that Miss Moses could not teach anything above chemistry and hoping to make it so that he would get the crown instead of his sister.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have the day off, so you do not have to worry about your brother trying to get me to quit out of frustration.\"  Thomas said with a smile, knowing full well that she was worried about him leaving for good.  He was worried that the prince would take advantage of his absence to concoct some new scheme to get the crown before the princess and ordering her execution.  Thomas dreaded the thought of Charles becoming king, and had taken special steps to make sure that Charles could not do anything today by asking Miss Moses to teach the prince and princess how to knit; knowing Charles hated anything that had to do with making something non-lethal or seeing something cute.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thomas remembered Charles ordering one servant to give Carrie's 5 month-old kitten some milk that was laced with cyanide, the kitten died within 20 minutes after lapping the tainted milk.  When Thomas tried to clear the servant's name he was told that if he did not watch himself he would be sent to the dungeon for the remainder of his life.  From then on, Thomas did everything he could to prevent Charles from hurting Carrie in anyway, the other servants helped in anyway they could, however some of them either got fired or quit after several months had gone by.  The rest are either too scared or determined to help with the small things to make sure Charles failed in his attempts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now that Charles is taken care of and Carrie heading to her class, Thomas decided that he would meet up with his old friend, Ace, at the market.  Ace is a tall shrewd traveling merchant with sharp beady green eyes that can spot a fake or a flaw in a matter of seconds, his short wavy brown hair is done in a lion's mane, and is always dressed in black.  They had agreed to meet at The Weeping Minotaur tavern.  When Thomas got there, he saw Ace with another friend of theirs.  It was...</span></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Thomas is a servant to a royal family, from a different planet.  One day he helps a complete stranger and they give him a ring that gives him a small amount of power over life and death.  The only way he can get the full power of his new abilities is to climb the ranks of his new side job until he reaches the title of \"True Death\".  Can he fight a new radical group that is going around and destroying his mentors' and allies' abilities?  Can he fight a group that will stop at nothing until no one can die?  Or will he witness the apocalypse with everyone coming back from the dead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\nKeep the POV in 3rd person omniscient, no changing POV in the middle of the chapter (it gets confusing and I will not hesitate to delete a chapter if it is beyond repair)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo not throw in random items (i.e. a motorcycle appearing out of thin air)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep the story consistent, I have seen stories go down the drain because of inconsistencies (if anyone spots one of my chapters being inconsistent, please notify me)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will be a life side otherwise it would get very dull in a hurry, and yes they will have a \"True Life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters that are either agents of life or death will probably have a tattoo or a necklace (it depends on what they do for a living, so if an agent of death is a cook do not give them any jewelry)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring, as well as tattoos or whatever the agents have, can transform into a weapon, however the character must chant a certain phrase to activate it (the person who comes up with the chant will be given 1,000 GPs and it will be the main chant for either the life side or the death side)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just because there are agents of death, dose not mean that they have to kill every time and try to not have killing in every chapter, it will get predictable if there is death in every chapter; same goes for the life side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I found out that there is a book called Death's Apprentice and I did not know about it until after I started writing this story)</td>",
