There's a boy you've been dating, but you think he's been cheating on you.  Your best friend will help you with your plan to spy on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Natalie Harrington aged 22 and are best friends with Katrina who wants help to spy on her boyfriend.  Your attic has a couple of chemical formula's in two bottles that you've recently discovered hidden away in an old dusty book with a secret compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Rachel Harrington aged 17 in your final year of school and you are sure your best friend is trying to split up you and your boyfriend so she can have him all to herself.  Your big sister is in university, but recently has found something strange in the attic when you were both cleaning yesterday.  A note fell out of the book and you picked it up to discover a list of chemical instructions to create two solutions.  One to shrink and the other to work as an antidote for anything shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Julia Robertson aged 18 and are best friends with Rachel.  Seeing her and her boyfriend together has been making you feel very jealous though since you've always wanted Rachel to see you as more than a friend.  You have a younger sister called Sarah aged 14 who teases you about your feelings towards Rachel since you find it difficult to tell her how you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a trip back to the origin of the formula.</span></div></div>",

She stands at a height of 5'10 and has a DD cup chest.  Her skin is pale yet smooth and she has some light freckles around her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's another day at university and you were supposed to meet up with your boyfriend after classes, but he hasn't shown up.  Natalie sees you still standing around waiting after she walks by an hour after Tanako was meant to meet up with you.<br>\r\n\"Stood up again?\"  She asks with a light sigh.  You nod in response looking down into your best friend's warm brown eyes.  A gust of wind blows, causing her light chestnut brown hair to flutter about in the single braid she has with it tied halfway down her back in a small pink ribbon.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he keeps making excuses and the last few times I checked with the tutors.  He wasn't where he mentioned and so I know he's lying to me and I'm sure it must be because he's seeing another woman.\"  You tell your friend.  She puts her arms around you and gives you a warm hug.<br>\r\n\"I can't see why anyone would want to be with another woman when they have you, I mean, you're quite slender and have a decent sized chest.  Not quite as big as my F cups, but then I've never really known why men seem to like huge tits anyways.\"  She mentioned.  \"Hey, how about we spy on him?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm not sure about that, what if he sees me and it turns out he's got a good reason for not telling me the truth?\"  You ask.  \"He knows you're my friend too, so sending you to spy on him wouldn't work either.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I just found something in my attic the other day and I think it would be perfect for this.\"  She mentions with a smile, taking you by the hand and rushing off with you in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes you reach Natalie's home.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...doesn't look like sis is back home yet.\"  Natalie mentioned as she unlocked the door and let you inside before heading to her bedroom and closing the door.  Once the door was closed she unlocked the top drawer of the vanity table and pulled out what looked like two large perfume bottles.<br>\r\n\"I don't see how putting on a little perfume is going to help.\"  You mention to her.<br>\r\n\"Actually...it's not perfume Kat, it's a shrinking potion and the antidote.\"  She tells you.  You frown a little and sigh.<br>\r\n\"Come on Natalie, I'm not in the mood for games.\"  You tell her.<br>\r\n\"It's not a game, it's true.\"  Natalie grinned.  \"I put a little drop on my tongue and shrunk down to 5'3\", before that I was 5'4\"  The antidote works just fine too.\"  She explained.  \"So, want to try it out?\"  Natalie asked you.</span></div></div>",

She has warm brown eyes and stands at a height of 5'4\" with an F-cup chest and a medium to slender body frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening you were tidying up the attic with your little sister, Rachel, when you stumbled upon an old dusty box.  Carefully you set it down and blew the dust off of the lid before opening it up and letting out a sneeze as the dust in the air begun to settle.  Inside there were two large bottles.  One had a light blue coloration to it and the other had a slight yellowish tint to it.  Upon closer inspection of the two bottles you discover the remains of two time worn labels reading 'sh nki g fo mula' and 'ant do e'.  The rest of the words are a little too worn to make out, but as you look upon them you realise what they spell and let out a gasp.  You never realised such a thing as a shrinking formula could be created, let alone an antidote for such a thing.  Carefully you look across to your sister.  She's 5 years younger than you with blondish brown hair and clear blue eyes.  She's always been quite small statured, standing at a height of 4'7\" with a B-cup chest and a slim yet sturdy looking body frame.  The possibility exists to try out the potion on your sister, but what if she doesn't want to?  Maybe you should try a little yourself?</span></div></div>",
