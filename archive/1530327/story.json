He found his body laying around and sighed. Slowly picking up himself, he tried to run to Tail's house before realizing he couldn't run as fast as before. \"Is this how slow everyone actually runs?\" He says to no one. Dragging his body, he decides to call a taxi and drive him to his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he slowly arrives to Tail's place, he thinks about what Amy is doing. Was she gone? Would Tail's have to put her in <i>his</i> body? His thoughts were interrupted as the car stopped. \"Here's your stop.\" The driver shouts. Sonic nods and gives him change from his pocket and leaves. As he <i><b>slowly</b></i> runs to Tail's door dragging his body, Knuckles appears and greets him. \"Hey Amy. What happened to the idiot?\" Sonic would've gotten angry but he was in a crisis right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Knuckles, can you push me all the way to Tails door?\" Sonic asks, sighing. Knuckles looks at him strangely before pushing both Sonic/Amy's body and his body. He stops himself before Tails door and slams it open, Knuckles right behind him. \"Tails come here!\" He shouts. After a few seconds, Tails comes walking with his gear still on. \"What's wrong Am- oh. So it worked Sonic?\" Tails asks, his voice cheery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sonic sighs and Knuckles even more confused. \"Can you change us back? And I don't know where Amy is.\" Sonic nagged and cringing afterwards. \"Sonic..? How did you get in..?\" Knuckles asked, trying to process what just happened. Before Sonic can answer, Tails grabs him and drags him to his lab. \"I can walk you know.\" He says and Tails laughs. \"Oh yea, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tails tells Sonic that he has to stay in Amy's body for a few weeks before going back to his body and in the mean time, Amy in his. \"This feels weird.. Amy inside my body already gives me shivers.\" Sonic says, not noticing Amy's cheeks becoming pink. Knuckles stands by them as they start the process. After a while, Sonic's body slowly wakes up. Rubbing her/sonic's eyes, she soon realizes she's in Sonic's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What does Amy do first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could hear Tails and Knuckles laughing and started getting angry. \"Oh Sonikku, you really are adorable. Blushing because of me!\" Amy says hugging him tighter as he trying to push her away.

There was only one way though, by undressing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around to make sure he was completely alone. When satisfied, he got to work. He took every piece of clothing off of Blaze's body from her gloves and shoes, to her cloak and bodysuit, to her underwear until she was completely naked. Sonic was in awe when he saw his new bare body. As of now, Blaze was the very first woman Sonic had ever seen in the nude. He breathed heavily at the sight, his/her heart was beating as fast as when he normally runs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly impatient, he began to run her hands through her soft, furry body. Her hands moved everywhere from her breasts to her tail. That chill constantly came back wherever he touched her, but again he enjoys it. Especially whenever he touches her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he came to a halt as he felt something wet between her legs. He looked down and saw her intimate area partially wet. Upon realization, he pieced together that this must be how women... er... relieve themselves. Now that Sonic is possessing Blaze, her urges are his as well. Sonic was now more than curious to try and pleasure his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

Sure, when she was a hedgehog, she could collect some magic jewelry and could posses godlike power. But even then, this type of thing was unheard of to Sonic and her friends. What strange manifestation of chaos energy could have done this? Now as she looked on to her body with a large burn mark on the old Sonic's chest, it was clear now that Sonic was dead. Rouge was all that remained. This would beg the question, should Sonic tell her friends about this? Would they call her crazy and never believe her? Or maybe worse, they do believe her and she will never hear the end of it? However, Sonic would need more time to decide. For now, she will have to get into the role of Rouge, seeing as Sonic's friends that were assisting the assault on Eggman's base have caught up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shadow skated around the corner, decimating an eggbot with the flick of his wrist. A single chaos spear shredding through the metal machine. Shadow's gaze turned to Sonic in Rouge's body. He had seen her get pushed to safety by Sonic, but did not expect the worst. \"Rouge...\" The black hedgehog's eyes drifted to Sonic's limp corpse. His red irises staring at it blankly. For years, they have been rivals. Hell, he would never admit it, but he would have even called Sonic a friend. One of the few he had left in this world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A tinge of guilt went through Sonic as she contemplated. Everyone would think that Mobius's savior is dead. This would be depressing and sad to see her friends mourn her when her body may be dead but her mind is still kicking. To the same affect, this offered a chance at a new life. Being the world's hero was a bit of a drag at times, and she was sure Shadow could handle it with the help of Silver and the others. But again, that begs the question of whether or not she should tell them. She would need some time to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He's dead...\" Shadow mumbled to himself, just barely loud enough for Sonic to hear him. Sonic didn't know what to say. Knuckles and Tails came up behind him. Fury lighting up in Knuckes's eyes as tears ran down Tails's face. \"I will kill that bastard...\" Knuckles frowned, referring to Eggman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Rouge?\" Shadow asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of the cards on the table, Sonic is left with two options. </span></div></div>",

It was fairly cloudy outside, thunder crackling back and forth. Sonic hates water, so he did his best to rush back as quick as he could. The cool breeze on his fur was worth it, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavy rain's rolling in, Wave. You should stay the night.

She adjusted her goggles over her eyes and jumped onto the board, kicking backward with her other foot and turning to stand on it at an angle as it boosted her forward. A crackle rippled over head and a yellow bolt of lightning struck down at the purple feathered skater. With his literal lightning speed, Sonic's heroic instincts made him leap out of the stool and sprint as fast as he could move his legs, tackling the girl off her board. The bolt missed her by just a hair, but struck the board with full might, causing it to translate the shock onto the two that now lay in the grass.

He was on his way home in the city of Westopolis to his apartment when he sensed something strange. It was definitely out of the ordinary. Taking a quick detour, the furry anti-hero made his way toward it, running and jumping up to the rooftops and found an odd looking Chaos Emerald. This one in particular had taken on a color that of which he hadn't seen before. All the other original 7 emeralds were colored green, light blue, dark blue, purple, red, white, and yellow. The glowing pink jewel had an odd aura to it which is why he sensed it from far away. The black and red hedgehog hesitantly walked towards the glowing emerald, and reached out a gloved hand to grab it. As soon as he did, it began to glow a bright pink as its aura overcame him and he passed out, unable to let go of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shadow awoke later, the emerald gone. But now he was in a pink colored room, grabbing his head as he had a slight throbbing sensation now.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"That was such a weird dream...\"<br>\r\nShadow mumbled aloud, but quickly grabbed his hands over his mouth, noticing the red and black extensions of his gloves were gone and there was just white and rings. That, and his voice sounded extremely feminine and girlish. It almost reminded him of... No. Not possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shadow hopped out of the bed and looked into a full-body mirror. There stood the uncanny reflection of Amy Rose. Over time, Amy had grown and her body had matured more. Hell, if she wasn't running around trying to whore herself out to that blue furred speed-freak then he could maybe even see himself attempting to start a relationship with her. But now there was one very big problem. He was that pink furred hedge-girl in the mirror. Shadow looked down in horror as he(or rather she) saw that Amy's, now her breasts were showing prominently underneath the tight red dress. They weren't huge like Rouge's, but they were decent enough to be even considered above average. Wide hips, thick legs, petite arms and shoulders, long pink hair that went passed her shoulders by an inch or two. The long eyelashes a clear universal symbol in the animated world that she was undoubtedly female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://img06.deviantart.net/f3e5/i/2011/155/6/7/__older_ames___by_amyr ose972-d3i0qum.png\"&gt;Picture<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why am I checking myself out?\"<br>\r\nAmy's voice asked in the back of Shadow's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Amy...? You're still here..?\"<br>\r\nShadow looked from the left to the right, blushing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wha..?\"<br>\r\nAmy was confused, why was she talking in the third person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's me, Shadow. I'm... in control of your body somehow...\"<br>\r\nShadow spoke aloud, hoping she wouldn't freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sh-Shadow...? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know, but I'll fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What would've been a pissed looking alien built war machine for a hedgehog, simply looked like an annoyed girl expressing her displeasure in a rather feminine way. Hesitantly, she reached into Amy's closet and took out the long, silky red evening dress. Wearing clothes period was strange to Shadow, Now she was somehow suckered into wearing a dress that would show even more off of Amy's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow took the hangar with the dress on it and set it down on Amy's rosy red colored blanket on her bed, then unsurely reaching back and unzipping the dress she already had on, unzipping her boots, taking off her gloves, and stepping into the red gown. She hiked it up over her breasts, zipping it up behind her, which took a bit of effort due to the long shoulder-length hair Amy sported. She went into Amy's walk-in closet and found a specific pair of red high heels that could've been about three and a half inches high. Shadow was going to put them on, but Amy nudged her to go dig through her underwear drawer to get a pair of stockings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow shook her head as she sat on the bed and tried to figure out the articles of clothing, but then having some of Amy's memories explain to her that she needed to unfurl the fabric over her legs as she moved them up, which she then did. The heels slipped on in a perfect fit, but it took a while for Shadow to understand how to operate those, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we please get this over with?\"<br>\r\nShadow groaned in Amy's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just makeup then we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow let Amy's hands auto-pilot themselves as they applied a series of cosmetics to Amy's face. Lipstick, mascara, gloss, eyeliner, and blush. When she was done, however, Shadow would seriously need to rethink her idea about dating Amy after this was all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

Shadow sighed before immediately leaping into action, kicking one of the robots in the head with the high heels she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow!?\"Amy shouted in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"She asked taking the broken pawns gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those shoes are brand new! Stop damaging them!\"Amy scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy they're just shoes. You can just buy new ones.\"Shadow replied shooting one of the robots to see that it took no damage. Instead small bolts of electricity bounced off of the metal. She looked at the gun and said to herself.\"They must be set to stun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just buy new ones? Do you have any idea how much those cost me!\" Amy shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow sighed.\"Fine!\"She said dropping the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stop! Be happy that I like you!\"She used Amy's memories to quickly discover how she summoned her hammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Shadow. You're so sweet. Wait you like me?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow wasn't listening she was busy smashing robots with Amy's hammer which proved difficult. There was a limited space to fight in Amy's house . Shadow didn't want to break any of Amy's belongings. Also it was hard to fight inside the dress that she was wearing. It constricted her movement, she was more used to having no constriction at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen atleast five eggpawns were in Amy's bedroom they began to fire at Shadow who was at a huge disadvantage.She was unable to dodge them and took multiple shots to the chest. The volts rushed through her body, paralysing her and making her fall to the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow! Shadow get up!\" Amy pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's eyes slowly closed while she pleaded. Then just like that Shadow lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow's eyes slowly opened to see a clear blue sky.\"Aargh. What happened?\"Shadow asked and then froze. That voice, that wasn't Amy's voice, it was his. Shadow sat up to see that he was in his own body again. He sighed.\" It was just a dream.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't.\"Said an all too familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow looked up to see Amy appear in front of him in a flash of light. She was wearing all the articles she forced him to wear.\"This is a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow groaned and fell back onto the grass. He was still in Amy's body and now they were captured by Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we in the same dream?\"He asked not sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Maybe it's because we are in the same body. When it falls asleep we both dream the same thing.\" She said putting a hand on her hip. Shadow stood up and looked at her. He could resist blushing at how beautiful and sexy she looked. Amy noticed this of course and grinned.\"Like what you see Shadow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow's breath hitched.\"Umm well. You're really beautiful.\" He admitted. He hadn't really gotten the chance to see what Amy's body looked like in those clothes before the eggpawns attacked. She giggled in response.\"Thank you. But I can't take all the credit, after all you got me all ready for my date.\"She walked up to him swaying her hips making him blush more, he had forgotten that her personality had changed she was not the girl he met on the ARK anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow.\"She said getting up close to him and putting her hands on his furry chest. Her voice sounded different almost seductive. Her face drew closers to his, he was nervous and almost backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During the fight you said you liked me.\"Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow didn't know what to expect was she going to kiss him force him to the ground or hit him for losing the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly did you mean when you said you liked me?\"She asked looking into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was unsure how to answer her.\"Well I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were always so usually locked up and hidden away where only he could find them. His antisocial attitude has costed him happiness for years. Strangely enough, sharing a mind with someone has made his thoughts clearer than ever. \"But the real question is.... how do you feel about me?\" He tilted his head, acting very out-of-character for him as he was genuinely curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Shadow, I don't know what to say...\" Amy smirked slightly, blushing slightly. \"I mean, I would be lying to say that I haven't thought about you in... that way before.

Shadow... Touch me.\"<br>\r\nAmy's mind told her in the back of Shadow's shared subconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Amy... I...\"<br>\r\nShadow bit her lip as she blushed, the sensations much stronger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please... we need it.\"<br>\r\nAmy pleaded, begging to be relived of her female urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow sighed, unable to resist and slowly reached in the back of her dress and unzipped it, casting off the article of clothing and stepping out of her boots, taking off her white gloves, and tossing her hairband aside. It was just her underwear now. There sat Amy's breasts underneath the white cotton bra and the matching pair of panties held her nether regions. Carefully, Shadow unfastened the clips on the bra, and cast it aside into the pile where she tossed the dress, hairband, boots, and gloves. Shadow didn't know much about the female anatomy, but thanks to Amy's nudges in the right direction, she slowly started to caress her breasts and found the spot in the fur in which her nipples were buried. Amy's hands seemed to work on their own, groping and massaging her breasts as she began to let out small moans of pleasure, which only egged Shadow on, letting her know that she was doing it correctly. A firm red blush sat atop Amy's face as Shadow then used her right hand to dig into Amy's panties, finding the exact spot in between her lips where the clit was, sticking two fingers in and pressing in on it, making Shadow gasp and have her breathing turn into heavy pants as one hand fingered herself and the other kept massaging a breast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going!\"<br>\r\nAmy told Shadow inside her head as she felt every sensation as well. They did share the body after all, Shadow was just making the decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! Ahhhh....ahh....oh...\"<br>\r\nShadow finished, feeling a female orgasm that sent her body falling back onto Amy's bed, uncontrollably thrusting her hips as she leaned back and panted to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Shadow heard a knock at Amy's front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\"<br>\r\nShe cursed in a very unladylike fashion, getting up and clipping her bra on with knowledge she only could've plucked from Amy's head, dressing herself in the dress, boots, gloves, and hairband and rushing to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Too bad for her he did though.\" Enjoying your new body I see.\" The hedgehog said with a mischievous grin. Shadow blushed hard and Amy screamed in their mind 'HE HEARD US!' She could feel her arm shake as Amy tried to force her to slap him and slam the door in his face, but Shadow held her back. There was a good chance that he had the answers as to how Shadow was in Amy's body in the first place.\"May I come in?\" They hedgehog asked politely. Amy obviously said no because she thought he was a pervert but Shadow was more level headed than that.\"Umm. Sure.\" She answered gesturing for him to step in. Closing the door behind him he was about to say something but she violently grabbed his chest and spoke first.\" Alright pal I don't know what the hell is going on here! But I'm getting the impression that you do so start talking!\" She ordered ,but his grin was still there.\" Alright, alright just let me go and I'll tell you everything.\" He instructed and as agreed she let go of him.\"You're really cute in that body when  you're angry.\" OK now Shadow felt like slapping him.\" The first thing you should know is that the pink emerald you found as you already know put you in this fair maiden's body.\" Shadow scoffed she already knew this.\" Yeah I know. Now how do I get out!?\" Amy was almost saddened by that statement, she really liked how Shadow had pleasured her earlier. Hearing that she wanted out so badly wasn't pleasing.\" Yeah well sorry to tell you this but. You can't.\" \"WHAT!?\" She shouted. Amy didn't know own whether to be happy or sad about that. She was happy that Shadow was staying in her body but sad that she would never have her own body again.\" Sorry but once you touched the emerald it was a one way trip. No take backsies.\" Shadow groaned at that. This was just fantastic not only was he stuck in Amy's body for the rest of his life but it was totally unfair on Amy who would never have her body to herself again.\" This isn't right. I can't stay like this. I can't just let Amy stay as a presence in my head for her life.\" Shadow's concern for her was touching but she was actually having mixed feelings about him leaving. The Shadow copy chuckled.\" And that's why I'm here.\" He stepped closer to her and made her instinctively back up and not surprisingly end up against the wall.\" What are you doing?\" She asked blushing as he got closer. \" Letting Amy in on the fun.\" He said trapping her in a passionate kiss. Shadow was frozen she didn't think she'd be her own first kiss. Then something strange happened , it felt like something was being sucked out of her. When they stopped missing the Shadow copy stared at her blankly and blinked.\" OK I think it's time for you to go right Amy?\" She asked yet there was not reply.\"Amy?\" She asked again, but this time the copy answered. \"Umm Shadow I'm in here.\" He said giving Shadow the shocked look.\" What how!?\"\" I don't know when he kissed us everything went dark then the next thing I knew I was starring at myself.\" Amy said looking himself up and down . Then a thought dawned on him.\" You're know if kissing you put me in this body maybe kissing you again will put me back.\" Shadow didn't want to try and interfere right now Amy had superior strength and speed compared to her.

Unfortunately, Shadow would have no time to marvel at Cream's breasts, because the two apex love-muscles were now his; hers.

From what little intel they already have on the matter, they can tell that he is using some kind of dark energy. Where he's getting it from or what he plans to do with it or what its capabilities even are are a mystery, which is why they're sending in their very best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once inside, Shadow and Rouge did their best to remain as stealthy as possible. But little did they know, The Doctor was well aware of The Guardian Unit of Nations' plans. He had a little surprise waiting for them in the mainframe room, where they would most likely be searching for any kind of schematics or hints as to what he was up to. To be honest, even Eggman had no idea what his new toy could do, and what better time to test it than the present?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rouge took out a tube of what looked like lipstick, but it was actually a hidden blowtorch, which she burned a large rectangle into the metal door blocking them off from the mainframe room. Shadow, being the stronger of the two, spindashed it down. Just as Rouge came up from behind him, Eggman fired his device, which shot a dark beam directly into Shadow, knocking him backward into Rouge. Everything went black for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minutes later, Shadow awoke with his head spinning, feeling his center of body weight was off balance. His chest and hips felt heavy, but that must of just had to be one of The Doctor's mind games. Shadow hopped up, and noticed something definitely felt off. He looked down and saw that he was now more so a \"she.\" Rouge's ample bust stood proud on her chest, having to be prominent D-cups being gently pushed up by the heart-shaped breastplate. Shadow poked one of them, assuming this had to be some kind of elaborate illusion, and felt it jiggle. This even went as far to cause a tiny moan escape her pink, glossy lips. Shadow gasped in Rouge's breathy voice, which sounded much more dramatic than she intended. She ran her hands across her new figure, his bust, her tight waistline, her hips, well endowed butt, and... her flat spot. Shadow's right, blue mascara covered eye twitched as she came to terms with the fact that she was somehow now in possession of Rouge's body. Rouge, of all people. The most sexually attractive and most seductive female he knew when he was still considered a he. She took a few deep breaths, not wanting to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pre04.deviantart.net/cf2a/th/pre/i/2015/111/a/3/___rouge____by_laurypinky972-d69balu.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://pre04.deviantart.net/cf2a/th/pre/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n To further examination, Shadow looked around, seeing that the blast must have teleported her to...</span></div></div>",

Way too many questions flooded the former ultimate life-form's mind. Why was he suddenly a she? And Rouge of all people. The most erotic and buxom female he'd ever met. Whatever that dark energy was, it had the power to force him into Rouge's body. Did that mean Rouge was gone forever? Or was she still inside somewhere? Or was he slowly dissolving into her? So many questions, so little time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You.. you did? You came here for me, and not the emerald you try to steal about once a week?\"<br>\r\nKnuckles furrowed the fur above his eyes that served as his eyebrows to express his emotion. It was a confused look he gave her, unsure if this bat-girl was just trying to deceive him with her looks like she'd done so many times before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Er... yeah..?\"<br>\r\nShadow nodded, instinctively batting her long eyelashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, then.

Knuckles chuckled and grabbed her by the wrist as she made an attempt to leave. \"What's the rush?\" He tilted his head, finding it strange that she didn't want to stay and argue with him as usual. That, and Rouge did not appear to be using her wings at all. She was also appearing to have a very hard time walking in her heeled boots. \"I...\" Shadow blushed uncontrollably.

Though she'd never actually been inside, only in the bottom floor bar area where she'd wait for Rouge to get ready to go on a mission. The G.U.N. made it very clear to them. If anything went wrong, they didn't exist. She could tell it was Rouge's room due to the several pictures of Rouge in heart-shaped frames and the large heart-shaped bed with pink and white sheets, pillows, and blankets.There was also a huge walk-in closet with hangars that lined the racks with mostly her jumpsuits and even a few dresses. Duplicates of the same thigh high heeled white boots with heart tips on the toes were aligned as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n This room was so incredibly... feminine. But so was Rouge, so what was she supposed to expect. Shadow's room was simple. A bed, a flat-screen, a computer, a nightstand and a gun rack. Rouge's room was complete with a vanity table, a walk-in wardrobe as previously mentioned, several dressers, picture frames, and a massive mirror that showed a very confused Rouge staring back into it. Amidst the confusion, Rouge's body had grown rather excited. And Shadow, being foreign to these sensations, had no idea how to react to them. It was clear that Rouge's nipples stood firm, erect, and proud as they were visible through the heart breastplate that also survived as that of a push-up bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her center of gravity was much different, weight being on her chest and rear as well as the very tight waist and core she now possessed(get it..? Possession?). The thick legs had a mixture of muscle and fat while her arms were now sleek and slender. It felt odd to be hairless entirely from the neck down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Curiosity peaked Shadow's interest, as this was probably the only instance in her life in which she could freely touch Rouge where ever she wanted how ever she wanted. She raised her gloved hand, and pressed a single index finger into her right nipple, and she nearly jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"<br>\r\nShadow let out a brief moan in Rouge's voice that was undoubtedly her expressing her pleasure. It made Shadow's insides light up inside and a fiery wetness grow down in her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Does Shadow proceed with her \"exploration?\"</span></div></div>",

That ray that hit her had to have knocked her unconscious and Eggman brought her here. Was this his intention? The great doctor's master plan? To diminish the ultimate life form into a seductive bat that wore her jumpsuits a size too small on purpose? She was still in too much shock at her newly acquired form to even worry or care about any of these questions. She simply sat on the bed, having had trouble even so much as standing upright without everything feeling off. An alien weight on her chest, a thin waist, thick hips and legs, all throwing her center of gravity off of her usual broad shoulders and noodle-like limbs. It also felt odd how the clothes caressed her curves so delicately. The spandex had been tightly stretched over her posterior to emphasize its roundness, her high heeled boots meant to show off her sultry walk that swayed her hips, the feeling of the silky elbow length gloves on her hands and forearms. How the pink chest plate worked as a push-up bra to emphasize her well endowed cleavage and the absence of an actual bra. Shadow wasn't used to wearing clothes, period. The only exception she'd ever had was when she was undercover or needed some extra protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A small camera zoomed in from the top corner of the room, transmitting straight to the mad doctor's surveillance room where he sat watching intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Eggman know about the change or did he just assume his ray obliterated Shadow?</span></div></div>",

How did I end up in your home?\" Amy had a huge headache, she felt weak. \"So you don't remember? You felt sick. That's why you came over, so I could take a look.

Silver removed all of Rouge's extra thieving gear, so he/she was dressed normally. He then used his psychic powers to scan the area, located Knuckles, and headed in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles was thinking about... what else?... the Master Emerald, when a shadow fell upon him from behind. A shadow with pointed ears, a rounded chest, and two very pronounced wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya want now, Rouge?\" Knuckles asked in a bored tone. It had been too long since he had experienced any action, and so he actually wanted her to attempt to steal the Master Emerald; he would get some excitement in his life stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to steal the Master Emerald again?\" Knuckles added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Silver-as-Rouge replied. \"I didn't come for the Master Emeralds...

But I suppose I have to, for the mission. Anyway, I can probably have some fun afterward.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he(Silver) bent down even lower to give Knuckles a better view of her(Rouge's) large, bulging breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it working? Is it?\" Sonic asked excitedly, while Tails peered around the tree with one of his improved periscopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet... I hope it does.\" Tails replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles continued to stare; then, seeming to catch himself, quickly looked away. Silver had to do something, fast. Moving around Knuckles to catch his attention again, Knuckles looked away another time. Realizing he had to do something drastic, Silver began rubbing her (Rouge's) breasts, and, this time, Knuckles just couldn't look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, then, come on Knuxie! Don't you want some of this?\" Silver-in-Rouge asked of Knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just when Knuckles was about to lose the slightest amount of interest, Silver knew he had one last chance. He had wanted to save his chance to try it out till later, but he knew it was crucial to the success of the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver's hand moved down toward her pants, into the area between Rouge's legs. He began rubbing at the edge of the pants, and though it began sending waves of pleasure into him, he tried to avoid thinking about it and focus on Knuckles, who, to Silver's pleasant surprise, seemed to be breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver just had to \"turn it up a notch\", and started moving faster. That was all it took for Knuckles to give it up, and he headed for Silver-in-Rouge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, you,\" he said gruffly, and pulled Silver/Rouge's pants down and shirt up and began to rub her breasts and lick her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when Knuckles couldn't bear waiting it out anymore, he shoved his large rod down into Rouge's body. Silver, at this moment, tried to leave her body, but could not, as the feeling he was experiencing proved too strong and so kept him from concentrating long enough and getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Silver felt something like a pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't know Rouge was still a virgin,' he thought. 'I guessed she had lost it a long time ago... Oh well, I'll worry about deflowering her later - for now, I'll try to enjoy this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations kept growing more and more and proved to be so intense that he wasn't able to think about anything but the current situation at hand and getting more of whatever was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles' pounding became harder, and Silver screamed with Rouge's voice, \"Oh, please, fuck me raw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sonic stared into the periscope (Tails had given it up because he couldn't stand the disgusting image), a slow smile appeared on his face. It looked like he was really enjoying the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver was still in Rouge's body.

His plan was complicated. To put it in an everyday person's terms, Eggman wanted to create a device that was capable of moving souls from one body to another so the minds of two beings can be switched around and posses one another's bodies. If Sonic was stuck as one of his allies, he'd be too weak and untrained to pose any true threat to the master plan. That was the plan originally, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a warm morning on Angel Island, Knuckles pacing back and forth bored out of his mind. Rouge hadn't attempted to steal the emerald today and she was the only real company he ever got. Sonic or Tails would occasionally call on him for backup when needed but that was rare since SEGA hasn't released a decent Sonic game since 2006. What caught him off guard though was a blue blur zipping passed him and a familiar pink hedgehog slowing down and panting as she was out of breath and couldn't keep up with her crush. Knuckles helped her stand, wrapping an arm around her waist and pulling her arm over his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Jeez, Amy. When are you ever going to quit?\" Knuckles asked, somewhat concerned if this girl should be admitted to a mental asylum or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He doesn't even give me a chance...\" She sniffled, retaining from crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, a flying pod with the iconic overweight Doctor Eggman flew overhead. <br>\r\n \"Chin up my dear! It's your lucky day! You get to test out my new invention!\"<br>\r\nEggman cackled, firing the beam. It hit Knuckles directly but the beam didn't do as Eggman intended. Knuckles vanished into thin air, leaving a very confused Amy Rose now standing upright and looking down at her body, one hand cupping a breast and the other running up her thigh and blushing deeply when she met what was in between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm.. Amy..?\"<br>\r\nShe gasped, covering her mouth with one hand at the sound of her highly pitched voice.</span></div></div>",

He had built a small home for himself near the emerald's resting sight. Usually, Rouge would attempt to steal the emerald at least once or twice every seven days. Currently, Knuckles was leaned against the emerald with his arms folded and his eyes closed. It was late at night and  Rouge was on a hill nearby, watching closely. She had a strange device in her hands that she bought off of the black market. It was supposedly one of the G.U.N.'s off the books projects that was cancelled. The weapon was described as something of a stun-gun powerful enough to put down supernatural hostiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rouge drew the firearm and charged it up. Once it fired, a stream of blue electric current shot and ricocheted off of the emerald and into Knuckles. Unexpectedly, however, Rouge was also effected by the firearm and she too passed out. The weapon breaking and shattering in her palms in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Knuckles awoke in the mourning, raising his hand to feel his head as he felt like he had a passing migraine. He squinted as he tried to sit up. His vision was blurred, but once his eyes went into focus, they widened. Looking down, Knuckles could verify that he was in fact not a he anymore. Rouge's body was clearly visible, her two breasts held together by the breastplate that held them together. Knuckles shrieked in horror, covering her mouth and blushing at the sound of a very effeminate scream. Rouge's voice was a part of the package she was now stuck with. What did she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rouge!\" Knuckles turned over to look at the Master Emerald to find that it was...</span></div></div>",

Chaos sunk to the floor, becoming a puddle of his own being, and slid over the floor until he was directly underneath Amy, taking advantage of her stopping and staring at the heiroglyphics on the wall.<br>\r\nHearing the sound of water underneath her, Amy looked down, and nearly screamed at the sight of the being under her. Suprised, Chaos nearly froze, but regained his senses almost instantly. <br>\r\nBefore Amy could jump away, Chaos stuck a pillar of his essence up, taking advantage of the fact that Amy wore a skirt, and slipped himself through her panties, entering Amy's \"Lower hatch\".<br>\r\nSinking to her knees, Amy moaned as Chaos forced the rest of himself into her vaginal cavity. Amy panted faster as Chaos clambered around inside of her, heading towards her brain, and complete control.<br>\r\nFinally forcing himself into Amy's head and soaking into her brain, Amy clutched her head and screamed! Stopping, Amy's hands fell to her sides, and a final plea crossed her lips, \"No, please no...\" before her mind fell unconscious... <br>\r\n...Right as Chaos assumed control! Standing up, Chaos nearly stumbled, not used to having solid legs. Remembering how other beings needed oxygen, Chaos learned how to breathe. Testing out his new female voice, Chaos toyed around before deciding that he wouldn't be able to pass off as Amy if he stumbled everywhere. <br>\r\nPracticing walking in Amy's boots, Chaos' steps became less and less wobbly, as he began to get the hang of it! A smile spread across Amy's face. \"Don't worry Amy! Though YOU may be gone, I'll gladly continue your life! It's time for the old Amy to disappear, and time for the NEW Amy to take the stage!\" Chaos exclaimed, feeling his body. <br>\r\n\"Amy!\" A voice cried. \"I heard you scream! What happened??\" Chaos spun around to see... </span></div></div>",

Blaze had blindly stumbled around in the dark until she felt a doorknob in her hands. Opening the door, Blaze saw that the room behind the door was lit, and that it appeared to be a tiny library! <br>\r\nStepping in and glancing around, Blaze took notice that the books weren't dated, though they looked ancient. Blaze jumped when the door blew closed. <br>\r\nGetting nervous, Blaze remembered the ghost stories of her childhood, and began to sweat. Suddenly, a laugh echoed through the room! \"Heh heh heh... A little kitty-cat hiding in the light! Tell me, are you frightened?\" A voice cackled. <br>\r\nFreezing, Blaze looked left and right, attempting to locate the source. \"Hee hee... You should be!\" The voice continued. Blaze turned around to face a large blank painting on the wall. <br>\r\nBlaze's heart nearly stopped at the sight of a ghostly form emerging from the smooth canvas. \"Let me introduce myself, I am the Great Ghost Lord, King Boom Boo!\" The giant ghost stated, fully emerged from the canvas. <br>\r\nBlaze stared at the being for 5 seconds, then took off towards the door! Before Blaze could reach it, Boom Boo's arm stretched, grabbing Blaze by her arm and pulling her back. \"Oh no you don't! I've waited FAR long enough for my revenge, and YOU, my dear, are going to help me succeed!\" The ghostly King stated, grabbing Blaze's other arm with his other hand.<br>\r\nBefore Blaze could scream, King Boom Boo placed his forehead on hers, grinning. Boom Boo's forehead began to sink into Blaze's, as she yelped in discomfort. As he began to sink into Blaze's head, Boom Boo stated, \"Goodbye little cat, for you shall exist no longer!\"<br>\r\nBlaze dropped to her knees and clutched her head in pain, The Ghost King completely in now. Blaze suddenly stopped, and rose to her feet.

This female's body is now under the control of King Boom Boo! Now, for other matters...\" The possessed cat remarked, beginning to feel her (His?) body down.<br>\r\nBoom Boo felt his new breasts, impressed at the relative size and feel. \"With this body, my revenge shall soon take root...\" Boom Boo stated, a wicked smile on his host's face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh dear!\"<br>\r\nThat was the thought that echoed through Vanilla the Rabbit's head. Her daughter Cream's chao, Cheese, had inexplicably flew off during Cream's slumber-party and into the night, spurring the girls to chase after him. Cheese had flown through the forest that surrounded their house, leading deeper and deeper, far beyond any sign of civilization. Eventually, after about 23 minutes of running, Cheese came to a stop. As the girls got closer to the wayward chao, an odd sight shifted into view. A castle, or at least a large estate, rested in the center of a large clearing, surrounded by a small moat. <br>\r\nCheese ended the shocked silence by chirping and flying toward the castle, stopping in front of it's large doors. Then, to Vanilla's suprize, the doors opened by themselves, welcoming the chao in. <br>\r\n\"It went into the castle. Great.\" Rouge commented sarcastically.<br>\r\n\"We have to go in after Cheese, Mommie!\" Cream exclaimed, looking at her mother with tears welling in her eyes. <br>\r\n\"O-Of course, dear!\" Vanilla stated, voice shaking. With that, their group went in. As they passed the doors going in, Vanilla noticed a thin candle-light coming from within. As soon as everyone was in, the doors slammed shut, and audible lock-click sounding. Tensions began to rise as Amy tried the handles.<br>\r\n\"They're both locked.\" Amy stated, concern apparent.<br>\r\n\"Stand back, I can handle this!\" Blaze exclaimed, hands glowing ember-ish red. Flames shot out of hands at the doors, engulfing them for a good 10 seconds before dying down. Rouge checked the doors. Not even a scorch mark.<br>\r\nThen, things got a lot worse. The dim light with which they saw dissapeared, startling them all. <br>\r\nVanilla stumbled blindly in the darkness, searching for her daughter without sight. Eventually, Vanilla stumbled into a small, yet dimly-lit room. She looked around, noticing nothing out-of-the-ordinary. She dusted off her dress and began to think.<br>\r\nThe Ghost King Boom Boo chuckled. He had chosen this woman to be his new vessel, with whom he would exact his revenge. A small breeze rustled Vanilla's dress, yet she took no notice. Boom Boo silently flattened himself to the ground, taking advantage of his ghostly physiology to become thinner than paper. He slid into position directly under where Vanilla was standing, and grinned.<br>\r\nThe Ghost King reached his hands upwards, both clutching either side of the hem of Vanilla's dress, spreading it. Yet again, Vanilla took no notice to this, deep in thought. Boom Boo shaped the rest of himself that had been flat on the floor into what appeared like a pale, ghostly white tentacle rising from the floor. Of course, he was completely obscured, as he was under her dress. Boom Boo carefully guided his tentacle-like self up the recesses of Vanilla's dress and between her legs, carefully avoiding touching either leg. Eventually, he reached the top, nearly touching her undergarments.<br>\r\nVanilla was deep in thought. She was wondering of where the others could be within this castle. Vanilla's deep thoughts were interrupted by a slight tickle in her \"lower areas\". Immediately, that tickle grew into a feeling of invasion, as the tentacle/ghost forced past her defenses. Vanilla yelped and struck a pose that would've put Marilyn Monroe to shame as the Ghost King climbed upwards. Vanilla dropped to her hands and knees as the ghostly hands let go of her hem and joined the main tentacle. Vanilla screamed at the top of her lungs as the phantom tentacle forced itself into her body completely, sliding in with a slimy 'SLURP'. Vanilla collapsed onto the floor, panting. <br>\r\nAfter about 2 minutes, Vanilla's breathing slowed, and she forced herself to her feet. She looked around, confused, before abruptly stopping. Vanilla clutched her head and moaned in pain. Her eyes began to shift from their calm brown to a deep crimson, before returning to their previous color. Vanilla let her hands fall to her sides and an evil grin crept across her usually warm and kind face. A dark, uncharacteristic chuckle crept from her mouth, as she looked down at her impressive form.<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh... Now I have a body to carry my plan out with...\" She stated, The Ghost King manipulating her voice. She smiled at her alluring curves, before laughing again. <br>\r\nHer dark laughs echoed through the empty halls.</span></div></div>",

Just GREAT.\"<br>\r\nAmy had managed to drag Rouge to Cream the Rabbit's slumber party, despite the bat's disdain to such pointless matters. If it were up to Rouge, she would have spent the night polishing and adding to her already massive jewel collection. Perhaps that break of habit was why things had gone so wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the \"Fun and Games\", as the others called them, the rabbit brat's pet chao (which she called 'Cheese', for some reason) up and left.  As the little creature flew off into the darkening evening, panic overtook all of the others, who quickly decided to go after the floating bother. While the others rushed towards the forest to chase the runaway chao, Rouge paused. Something felt off. Against her better judgement, Rouge pushed her doubts aside and hurried after the group. \"After all, if I don't, I'll never hear the end of it from Amy.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set over the tips of the thick pine trees that comprised most of the forest, the group of females rushed down a small path that grew thinner and fainter the farther they ran. As the golden light that was the sun disappeared over faraway mountains, Rouge's uneasiness worsened. Though the other members of their ragtag rescue crew remained focused completely on their chase, Rouge took notice that the forest which, in all other situations, was full of animal and bug life, seemed completely DEAD. This honestly frightened her for some reason, yet forward she continued. After what seemed like an eternity, the path reached it's end, resulting with the group coming to a stop. In front of them sprawled a nearly unimaginable sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinged by a suspiciously full moat lay a castle straight out of the middle ages, sized quite similarly to a large estate. Almost immediatly, Cream spotted her chao floating still in front of what seemed to be red doors. Without warning, the doors opened seemingly of their own accord, as the creature floated casually inside. Rouge's eyes opened wide at the sight. So there WAS a reason to be concerned! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could object, the group rushed in. Rouge sighed in frustration before rejoining them. As the last girl entered, the door shut and locked itself, shown by a clear \"Click\". Almost immediately, Rouge scanned the area for any useful info. It was dark, the only illumination coming from unseen candles. Oddly, Rouge saw no sign of the chao's presence, and for a moment, all was silent. Then the light disappeared. Rouge, despite her ability of echolocation, felt just as blind as she imagined the others were at the moment. Unable to hear, see, or smell, Rouge resorted to the oldest trick in the book: Grasping around blindly until she could find a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Rouge's plan succeeded, and she opened the newfound door. It was still dark, but it didn't feel like she was covered in a veil of death, at least. Rouge began to observe the room, seeing books littered about, like a child studied here. Unbeknownst to the jewel thief, a shadowy form rose from the floor behind her. As quietly as he could, King Boom Boo chuckled. This female bat would make an excellent host body, well suited to his plans. The ghost king solidified directly behind Rouge and tapped her on the shoulder, getting her attention. Rouge spun around, and froze at the sight the ghost king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 seconds passed before Rouge opened her mouth to scream! \"Now!!\" Boom Boo thought, grinning. Before a sound escaped, the ghost stretched his arm into Rouge's mouth and down her throat, silencing her. Rouge looked on in horror as Boom Boo's other arm extended into her, before it began pulling. Rouge's eyes rolled back in their sockets as the Ghost King's body shoved itself down her throat. She fell to the ground as the being completely entered her, and she began to convulse violently. Tears rolled down her cheeks as screeched at the top of her lungs, her mind disappearing into darkness. Her final words never escaped her mouth, her lips unable to form a word of any kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body of the bat stood up, with a new, more malevolent mind in control. Her eyes shone a deep red as she smiled. The King of Ghosts had taken a new form. \"My, this body is everything I could have wanted! Fast, agile, sleek, and of course, quite curvy.\" The possessed bat cooed, feeling every scrumptious hump and curve. \"With this body's appeal and my mind, my revenge is set in stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark and ominous laughter filled the castle, warning of the evil soon to occur.</span></div></div>",

Realizing this opportunity, King Boom Boo or now 'Rouge' continues to chuckle at the thought of having possessed the body of its prey. She is not like the others from the party. Her attire portrays her feminine wiles and mischievous nature. Surely this can work out to the king's favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rouge's body, the ghost tests her powers. She sends a few kicks out in front of her, testing her leg speed and strength. Her high-heeled boots appear to be a blur in front of her. <i>Just glorious</i>. She stops and admires her legs. The ghost has taken a liking to the body it possesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the woman\" she says. This is a worthwhile chance for the ghost. All the emotions, memories, and sensations that Rouge has felt is being shared with the king. Her skills in espionage will be most useful. Rouge then cups her breasts and feels the pink chest plate on her. She motions her hands down to the sides of her body, loving every bit of feeling her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so she is the woman who is associated with that wretched red Echidna. The two have a bit of chemistry. Perhaps things can work to my favor in getting my revenge on that cretin.\" Rouge thinks about this, but then becomes angry. The king of ghosts realizes that this woman has an interest in the red Echidna. To think that the seemingly best host that can contain its mischievous nature has its downsides. <i>Great, this woman has a thing for Knuckles</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then thinks of something. <i>I could ruin the relationship she has with Knuckles and her friends, but I have other things to do than be worried about bothersome pests. So much potential can be used through her skills and connections.</i> Rouge then begins to channel some of the energy within her. It is dark and malevolent, spawning some ghosts in some areas of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoaring in the air, Rouge ponders over what to do next. Her plan had worked in trapping all the girls inside. It was easy too, using that little chao as bait to trap them. Now, with the body she inhabits being one of the victims, she can commence her plan towards getting her revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, I wonder if I can still utilize some of my powers while in this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire erupts from Rouge's hands as she looks at them with her passionate red eyes. Astonishingly enough, none of it burns her white fur as she channels them. <i>How unique</i>. Appreciating this, Rouge calmly walks around the room as her footsteps make sounds. \"I can make enhance this body with my own powers as well\" she grins. So gleeful with the thought, Rouge tests out her supernatural powers some more. For quite some time, she seems to get the hang of this, even thinking of new things to try out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahahaha! With this great body, I can use it to my own liking!\" Rouge then looks at herself, admiring what she has. This has been a successful moment for her. \"Just perfect.\" Rouge continues to stay in the air while enjoying this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thought she realizes something. <i>I can finally achieve something now. With my powers, minions, and this wonderful buxom form, I can become a great thief! Perhaps I might come across that bothersome Knuckles and teach him a thing or two.</i> \"Oh such wonders\" she grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well leave some of the kiddies behind to play with their prey! Who knows, I might even let the mimic ghosts have their way with them, using their abilities against them and taking on their forms to cause mischief. Oh the confusion and fear will sustain them enough\" she taunts. \"Even the Hyudoros might get a little bit a fear from the guests. Their powers will prove to be hard to overcome, for the more darkness present, the powerful they become.\" With these thoughts in mind, Rouge walks over to the side of the room. She opens the window and looks at the clouds and full moon present. This is what the ghost king has been waiting for. Rouge levitates in the air with her wings and floats outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out into the night sky, the new Rouge sets her eyes on seeing the possibilities she can make. With the woman's power and the ghost's own abilities and ghouls to summon when needed, King Boom Boo figures that it will have the fun necessary to fill it's needs. The night is full of mystery and mischief.</span></div></div>",

As Cream, her friends, and her mother followed the rogue chao, they passed through the forest that Vanilla (Cream's mother) had always warned her away from. Eventually, they stopped their chase at a moat filled with water. Taking advantage of their pause, Cream glanced around. They were deeper in the forest than Cream remembered ever being, and across the moat, silhouetted against the moonlight, was a castle. It's walls were worn and covered in moss, yet something seemed... NEW about it.<br>\r\nCheese quickly flew across a small bridge on either side of the moat and floated to a stop near the door. As the girls hurriedly crossed the bridge, Cream saw the castle's doors open on their own accord, and Cheese flew in. Without pausing, the girls rushed in after him. Immediately, the doors shut behind them. Cheese was nowhere in sight. Rouge tried the door handles.<br>\r\n\"We've got a problem. They're LOCKED.\" The bat stated, a look of concern washing over her face.<br>\r\n\"Step back, Rouge!\" Amy said, approaching the door. \"I'LL handle this!\" Her Piko-Piko hammer materialized in her hands, and she swung it at the doors with a powerful battle cry. Her hammer hit the door... And bounced off. Amy looked at the door dumbfounded, then to her hammer. Amy narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n\"C'MON. OPEN. YOU. STUPID. DOOR!!!\" Amy roared, repeatedly slamming her hammer into the door with little effect. Amy stepped back. Not a single scratch. Amy sunk to her knees, exhausted and hopeless. <br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Blaze moaned, dispair obvious in her voice. <br>\r\n\"We have to stay together, thats what!\" Vanilla stated, trying to stay calm in spite of their situation. \"We can't go off on our own in this castle! Who knows what could happen?\"<br>\r\nAs Vanilla finished her sentence, a strong gust of wind blew through an unseen window, extinguishing the dim candlelight that illuminated the entryway. All of the girls screamed. <br>\r\nCream fumbled about in the darkness, searching for some light, some indication that she'd be alright. Eventually, she stumbled into a room through an open doorway, drawn by the dim light coming from inside. The room was completely bare, except for a piece of paper attached to the wall at the far end of the room.<br>\r\nAs Cream shuffled towards the paper, curious, a large, phantasmic form rose from the floor behind her. King Boom Boo chuckled to himself. This girl would make a perfect host! Her petite body and unbreakable innocence seemed the perfect guise to assume on his quest for revenge. No-one would guess that beneath the orange dress and cute face was a cunning and malicious mind. <br>\r\nPerfect! He would fly into her back, entering her body and turning her into his pretty little puppet! Delicious! Knuckles wouldn't see this coming! As the Ghost King approached the young rabbit-girl, she paused, the skirt of her small dress rustling in an unseen breeze. Boom Boo heard her give off a small chuckle before she resumed walking. <br>\r\n\"Has she finally snapped?\" The Ghost pondered. \"Well, that won't matter once I'm under her skin like a worm!\" He said to himself, lunging forward for the end of his hunt. <br>\r\nCream spun around quickly, and to the King's surprise, was smugly wielding a vacuum-like contraption she had seemingly retrieved from nowhere. She grinned menacingly, and flipped a switch on the nozzle. \"Bye-bye, King Boom-BUTT!\" She laughed. The Ghost King's direction abruptly shifted, as he felt himself pulled forcefully toward the device.<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT?! HOW?! WHAT IS THIS?!\" Boom-Boo shrieked, pulled relentlessly towards the nozzle's thin entrance. <br>\r\n\"Easy.\" Cream stated smugly. \"I knew your ghost had possessed Cheese from the start, so I brought this nifty little thing with me for my own trap!\"<br>\r\n\"B-But...!\" The King screeched, halfway in the the nozzle.<br>\r\n\"I knew you were going to try to possess me, so I came prepared!\" She gloated.<br>\r\n\"N-Not... Fair...\" Boom-Boo struggled to speak, before being completely inhaled by the void-like contraption. <br>\r\nCream smiled and flicked the ghost-catcher's switch to \"Storage Mode\". It was time to regroup with her friends. She whistled as she skipped down the dark, empty hall. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" The girl smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had the words been uttered that Amy once again began to feel a surge of energy. The chaos energy coursed through her entire body, swirling around her, and changing her as her and Tikal's traits began to combine. It started with her dress, splitting in half to reveal the girl's midriff. The skirt of the dress tightened around her waist, and her boots slowly morphed into wraps around her legs. Her fur changed too, slowly fading from bright pink to a more pastel peach color, and her hair began to grow out, down to her shoulders. Next was her face, her eyelashes became longer, while her eyes sharpened, and her lips became soft and full. Meanwhile Amy could feel herself growing bigger, taller, legs becoming longer, and making the already short skirt even shorter in comparison. Assisting with this, her hips began to flare out, pushing against the skirt. Meanwhile her butt pushed out in a different direction, sticking out like a shelf. On her stomach, light muscle formed, giving her midriff some toning without being outright muscular. Finally, the energy focused around her chest, stimulating her nipples and making her bosoms feel sensitive and tingly. The mounds began to grow, pushing more and more against the top with each jolt of energy, nipples growing larger and more erect as the energy stimulated her. More and more her breasts pushed and strained against the shirt, easily surpassing the girl's inital B-cup, and becoming a C-cup. Another jolt and her chest lurched outward even more. A D-cup? No... E-Cup. and still going. Pulling more and more against the top, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final pulse, the breasts lept into F-cup territory, while at the same time snapping the string holding up the collar of the girls' top, revealing the impressive cleavage while the top itself had stretched out to show a good bit of underboob. The girl took a few heavy breaths, bosom heaving from the rush of power. Until finally, she looked up at Rouge, who had become frozen in shock. Or rather, looked down, as the girl was now at least a foot taller than the bat woman. And that wasn't the only place where she had bested the bat, sporting a curvaceous figure that made even Rouge appear underdeveloped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A..Amy?\" Rouge stammered, at a total loss for words after what she just witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman locked eyes with Rouge, now sporting glowing blue pupils, and in a voice that echoed of both girls, simply stated, \"No... I am Tikamy....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to eye the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along now, Rouge... We have work to do...\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately though as he did so the machine scanning the emerald short circuited as it was being exposed to more energy than the fox had planned for causing an impact that sent Tikal's spirit flying out from the Force and right into Tails' chest as he was sent flying due to the blast causing a huge explosion, the body landing near the river with only cuts and bruises due to much exposure to Chaos Energy in the past making his body much more durable.

He was completely invisible and inaudible to Sonic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sonic continued to search the workshop for his best buddy, Tails calmed down and finally began to use his brain to figure out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay; so I'm currently invisible to others and I can't be heard either,' thought Tails. 'I'm also flying, but without using my tails to do so.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was thinking, Tails was following Sonic through the workshop, on the process discovering that his current state allowed him to pass through walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All indications say that I have somehow aquired all the powers of a ghost; most likely caused by the Chaos Emerald.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails took another quick look at his transparent body. 'Although it is a facinating experience to be like a ghost, I'd rather get back to normal. I think I know what could have caused this, so it should be easy for me to whip up something to reverse it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails floated over to his workbench to try and build a gizmo that could change him back to normal. Unfortunately, he soon became aware that his ghost-like condition meant that he was unable to hold solid objects; meaning that he couldn't even pick up his tools!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, no!' thought Tails as his transparent hands kept passing right through his screwdriver. 'If I can't pick up my tools, I won't be able to ever return to normal! What do I do?!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tails was reminded of the movie he had watched with Sonic the other day. That one had also been about ghosts; ghosts that made mischief by.... possessing bodies....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a lightbulb turned on inside Tails' head. If he currently had the powers of a ghost, then maybe he could possess a body in order to build the device that could turn him back to normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it just so happened that there was a body nearby for Tails to possess: Sonic's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Tails was a little reluctant to use Sonic's body; at least at first. He was his best friend, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut; the combination of needing a physical body to complete the device and the prospect of actually being a hero, soon changed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing on a hunch on how to possess someone, Tails dove down into Sonic, loosing conciousness when he hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tails came to, the first thing he noticed was that he was now taller. The second thing was that his arms had sandy-colored fur on them. Looking down at himself, Tails saw blue fur covering his legs and more sandy-colored fur on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up into a mirror in front of him, Tails didn't see the yellow-furred fox he was used to. Instead, he saw Sonic staring back at him, his body perfectly mimicking Tails' movements!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It worked,' thought Tails. 'It really worked! I'm possessing Sonic's body!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big grin formed on his, or rather Sonic's, face as Tails moved his borrowed body closer to the mirror, stopping right before Sonic's nose would have touched the glass and looked at his new reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure; it was a bit weird for Tails to see Sonic's face instead of his own, but the fact that he could actually BECOME Sonic (in a way) made up for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, Tails just couldn't resist running his new hands up and down over Sonic's body. Tails was a little surprised at the fact that Sonic's seemingly thin arms and legs possessed muscles that could put an athlete to shame; but, then again, Sonic did do a lot of fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tails continued feeling Sonic's ears, quills, tail and chest, Tails became aware of something moving between Sonic's body's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Tails to realize that all the examining he had done, had gotten Sonic's body aroused!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrdinarily, Tails would still be too young to experience such a thing. However; since he currently occupied Sonic's teenage body, he also had all of his hormones, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Sonic's 'tender parts' emerging from between his legs, Tails became so ingulfed in the new feeling of being horny that he couldn't resist it. Slowly, he moved his hands downwards to grab Sonic's 'shaft'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before they reached it a voice yelled inside Tails' head as if through a megaphone. 'What the heck are you doing?!? That you want to try being Sonic is okay, but this is definitly not!!! He's your best friend; you can't just do this to him, even if you control the body!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails' subconciousness succeded in snapping Tails out of the erotic fugue he had been under. He quickly withdrew his hands and then waited for Sonic's body to not be horny anymore. In order to speed up the process, Tails closed his eyes so that he wouldn't look at Sonic's body, though he opened them again as soon as the feeling were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis incident had gotten Tails back on track. He began to walk over to his workbench to start construction on the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever; as he walked, another little voice inside Tails' mind spoke up. Sure; it was unethical of him to 'pleasure' himself while in Sonic's body, but that didn't mean that he had to stop being Sonic quite yet. He could still go out and try out this body's speed, maybe smashing a few of Eggman's robots along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails' scientific mind also spoke up now. Instead of going back to normal, how about experimenting a little with these powers first? It could be interesting to see if Sonic was the only one that could be possessed, or if he could possess others, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tails decide to do?</span></div></div>",

She finally had the chance to pull off her biggest hest ever: The theft of the Guudlord-Itzbigg Diamond; the biggest jewel on Mobious after the Master Emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why Rouge had not attempted to steal it before, was because of the myriad of security devices and alarms that protected it. Not even she could get through security that tight. It would take a genius to get past all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the only genius she knew who could get past those systems was Tails, since he was the obe who'd designed them in the first place, and he was too much of a goody-two-shoes to want to let her get past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why she had jumped at the chance, when she heard a rumour about Doctor Eggman's latest prototype invention; something he called: The Phantomizer.<br>\r\nAppearently, the device was meant to seperate the soul from the body of whoever used it, without any negative effects. The 'Phantomized' individual would then be able to possess other beings like an actual ghost!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Rouge had stolen it from Eggman the second she heard about it. It presented her with a singular opportunity; since Tails wouldn't let her past the alarms, she would just use the Phantomizer to turn herself into a spirit, possess Tails' body, and then get the information she wanted straight from his own mind!<br>\r\nThe fact that she would become an 8-year-old Mobian fox boy in the process didn't worry her too much. It wasn't as if she was going to be Tails for an extended period of time; only just long enough to get the info and that would be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Phantomizer was currently on Rouge's living room table with Rouge slumped on the floor in front of it. Or, rather, Rouge's body was laying on the floor. Rouge herself was currently in a spirit form, hovering over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you know,' she thought. 'It works better than I expected.' Her sly smile got wider. 'Now, to find that fox.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge floated out through the wall and headed towards Tails' house. She actually floated faster than she could fly, so it wasn't long before she had arrived. Judging by the sounds coming from inside, Tails was most likely tinkering with some new device in his workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time to pay Tails a visit,' thought Rouge as she ghosted through the wall to the workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she saw, was the fox in question working on some new gizmo at his workbench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect! He's alone.' thought Rouge.  She didn't waste any time; as soon as Tails put down the wrench he was holding, Rouge flew into his body. Tails' body jerked awkwardly at first, but it didn't take long for Rouge to gain complete control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Rouge do now?</span></div></div>",

Now what do I...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts trailed off as Rouge suddenly realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've got to be kidding me,' groaned Rouge mentally as she became fully aware of what her only option to get the diamond was. 'The only one with the knowledge to shut down the system is Tails himself?!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge actually began to worry. 'This is not good,' she thought. 'I really want to get that gem, but Tails is the only one who can shut it down without it seeming suspicious.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge mentally sighed. 'I didn't want to possess Tails longer than I had to, but I don't have much choice if I want to get to that gemstone.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well; I suppose I'd better get started, then. If I want to gain access to the security system, I had better practice being Tails. Otherwise, the guards will just think something is wrong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge mentally prepared herself and then opened her borrowed body's eyes.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing that Rouge noticed when she opened Tails' eyes was that the workshop now seemed to be slightly bigger. Not surprising, since Tails' body was smaller than her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge took a quick look around the workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Huh,' she thought. 'It's weird seeing Tails' place from this perspective. From his body, it seems to be a lot bigger than it really is.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then prepared herself for what would happen next, as she took a deep breath and then looked down at her temporary body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was well aware that she was currently possessing Tails' body, it was still a bit surrealistic for Rouge to see the yellow and white fur on Tails' body instead of seeing her own fur and clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge made Tails' face blush red as she realized that Tails normally didn't wear any clothes other than his white gloves and his red-and-white shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of habit she tried to use Tails' hands to cover herself up, only to be even more aware of the difference between Tails' body and her own, as one of the hands passed over her now flat chest, while the other hand brushed against the fur covering the 'package' between Tails' legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahh!\" Rouge yelped in surprise, before moving the hand covering her now non-existing breasts up to her new throat. Hearing Tails' voice when she talked instead of her own, was quite unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment before she had calmed down enough to rationalize her thoughts and remove the other hand covering her new crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause male Mobians typically had thicker fur than female Mobians, it was normal for the vast majority to wear nothing more than gloves and shoes; since their fur acted as both a natural 'cover', kept them warm even during very cold periods and acted as a natural armor, too. Many male Mobians felt extremely uncomfortable wearing any other kind of clothing because of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, however, an extremely uncomfortable experience for Rouge; for even though she was currently inside the male body of Tails, her female mind still caused her to be embarrased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay; so it may be harder for me to pretend to be Tails than I thought at first', thought Rouge, as she recovered from her little scare. 'At least when it comes to not wearing more clothes than this.' She once more looked at the gloves on Tails' hands and then at the shoes on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge looked over her new self once more. 'No, this won't do,' she thought. 'I am looking out of Tails' eyes, but I need to get a better look at his body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then remembered that Tails had installed a mirror in his workshop, though she didn't know why he had done it. She looked around, spotting it hanging on the wall to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to walk towards the mirror, Rouge noticed that she was still swaying her hips when she walked. This would be perfectly normal in her own body, but, as she could see from the growing reflection in the mirror, it looked somewhat creepy seeing Tails do it. She also noticed that her balance was somewhat off, since she didn't have any weight on her chest anymore.<br>\r\nShe mentally made a note to herself about learning to walk lile Tails as well, before coming to a stop in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was aware that she was currently occupying Tails' 8-year-old body, it still felt strange to Rouge to see Tails' yellow-and-white furred reflection in the mirror instead of her own, 18-year-old body, mirroring every movement she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA closer examination of her new reflection revealed several things to Rouge. For one thing, she was almost a full foot shorter than she normally was. Rouge had met Tails lots of times before, but it was only now that she really noticed the size difference between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing she noticed was how strong she felt. Rouge could remember when she was 8 years old; she didn't have nearly as much strength as Tails seemed to have. 'Must be because he's a boy,' thought Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third thing she noticed was Tails'... well... tails. As a Mobian bat, Rouge herself was used to having a tail, but it was really different than the ones Tails had. Not only was there now two of them, but they were longer and much more flexible than her own.<br>\r\nRouge also knew that Tails would often rotate his tails like helicopter blades in order to fly. Rouge felt a little nervous at the thought of flying like that since she was used to using her wings to fly, but she didn't have much choice if she was going to pretend to be the young fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final thing she noticed was, again, the lack of clothes on her new body. It seemed to be much more prominent than before, now that she could see her new reflection, causing her to blush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge had gotten so used to wearing her sleeveless unitard, breastplate and all the other things, that she felt really naked at the moment; even though she was well aware that it wasn't neccesary for Tails to wear anything other than gloves and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't Tails wear more than this?\" grumbled Rouge, only to jump at she sound of the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was perhaps the most surreallistic thing about this situation: hearing Tails' voice instead of her own whenever she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe that I'm currently inside Tails,\" said Rouge in her new voice, while using Tails' hands to gently examine her new face; from her new fox-ears to her furry new muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels so different to be a boy,\" Rouge continued, as she moved Tails' hands down to examine her new chest. \"It also feels weird not to have breasts anymore.\" Rouge carefully used Tails' hands to feel the developing youthful muscles underneath his fur. \"But having these muscles makes up for it a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge suddenly let out a small cry of surprise and pleasure as she felt Tails' fingers brush up against his nipples that were also hidden under the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah... This actually feels good. I had no idea that a boy's nipples could be so sensitive,\" said Rouge, as she continued using her new hands to examine her new nipples. \"They are not as sensitive as my breasts, but they are sensitive enough,\" noticed Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge then moved Tails' hands further down his torso, this time stopping at his belly. \"He certainly has potential for a six-pack here,\" said Rouge, feeling Tails' youthful muscles before moving Tails' hands to her new waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should have figured that a boy's waist wouldn't be as thin as a girl's, but it still feels odd,\" said Rouge, noticing Tails' waist was a lot more rubust than her own, despite their age difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moved the hands a bit backwards to feel Tails' rump. \"It also feels strange not to have a big butt anymore,\" complained Touge while taking notice of the size difference between her own body's butt and Tails', carefully avoiding tickling the base of her two new tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge made Tails' cheeks blush tomato-red as she slowly, almost reluctantly, moved her new hands to her new crotch to continue her examination of Tails' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge gave off a little gib of shock (and pleasure) as her new fingers found the sensitive 'package' beneath Tails' fur. \"This is probably the weirdest part of being a boy,\" concluded the blushing Rouge as she carefully used Tails' fingers to gently feel her new appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should have thought this through a little more,\" said Rouge, making Tails' voice sound nervous, while she kept on touching Tails' tender parts. \"This thing is a lot more sensitive than I thought it would be. I don't know if I can get used to this in time to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trailed off as she began to feel her new 'addition' stiffening. Quickly removing Tails' hands from his groin, she watched in both horror and facination as Tails' 'rod' slowly wormed its way out past the fur, before standing at full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! This shouldn't be possible!\" exclaimed Rouge. \"Tails is far too young for this to happen! An 8-year old cannot possibly get 'turned on' like this! How is this possible???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost automatically, her borrowed body's brain came up with a theory.<br>\r\nRouge herself had gone through puperty already, but it hadn't happened to Tails yet. So; because her 18-year-old mind was inside Tails' 8-year-old body, Tails' body's natural functions likely got confused, which likely caused some sort of hormonal imbalance, which in turn caused Tails' body to become aroused way before its time when Rouge was examining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge thought this over carefully, while still staring at Tails' now erect member. If this theory was correct, then it just became much more difficult for her to imitate Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to do something about this,\" said Rouge. \"Maybe I can push it back under the fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatly for Rouge, due to the conflicting signals in her new body, she experienced an immense surge of pleasure the moment she touched Tails' member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh....\" moaned Rouge in Tails' voice. The lustful side of her phyche kicked in. Before she realized what she was doing, her new hands began to furiously stroke Tails' member. Although Tails' body was still to young to 'climax', the feeling of pleasure that Rouge got was still incredible. It took two whole minutes before she finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt... amazing.\" She glanced down at Tails' fingers which were wrapped around his 'rod'. The realization of what she had just done, hit her like a freight-train. \"Wait... This is wrong! I shouldn't have done this in Tails' body; he is still much too young for this to happen to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow slightly disgusted with herself, Rouge qiuckly let go of the 'rod'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Reciting the spell rogue had acquired she felt her body become lighter. Opening her eyes she realized that she had turned into spirit. Perfect. Phase one was complete. Looking down rogue noticed her clothes had fallen off and her spirit form was naked. While she might have felt embarrassed  there was currently no one else present and she was most likely invisible to any outside observe. Looking at her fallen garments she followed the next part if the spell. She put a hand on the heart shape  breast plate she always wore  and felt her body immediately get sucked inside and she possessed  her discarded clothes. The rest if her clothes, her boots and her gloves all seemed to dissolve and get absorbed back into the breast plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow came the next part. Rouge did her best to move her temporary  new body away from view. It was a struggle but she hid self well in Blaze's bedroom and there she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze arrived home after a busy day of adventuring. She was so exhausted and decided that a nice relaxing shower was in order to clean herself up. Not bothering about anything else the feline guardian stripped her self bare. She tossed her clothes into the dirty clothes and immediately got a fresh identical outfit to the one she wore before and rested it on her bed. The cat then went to the shower for a nice relaxing bath...surprising since she was literally a fire cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this was the perfect timing Rouge moved her breastplate from its hiding spot and onto the bed. She easily fitted herself into Blaze's close and thanks to the spell easily assimilated  the temporary body, her breast plate into Blaze's outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the sol guardian returned from her shower and promptly dressed herself none the wiser to the invader in her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze noticed how her clothes felt surprisingly more comfortable and tight this time. She felt a strange warmth and comfort in them. That warmth was Rogue's spirit slowly invading her body from clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside Blaze, Rouge decided to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cocky and arrogant sometimes, he has a good heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver the Hedgehog: This telekinetic/telepathic hedgehog from the future also has a variety of other psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow the Hedgehog: The very antithesis of Sonic, this black-and-red hedgehog is known to be moody, but is mostly cool, calm and collected. Is known to have a fetish for many different girls; Rouge is among the foremost of these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnuckles the Echidna: Hard headed and gullible, and another rival of Sonic (besides Shadow), his stubborn and seemingly selfish demeanor alienates most people besides his close group of friends (Sonic and the gang). He guards the Master Emerald on Angel Island as the last surviving Echidna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy Rose: This pink female hedgehog is Sonic's self-professed girlfriend. Would do anything for Sonic, but other than that, is mostly a kind-hearted individual who wouldn't hurt a fly. (Unless they attempt to harm Sonic.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze the Cat: Either from the future, an alternate dimension, or both. This sassy, purple haired feline is an ally to the 3 hedgehogs, and is rumored to have an interest in Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream the Rabbit: Sweet, calm, and peaceful, the bunny is one of the nicest people around. She's almost never seen anywhere without her pet and best friend Cheese the Chao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge the Bat: She's facing a dilemna: Knuckles? Or Shadow? Her skimpy outfit doesn't help - all sorts of men would do anything for her, further increasing her indecision. This well-endowed bat is known for using her assets in order to get her ways. And by ways, I mostly mean either getting the Master or Chaos Emeralds, or getting a guy. Either one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add more characters FROM THE GAMES ONLY. None from any comics or TV series. No OC's, either, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy, and please add! Also, please try to keep proper English. I reserve the right to edit poorly-worded chapters.</td>",
