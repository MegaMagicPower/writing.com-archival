This might be the only time you'll get a hot meal in a while!\" said Delia Ketchum, mother of Ash Ketchum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mom, I will!\" yelled back her son from the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Delia was about to go back to the laundry she was doing when she noticed an out-of-place box sticking out of the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh! Ash must've moved it when he was looking for his old cap and forgot to move it back.' she thought as she went over to move it back to its proper place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to push it in, she noticed that it was some of Ash's old stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness, I haven't seen some of these things in years! Let's see what's inside.\" she said with some excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see. One Mr. Bulbasaur plushie, one squirtle squirt gun, and oh! one charmander husky sized T-shirt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the memories she missed the most, Ash's plus-sized physique was one the that she missed the most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ash was younger, he was a chubby lad. With a round face, pudgy potbelly, and tiny moobs, Ash was definitely a 'husky' kid. Always, asking for more and always clinging to her, Ash certainly was a huge momma's boy And, because of his huge appetite and lack of exercise, he probably would have stayed that way had Gary Oak not moved here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gary moved, Ash and him immediately became rivals, always trying to outdo each other in everything. School, games, sports. And as Ash got more athletic, he started to become thinner, and started to become more and independent until he dropped the bomb that he wanted to become a pokemon trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that happened, she knew that she had lost her chubby nine year old forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ash came home, he announced that he was staying for month or more while his companions took care of some personal business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as she looked at him, still eating away, he could see the double chin, the potbelly, the round face smiling. She could see his tiny waddle, bouncing boy breasts, and chubby limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she decided that with the month she had with him, she would try as hard as she could to try to get her pudgy son back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Ash who was still oblivious to his mother's thoughts, wonder what would've it been like had he still been fat. He clearly remembered being fat and how much he loved it. The feeling of always being full, how fun it was to play with it sometimes, and how much he hated having to lose it all when he was trying to keep up with Gary. And he suddenly decided that he would try to get that back. And why not, he was here for at least a month. Enough time to gain a bit and lose it all again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that thought, he renewed his eating with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's two view points. Pick one, and make sure that Ash still gets fatten up at the end.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a cheery smile Delia cleared the plates of chicken (all empty now) from the table and looked over to her son who gave a content sigh. \"Did you enjoy the chicken hun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah it was delicious!\" Ash said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im glad to hear it! I have all these new recipes and no one to test them out on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've still got some room left if you still feel like cooking\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that\u2019s wonderful! I\u2019ll be right back with the first course\" and with that Delia returned to the kitchen with her Mr.Mime and resumed cooking. After twenty minutes she returned with a huge bowl of macaroni and cheese with bread crumbs on top. Ash's mouth watered at the sight of all the oozing cheese and smelled the heavenly aroma before the bowl could even be placed in front of him. \"Well dig in! I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything, ok?\" The only response she received was a muffled 'ok' for Ash had started wolfing down the meal as if he hadn\u2019t eaten in years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Delia came back with a 22\" deep dish pizza. \"When you\u2019re done this pizza will be wa-\" she was cut off by the sound of a fork hitting the bottom of a bowl and a loud sigh as Ash leaned back in his chair and rested a hand on his slightly larger stomach which pushed up against his shirt. \"It\u2019s good to know my boy has a healthy appetite\" she said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it\u2019s all so good! How can I not eat it all?\" Ash said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia tilted her head back and with renewed energy said \"Well I won\u2019t keep you waiting. I'll be right back\" then ran back to the kitchen. The kitchen was a virtual hurricane of ingredients flying and pots and pans clanging as dish after dish were rushed out of the kitchen. Delia and her Mime poured all their energy into their cooking after it became apparent that Ash was inhaling his meals faster than they could cook. Never the less massive mounds of burgers, steaks, buttered mashed potatoes and other filling, fattening meals found their way from the kitchen to the table to Ash\u2019s gullet. The young trainer ate so fast he barely took the time to breathe as mouthful after mouthful of food found its way to his belly which by now was so engorged it made his shirt ride up a good six inches while his poor pants struggled to stay buttoned against the heavy, taught ball of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoof boy that was good\u201d Ash said as he rubbed his bulging midsection. Delia peeked at her son from the kitchen and thought how meals like this reminded her of times past and brought out the tenth course. A whole apple pie with tons of ice cream on top. Ash eyed the giant desert and struggled to sit up under the weight of his swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this will be enough for you sweetie. I know how you love apple pie so much\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mom\u201d Ash said heavily \u201cDon\u2019t worry I think it will do\u201d. Ash tucked into the pie and with every spoonful, with every swallow Ash\u2019s belly visibly grew and strained against his pants as sweat started to pour from his head. With only one slice remaining Ash felt as if he would explode on the spot if he even looked at it. With determination not to let his Mom down he picked up the slice with one hand and crammed it down his throat. With a mighty gulp the slice landed in his belly and pushed it to its limit as a loud POP was heard. The last slice was the straw that broke the camels back as the button on his pants was blown off, hurtling it across the room like a bullet. The absence of the button allowed his belly to surge forward and push his zipper all the way down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat there in a stuffed stupor, his giant beach ball of a belly resting on his lap. With both hands he gently caressed his swollen gut and lightly moaned \u201cThanks Mom\u2026that was great\u201d he said softly as he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything for my growing boy\u201d Delia said as she covered her son with a blanket and patting his new found girth. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have your mail for today.\" \"Thanks Larry\" She then was checking the letters and saw that one was for Ash. She then went towards Ash. She noticed that he already unfasten his belt, and undid his zipper. She was very happy that her work was showing results. \"Honey, this letter is for you.\" Ash ripped the envelope and red the letter \"Ash, i'm bored.

Although he had just finished a massive lunch he tucks into his desert with delight.  As Mom cleans up the plates that had so recently contained two subs, fried chicken, a bowl of soup, and another pie, Ash grins a choclately grin.  With the one hand he finishes his desert while the other rubs his full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough after noon, Ash is still wearing only his boxers and t-shirt.  The boxers fell snug and his stomach is peeking out up to his belly button.  As his mom takes away the empty tin he reclines further, enjoying the sloshing sensation his tummy gives when rubbed - a welcome change from weeks of starving in the wild hunting Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd been up for several hours already but hadn't yet showered or even moved off the couch yet. All morning had been spent eating!  He burps contentedly and sighs.  Slowly he begins to doze.  Already he hears his mom pulling out pans and pots for dinner.  Ash's smile only deepens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like old times!\" he thinks to himself.  <br>\r\n\"Full up honey?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mom, thanks!\"<br>\r\n\"Such a good boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh lays full out on the couch, stomach fully exposed and falls asleep.  Within a few hours Mom has finished cooking a meal fit for a Junior Sumo in training!  Before she can wake Ash his belly stirs him to life and the hefty boy storms to his place in the dining room and begins stuffing his face like a starved animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom watches throughout the meal.  His rounded tummy bulges out visibly plate by plate.  She smiles and helps him load up each plate until the whole meal is in his stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles as she brings him his desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash reclines in his bed, later that night, still in his boxers and eating chips he laughs quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One week and I'm already near as big as I used to be! Wow!  No sense in stopping now, right?  It feels so good after all.  Why should I stop?\"  He pauses a moment to stuff down a cupcake and guzzle a carton of milk.  After a deep belch he continues his reverie.  \"Man that felt good!  Mom sure is baking me alot lately...  Oh well, its not like I mind! Heh! Hmm... I wonder how big I'll get by...\"</span></div></div>",

Ash was lazily only wearing his underwear and a t-shirt, so his shirt was stretched out like a sports top and his underwear was so stretched on his big butt, it was a wonder it hadn't torn off yet. \"But now...the next step to getting my big baby boy back,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom,\" said Ash, seeing his mother bringing him some toppings for his ice cream, including whipped cream, fudge, and chopped nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash...I  have some new rules for you,\" said Delia with a stern look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three of them. 1: You will continue to eat whatever I cook, no matter what,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem with that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2: You will let me take care of you completely. I will clean you up when your face is messy. I will handle your chores. And all you have to do is just relax and be my baby,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...ok,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3: From here on out. I am not mom...its mommy,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, mom,\" smiled Ash, before Delia gave him a light whap on the head. \"Ow!

Your not going to be a big boy while your in my house. Your going to be my little baby boy for as long as you stay here\" Delia said this sternly with anger in her voice. \"And no talking while you eat. I forbid it. Do you understand?\" Ash just nodded and sat quietly with a look of fear on his face. \"Good\" said Delia. \"Now its time for my little baby boy to eat\". Delia took the spoon Ash was holding and stuck it in the tub of ice cream, pulling out a large scoop of chocolate ice cream and stuffing it in ash's mouth. \"There we go, eat up honey\" Delia said with a bright smile on her face. Ash was scared at first, but he eventually gave in to taste of the smooth chocolate as he sat with a sleepy look on his face while he ate the ice cream. He lay on the couch as Delia kept feeding him scoop after scoop, pushing it into his maw. The pushing had left several chocolate stains all over his mouth. Ash was going to say something, but then remembered that he wasn't allowed to talk and if he did his mother would slap him over his head. Delia continued to feed Ash the ice cream and Ash of course swallows it whole. After he finishes Delia takes the bowl back to the kitchen and says\" Okay honey, mommy has more food coming so just sit there and relax\". \"Yes mommy\" says Ash still on the couch and still hungry for more. Delia simply smiled and headed back into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the next course and brought it to Ash. A large blueberry pie, but unsliced. Delia apparently wanted Ash to eat it by hand. She walked into the room with Ash still there, the last meal apparently plumped him up just a little bit more. His blobby belly jutted out between his now to small T-shirt and tight Size XL boxers and spread across his lap jiggling with even the slightest movement. \"Here you go dear\" Delia said placing the pie on ash's tummy which was soft enough to hold. \"Thanks mom- OW\" delia slapped ash on the head. \"What did I get through telling you, you will call me mommy\" Delia said angrily staring at Ash, her hands on her hips and her feet together looking down at her son. \"Its time i got a little stricter with you little boy\" Delia came up close to Ash' face angry. She tore a slice of pie from the dish. Ash was too scared to eat but he couldn't help what happened next. His mom clutched his face together with her hand forcing his mouth open and stuck the entire slice into his mouth, pushing the whole thing in slowly with one finger. \"You are going to eat mister and you are going to eat it all\". Ash understood this well enough already but his moms anger knew no bounds as she now despised Ash talking in a grown mature matter. She wanted her little boy back so badly she coudn't control herself. She even prevented him from chewing his own food as she closed and opened Ash's mouth, her fingers on his fat cheeks making them chew the food. Ash had no control at that moment for his jaw was in complete control of his mother, preventing him from speaking or making a sound above a muffle. He was so scared of his mother that he actually lost his appetite. \"Alright Ash, I've come to a decision\" Delia said, still holding Ash cheeks and squeezing them on both sides. \"Since you can't remember to call me mommy I'm going to have to punish you. I'm going to feed you every slice of pie here and you are going to sit here and eat them. And as an extra punishment<br>\r\nYou won't speak or chew your own food. I'll do it for you. Hopefully this will teach you to call me mommy. I'll give you a few minutes to rest but you do not touch the food\" And with that extreme forceful announcement, Delia left the room to prepare the next dish. Ash sat there looking down at the pie, he had never seen his mother like this before. It was like she was another person. What was he to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash had sat there in fear of his mother who really wants him to eat and be her little baby boy. His fat face showng a scared look as his mom rumaged through some more dishes to prepare the next meal. He could hear the plates hitting each other as she hit them together a bunch of times, showing just how angry she was at her son for not calling her mommy. Ash looked down to see his belly, exposed from his T-shirt to show his blobby mass and belly button while it held the dish of blueberry pie and jiggled with every breath he took. It lyed on his lap and quivered whenever it wanted food. his thighs were no different for had it not been for his blobby belly drooping over his lap they world be touching each other. his fat legs spread wide across the couch, pressing against the handresting sides. They were making his boxers tightly clench against each thigh. Ash then took off the plate of pie and put it on the table next to him. He then felt his big, jiggly belly as he put both his chubby arms around it and squeezed it from both sides, feeling the sloshing inside him as he shook it up and down, finally letting it go as it plopped back onto his lap. \"Man... I've gotten fat\" Ash said while slumping back, letting his belly jiggle and push out. After realizing how fat he got Ash knew that even though he had fun engorging himself  he had to continue his journey and get back on his feet. He tried to move off the couch. \"Urggg...Urghhhhh\" Ash struggled to move off his spot. his heavy belly was pinning him down. He pushed his fat body off the couch, but seeing as he had sat down and hadn't gotten up since, he couldn't stand for long and fell back down. \"OOOOOF\" said Ash tiringly as he couldn't support his newfound fat that bulged out of his body and sat back down. His belly jiggled a bit as he plopped down. At that moment his mom came back in the room.  Ash was scared of his moms angry look that she had walking toward him. He sat there with a look of fear on his face as his mom sat next to him and took the dish of pie in her hands. Knowing what he had to do he began to speak. 'Uh, mommy\" said Ash, remembering to call her mommy. \"I don't want to eat anymore please, I think I should-OW\" His mom pulled his ear. 'No Ash, you are not allowed to leave this couch unless I say so, understand\" said Delia in a angry voice, still wanting Ash to obey her like a little boy. \"Your nice and plump and i like you that way honey\" she had let go of Ash's ear, her anger subsiding as she grabbed a handful of Ash's jiggling belly fat and shaking it \"And i want you even plumper\". Ash was still reluctant about eating more seeing as he didn't really want to gain anymore weight, but his belly was causing him to slouch and laze about. He then began to speak again. \"Mommy, I don't think i should eat anymore\" said Ash trying to be confident and brave. \"Nonsense, a growng boy needs to eat, so down the hatch\" immediatly after that last word Delia grabbed Ash's face and clutched it in her fingers. She squeezed his cheeks causing his mouth to pry open, then she grabbed another slice of pie and stuffed the whole piece into Ash's mouth. The pie was hanging out of his mouth causing him to only speak in muffles \"MMMPPHH MMMMY\" Ash tried speaking but his mouth was stuffed with the pie slice and he couldn't remove it since his jaw was in control of his mom. \"Don't worry dear I'll fill up your tummy nicely\" she said while jiggling his soft belly \"Now eat up\" She then  proceded to push the whole slice into his mouth. She watched it slowly go in as she pushed it with one finger, forcing ash to chew. He chewed himself and swallowed relunctantly. As soon as he finished one slice another was crammed into his maw. This time however Delia pushed the slices into his mouth and held her hand over it while Ash chewed. Slice after slice was forced down his gullet, expanding his billowing belly further and further bit by bit. As he ate he looked at his mom the whole time. The look of a scared child on his face as he was forced to eat every slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the dish was empty and he sat there rubbing his stuffed belly. That's my baby boy\" Delia said rubbing his belly. All that eating had made Ash quite sleepy so he rested on the couch for a few minutes. \"Don't worry dear, there's much more food\" Ash looked at her and moaned . He didn't tink he could handle so much food. \"I need to get out of here\" he says..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

Not only was he too big to wear any normal clothing, but he also was an incredibly messy eater (much to Delia's delight). Ash's massive glob of a stomach reached past his knees and was only inches away from the floor. Two doughy boy breasts bigger than his head rested on his massive belly and his fingers and toes had inflated to resemble sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika!\" chirped Pikachu, almost practically immobile now.

Ash had grown so much so, that it was becoming harder and harder for him to feed himself. The last time he was weighed he was at around 550-600 pounds, and all the fat had been going strait to his belly and butt, his legs were becoming thicker everyday and it was starting to put strain on his boxers. His chest was making all his shirts fold under his big set of moobs, and stretched out the neck reveling some man cleavage. His arms, like his legs were growing thicker each day making it harder for him to lift the food to his mouth. His fingers and toes looked like overstuffed sausages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia giggled when she remembered seeing Pikachu sleeping on Ash's belly from time to time.

There sitting on the couch and watching TV was her big baby boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had really grown since his vacation. His belly had reached his knees and he began to form a third roll of fat. His belly rested between his flabby thighs that were as thick as tree trunks and fat had started to form around his ankles. His butt had grown to the point where it almost took up the whole couch, each cheek was the size of a bean bag chair. His arms had fat hanging off them and his wrists also had fat forming around them. His sausage fingers were covered with grease. He didn't have a shirt on so she got a good look at his chest. A set of man breasts rested on his belly hanging off of the sides a bit. His three chins and fat cheeks made him look adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hay mommy what do you have there?\" Ash asked his mother with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you a bowl of hot fudge, I hope you enjoy it.\" Delia told her son, she was getting ready to start feeding him when she heard grunting. She looked up and saw Ash trying to reach for the giant spoon with no luck. she didn't want him to hurt himself and this worked to her advantage. \"Oh honey you can't reach it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N....(huff)..(huff)....no..\" Ash said his cheeks and chins jiggling while he talked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you let me feed you honey, you just relax while mommy takes care of you.\" Delia said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really thanks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia climbed onto the couch and placed the apron around his neck like a bib. \"So you don't make a large mess like you do.\" Delia smiled at her son. Ash just grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay here comes the plane.\" Delia cooed as she feed Ash the fudge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was in total bliss, the feeling of hot chocolate fudge sliding down his throat made him feel so good inside. The fact that his mom was feeding him the food and he didn't have to feed himself was even better. 'This is great I feel just like a baby again, being fed by mom, and I knew she would like it when I call her mommy. Soon I really will be her baby boy again. Hmm I wonder if anyone sells 5XL sized diapers?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, all 10 lbs of fudge were in Ash's massive gut. Chocolate covered his face as he licked his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP.........ah, that was great I am so stuffed.\" Ash told his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia knew better to know her son was full. he would be hungry again after a nap.

Audino kept watch over him, making sure all of his needs were heard and recieved. Chansey was tasked with caring for the blubbery boy by changing diapers when necessary and bathing him after an especially messy meal. Miltank was in full production mode to help feed Ash, pumping out several gallons of Moomoo Milk per hour\u2014a drink as delicious as it was fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh awoke with a familiar pressure in his lower body. Audino's ears perked up as a wet fart noise escaped his rear. A sigh of relief came next. Nidoqueen swooped into action, flipping over the gargantuan mass of fat with ease, allowing Chansey access to begin operating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone made a stinky!\" Delia said as she carted breakfast into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma!\" he shouted, still being cleaned by Chansey. His mouth was opened wide, ready to be fed. \"Ahhhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank's udders pumped Moomoo milk into a mixing vat, where it was combined with other flavor and fat enhancing compounds. A hose was put in his waiting mouth and the liquid caused him to moan in pleasure. After Chansey was finished, Nidoqueen flipped the boy back over to allow his stomach room to expand, seemingly before their very eyes. <i>His</i> eyes however, were closed shut as the liquid slid down his throat and into his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of pumping sweet and fatty milk, his belly would have been round and taut had it not been for the dense layer of fat coating it. He groaned in pain once the hose was removed. \"Is my baby boy ready for breakfast?\" Delia asked, poking her head in from the doorway. Despite his current pain, his eyes perked up as the smell of bacon wafted through the air. He nodded and grunted in approval, and Nidoqueen got to work, heaving the boy up from his crib and out to his giant high-chair, (which was little more than a fold-out table attached to an oversized loveseat). Ash's rear filled the entire thing, spanning over five feet in width. His doughy gut, which now hung down between (and far past) his dimpled knees, was mostly concealed by the table, except for the large fold of fat which rested above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew filled the table before him with plate after plate of food: stacks of pancakes drenched in syrup, an entire loaf of bread frenchified, greasy cheese drenched scrambled Chansey eggs, a tray piled high with fatty bacon, and gallon of sugary orange juice to wash it all down. Ash opened his mouth wide and allowed Delia and Audino to feed him the feast before him, the act of chewing was enough to make his whole face jiggle. Nidoqueen got to work preparing the next meal while Chansey soothed his already sore belly as increasingly more food entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!!!!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour later and the feast was completely gone, now digesting into fat. Ash groaned in pain once more while Chansey tended to his bloated belly. \"Looks like it's time for second breakfast!\" Delia said. The words made him groan even louder. \"What's the matter my baby boy? Not grateful for all the effort we've gone through? Dear me, it looks like I have no choice but to punish you... You're grounded mister! That means you're not allowed out of the house <i>ever</i> again, do you hear me? And on top of that, you'll eat every morsel you're given, <i>without</i> complaining, otherwise I'll have no choice but to make you eat even <i>more</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Woah, what just happened to mom?'</i> Ash thought to himself.<i> 'As long as I get to be her baby boy again I really don't mind what she does...'</i> A few perverted thoughts emerged but were quickly shoved to the back of his head.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, Mr. Mime didn't take much convincing as he always missed Ash when he was out on his journeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week later, the effects of Mr. Mimes mental treatment began to surface. While Delia was fixing the nights feast for Ash, he was in the other room watching the highlights of this month's Elite Four challenge. Suddenly, Delia noticed the sounds of pokemon locked in combat had been replaced by light music. She glanced into the next room to see what Ash was watching and found that he was watching \"The Pokepals\", Ashes favorite show from when he was eight years old. She shared a knowing smile with Mr. Mime who was helping prepare for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater while Ash ate...</span></div></div>",

She rubbed his belly and went back to feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, after Delia tucked Ash in and kissed her big baby boy good night, she sighed. Ash was becoming the big baby she wanted again, but there was still something missing. It was then something came to Delia: she saw something she could use at Professor Oak's lab the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Oak?\" asked Delia, looking around. The poke prof was nowhere to be found; not that Delia needed his help. She helped him move some boxes when she had seen it and asked about it. She opened up the box she saw earlier and found several syringes with Miltanks marked on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Professor, what are these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Those? Those are hormones for Miltanks. Sometimes they end up lacking and can not produce milk for potential young. This was an off-shoot from some drug they were making for human mothers......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...here we go,\" said Delia, taking a deep breath. She injected the syringe into her arm, before feeling the pink liquid inside flow into her vein. \"Hmm...wonder if this was...\" she began, before feeling funny. Her chest, thighs, and butt started feeling hot, before she felt her shirt and skirt tightening. All three were expanding in size and girth, making Delia grow into a large hour glass. \"Wow! It worked!\" she smiled, gripping her boobs to feel them swollen with milk like when she was first nursing Ash. Now Delia could provide her baby with the most natural food he needed. Delia then looked back to the box and thought to herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Ash was sitting in the living room, groaning as he rubbed his swollen stomach from the lunch that he had just eaten. It had been decided that he would be on vacation for six months or more earlier that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Misty had called saying that she had to take a trip with her sisters to go visit some family far away and that she wouldn't be returning for five months or more. Then Brock had called saying that he had to stay home and take care of the gym until his father got back from a trip that would take about six months, if not longer. Neither Misty or Brock had explained, just saying that they had to take care of things with their families for roughly about six months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was fine with Ash. It gave him more time to gain weight. Ash reclined back, still rubbing his belly. He had noticed that morning that none of his shirts could even reach his naval anymore. He would have to have his mom go out and buy him some more shirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then an idea occurred to Ash. He sat up, groaning as he did so, placing a hand on the bottom of his gut in a futile attempt to stay the pain of moving on his full stomach. He peered into the kitchen where his mother was humming happily as she washed the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that his mother had to of noticed that he was gaining so much weight. She had to know, especially since she went out and bought him new pants that fit so he wouldn't have to walk around in his boxers, which reminded him. He needed new boxers as well. His underwear was getting a little too tight. Last night when he had bent over to pick up his pants so he could put them in his dirty laundry basket, he had thought that he had heard a rip, but when he had tried to examine his underwear in the mirror, he hadn't seen any such evidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to talk to his mother, Ash got up and walked into the kitchen. Three steps in, Ash noticed the freshly baked cookies sitting on the oven, cooling. Suddenly his stomach let out a tremendous growl and he was instantly next to the oven, stuffing the cookies as fast as he could into his steadily growing gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Are you still hungry Ash? I've also got some cake in the fridge if you want. It's your favorite, white cake with chocolate frosting.\" his mom said cajolingly from behind him. Ash turned with his mouth still filled with cookies and his hands full of them and beamed at his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\" he garbled around the cookies that were crammed into his maw. His mother smiled lovingly at him and turned to get into the fridge while Ash turned back towards the cookies and finished each and every single one of them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, he turned around to find that his mother had set the cake on the table for him with a fork and an extremely large glass of chocolate milk. He was quickly at the table in the seat the cake was set before, with the fork in his hand. He began to dig into the cake without any further ado, no even bothering to cut him any slices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then he would take a couple gulps of milk, but as soon as he replaced the glass, his mother was there, filling it back up. His glass never went empty. When he finished the cake, gulping down his entire glass of milk to wash the remains down, he groaned. He just then realized how much more his stomach felt, how tighter it felt, how good it felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you full now, dear?\" his mother asked softly. Ash turned to gaze at her, unaware that he had chocolate frosting all over his face with crumbs on his lips and shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I know you've noticed how much weight I've gain. I know you have! So, why haven't you said anything?\" he asked. His mother fell silent before turning around and pouring herself a cup of coffee and pouring Ash another glass of chocolate milk. She then returned to the table, giving Ash his glass and sitting across from him with her coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, honey, do you remember when you were little?\" she began. Ash nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but wha-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me continue dear. Do you remember how you were a little heavier than the other boys?\" she asked tentatively, never wanting to call her little boy fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I wasn't a little heavier. I was fat.\" Ash said bluntly, laughing a little. This caused his mother to smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you were a little fat. I remember how back then, how you would always cling to me, asking for something to eat. A cookie, a piece of candy, a piece of cake, a piece of pie, a snack, a sandwich. Just little things to show that I loved you and was paying attention. I loved that, Ash. I really did. I loved rubbing your stomach when you got a stomach ache, I love having to buy your clothes that were larger because you had gained a little too much weight for you to fit into your old clothes. I loved those days.\" she whispered softly. Ash's eyes filled with sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then Gary Oak moved here. And then you started getting active, losing weight, becoming independent. The little boy who used to sit in the kitchen, watching me, waiting for a cookie wasn't there anymore. The little boy who used to come to me for a belly rub because his tummy hurt wasn't coming to me anymore. The little boy who needed bigger clothes suddenly needed smaller clothes less and less often until he was just buying them on his own. Oh Ash, I miss those days so much.\" she cried. Ash got up and moved around to his mother, hugging her against his slowly fattening body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mom. I miss those days too. That's why I've been gaining so much weight. I've wanted to return back to those days, for just a little bit, at least.\" confessed Ash as he comforted his mother. She peered up at him, seeing the honesty in his face. She then beamed, tears still pouring out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ash, honey. What a pair we are.\" she murmured, standing up, hugging her somewhat squishy son to her. She then frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be full, though. Lets get you on the couch with a nice warm blanket and maybe a belly rub?\" she asked the last part tentatively. Ash smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A belly rub sounds nice mom.\" he murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then a belly rub it is.\" she chirped cheerfully, leaving him to the living room and the couch, only disappearing briefly with the warm blanket before she began his belly rub. </span></div></div>",

We couldn\u2019t have him sleep on the higher levels or he might break the floor &amp; fall down. I\u2019m really glad to see he\u2019s living with me now &amp; is just like he was in the good old days. Back when he was a fat little boy, a plump trainer.

Outside of course.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem Mrs. Ketchum.\u201d Gary said as he saluted her. He walked into the family room to gaze at Ash\u2019s enormity up-close. His face was framed with 5 chins each drooping over his chest &amp; boy boobs the size of melons &amp; they were constricting his neck. His cheeks were the size of beach balls stuffed with water, making his face look puckered up all the time &amp; covering a lot of his eye space, showing those glittering black eyes. His belly was about the same size as his butt which was the size of a jumbo king-sized bed, maybe even bigger. His legs were the size of marble columns &amp; just as heavy with feet that have 7 ft. of skin &amp; fat that can't even be wiggled. His arms can no longer bend &amp; look like Sequoia tree trunks &amp; his fingers looked like dumplings stuffed to the brim with exotic meats. He was sound asleep with a very light snoring (ironic at this size don\u2019t you think). His body was draped with fuzzy blankets that looked like they would make a circus tent over a fumigated house.<br>\r\nGary tiptoed in quietly &amp; removed the blankets from Ash\u2019s gut to see he was naked, not even underwear could fit him anymore. It seems that his grandpa\u2019s work did the trick. Then he jiggled Ash\u2019s belly, put whole 5 in. pencil into his belly button, &amp; then jumped onto Ash as if he were a bean bag chair. \u201cWakey, wakey Ashey boy!\u201d Gary shouted.<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh. Huh. Oh, morning Gary, it\u2019s been so long since I last saw you.\u201d Ash said groggily with a throaty fat-filled baritone. He tried to get up but there wasn\u2019t much energy left for him in his already large body.<br>\r\n\u201cEasy big boy, don\u2019t strain yourself.\u201d Gary said reassuringly while rubbing Ash\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh!\u201d Ash squealed in pain. \u201cWhat\u2019s that painful yet erotic sensation from bellybutton?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops. Forgot to remove the pencil from there. Here we go.\u201d &amp; the pencil was removed, but not without leaving behind some lint. \u201cSo how you feeling Ash?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGood, just hungry as usual. I still love the feeling of being bloated so much that I can\u2019t be stuffed anymore with food. My mom does that to me all the time, but now I\u2019m feeling something different.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s in my head.

Now before you say anything being a member has given us certain gifts, like the ability to see the bonds of those who truly love each other whether they know it or not like you and Misty.\u201d Justin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen they told me that they could let me know if you loved me but kept it from yourself I jumped at the chance. Ash please hear them out about what they are offering.\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin then continued. \u201cYou see if you agree to become one of us then the possibility of the couple getting married becomes 100%. You also would have to accept the blessing of our order and that would mean both of you get fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs fat as you guys?\u201d Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are still gaining; some of our older members are so big that they can\u2019t walk.\u201d Fran said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we are offering would change you forever and if you accept you can never leave the club. But think of what all of the benefits.\u201d Eric said. \u201cThis is a pardon the pun a very big decision that affects you both. If you need to we will give you 24 hour before you both give us your decision.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, I love you and we both know you love me too. We do not have to do this if you don\u2019t want to but this could mean that our dreams will come true. You could be a Pokemon master and I could become the greatest water Pokemon trainer in the world. I know it would probably mean that we would be the fattest trainers in the world but no matter what I will stand by you.

On a rocky mountain with practically no vegetation there was a twenty square foot landing that was covered in a lush grass field. That kind of thing stood out, mostly because it was a trade mark of celebi. She always made a field grow wherever she landed, legendaries had that kind of power. Ash froze in place, nodding to pikachu to jump down to prepare for an attack. Day break over the horizon had painted the sky a deep orange, perfect scenery, the trainer thought to himself. Now Ash was about to learn a lesson about picking fight with legendary pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi  didn't seem to respond to his presence... that is, until she started laughing. \"Hey, what are you laughing at?!\" shouted an indignant trainer. She floated up into the air and spun around. It was obvious she was trying to contain her laughter, but she couldn't look at Ash without giggling. She said something in the pokemon language before flying directly at him, \"woah uh hey!!\" Suddenly he was engulfed by a green field of psychic energy, and pikachu, knowing what that field did, didn't dare interfere with it. It seems that metabolic spray Jessie and James had hit him with had taken heavy effect, in fact, it would only take days for his body to show the new weight, and even rigorous dieting and exercise wouldn't be able to stop his gaining. Of course celebi could tell because she could see Ash's future just by looking at him. In the up coming weeks, he'd eat practically nothing exercise all day and still blimp out. She couldn't help but laugh! It was like her own private sitcom compressed to four seconds of run time! Every time she looked at the trainer, all the legendary pokemon could see was Ash turning into a blob!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to get an in person view of Ash Ketchum the Fatty in person, so she decided to do some temporal compression. Ash almost looked like he was being inflated with a garden hose, the gain happened so quickly, and it was only a few seconds before the field released him. He looked to have gained ten pounds, and his new stomach pressed out through his shirt. \"Hey!!! What the heck did you do to me!! Get this fat off of me!!!\" The celebi couldn't respond, she was laughing to hard. He looked so cute, belly all exposed like that. \"Pikachu...uh, Hey!!!\" Pikachu was on the ground, rolling over in laughter. Putting a hand to the flab, Ash swelled with indignation. \"Change me back!!\"</span></div></div>",

Well, if I did, it must just be two or three pounds, nothing crazy.\" he said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to be sure that he was not hallucinating, he got the bathroom scale and weighed himself.

How is that even possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took his belly in his hands and made it jiggle.

I seriously need to stop eating like a pig and start exercising more or I will get even fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got out of the bathroom and saw that Misty and Brock were not there, they had gone to the breakfast. He then went to change himself but as he was putting his pants, he had difficulty pulling them up his fleshy thighs and butt. He was jumping, hopping it would make it easier but the only thing it did was making his chubby belly wobble upside down. When he finally made his pants pass, he tried to button them. He sucked in his belly at the maximum and tried to made the button reach his hole. He finally did it and he heard Pikachu laughing at him for being so fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it Pikachu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his pokemon did not stop after two minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, let's put a shirt now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then went to search a t-shirt and found his favorite. He put it on and he saw that it was tighter than before.

Ash then heard his stomach growling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man I need to eat something right away, I will go take my breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then rejoined his friends and he started to suck in his belly so they would not notice his weight gain. Brock had made a huge breakfast and while Ash knew it would make him gain even more weight, he told Brock to give some to him. Ash ate more than any other time in his life. His belly was now fully bloated and his t-shirt was not covering it fully, giving people a great view of it. He then heard the button of his pants giving up and popping. He blushed when his two friends looked at him, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty then said:\"Ash, did you gain weight? Because you look kinda fat...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt dizzy, sick to her stomach, one side freezing cold from where she had been led out against the stone floor, the sound of voices seeming as if they were coming from far away. She moved slightly, as not to draw attention to herself, soon realising her wrists were bound behind her back with a length of material, and so were her ankles. A gag was tied over her mouth, tight enough to dig into her cheeks slightly, effectively stopping her from making any sound above a muffled cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So we just leave her here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan!

She didn't need to recognise those voices to know who they were, only one group of people were intent on getting their hands on Ash's beloved Pikachu, taking down anyone in their way without so much as a second glance. She tried to move, to ease the stiffness in her limbs, shock soaking through her as she finally got the chance to gaze down at herself. Where previously was a flat plane of taut stomach, arching in delicately to emphasise the light flare of her hips, was a stubborn bulge of skin, pushing apart her skin tight top from the waistband of her skirt. She took in a shaky breath, her belly expanding slowly with her frightened breathing, her muddled mind trying to listen to her kidnappers over her increased heart rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Full Incense: An item to be held by a pokemon. It is an exotic-smelling incense that make the holder bloated and slow moving. They'll be helpless to this.</i> Laughter followed, Dawn's heart sinking, able to taste the strong incense curling past her gag and into her very senses, her stomach protruding painfully in proof of it's work. If Ash fell to these effects when he got there, Pikachu would be ripe for the taking.  </span></div></div>",

That was a powerful attack, so they might not try again for a while.\"  Dawn smiled at this reassurance.  She continued huffing and puffing from the long sprint, the bulge that was her belly jiggled slightly with every breath.  Dawn did not notice, but Ash sure did.  Ash was hypnotized by it.  'Team Rocket said that I would bloat up,' Ash thought 'It must have happened to Dawn, but will it happened to me?'  Ash knew that he was exposed to the incense that Team Rocket threatened him with, so when would it happen to him?  Ash never was into gaining weight; unless it was a girl...a girl he liked...a girl like Dawn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Dawn, let's keep going.  Brock's at the Pokemon Center waiting for us.  We can rest up there and continue our journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the affects of that incense?

Suddenly, all three heard a sound: it did not come from the forest, it did not come from the sky, it came from Dawn and Ash's stomachs.  The two blushed at the gurgling sound.  \"Let's hurry to the Center Dawn so we can get a bite to eat.\"  However, the gurgling sound from their stomachs wasn't just from their hunger, but also from the effects of a certain incense...</span></div></div>",

We should have come here sooner!\"<br>\r\nBrock smiled. \"It's a shame none of her talent rubbed off on her son.\"<br>\r\nAsh scowled at his friend. \"I could cook anything I wanted to! In fact, I helped Mom make the dessert!\" He smiled smugly at his friends. \"Just wait until you taste a piece of my chocolate cake!\"<br>\r\nThey all finished their stew, dreading what terrors Ash's cooking would do to them. Dawn could almost feel her stomach churn in anticipation of its next meal. They were doomed! <br>\r\n\"Here it is, kids!\" Mrs. Ketchum brought in a large platter from the kitchen, and on top was...<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Exclaimed Dawn, \"That's the biggest cake I've ever seen!\" And indeed, the cake was huge. There were five large cakes; all piles on top of one another, glued together and completely coated with chocolate frosting. This cake actually looked edible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I was a good cook!\" Ash said triumphantly. \"I'm going to make you eat your words Brock!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll settle for eating the cake!\" Brock exclaimed as he practically dived from his chair to cut himself a slice. Soon, everyone was happily munching on their own piece. There was still a lot left though. Not wanting to let all of this beautiful cake go to waste, Dawn started on her second piece. Everyone else followed suit. Soon every one had another, and then another, and another followed that piece, until everyone had eaten down to the last layer of cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm stuffed,\u201d said Brock happily as he leaned back in his chair. \"Ash, you really ARE a good cook!\" Mrs.Ketchum looked worried. \"You know kids, that really wasn't a very healthy thing to do. We should have had something nutritious, like carrot cake, or a fruit salad even! You guys will need your strength for tomorrow, and I'm afraid that eating all of that cake will just slow you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, come on Mom! Lighten up! After all, I can hold my cake better than anyone else in the world. I don't have a girl's stomach!\"<br>\r\nDawn's eyes snapped up. \"Excuse me? What's wrong with a girl's stomach?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone knows that girls can't eat as much as boys can.\" Ash said in a superior voice. \"It's common knowledge.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" With that, Dawn grabbed another piece of cake from the platter. <br>\r\n\"Hey, no fair! You got a head start!\" Ash grabbed a slightly larger piece and stuffed it in his mouth with his fork. \"Ha!\" He said with his mouth full. \"I told you we could eat more!\"<br>\r\n\"In your dreams, skinny boy!\" Dawn tried to grab another piece, but Ash got there first. He quickly grabbed the whole cake and started shoving it in his face. Soon there was nothing left of the delicious pastry but a few crumbs and a smudge of frosting. <br>\r\nHe started dancing around the room. \"Haha! I can eat the most! Boys rule! Hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's mom shook her head. \"Oh, Ash, I wish you hadn't done that. Now you're going to get sick for sure! You've had more cake than anybody!\"<br>\r\n\"Ash Ketchum, pokemon master, never gets sick! I'm the master of the cake!\" he said, pouring himself a glass of milk. But just then, a funny look came over his face. He suddenly dropped the glass of milk, and ran to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn laughed out loud.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time after his victory in the Sinnoh League Conference, Ash returned home, hoping to take some time off from adventuring.  His friends had all gone their separate ways; Brock returned home to Pewter City, both to reclaim the mantle of Gym Leader from the stewardship of his little brother and to perfect his breeding skills, while Dawn joined up with her childhood friends Lucas, Barry, and Kenny, and trekked to the Battle Zone off Sinnoh's eastern shore, hoping to visit the famous Battle Frontier.  Ash didn't mind; after all, his friends had their own lives to attend to, and who was he to interfere?  As long as they were happy, he thought, so was he.  However, being alone for the first time in quite a while, the young trainer was at a bit of a loss as to what to do next.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, sure, there was always the elusive Isshu Region, which Professor Oak had suggested as his next destination.  It was far away, more so than any other place Ash had been, and was host to all kinds of new Pokemon, as well!  And, yet...for once the prospect did not excite him, at least not as much as it used to.  Truth be told, after so many consecutive years of it, the boy had grown somewhat tired of the seemingly endless cycle of visiting new regions and challenging their Pokemon Leagues.  No, for once, he wanted to go somewhere simply as a traveler, taking in the sights and just plain enjoying himself, rather than concentrating on yet another tournament.  But, where, he wondered, would he go to do such a thing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, he set the question aside, electing instead to spend some time at home in Pallet Town with his mother.  She certainly didn't mind, being quite happy to have her \"baby\" home for the first time in Arceus-knows-how-long.  Since Gary was away, Ash didn't really have anyone around to interact with save for her, his Pokemon, and the Professor.  As a result, he rarely found much to do besides sit around at home, watching TV and eating.  And eating.  And <i>eating</i>...after a good couple of months of this, the results made themselves quite apparent; where once was a fairly trim stomach, he had developed a rather prominent potbelly, while the rest of his body had thickened in equal measure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with Ash being Ash, he didn't even notice his deteriorating figure.  Nevertheless, he soon found that he was growing somewhat restless at home, and decided to shove off for his next destination after one more week.  He decided on a whim that he would visit Hoenn again, checking up on his old friends May and Max, as well as visiting some of the interesting tourist attractions that he'd missed the first time around.  Though he didn't plan on doing any heavy battling while there, he still brought along his Sinnoh team just in case.  After saying good-bye to his mother and the Professor, he was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving in Hoenn, Ash's first stop was Professor Birch's laboratory, whereupon he immediately inquired as to May and Max's whereabouts.  Much to his consternation, however, the Professor informed them that the two siblings were still traveling abroad, having set out for Sinnoh immediately after finishing up in Johto (\"Great,\" thought Ash.  \"As soon as I <i>leave</i> the place, they go there.  Just my luck, huh?\").  In their place, he found the Professor's son, Brendan; a tall, athletic young man with strikingly white hair and red eyes, he was the same age as Ash himself, and had returned to his homeland after an extended amount of time away, challenging the Leagues of other regions (conveniently explaining his absence when Ash himself challenged the Hoenn League).  A longtime friend of May and Max, he had returned to his father's lab in order to receive a mission from him, namely to journey to Hoenn's southwestern oceans in search of the ancient Sky Pillar, where the legendary Rayquaza was said to roost.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting either boy to be lonely, Birch suggested that they team up and take on his mission together.  This was no problem for Ash, who was always willing to make new friends, and had also been unsure of where he wanted to go upon arriving in Hoenn.  Brendan, on the other hand, was less enthusiastic, being rather aloof by nature.  Nevertheless, his father insisted, and they departed Littleroot together.  During their travels, they learned that they actually had quite a bit in common, both of them being talented Trainers with a natural affinity for battle.  Even more noticeable, though, was their shared love of food; both boys were incorrigible gluttons, who loved to gorge themselves at any given opportunity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, that's exactly what they did.  As the duo made their way across Hoenn, battling any Trainers they ran into and observing the many wild Pokemon, they also stopped at every last buffet along the way and stuffed their faces as much as they could.  And, with no one to tell them not to (Misty or Brock for Ash, May and/or his father for Brendan), they were able to continue their feasting completely unabated.  Naturally, this caught up with them quite fast; Ash's moderate pudge quickly piled up, and he soon ballooned to about three times the size he started at, gaining a big, bouncy gut that hung over his waist and a couple of new chins, with moobs and flabby limbs to match.  In spite of his lack of a head start, his new friend easily reached the same size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and yet <i>still</i>, neither one noticed, even as the very act of walking down the Routes became more and more laborious for them.  Presently, the two were making their way into Mauville City, no doubt about to head to the Pokemon Centre to hit the breakfast buffet.  As they approached...</span></div></div>",

After explaining how greatful they were to Pikachu they gave him a feast.  He also learned those pokemon that attacked them before were more than likely to come back and bother them when Pikachu left.  Ash didn't know what to do.  He had already fallen behind on his schedual and to stop to help every pokemon in need didn't help things.  Finally, he came up with a solution.  He told Pikachu to stay with the pokemon to help them get strong enough to protect them and Ash would meet up with him on the return trip.<br>\r\nIn the days that past Pikachu had to help all the pokemon train to better prepare for an attack whenever it might come.  With all the work he did to train all of them he was pleased to find them supplying him with plenty of food.  And at the banquets they held at night to thank Pikachu for protecting them Pikachu didn't want to be unappreciative so he ate his fill too.<br>\r\nAll this seemed fine at first, but Pikachu didn't realized his gut growing out more and more each day.  Pikachu started helping the pokemon train less and less and watched them fight one another checking out their moves to see if they were doing them correctly.  Another thing that was changing was the food servings.  The pokemon had trouble collecting food before Pikachu trained them to use their attacks more effectively.  They began gathering more food and giving Pikachu the biggest share of all that Pikachu gulped down each and every morsel.  But it wasn't just fruit either.  The pokemon started swipping food from people in the vacinity as part of their speed and stealth training.  Most of the pokemon were afraid to try human food so they let Pikachu have the majority of it.<br>\r\nBy weeks end Pikachu's wieght doubled.  Pikachu would've normally been more concerned with this, but in the week that past he started growing lazy.  The other pokemon managed to handle minor attacks on their own.  After the initial week Pikachu stopped monitoring the Pokemons' training and stayed under a berry tree that he could just lay on his back and catch the berries as they fell in his mouth.  Pikachu didn't feel like training anymore, just be pamped and relaxed as he had been.  He eventually lost track of time and even that Ash would be back soon to pick him up.</span></div></div>",

But in the center of it all was an enormous cake topped with berries, a cake made of several stolen cakes from the city, meshed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief Raichu, also fattened to enormous obesity, currently even larger than Pikachu, his enrmous gut hanging before him, came to the fattened Pikachu and stated in the native Raichu language, \"Welcome to our tribe young brother. We are the Fatchus, a rare tribe of pok\u00e9mon that honor the heros among us with enormous feasts, and you are now the greatest hero our tribe has ever known. Eat this cake, and take your seat as our chief.\" He backed away bowing as the new chief marveled at the cake, as he climbed to the top of his initiation. With great gusto he began the greatest feast he had laid eyes on, stuffing his cheeks as if he were a chipmunk, that way he could stuff down the most he could. Within a few minites he had already scarfed down 2 of the 10 tiers. He continued mawing his way back down to the ground, eating the tiers of increasing size, his t stretching and groaning with every bite. But as he started on the last tier, the bloated mous pok\u00e8mon was too full to continue. He crawled to his throne, ordering the pichus to feed him the 50 lb final tier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 250 lb blobby Pikachu soon finished his meal contently when soon a rustling came from the bushes. What was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pikachu finished his meal and patted his bloated belly.  He looked up at the sky and found it was dark.  He realized Ash was probably worried about him and had to hurry back.  On his scurry out of the forest he was blocked by a group of pokemon not wanting him to leave.  He asked them to step aside, but they refused.  Pikachu tried to leave another way, but once again he was blocked.  This began to irritate Pikachu as he shouted at them to let him leave.  This upset and angered the pokemon.  In truth they wanted Pikachu to stay and protect them, but they also knew he was a trainer owned Pokemon.  This left them with an important task for them to accomplish.  While most remained behind to keep Pikachu preoccupied a small group went out take Pikachu's pokeball from Ash.  Some of the pokemon were released from trainers before and they knew that if they destroyed the pokeball then Pikachu wouldn't belong to Ash.<br>\r\nIn truth they knew that wouldn't be enough to keep Pikachu here so they planned to try and pamper him so much he'd never want to leave.  If that didn't work their last ditch plan was to stuff him till he was unable to move and keep him from Ash.  After that they'd just have to use a little hypnosis to separate them.<br>\r\nPikachu was ready to leave forcefully when they heard someone call from above.  An Aipom and a few other pokemon were there and in Aipom's tail was Pikachu's pokeball.  Pikachu could only watch in horror as he flung it at a rock and see it shatter.  Pikachu felt the strange power of the pokeball lift from him, but this just enraged him.  He charged up his lightening, but before he could attack a group of pokemon leapt on him and began cramming food into his mouth.  Pikachu swallowed a little from the shock, but then zapped them.  They flew back, but more pokemon jumped in to take their place.  Pikachu kept zapping them, but it there were just too many pokemon to defeat.  Plus they were cramming his face with food and already having a full stomach he was already a little tired.  Pikachu's lightening began losing power with each shock until he could barely hold off the pokemon for a moment.  Finally Pikachu realized the horror that he was out of electricity.  His cheeks sparked for a moment then stopped for good.  Some of the pokemon tapped Pikachu's cheeks like they were seeing if they were still working.  When they were confident they were they backed away from Pikachu and let a few pokemon who knew hypnosis step in.  Using that attack all at once Pikachu was fed illusions of Ash being cruel to Pikachu and him smashing Pikachu's pokeball.  After that he was misled that the pokemon conforted him and his recent binge was caused by him drowning his sorrow in food.  The illusions continued and made Pikachu feel so sad he began munched down food in reality.  After a while of hypnosis Pikachu's sadness turned to anger to the pokemons' delight.  Pikachu got up with newfound energy.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ash was looking for Pikachu when he ran into some more pokemon.  He asked them if he knew where Pikachu was, and was answered with a hypnosis attack.  He began to see Pikachu acting very rude and selfish to him.  That Pikachu pigged out on their food supply and began treating Ash like his slave.  The images came coming into his mind until he was just as angry as Pikachu.<br>\r\nThe two then ran to find one another and when they did they began yelling at each other confirming what they saw to be true.  Their anger grew until they agreed that they were going to part ways there.  Ash stormed off without Pikachu.  Pikachu on the other hand went back to the other Pokemon and agreed to be their guardian.<br>\r\nAfter the cheering that Pikachu would stay they all turned in for the night.  All of them except Pikachu.  Despite being mad as Ash he was still really upset.  He began stuffing his face again despite being really full already.  Pikachu pigged out on the remaining food before he went to sleep that night.</span></div></div>",

All that happened was that he got fatter, lazier, and even more depressed. After a full week of him binging on \"Comfort food,\" he was incredibly huge. The average Pikachu weighed at around 30-35 pounds, but all of his eating caused his weight to skyrocket to 80 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     His arms and legs were as thick as his waist was originally, his fat head peeking out on top of his body along with his triple chins, and his stomach bulging out 2 feet on either side of him, 3 feet out of the front. Even his tail was noticeably softer and duller, sinking a bit into his bigger butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Pikachu was a mess.

Several times, he turned around to beg for Pikachu's forgiveness, but stopped himself before he went back in the forest. He went all the way back home to Pallet town to try and forget about Pikachu and their argument. And he did it the same way as Pikachu was, by eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh walked into his house feeling absolutely miserable about the whole ordeal. His mother decided to try and make him feel better by making him all of his favorite foods, in a huge amount. All that did was make Ash stuff his face for the next couple of days, moping about Pikachu's and his fight. His mother was constantly in the kitchen, trying to keep up with his eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt just as bad as Pikachu about what had happened between them, if not worse. They were friends for as long as either could remember, and one little fight got the both of them to part ways. No wonder why they were both so sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had gotten a whole lot huger since he first got home. His gut stuck out a good 3 feet on either side, 4 out in front. Ash's shirt was barely clinging onto his perfectly round gut, just barely covering his chest. His face looks a lot more filled out with his cheeks puffed out, and his neck almost invisible under three chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's arms were about three inches thicker than they were before, only moving to shovel more food into his gaping maw. His legs were about 5 inches thicker, and his thighs were touching each other, resulting in him to have to waddle from place to place. Of course, the only places Ash went to were the bathroom, and his bed at the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Pikachu were both very depressed about their fight, and they were both handling it by eating, (very poorly if I may add). The only question now is, what do we do now?</span></div></div>",

They weren't sure at first what to do, but one of the pokemon commented on how Pikachu seemed happiest while he ate so they figured a lot of food would do the trick.  With that they began gathering all kinds of foods for Pikachu to munch down.  Pikachu smiled at the first few piles of food, but started getting a little worried seeing the piles soon towering over him.  Though he had been saddened after losing Ash he had started becoming aware of the shape he was in and started to think about working it off.<br>\r\nJust then a Pichu came in stumbling with a jug of a strange kind of nectar.  The pokemon called it happiness nectar since it made them feel happy after taking a sip of it.  It was kind of like laughing gas which was what the pokemon didn't realize.  Finally, the Pichu tripped and the nectar splashed right into Pikachu's face.  At first he wiped it away and spit it out, but before he knew it, he was intoxicated with it.  He laughed and chuckled.  Sparks shot out of his cheeks and the pokemon thought the food was working.  They started handing Pikachu the food to Pikachu who began stuffing himself semi aware of what was happening.  Pikachu's recent binges have made his appetite quite big not to mention his current jolly state made stuffing himself silly easy as well.  Since the dose of nectar he drank was quite large he was giggling for hours and eating between those laughs.  As time passed it soon became dark and all the pokemon, along with Pikachu went to sleep.<br>\r\nThe next morning Pikachu awoke to find that he was huge.  He could barely remember what he did yesterday, but knew more than ever he had to shed his new weight.  He got onto his four paws, but soon collapsed under his weight he had to crawl to move now as his body was simply tremendous.  He barely got a few feet when the pokemon arrived around him with food in hand.  At that instant Pikachu's stomach grumbled in hunger.  Pikachu looked at the food and couldn't understand.  He never desired food in such a way before.  He wanted to lose the weight, but another part of him wanted to eat.</span></div></div>",
