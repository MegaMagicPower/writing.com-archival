He should\u2019ve asked her out, but he didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sense of guilt only grew over the following weeks. For as the weeks went by, Juane started to realize just how much time Pyrrha spent with him and how little time she spent with others. Not to mention, Pyrrha more often than not acted as their conversation starter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, Juane finally worked up the nerve to do something about it. He went to Nora for some relationship advice, since Ren didn\u2019t seem nearly as talkative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point on the calm sunny day while Pyrrha was out practicing, Juane nervously walked up to Nora in their room. \u201cUm.. Nora, can-can I have some advice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora smiled \u201cSure thing Juane. Is it about Pyrrha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane blushed. \u201cYes. H-how\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora just chuckled \u201cAww, it\u2019s just female intuition is all. So what\u2019s troubling you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane nervously looked away as he asked \u201cWell\u2026 I feel really bad about not asking Pyrrha out to the dance and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora finished his sentence \u201cit\u2019s okay Juane. Believe me, Pyrrha is used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it though! I\u2019m the reason she\u2019s used to it. She\u2019s always been there for me and for some reason I became clueless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane responded rather depressed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t only that. I talked to her about Weiss rejecting me. For so long, I acted like I was in love with Weiss. I know I\u2019ve changed sense then, I just\u2026 oh, I just feel so lousy. Is they anything I could get for Pyrrha that she\u2019d love?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was taken aback by the sudden leap into serious-ness, but responded appropriately. \u201cWell now, I\u2019m getting the sense you want something bigger than just flowers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeees. That\u2019s right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 there is this one thing that might do the trick..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, what is it? Whatever it is, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was some magazine. Oh what was the name of it.. \u201cBody Change.\u201d I dunno. I think that was it. She\u2019s talked to me about a couple things she wished you took notice of with your body. I can\u2019t remember what those things were, but I believe she was reading about them from that magazine. I could be wrong, but it\u2019s worth looking into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go get it right away. Where is the magazine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.. I think the latest copy she was reading is somewhere in her drawer. Left drawer maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane nodded and quickly looked for it. Luckily, he was successful and hid it in his breastplate armor. Then he rushed out the door to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora nonchalantly said after he left \u201cHaha, he better give me credit for this idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Juane found a quiet secluded place in the library, he scrolled through the pages of the magazine in hope of some clue. And on the 7th page, he found it! There was a brief mention of something called \u201cyouth dust.\u201d Reading over it, Juane thought it was referring to some sort of appearance changer, like a youthenizer or something. After all, he remembered how much his sisters talked about \u201chow bad it was to look old.\u201d In his mind, surely this had to be one of the things Pyrrha wanted. That said, he couldn\u2019t remember her mentioning anything about him looking too old. He chalked that up to his own insensitivity though. So, in a record breaking speed he mailed a request to the address with the money attached. It was a modest 40 dollars and surely worth it for Pyrrha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after sending his request through speed mail, he went back to his room and put the magazine back where he found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora perked up after seeing him back so soon. \u201cSo.. how\u2019d it go? Do you think you got something good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, absolutely! But I\u2019ll keep it a surprise for tomorrow when it comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Pyrrha was coming in \u201cHi guys, how\u2019s it been since I was gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane spoke up first clearly showing something was up \u201cGood.. good\u2026 I\u2019ve got a great surprise waiting for you tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou do?! Well, thank you for telling me so soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Pyrrha\u2019s response, Juane realized how stupid it was that he said that. He thought that it would hurt the surprise. So, he tried extra hard for the remainder of the day, to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Pyrrha knew it, the next day, a Saturday, had come. Juane eagerly woke up early to get their team mail and sure enough it came! The youth dust came with a little bit of instructions, which he breezed through. Once done, he planned to take it around noon for the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce noon hit, he stopped Pyrrha before she went to the cafeteria with Ren and Nora. \u201cPyrrha, could you not leave just yet? I have that surprise to show you!\u201d Nora and Ren just nodded and were out the door in a couple seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d Pyrrha gleefully said. \u201cYou know, Juane you didn\u2019t have to. It was awe fully thoughtful though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense. After what I did at the dance, I need to make it up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha blushed \u201cJuane. That was nothing. If anything, I made a mistake. I should\u2019ve told you how I was feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to say, but I still felt it necessary. So, if you don\u2019t mind, could you put on this blind fold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha smiled and said \u201cOk. Tell me when you\u2019re to take them off.\u201d Pyrrha then blindfolded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do.\u201d Once Pyrrha seemed fully blindfolded, Juane did as the instructions said; he drank the youth dust. Apparently, this youthenizer was triggered by drinking it. Juane thought it was weird, but he didn\u2019t question it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with no second thought, he drank the pink dust, instantaneously turning into a 1 year old. His clothes didn\u2019t shrink with him though, leaving a big pile of clothes on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the regression was complete, he looked at his now chubby arms in complete shock. He couldn\u2019t register exactly what happened, but he could tell one thing; whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Juane, Pyrrha heard the clatter of his armor fall to the ground and immediately became concerned. \u201cJ-Juane, is everything alri-\u201c After just slightly peeking out of the blindfold, she saw the pile with Juane\u2019s clothes. \u201cJUANE?! JUANE, WHERE DID YOU GO?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen almost on que, Juane started crying. \u201cWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Pyrrha connected the dots, becoming scared of what lied beneath Juane\u2019s hoodie. She slowly kneeled down and moved the clothes around to see what was inside. Sure enough, her first guess was right. Juane turned into a baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding out the truth, she shook in fear for a couple seconds. Then, something triggered in her. Her instincts that is. She did what she immediately knew to do with crying babies; she cradled the now naked baby Juane, humming a lovely tune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer instincts served her well, since Juane quickly calmed down after. Once he was back together, she sat on the bed with him in her bosom and, as calmly as she could, asked \u201cJuane.. what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane nervously replied \u201cM-m-maga-zeen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha became even more concerned \u201cWhich magazine Juane? What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane became tear-y eyed for a little bit upon further questioning \u201cDa-da-dat wun\u201d Juane then pointed to Pyrrha\u2019s drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha\u2019s concern and agitation only grew with that response. Still, she took her precautions, wiping the tears from Juane\u2019s cheek. Then she got up, holding Juane in her left arm and walked over to the dresser. She opened it and pulled out the only magazine she knew she had. \u201cIs this the magazine, you were referring to Juane? What about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Pa-ja se-ben\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was in great suspense, but did what was instructed. Once she pulled to page seven, she immediately got a clue. \u201cJuane\u2026 please tell me you didn\u2019t use this youth dust on yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane just nodded in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha just facepalmed. \u201cLet me guess. You thought it meant youthenizer, and the present was you\u2019d appeal to my taste in looks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay Juane\u2026 we\u2019ll find a cure. In the meantime, I\u2019ll take care of you. Just please don\u2019t make this mistake again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cK-kay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha chuckled in response. \u201cDon\u2019t feel too bad though Juane. I\u2019m not opposed to taking care of you for a couple days.\u201d She then changed her expression to a more motherly one. \u201cIt helps me express something to you that I\u2019ve been too embarrassed to express: love.\u201d Pyrrha then lovingly hugged Juane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuane cooed in response to her hug. But then she said something terrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst things first though, you\u2019ll need a diaper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
