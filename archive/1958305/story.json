It was only a few few months until the tournament would start, and everyone was doing their best to make sure everyone and everything was ready. Master Hand was currently going through the mail to see if any of the other fighters had replied to say they were on their way. In amongst the letters though, was a strange parcel. Opening it up, he found a strange device inside, and a manual explaining how to use it. After a quick look for the manual, he certainly new this wasn't a new item he wanted to use for the tournament, it was far too uncontrollable and dangerous... much like the person he gave it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy! Can you come here for a second?\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a flash, the hand's brother burst through the door. \"Yeah bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to take this to the incinerator,\" He said, handing the package to Crazy. \"It's far too dangerous to let it stay around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" Just as quick as he entered, Crazy left in the direction of the incinerator. Of course, Crazy was more than a bit scatterbrained, and on his way, he thought of something else to do and sped off in another direction, dropping the package as he went. And so that package sat in the hallway of the living quarters of the tournaments grounds, until someone happened to find it and take the contents of the package for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that person is you. But who are you?</span></div></div>",

Curious to see what is in the package you decided to take a look in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure that no one is around, you open the book and find a strange remote inside with some type of manual. You look at the remote and see a bunch of strange buttons on it. You are not sure what they all do so you decided to open the manual and read up on it. According to the manual, the remote has the ability to change the user with an other person depending on the button. You decided to go back to your room and do some more investigation on the remote. Lucky for your Luigi (your brother) was not in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing some reading, you wanted to try and test this new device on someone. You are not sure who exactly you would want to try this on and even what button do you want to press. There are so many options for this.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were almost instantly aware of your new HUD as you looked out of it to stare at your previous body who was now occupied by Samus-Aran and who now looked slightly confused but still looked towards you and says, \"uhh sorry Samus, I'm not very sure why I'm here but I hope I see you later!\" and jumps away leaving you alone in the hallway with Samus' body and power suit. \"Well that didn't go to plan, I didn't want to steal her...well EVERYTHING! From what she just said to me and how she acted it seems like I have her life now plus her body AND clothes\" you mumble as you walk towards the training area, presumably where Samus was going before you stopped her. You reach one of the large tournament stadiums where most of the actual games took place and find many fighters already training with each other there specifically Link and Ganondorf who were locked in a heated battle. You decided to let them duke it out on the bottom of the stage while you get more familiar with your new weapons and abilities closer to the top of the large stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got acquainted with her \"recoveries\" as most fighters call it while somersaulting upon the platforms to get to the top, your jumps weren't as high as before and jumping really wore you out while wearing the power suit so your recovery was a better option. Once at the top, you decided to work on your new arm cannon on a few training bags, keeping a mindful eye on the two clashing forces below you, you shot the bag a few times with a couple missiles but then discovered how much more damage it did when charged it for only three seconds, unleashing a powerful ball of energy towards the poor bag knocking it back a few meters after the initial collision. \"Wow! That was awesome!\" you say aloud as you  look upon the damage that singular shot did, \"what other abilities does Samus have to offer I wonder?\" You use more arm Cannon attacks upon the bag and even getting up close and doing some melee damage upon it, grabbing it with a grapple beam and knocking it to the ground before unleashing a volley of damage using a flamethrower like device within the arm cannon knocking it high up into the air allowing you to jump up and do a type of spin attack launching it even higher and higher until it stayed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were preparing for it to fall yet again when suddenly you heard two swords clang against each other very close to you and, with your new bounty hunter skills and reflexes you dodge completely out of Link and Ganondorfs way for the moment at least. As the two powerful forces of good and evil were now bringing their fight to the upper platforms and it was getting more and more violent and chaotic. You now knew that it needed to stop or the whole stage would need to be rebuilt before the tournament actually began so you decided to fire a charged ball of energy at Ganon, who was the most destructive. It knocked him up up a bit allowing link to get a good hit upon the immortal king but ultimately this only made him angrier as he attacked both fighters  with animosity and vicious rage that both fighters were barely able to keep up. He slashed out with his long sword every once and awhile and was almost always blocked by Links Master sword or your grapple beam and either stunning him or taking away his sword for a couple precious moments allowing both of you to deal great damage upon him and even knocking him off the stage but he swiftly recovered to the ledge showing that this obviously wasn't his first time in the tournament. Fortunately both you and Link were veterans of the tournament, meaning you both had more knowledge and experience fighting on theses stages and as such were able to trick him into following them off the stage and allowing Link to spike him off into the abyss. He almost recovered but thanks to your missile it knocked him even further off not even allowing his recovery to save him that time and thus throwing the King of evil into the abyss to wait out the rest of the round while you and Link celebrated upon the now partially destroyed stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was exhilarating huh, Link?\" it completely slipped your mind that Link (usually) preferred to stay silent, even in the most dire of situations, so you were almost confused by his thumbs up and exhausted smile. You smiled back, though he could not see it because of the visor, and gave an equally exhausted thumbs up back to him showing you admiration of his skills and abilities through one gesture. Link soon left the stage, presumably to go and rest after that long training session, leaving you alone on the now wrecked stage leaving you to find that you were also exhausted and had the power suits A.C. to thank to keep the sweat from getting in your eyes and face and you also decided to head back to rest. However where would you go? Back to find your real body and swap back? Or would you stay in Samus' body and go back to her room to rest? The real Samus didn't even seem to know of the swap ever even occurring and just assuming her new role as the the first of the Mario Bros. but then if you stay would you be stealing Samus' life?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions were circulating through your head and you decided to take out the remote and look at, giving it a good feel. You decided to...</span></div></div>",

You slipped the remote back into one of the suits many containers and walked out of the state and back into the long hallway you had come in from, you notice Ganon on the right sitting on a bench that was right outside the stage's entrance and he was looking very sour about the fights conclusion. You briskly walked past him eager not to get into another conflict with him but you caught something before you rounded the corner: \"better watch yourself, Samus-Aran\". \"Great\" you think to yourself \"Now I've created an enemy for Samus\". You walk back to one of the main courtyards and look around for rooms/dorms for women (for obvious reasons boys and girls could not share room) and find that it was on the right lane as opposed to the boy's left lane. You travel down it and find many rooms with names and such upon them indicating who was supposed to be rooming with who: Zelda and Peach went well together and Bayonetta and Palutena tolerated eachother. You were relieved that Samus was roomed with Sheik who, like Link, was not to chatty so you didn't have to be asked questions about Samus you didn't know, because the swap had only given a few helpful memories like how to put on and off the power suit and zero suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned the handel to get inside but found it wouldn't budge, \"huh? What the-\" you forget with it a little more until you finally realize that unlike the boys rooms the girls had codes that needed to be inputted before entrance, something about men not being as trustworthy or soemthing. That was one memory that the swap had neglected to give you so you were stuck outside until you could ask one of the hands to open it for you or if Sheik could possibly open it for you, which would've been a bit awkward. However, the door opened on its own after about a minute and a computerized voice says \"scan complete identity authenticated: Samus Aran, welcome\". You were a little confused by what just happened, did it just scan you to let you in? If so that was very convenient to you, you walk in and find a small living quarters scattered with technology probably belonging to Samus and two doors in the back with Samus' name on one door and Sheiks name on the other. You stepped carefully over some of the junk and weapons that Samus had left and stepped into the thankfully unlocked door to enter Samus' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a bed that looked comfortable and had extra beams to keep it up so it could hold more weight, Samus probably wore her power suit to bed at times causing the regular beds to collapse, you were tempted to test the weight capacity of the bed now but decided if you were gonna get some rest you didn't want to wear the power suit and find yourself cramped later so you pressed a few modules here and there then pressed a deactivation button the arm cannon that allowed you to slide the suit off. You started with the arm cannon to give you another hand then began to take off the boots and let armor allowing you to walk more freely, you then pulled off the cheapskate then the arms and finally the helmet and placing the pieces in a neat pile in the corner for later use. You were now in her zero suit and were tempted to take that off as well but decided against it out of respect for your friend, you climbed into the bed and began drowsy quickly before finally passing out on the comfortable subsets and pillow.</span></div></div>",

A loud grumble is heard coming from your stomach only confirming that it was time to eat, \"Well I better get going if I want to eat something\" You say before rubbing your now very slim but durable stomach and turning off the loud alarm before placing the helmet back with the rest of the power suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do you take the Power suit to dinner or stay in the Zero suit?</span></div></div>",

The leg plates and boots were the first on and made you quite a bit taller, then the torso and chestplate which covered a lot of...well Samus's \"gifts\". Then the bulky shoulder plates and arm cannon respectively on your right hand and regular arm and hand coverings on the left leaving only the helmet which you picked up and slipped on. It took a minute for the helmet to sync with the rest of the suit and make it fully operational but when iit was done yo felt super powerful; similar to how the mega mushroom made you feel after you consumed it. You smiled as you exited the room to find the messy room now cleaned and organized with all the weapons now in a neat pile in the corner, you then noticed that Sheik was impatiently tapping her foot in the corner apparently waiting for you, \"let it be known,Samus, that I will not be responsible for your gadgets next time AND wait for you. I'm starving\" she informed you before opening the door \"by the way, I was informed the moment you tried to enter the room...please remember the code next time\" she handed you a sheet of paper containing the 4-digit code: 2679 and then left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou memorized the code but slipped it in one of the suits compartments just in case you forget, \"huh that code looks familiar...ehh its not important right now\" you say before following Sheik out into the long hallway where you see she is again waiting on you. \"Jeez Samus,  you're ususally a lot faster, something up?\" she questioned as you both walked along the long hallway. \"uhh well, nothing much\" you mumble getting a laugh from Sheik which was unusual considering Sheiks usual toughness \"heh heh, sorry just never heard you mumble before, somethings clearly bothering you Samus and I intend to find out so why not just tell me\" you think on her words and finally say \"well...I kinda helped Link defeat Ganondorf before I took my rest, he was super tough and after he kinda threatened me\" Sheik's eye widened a bit but still remained calm enough to say \"heh well...yeah I guess that would be a unnerving event for you, considering he is a very powerful fighter...maybe even the most powerful fighter currently here\". This did not set you at ease at Ganons supposed threat to you, but it was good cover for your odd behavior as Samus so you'd stick with it, \"yeah...I just hope he doesn't do anything too harmful in the tournament\" Sheik shook her head and said \"i wouldn't bet on it\" just as you and her arrived at the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many fighters were already present and eating the food that both Crazy and master hand were creating, while it was mostly Master while Crazy messed around with the flour and made chaotic \"snowstorms\" much to Master hands dismay. Peach and her toad companions were sat together at one of the tables enjoying sandwiches and lemonade and you were tempted to join them but then the real Samus beat you to it along with Luigi who had brought over some delicious smelling spaghetti. You decided against it and chose a spot next Sheik and Palutena before going up to get some food, there were so many options ranging from the delicious smelling spaghetti from earlier to a full on turkey possibly made for duck hunt (one of the new additions to the roster). You picked up a simple meal of a couple wings and plenty of vegetables, something about looked more appetizing than the spaghetti for some reason, you brought it back to your spot and begin eating, having taken off the helmet to eat more easily. You look over the large dining area until you spot Ganon in the corner of the room, he wasn't eating anything but was just observing...watching his fellow fighters enjoy themselves without enjoying it himself, very creepy indeed. You were brought out of your staring to a tap on your shoulder plate which made you jump in your seat and looked over to see....</span></div></div>",

You gulp at her words and say a lot calmer than you really were \"it's cool Mario..really\" she smiles and heads back over to peaches table leaving you to your food and thoughts: \"why didn't I do anything? I could've swapped back if I was quick enough so why didn't I? Am I getting...close to Samus?\" you think in your head as you quickly finish your meal and head out leaving the cafeteria to go back to where it all began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive in your room where you stashed the box and manuel, hopefully Samus or Luigi hadn't gotten too curious and messed around with it. You enter quite easily due to your arm cannon and find it in the back where you left it quite undisturbed, you swiftly run over to it and open it finding the manuel and Styrofoam still inside leaving you to believe that Samus and Luigi hadn't looked inside yet. \"okay...so that's taken care of, but what to do now?\" you obviously could take the box with you back to your room but you could also just swap back when no one is looking. But was that even what you wanted now? You had started this whole thing as a test and you certainly hadn't meant to stay for so long but you were enjoying being Samus, not having to worry about Luigi or Peach was relieving and of course being female (and quite an attractive one at that) was cool in and of itself. Were you ready to give it up just for the sake of normalcy? You weren't sure of your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and took out the remote from an compartment and the helmet from your head and placed them in front of you, seemingly weighing your options. You thought for a long time on both of them and debated and debated with yourself until finally you had an answer.

There stood the menacing form of Ganondorf simply standing and staring at you, arms crossed and cape flapping with no wind (isn't that weird). \"What do you want, Ganon\" you say with authority not letting the evil being out of your crosshairs, he merely smiled \"if you think your poor excuse for a weapon will do much against me you would be mistaken, however I merely came to tell you one thing\" you grunted in displeasure which he took as confirmation \"stay out of my way or death will be much closer than you realize\" he then disappeared in a haze of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an idiot, everyone knows the hands have bestowed immortality on all the fighters\" you said as you placed your arm cannon by your side but not putting your guard down.

Diddy Kong and Pikachu are bouncing around on the ceiling supposedly playing a game tag while Zelda tries to contain them using one of her many spells, Duck hunt (dog) is chasing his partner around Bayonnetta who is casually drinking some dark liquid and reading a book generally unfazed by the mayhem ensuing. You rush over to help Zelda contain the monkey and mouse-type Pokemon before they seriously damaged something, \"sit still you troublemakers!\" Zelda screams before casting yet another spell towards them only for them to dodge and continue playing their game. You charge up a shot on your arm cannon and wait for a precise moment to shoot, trying to keep them in your crosshairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Diddy crossed them and you let lose the ball of energy allowing it to hit small chimp and make him collapse in an exhausted heap on the floor allowing Pikachu to run down and tag him, simultaneously giving Zelda her much needed opportunity to cast her spell capturing both of the speedy fighters. \"whew...thank you, Samus, they were giving me a run for my rubies and being quite a nuisance for both me and Bayonnetta over there\" Bayonnetta merely waves and takes another sip while occasionally petting the now tamed duck hunt, \"you're welcome, I was coming in here to relax but I guess that's a rarity wherever you go huh?\" you say while putting a hand on you hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda giggles and offers a seat next to her which you take, \"so...what do you usually do to relax, Samus?\" The question caught you off guard, Zelda wan't usually one for invading others privacy, or at least not when you were Mario, \"well...usually I train with or without the power suit to be ready in all of my combat suits and hang out with Sheik...hang on, I just realized, if Sheik is you then how am I not rooming with you and why isn't peach rooming with Sheik?\"you answered/questioned her. Zelda chuckled at your questions and rubbed the back of her head as if she too was wondering the same thing, \"well...it's a bit complicated, I also had these questions and asked the hands this, and the simplest answer I got was that Sheik and I are the same person just from two different times and realities, one where I went back to being Zelda and one where I stayed Sheik\" she sighed as if she had just oversimplified something that took a couple hours to explain. \"huh...well that kinda makes sense\" you said simply and Zelda nodded her head thankful she didn't need to explain anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two chatted a while after that, so long in fact that Bayonnetta finished her book and took both of the trouble making fighters with her with duck hunt not too far behind, some fighters came in to briefly join the conversation or do other activities the room had to offer. Soon enough though Zelda left to get ready for bed and it was then that you noticed the time: 11:00, your sleep schedule was definitely going to messed up after this, you rushed back to the women's rooms to find the door locked again. You racked your brain for the password but could not remember it so you took out the code from one of the suits compartments and inputted it into the console. The console beeped and the door opened while the same automated voice from before said: CODE ACCEPTED, you walked in and allowed the door to close behind you before walking into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did you change into your sleeping clothes or is the Zero-suit becoming sleepwear?</span></div></div>",

Compared to your more cartoonish nature before, Samus's face and body was all too realistic and just seeing the detail was interesting, and the feelings the tight combat suit was giving your body was incredible. Alas, you could explore these feelings tomorrow, for now it was time for some rest, you climbed into the bed and covered yourself with the sheets and allowing your body to adjust to the comfortable and safe feeling, \"ugh! This hair is getting in the way!\" you say as the golden yellow hair fell in your face as you took off the red scrunchie and placed it near the paralyzer and rocket heels which you had taken off due to them being most uncomfortable and making your sleep aggravatingly difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed your hair back and placed your head on the comfy pillow allowing your body to take over, leading you into a restful sleep with a smile on your lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow is the time to ask whether we should switch perspectives to the real Samus in Mario's body with the remote or stay in this perspective.</span></div></div>",

Never one to turn down free loot, you pick up the box, make sure no one else is around who could have dropped the box, and head to the nearest room, which happened to to be the leisure room, to sit down and find out what's inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there was no one around to question you on your find, so you take a seat on the couch and look inside the box. Inside you found something that looked like a TV remote, and some sort of manual. You frowned slightly, you were never that good with technology, but take a look through the manual regardless. To your surprise, it was no ordinary TV remote. According to the manual, it could alter the fabric of reality itself, albeit in a limited fashion. You were really curious to know if it worked now. You threw the box in the bin and tucked the manual away inside your quiver so you wouldn't lose it. You'd probably go put it back in your room later. Hopefully Toon Link wouldn't find it and ask you about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up off the couch, remote in hand, and decided to go look for someone to try out this remote on them. As luck would have it, someone happened to pass by the leisure room just as you were standing up. They didn't see you so they'd be perfect to try it out on, but at the same time you didn't clearly see who it was and you weren't sure if it was someone you even wanted to swap something with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly make up your mind that there's no time like the present to try it out, and you can probably just switch back once you know it works.

In fact, you would almost have though it didn't work if it weren't for the fact that Peach was now walking away with your sword and shield strapped to her back, and your hand which was holding the remote was now encased in a white glove. Ignoring the odd sensations you were feeling for a moment, you take a closer look at Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was now walking down the hallway fully dressed in the attire of the hero of time. Not only did she have your tunic and hat, she also seemed to have your weapons strapped to her back. For a moment you wonder if that meant she also had the manual that was hidden in your quiver, but you quickly found it was folded and held in your other gloved hand, since it apparently didn't count as clothes. She even had her large earrings removed, and replace by your small one. You could only see her back, so you couldn't tell if she still had her makeup on, but judging by the taste on your lips you assumed she didn't. All in all, your outfit didn't look too bad on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow looking at yourself, you couldn't help but think you'd look ridiculous if it wasn't for the fact that everyone else would think this was normal. Your tunic had been replaced with Peach's pink, puffy dress, your gloves with her's, and your boots with her heels. You felt a lot lighter without all your weapons on your back, but you wondered how you'd fare in battle without them. As you noted before, you could taste what you assumed to be lipstick on your lips, and felt other things on your face that you assumed to be the rest of Peach's makeup. Reaching up, you felt her crown perched atop your head, and her large earrings dangling from your pointed ears. You could even feel what you assumed to be a bra and panties underneath the dress. It was an odd experience to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider for a moment whether you should just swap back now and find someone you'd actually be interested in swapping something with, or whether you should just keep the dress for now and see how things work out.</span></div></div>",

With a moment of hesitation, you thrust your fingers into your new pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh YES!\" You scream as pleasure fills your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to instinctively thrust the fingers in and out of your stolen pussy, with every thrust you let out another sensual moan in Bayonetta's sultry accent only turning yourself on more. You writhe about  on the sheets, kicking out with your long, feminine legs and touching your soft face with an even softer hand. Your moans grow louder and louder and despite not having Bayonetta's nonchalant personality, you're in too much pleasure to care who can hear you. Even if they did, they'd just assume it was Bayonetta satisfying her female urges as to any outsider that was what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a knock on the door...</span></div></div>",

You could come back for Peach's clothes later if you really wanted them. The most interesting swaps seemed to be body swap, head swap, and life swap. Body swap would give you Peach's cute little body to play around with yourself, head swap would give you her body below the neck as well as the clothes that matched, and life swap would put you back in her clothes again but everyone would believe you were her. The other two options didn't interest you as much. Relationship swap would put you in a position with Mario you'd find yourself wanting to swap out of immediately, be it with life swap or another relationship swap. As for gender swap, becoming a woman seemed sort of interesting, but claiming the female parts of someone familiar to you just seemed more interesting than being a female version of yourself.

While Peach doesn't have any pockets on her dress you did manage to find the key on your person somehow (probably in the same place where she keeps her turnips) and open up the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice about Peach and Zelda's room is that it's far more spacious than your own. Maybe it's because they're royalty? The room was divided into two halves. The left half has golden walls with Zelda's large four poster bed being mostly deep shades of purple, blue and some gold. There was also a soft purple carpet covering the floors along with a modest size blue wardrobe with a matching vanity table nearby. This half was most likely Zelda's. Now you took a look at your half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink... lots and lots of pink. The walls were painted pink, with a soft carpet in a darker pink covering the former wooden floors. You now have a large four poster bed with pink satin sheets. There's also a vanity table with a heart-shaped mirror and more makeup than you had ever seen in your life along with a pink wardrobe right next to it. Thankfully there was a large curtain cut between the two halves which mean it's unlikely that Zelda will see your new possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your half of the room, you notice a trunk at the edge of the bed. It's locked, but a key is easily discovered on top of Peach's dresser. She clearly didn't expect any sort of intrusion. You open up the trunk, and find its mostly filled with sporting equipment. Golf Clubs, tennis rackets, etc. You stash the device underneath these things and lock it, choosing to hide the key under Peach's mattress. If anyone DOES come looking for the remote, its unlikely they'd be able to track it here specifically. You could also do what you want with the remote should you get tired of having Peach's life you could try something different and not worry about getting permanently stuck in a situation you don't like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then caught a glimpse of Peach's pink wardrobe. You notice that it was open and, deciding that you have nothing better to do, walked over to it. You see a wide variety of outfits, ranging from other dresses to sport attires. The idea of putting on a little modeling show (and maybe finding a more convenient outfit to wear than that excessive dress) had its own level of appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, there are plenty of other things you can do instead, such as train at the gym, go to the garden, and plenty of other things you can do instead. <br>\r\nDo you decide to stay in your room or leave for other pastures?</span></div></div>",

While you had had fun experimenting with the remote on Peach, she was planning on keeping your life and body for good! \"Wait! Peach, you can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't what? Keep your body? You're the one who gave it to me in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fine, you can have my body, but you can't take my life like this.\" You reach for the remote, but Peach quickly moves it out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can, and will. Clearly you're not responsible enough to have something like this if you're going to go around swapping things with people just to laugh as they freak out. Maybe a little time as a princess will teach you some proper manners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. you... I'll tell everyone you stole my life!\" you threaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who's going to believe you? And even if they did, I'll just tell Zelda that you stole my body first.\" You gasp. Even if you weren't yourself right now, you can only imagine what Zelda would think about you doing this to her best friend. \"Haven't got anything else to say, 'Peach'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I'll be going now. Have fun with your new life.\" With a smug grin on her face, Peach turns and walks away. You would have chased after her and tried to take back the remote, but you knew that you were no match for her now that she had your body and life, and you had her's. No, if you wanted that remote back, and with it your life and body, you'd need to be smart about this. If you stayed up late, you might be able to sneak into your old room and take the remote while Peach was sleeping and swap back. Maybe if you swapped back while the awareness setting was on 1, she'd forget about this whole incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But until then,\" you say to yourself, looking down at the body and clothes you now possessed, \"I'm stuck like this.\"</span></div></div>",

Inside, you find that rather than having two separate beds on opposite sides of the room, as they had been when you had left, the two beds had been pushed together in the middle of the room. It seemed this was a change made to reality to compensate for you and Zelda being both roommates and lovers. As you close the door, Zelda stirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, Peach? Is everything okay?\" Zelda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Everything's fine, Zelda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come back to bed then.

The point of this exercise was to test if and how the remote worked, so you felt like if you reversed the swap right away it'd be sort of cheating. Allowing Peach to walk away, you head over to your room to put the manual somewhere safe, noting that you somehow knew exactly how to walk in Peach's heels. After putting the manual on your highest shelf where Toon Link couldn't reach it, you think about where you want to go next. Remembering that you were heading to the gym before you found this remote, you decide to head over there and test out how well you can fight without any weapons (although you did see Peach's umbrella, frying pan, and golf club back in your room). Perhaps you'd even find someone else who could test one of the other buttons on, although you weren't committing yourself to swapping with the first person you saw like you had with Peach. Speaking of Peach, you were beginning to like the feel of her clothes. They felt very different from your old tunic, but after only a little time wearing it, your were feeling almost as comfortable in it as you did in your old clothes. Perhaps that was the influence of the remote giving you the skills you needed for the clothes though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you leave, you head into the bathroom to see exactly how you look. Checking the full length mirror on the back of the door, you had to admit you looked a little ridiculous. While the dress and the rest of the outfit had made Peach look cute, it looked rather weird on your male body. The top had been stretched to fit your wider, flatter chest, and the skirt lengthened so that it would reach the ground even with your added height. Interestingly, you thought the makeup would have been the strangest part about the outfit, but it actually didn't look too bad, and made your face look a bit feminine. Speaking of the makeup, you notice all of Peach's makeup supplies are around the sink, and you instinctively start to touch up your makeup, just as Peach might have. Once you are satisfied with how it looks, laughing a little at how odd this situation is, you leave your room and head to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the gym to be deserted, and you didn't run into anyone else on the way there, so for now executing more swaps was out of the question. You are about to put the remote away in a pocket or bag, before you realise that with Peach's clothes, you no longer have any. You can't exactly go hitting a sandbag while you have the remote in your hand. That would have the risk of accidentally breaking it, and even though you were currently enjoying Peach's clothing, you weren't sure you wanted to be stuck with it for the rest of your life, and miss out on the opportunity for more swaps. Since no one was around, you could always leave it on a bench next to the sandbag. That'd be easier, but if you wanted to be completely sure that no one saw it and it didn't go missing, putting it in your gym locker would be the safer option.

You were probably going to adapt some of Peach's moves to work with the clothes you now had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start with trying out some of the special attacks you've seen Peach do since you currently don't have a way to make use of any of your own special attacks. You start by trying out the move she called Peach Bomber. You try and ram the sandbag with your behind, just like you've seen Peach do. You stumble a little as you do so, because of the hem of your new dress, but manage to hit the sandbag anyway. Surprisingly, despite your blunder, the sandbag flies backwards from the impact. You figure that the move itself was already pretty powerful but your well-toned and conditioned body helped and made the move even more effective than it already was. Now you wanted to try and use her Peach Parasol move. You try and figure out how she pulls out her parasol seemingly from nowhere. You try to vision the parasol appear in your gloved hand. To your amazement, the parasol appears in your hand. Next you attempt to do the attack. You go and thrust the parasol upwards while jumping upwards with a bit of a forward direction. At the height of your jump, you open the parasol and, despite your much heavier weight, you slowly float down to the ground. Although much to your embarrassment, the bottom of the skirt inverted itself and revealed the bright pink panties you now wore.

Any plans of trying out new moves in your current clothes forgotten for the time being. You were deep in thought about what was taking Samus so long to return and what would happen if Samus used the remote before she came to you. In fact, you were so deep in thought that you had not notice her come in still in her blue skin-tight Zero suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Link. You miss me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus! You startled me.\" you reply, jumping from your seat a little. \"Why aren't you wearing your Power Suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already scanned the remote in my room. So I decided to just leave the suit in my room since I wouldn't need it anymore. Plus it would be better for me to show you what it does without the Power Suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... so you already know what it does? Did you use it yet?\" you question her since you didn't see anything different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I already know what it does. And no. I wouldn't use it without you.\" she answers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So what does it do?\" you say, still pretending to not know what the remote does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is supposed to switch certain things about people around. The switch is normal to everyone except the person holding the remote. Although they can change who else can see the swap. I think it's better if I show you instead.\" she quickly explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say or do anything, Samus had quickly pressed several buttons on the remote. In an instant you were no longer looking at the female bounty- hunter, instead you were no looking at yourself complete with the puffy, pink dress you had swapped earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" you stop and put your hand to your mouth upon hearing your voice. It definitely came as a shock since you hadn't tried swapping anything except for your clothes. It was much higher and breathier than you remembered. Itwas also weird that when your hand touched your mouth, there was now a blue, rubbery material covering it. Upon further examination, your hand is now much thinner and more slender than before. Also, the blue material on your hand extended to cover your entire arm and the rest of your body. Speaking of your body, it was definitely much more feminine than you remembered. It was definitely weird seeing a pair of breasts and long, blond hair falling in your vision whenever you looked down. You now had the body and the clothes of your good friend Samus Aran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really weird.\" you hear Samus in  your body say. \"How you doing there Link?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm doing okay.\" you answer. \"How did you make me notice the swaps and what exactly did you swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I chose Swap Mode 2 before swapping.\" she answers in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay. So only you and me can notice the swap.\" you further answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for what I swapped, I only swapped bodies and clothes with you.\" she explains further. \"I just wanted to try swaps that would be obvious.

Turning around and  hiding the remote behind you, you find the Villager standing there, unsurprisingly. Like the Wii Fit Trainer, Villager liked to spend his free time in the garden. Surprising, however, was the fact that you were even in front of him in the first place since the life swap would place you in the conversation with Fit instead. Also surprising to you was that really long, blonde hair swished around you as you turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Villager.\" you answer, in a feminine voice which shocks you a little. \"I was just taking a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay! See ya later princess!\" he says heading on his way to the provided planting areas in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he left, you began to examine yourself to find out what you swapped instead. It was a brief examination since all you had to do was look down. You still had Peach's dress but now they covered the body it was originally designed for. The front of the dress extended forward due to the breasts you now possessed. Instead of swapping lives with her, you had accidentally pressed the body swap button. You had Peach's life, dress and now you also had her body to go with it. You then realize that you had now completely swapped with Peach and nothing of your real self remained with you. Speaking of Peach, she was now completely you. Looking towards where Peach, in your life, was having a conversation with Fit, you see that both of them had already left. The conversation probably wasn't that long since you and Fit weren't really friends yet. That left you unable to swap back with Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince swapping back was no longer an option, you had to decide what to do next. You didn't really want to be Peach completely so you consider swapping with someone else and off-loading Peach's life, body and clothes on someone else then swapping back with Peach when you get the chance. Then an idea comes to you. You were considering trying out life as royalty earlier after you accidentally swapped lives with Peach. You now had the body that went with the life and clothes, so why not try to do that now? </span></div></div>",

Sitting up, \"What in Hyrule-\". you stop yourself and cover your mouth upon hearing your voice. It was not your usual male voice. It was a very female voice. You then remember about the remote you found and your complete swap with Peach. Your feminine gloved hand holding the remote confirmed this. Although the voice you spoke in seemed different from Peach's voice. It was then that you noticed another person lying down in the hallway, apparently also a victim of Jigglypuff's Sing attack. This didn't surprise you since you've been going against Jigglypuff since the very first tournament. What did shock you however was who was asleep on the floor, or at least who it appeared to be. It looked to be Peach but she was wearing the clothes of the goddess, Palutena. \"This could only mean-\" you thought. Quickly looking down, some green hair swishes into your field of vision. You also notice that your feminine...assets...were much more pronounced than before. All these new features of your body and the fact that Peach was lying on the floor near you told you that you had inadvertently swapped bodies instead of lives with Palutena. You had once again made a wrong swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!

The allure of becoming a goddess was too strong, or at the very least, stronger than wanting to be a princess. At the very least you might command some respect in Palutena's life, not to mention her powers. While she wasn't someone you would have willingly swapped with under normal circumstances, she would at least make for a better substitute until you got back into your own life than Peach would. This would technically leave Palutena and Peach switched around, but they'd think they had always been each other, and they'd look completely like each other too, so it would be like nothing had changed. As Palutena, with Peach's body, begins to stir, you point the remote at her and press the life swap button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an instant, you find yourself back to laying down on the floor, this time where Palutena had been. Before you can even start to get up, you hear the sound of high heels clicking their way down the hallway. It seemed that the new Peach had gotten herself off the floor and was headed elsewhere. \"Good riddance,\" you mumble to yourself, still not used to hearing a voice other than your own coming out of your mouth, \"I'm not going back to that again.\" Luckily Jigglypuff wasn't around to hear your musings. You supposed it had probably gotten mad and left after Palutena fell asleep during its song. You slowly lift yourself off the ground into a sitting position, before standing yourself up, and take stock of the changes to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite going from being one woman to another, there were quite a few differences. Not as many as between yourself and Peach, but still enough to be significant. You were definitely taller now, something you were glad about, thinking about Peach's petite frame. Your hair was much longer, and the length made it heavier too. Something else that was heavier was your bust, which was somewhat larger than Peach's, although your \"assets\" definitely seemed larger when seeing them from this angle. Of course, the clothing was different too. Unlike Peach who practically covered up everything with her dress, Palutena's dress had a large slit on the right side of it, running all the way up to her hip. It honestly embarrassed you a bit, knowing that one false move could possibly lead to you flashing your panties for everyone to see (even if they weren't really your panties, and you weren't really you right now). At the very least, you had some more conventional weapons, a staff and a shield, and of course, Palutena's godly powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I suppose I can deal with this for a while.\" Palutena's life would suffice for now, but what you really wanted was to be yourself again. Now that you had found someone to offload Peach's life onto, you could go looking for yourself again. But where would you have gone? You tried to think about what you had planned to do before finding the remote, but you just seemed to draw a blank. Were you really just going to wander around aimlessly looking for yourself? Perhaps it would be better to just try and live out Palutena's life until a time when you knew exactly where your old life would be, and perhaps find a more suitable life than Palutena's in the meantime. You begin to walk away from where Jigglypuff had put you and Palutena to sleep, mulling these thoughts over in your head, your new breasts moving slightly with each step. \"Heh, can't wait to get rid of those.\"</span></div></div>",

From Pit's perspective, nothing seemed to have happened, save for the collision itself. As such, he was surprised when his body suddenly got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Rosalina! I was kind of in a hurry. Gotta go!\" With that, Pit's body left, leaving the remote on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit stared at the scene blankly for a moment, before he managed to put two and two together. \"Link?\" he asked of the woman sitting on the floor in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silent for a moment. You couldn't believe that this had happened again. You could once again feel female parts making up your body, and a dress cloaking your form. With the body and life swap buttons being so close to each other on the remote, you'd somehow managed to hit both of them in the collision, and had wound up as Rosalina. You replied to Pit with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit held in a laugh, and offered Link a hand. \"I guess me letting you use my body didn't do much good, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbing the remote off the floor, and accepted Pit's hand up. \"This remote must be cursed or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I wanted to do was test out the remote and then swap back, and since then, I've gotten stuck doing all sorts of swaps I didn't mean to do.\" The stress of it all was definitely starting to get to him. At the very least, Rosalina's body seemed a bit better than Peach's or Palutena's. She wasn't as petite as Peach, or as curvy as Palutena. She had powers similar to Palutena, but her dress was more conservative, like Peach's. It still wasn't your body, though, and it was still a woman's body, and you weren't comfortable with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe it'd be good for you to relax a bit,\" Pit suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Pit as if he'd just said the craziest thing in the world. \"Relax? I'm stuck in someone else's body and I don't know were my real body is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah. But, the tournament hasn't even started yet, it's not like you're never going to see your body again. Maybe you should take a break and try to calm down, and then swap back once you know where your body's going to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit's suggestion did make a bit of sense. While you hadn't exactly been comfortable swapping around between different bodies, there was really nothing stopping you from simply waiting until dinner time or something and swapping back then. It might do you some good to try and relax a little after how stressful the past few minutes had been. Of course, that meant spending the rest of the day as a woman, and you weren't sure if you were comfortable with that idea.</span></div></div>",

Pit smiles and quickly says, \"sure Link, whatever you say, now where do you usually go to relax?\" You thought on it and find that you were at your most calm hanging out with Zelda at the Library, although it was always awkward being that close with one another in your usual body, especially since everyone though you two were together. \"uh, the Library, I suppose...\" you say uncertainly, you watch Pit's playful smile vanish from Palutena's face, \"really? The most boring place here is where you go to relax, why not the Smash Park, maybe we'll find your body there?\" He tried desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I've made my decision, now are you coming or not?\" You ask already turning towards the Smash Library. Pit sighs and say's \"fine....I'll come with you, maybe something interesting will happen, I doubt it though\" You find that Rosalina doesn't eally walk but kinda floats about three centimeters off the ground so you didn't have to worry about tripping on her heels, overall Rosalina felt more laid back and chill than Peach and Palutena who both had differing extremes. Peach being too uptight and Palutena being too loose, Rosalina striked that balance where you felt comfortable and concealed at the same time. \"Why don't you like reading? It can be surprisingly calming with the right people\" you blurt out in curiosity as you watch a grumpy Pit in Palutena's body walk behind you sulking. \"It's because I can't read, idiot, I've said this soooo many times\" he said still pouting \"well that was when you were Pit...can Palutena Read?\" you ask as you begin to approach the old doors of the Library, \"of course Lady Palutena can read, she's a goddess for crying out loud!\" He said frustrated as you tap the door handle with the tip of your star wand and the apparent impact blasts open both doors until they were wide open, scarring the poor librarian to death \"well now you're that goddess who can read, Pit, try it out!\" You offer him a book from off the shelfs which looked really interesting, \"huh...these letters...they form into certain words and...those words combine to create sentences! I....Can....READ!!\" Pit shouts loudly with Palutena's booming voice causing most of the Library to \"shush\" him, leaving him in an embarrassing position, \"oh...sorry, everyone\" he said shyly getting back to his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and grab one of your favorites, Hyrule legacies, from the shelfs and brought it over to a reading table with Pit following closely behind, \"Link, why is reading so cool! Why did Lady Palutena never teach me!\" he asks in a surprised tone but in a whisper now. \"Maybe cause she knew you would react like that, now let's just sit back and read until Dinner so I can swap back\" You answer the still excited Pit who had picked up all three versions of the dictionary that was currently available and was currently reading with a smile on Palutena's face, \"you don't have to tell me twice\". You both read to yourselves for a while until you noticed someone coming in, it was Zelda and she took one of her favorite's off the shelves as well before walking over to you and Pit and asking, \"would it be okay if I joined you ladies, Link isn't here so I prefer not to read alone\" You smiled daintily and pulled up a chair while Pit said, \"sure, feel free\". Zelda smiled back and sat next to you and before opening her book looks at the title of yours and gasps, \"that's Link's favorite! He would tell me he loved the stories of ancient Hyrule leaders, he would be happy to know someone else shares his fondness with the book, Rosalina\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back and say, \"yeah, it looked pretty nice from the title and has only gotten better\" Zelda nods and looks over at who she presumes to be Palutena and raises an eyebrow, \"Palutena, I didn't know you were such an active reader\" Pit smirks back putting down a half finished third dictionary,\"I find it very...enjoyable, to say the least, I should really teach this to my servants the next time I see them\" he adds as Zelda smiles and finally begins her book. You felt like you and Zelda were really getting off to a great start again, like a newish fresh slate had been created between you and her, however you felt like you were lying to her pretending to be Rosalina, you told Pit, and you barely knew him let alone trust him. Zelda had been your damsel in distress and your most precious ally, if anyone deserved to know it was her. Who knows maybe she knows where your real body might be.</span></div></div>",

Sure, they'll end up with Peach's clothes, probably permanently, but it's not like they'll notice anything different, unlike you who is thoroughly weirded out by how comfortable the dress is starting to feel. There isn't much choice here in the garden, but both choices are better than this ridiculous dress. On one side of the garden, there is one of the newcomers, Villager, planting a sapling.

By the way he seemed a little annoyed when you and some of the other guys laughed at the thought of wearing a dress (and experience which after today, you've decided you don't want to do again), and how he mentioned that in his town no one had a problem if a boy wore girls clothes and vice versa, maybe he's actually enjoy the dress. On the other side of the garden, another one of the newcomers, Wii Fit Trainer, was meditating. If you swapped with her, you'd still be wearing girls clothes, but it'd be a bit more sensible, and at least you'd have pants.

Just as quickly as last time, the change happens. Now, Wii Fit Trainer is still sitting on her exercise mat meditating, but she now wore Peach's dress, heels, and jewelery. Peach's makeup was very obvious on her, thanks to her incredibly pale skin tone. Looking down at yourself, you now had much more sensible attire, although it was clearly still meant for a woman to wear. You had on a blue tank top that showed off your midriff, a pair of black yoga pants, and you could also feel a hair-tie trying to pull what little hair it could grab into a ponytail. Just as with Peach's clothes, you could feel some feminine undergarments, although from what you could tell, instead of Peach's silky bra, you now had Wii Fit Trainer's more practical sports bra. Without all your weapons, and with so much skin showing, you definitely felt a bit naked, but you put yourself at ease a little by assuring yourself that no one would see anything out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the garden, you head towards your room. You wanted to put the manual away so that you wouldn't loose it, and then maybe improve the situation you were in with regards to your clothing. The sooner you could find Peach, the better. Now that your weren't frantically running somewhere as you had been in Peach's dress, your mind had a lot more time to process all the little differences about your clothing. Every slight breeze caused you to become aware of your exposed stomach and shoulders, prompting you to try and pull the tank top down further. Walking down the cold hallway barefoot was also a rather different experience. As you were distracted by the different feelings you were getting from your clothes, you don't notice someone coming from the other end of the hallway, and you bump into them, accidentally pressing one of the buttons on the remote to swap with them.

Everything feels tighter, your feet raise off the ground, and the breeze no longer affects you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can check yourself, Samus speaks. \"Woah there. Might want to watch where you're going, Link.\" Looking up at her, you can see she is now wearing Wii Fit Trainer's exercise clothes, and they actually look pretty good on her. You also note that any and all makeup she had on has disappeared, which you now feel on your own face, and the position of her ponytail had been lowered to match how Wii Fit Trainer had her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sorry about that. I was distracted by something.\" You scratch the back of your head with an awkward laugh. You find it a little off-putting that you can't actually feel your hair on your fingertips. You know why, Samus' Zero Suit covered your whole body below the neck, but it still bothered you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Just, keep your eyes on where you're going. You wouldn't want to go running into one of the villains like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see ya.\" With that, she walks away, completely oblivious to the changes that have occurred. You take the time to look at yourself. Despite being more covered up than before, you somehow feel more exposed. You are completely covered from the neck down by Samus' skintight Zero Suit, leaving nothing to the imagination. If you had been a girl, this probably would have looked great on you, but it didn't exactly suit your manly frame. The tightness of the suit didn't really bother you too much, except for the tightness on your groin. It was pretty uncomfortable. You were also wearing high heels again, albeit rocket powered ones. After all the running around in Peach's heels, you weren't too bothered by them. Although you did find it a little strange how much it didn't particularly bother you to be in female clothing anymore after trying on three different outfits. In fact, looking back at Samus walking away in Wii Fit Trainer's outfit, you couldn't tell which outfit you preferred. Samus' outfit covered you up more, but Wii Fit Trainer's outfit wasn't as tight. You needed to make a decision before Samus left your sight, or else you'd be in Samus' outfit regardless.</span></div></div>",

You could feel Samus' hair-tie higher up in your hair than Wii Fit Trainer's had been, and it felt a little tight (much like the rest of the outift did) as it tried to find enough hair to grab onto. Maybe if your hair was longer, like a girl, it wouldn't be as awkward. You also noted your hips swaying slightly due to Samus' jet boots. Not as much as it would if you had a female body, but still a little. You also thought that along with being a bit uncomfortable on your groin, the Zero Suit really wasn't made to be worn by a male. If you had a female body, you think it would probably look and feel a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze as you think about what you had been subconciously thinking. The whole time you were thinking about Samus' outfit, you were thinking about how it would be better if you had a female body. This worries you a bit. Had the remote influenced you in some way? Was this just some side of you that you didn't know existed that wanted to be female? The more you looked at the Zero Suit on your body, the more you felt it should be a female body filling it, and you should be that female body. This freaked you out, but as much as you wanted to just swap back as soon as possible and then get rid of the remote so it would stop messing with your head, but part of you just wanted to give into these impulses and see where it took you. You could always swap back if it got out of hand, right?</span></div></div>",

The swap onky takes an instant before you find yourself in a completely different body You're still you, but different somehow. You look down at yourself to find an unfamiliar body where your own body should be. <br>\r\nYour hair was much longer than  before, and you could feel it run down to about the middle of your back. Your finger curl around the soft lock and see that it was a brighter blonde than before. Now that you could have a closer look at them, you could see that the fingernails were a little longer, and were painted green. Your limbs overall felt a bit thinner, your waist especially so. Despite the loss in muscle mass, you still felt fairly strong. You were sure you could swing a sword no problem, if it came down to it. Your breasts were on the small-ish side. No unreasonably so. The thought of them being \"your\" breats is still a little hard to grasp. You hips and butt felt a bit bigger as well. You had also dropped a bit in height, and although you couldn't see your face, you could tell your features were a bit softer. You could feel a bit of make up on your face, and guessed it was about the same amount as Peach usually wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change is a bit overwhelming, and you find yourself just standing still, trying to take everything in. You can feel the steady rise and fall of your chest as you breath deeply, trying to calm down a bit. And yet you also feel... comfortable. Finally, you had a body that fit the clothes you were wearing. Samus's suit showed off every curve of your body, and while that was a little awkward, it also felt immensely more natural than it did on your male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was still there, but it wasn't the Peach you had once known. Oddly enough, you knew that the two of you had still retained your old names despite the gender change. Princess Peach was now Prince Peach, ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom. Her pink dress was now some sort of purple suit befitting of a prince, and she seemed a bit taller, and her hair seemed a bit closer to orange than blonde. Neither he nor Zelda considered anything different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the memories hit. Every little moment, changed to make it so that you were a woman. It was actually kind of surprising how little had changed, aside from your body and the way people treated you. You shake your head, feeling your long hair moving about as you do so, trying to break yourself out of your little daze that was set on by all the changes. You have two sets of memories now and yet organizing them takes little to no trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big difference, you realize, between picking Peach and Zelda is that Peach was far more feminine than Zelda ever was. You still have your memories of fighting Ganon and defeating evil and saving Hyrule, but your memories suggest that you did it in a more girlish fashion. You doubt that, had you switched with Zelda, your body would have the same level of makeup and nail polish. But that's no big concern. You're still dating Zelda and your preferences haven't changed. In fact, you think your body is even more passionately in love with Zelda. You recall behaving like a schoolgirl with a crush around her before, although you maintained your fighting instincts and determination throughout. You just also enjoy dresses and your current outfit a lot too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole swapping business was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely sure where to go from here. You had gotten the body you wanted without any trouble and were far more comfortable for it. You were beyond satisfied. Plus, your concern about the remote doing something to your head, making you a little too comfortable, influencing you to cause more changes... well, that's in the back of your mind too. Plus, it'd be nice to catch up to your girlfriend. You sigh contented just thinking about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, the remote is meant to be used. What's the point of having the swapping remote in the first place if you aren't gonna use it?</span></div></div>",

You don't think you fully appreciated that smile when you were a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you Link.

But she just keeps smiling and giggling at your nerves, occasionally pecking you on the cheek. She must really think you're cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation, as much as you can manage it, is a typical one about the tournament and how they've been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Zelda's curiousity is peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Link, what's that remote you have with you?\"</span></div></div>",

You as a girl and Zelda as a man is a mental image that you need to see in person, to satiate your curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sense of commitment, you point the remote at Peach and press the gender swap button. The swap onlytakes an instant before you find yourself in a completely different body You're still you, but different somehow. You look down at yourself to find an unfamiliar body where your own body should be. Your hair was much longer than before, and you could feel it run down to about the middle of your back. Your finger curl around the soft locks and see that it was a darker blonde than before. Now that you could have a closer look at them, you could see that the fingernails were a little longer and thinner than before. Your limbs overall felt a bit thinner, your waist especially so. Despite the loss in muscle mass, you still felt fairly strong. You were sure you could swing a sword no problem, if it came down to it. Your breasts were on the small-ish side. No unreasonably so. The thought of them being \"your\" breasts is still a little hard to grasp. You hips and butt felt a bit bigger as well. You had also dropped a bit in height, and although you couldn't see your face, you could tell your features were a bit softer. Everything was softer, really. You can feel a small tinge of make-up on your skin, but its just a light blush and some eyeshadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change is a bit overwhelming, and you find yourself just standing still, trying to take everything in. You can feel the steady rise and fall of your chest as you breath deeply, trying to calm down a bit. And yet you also feel... comfortable. Finally, you had a body that fit the clothes you were wearing. Samus's suit showed off every curve of your body, and while that was a little awkward, it also felt immensely more natural than it did on your male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was still there, but it wasn't the Zelda you had once known. Oddly enough, you knew that the two of you had still retained your old names despite the gender change. Princess Zelda, owner of the Triforce of Wisdom was now Prince Zelda, ruler of the kingdom of Hyrule. Her purple and white dress was now a royal outfit vaguely resembling a military uniform, with a purple sash going across his white ensemble. She (he?) seemed a bit taller, and her hair lightened a little, the opposite of your own currently dirty blonde hair. He was also far more muscular than Zelda was and you were fairly sure there was a sword resting next to him. Neither he nor Peach considered anything different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the memories hit. Every little moment, changed to make it so that you were a woman. It was actually kind of surprising how little had changed, aside from your body and the way people treated you. You shake your head, feeling your long hair moving about as you do so, trying to break yourself out of your little daze that was set on by all the changes. You have two sets of memories now and yet organizing them takes little to no trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference between this version of you and the former you was very small. You were still the hero of Hyrule, fighting evil, and saving the day and nothing had stopped that. Personalities didn't switch with gender, but you can't help but wonder if, had you swapped with Peach, you'd be as mature as you usually are. Peach was considerably more mischievous and flirty than most people gave her credit for. If her girly behavior was connected to that, would that have transferred to you as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole swapping business was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, you don't notice someone approaching you until they're right in front of you. You jolt a little but rest easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You startled me a little.\"</span></div></div>",

It would seem you accidentally pressed the life swap button when you bumped into her, which now made you bounty hunter Samus Aran. \"Don't worry about it. Just try to watch where you're going next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus smiles, and then walks past you in the direction you had been heading before the swap occurred. You notice you are now wearing Samus's Zero Suit, which while it covered you up more than Wii Fit Trainer's workout clothes, was rather tight and left nothing to the imagination. You were also wearing high heels for the second time today, although now they were a pair of jet boots. When you had thought about what you could do with this remote, swapping lives with Samus was definitely not something you thought you'd be wanting to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus was still in sight, so you could swap back if you wanted to. Or perhaps you could swap something else. Sure, you had screwed up and this swap was an accident, but perhaps you could make the most of it. Since you had found the remote, you had made one swap and then continually worried about getting things back to normal. Why not throw normal out the window? Why not be Samus for a few days? There'd be plenty of time to get everything back to normal before the tournament actually started, and as far as you were aware, Samus's didn't have a boyfriend you'd have to deal with. Perhaps you could borrow her body for a bit, or put your head on her body to really mix things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, if you really wanted to throw normal out the window, Samus was old news. You'd already swapped with her, and taken her life, there were plenty of other people around who would be great targets for swaps. You'd just need to wander around a bit to find one. Of course, you could always just leave things as they were for now, and try to live Samus's life for a while without changing things even more.</span></div></div>",

I wasn't watching where I was going.\" You try not to react, but the voice you had just heard was your own. Looking up, you see yourself, or your body at least, wearing Zelda's clothes.

Now you could see clearly what you, or at least your body, looked like, and it certainly wasn't pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to keep calm, you reply, \"Don't worry about it. I wasn't watching either.\" You do your best not to freak out as Zelda's voice comes out of your mouth, although even now you can feel that your mouth was different, like your facial structure had been rearranged. But not just that, you could tell your entire body had been changed into Zelda's but if you started examining your body in front of her, she'd know something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got somewhere I need to be. I'll see you tonight.\" She give you a wink, which honestly looks a little weird coming from your body, before walking off down the hallway. You quickly look over your body so you can decide whether you want to swap back nor not before she disappears. The obvious thing when you look down is the pair of breasts sticking out from under Wii Fit Trainer's tank top. Below that you have Zelda's slender arms, her thin waist moving into her larger hips (larger than yours at least), all the way down to her thin legs and dainty feet. You could also feel Zelda's long brown hair on your head, pulled into a ponytail by Wii Fit Trainer's hair-tie. The outfit at least looked better on you now, but you weren't sure that was a good thing if it meant accidentally stealing your girlfriend's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ready the remote, you mind thinks back to what Zelda said. \"I'll see you tonight.\" With a few couples entering the tournament (and from how you had seen Little Mac around the Wii Fit Trainer, the possibility of new ones being formed while at the tournament), Master Hand had set up a couples room that people could rent out to spend a night together with their special someone, and tonight you and Zelda would be using it. This causes you to stall the swapping back. Sure, it felt a little wrong to be stealing your girlfriend's body, and it felt very different to your old body (you weren't sure if it was a good different or a bad different yet), but now you were curious. Maybe you could keep Zelda's body for tonight just to feel what it would be like. Still, you suppose if you wanted to, you could give Zelda's body back and borrow someone else's for tonight. Although even with your curiosity, you weren't sure you liked having a female body, especially one with so much less muscle mass than your old body. As Zelda is about to round the corner and leave your sight, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Having switched through 3 different outfits in that past few minutes, you had become very aware of your clothing, and you could feel it becoming less exposing and more restrictive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Link. I wasn't watching where I was going,\" Zelda says. Looking up at her, you see that she is now dressed in Wii Fit Trainer's exercise clothes, instead of her usual regal outfit. Without her usual jewelery and makeup, and with her hair pulled back into a ponytail, she looks much more plain than she usually does. Still beautiful, of course, but she definitely looked better in her own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly glancing back at down at yourself, you see that Zelda's dress is now stretched across your male body. It's not as poofy as Peach's dress, and it feels more sensible, but at the same time it was a bit tighter, clinging to your body, and left your top a bit more exposed, although the armor on your shoulders helped with that. Her jewelery and makeup wasn't as heavy as Peach's was as well. \"Don't worry about it. I wasn't really paying attention to where I was going either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles a bit. That smile warms your heart, even in a situation as odd as this one. She brushes a stray bit of hair out of your face, and says, \"Y'know, I always love it when you doll yourself up like this.\" It takes you a moment to process what she says. You knew reality would change so everyone would think it was normal, but Zelda didn't just think it was normal for you to be wearing dresses and makeup, she liked it. She gives you a kiss on the cheek, which makes you blush. \"I'll see you tonight.\" With that, she walks off. You remember that Master Hand had set up a couples room that people could rent out, and tonight you and Zelda had done just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to watch as she walks away, dress swishing and you spin on your heels. You would have swapped back as soon as she wasn't looking if not for the fact that Zelda had said she liked you dressing up like a girl. If she liked it, who were you to deny her of it? Still, you did think the clothes looked better on her than they did on you, and you didn't feel right taking all her expensive jewelery and such away from her (You hadn't exactly felt the same way about Peach's jewelery because, well, she wasn't your girlfriend). You think about what you could do now. Zelda currently liked you wearing makeup and dresses and such, and you liked her wearing the same. Perhaps you could switch back with Zelda so she had her clothes back, and then you could switch back with Wii Fit Trainer so you'd have Peach's clothes again. Peach's dress made you feel a little more ridiculous than Zelda's did, but maybe it would have the same effect on Zelda as you wearing her clothes did. Still, your original plan had been to get your old tunic back, and you'd be going against that plan if you were actually considering wearing the clothes of one of the princesses permanently, just to please this altered reality Zelda. You think carefully over the options, and decide to...</span></div></div>",

Did you want to just wait until you could get your own clothes back, or did you want to please the altered reality Zelda by dressing like a girl (or at least a more feminine on than you were currently dressing as) again?

You jog back to the garden, trying to ignore the breeze on your exposed arms and stomach. When you get there, Villager has left, but luckily Wii Fit Trainer is still doing her meditation. Doing your best to put your manly pride aside, you point the remote at her and press clothes swap. Once again, you feel your clothes change around you, and you've changed back into what you had been in after the first swap. You could always have swapped later if you wanted to see how Zelda would react, but you decided that if Zelda did like you in these clothes, you'd need a while to get used to them. Leaving Wii Fit Trainer to finish her meditation, you head back towards your room to finally put the instruction manual away somewhere safe. On the way there, you notice some of the smaller changes you had missed when you were frantically trying to find Peach. For one thing, you were walking perfectly in Peach's high heels, and they gave you a slight sway in your hips. You wondered how different your walk would be if you had the hips to match the sway, but you put the thought out of your head for now. You were already dealing with the clothes of a girl, you didn't want to have to deal with the body of one just yet. You also noticed that while in Wii Fit Trainer's clothes you felt every breeze on your arms and stomach, Peach's dress covered you a bit better, but you'd still feel when a stronger breeze came in from outside and blew up under your dress. You also realise now that you're thinking of the dress as both Peach's dress and your dress, and that you're a lot more comfortable wearing it after spending the last however many minutes switching between various girls' clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the room, you put the manual on the highest shelf you had, where Toon Link couldn't reach. Not really sure what to do, you decide to check the full length mirror in the bathroom to see exactly what you looked like. You had to admit, you definitely looked a bit silly, although you'd be the only one in the world now that thought that. The dress and gloves had been stretched to fit your male body. Lifting up the hem of the dress, you Peach's heels resized to fit your feet, although it doesn't look as out of place as the rest of the outfit. You are glad the skirt of the dress wasn't shorter, because you found your legs were still unshaven as they were before, creating a strange juxtaposition with the girly dress. You weren't sure if it would be considered weird in this reality if you decided to shave your legs, but if you were going to be keeping Peach's clothes then you might decide to do it at some point, just so it felt better in the dress. Strangely, your face seemed to be the least weird part of the ensemble. The makeup by itself had made your face look more feminine, and the crown and earring added to that. If your hair was a bit longer, you'd barely be able to tell it was a male head you were looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of makeup, you notice that in all the shenanigans that had occurred, some of it has gotten a little smudged. Noticing all the makeup supplies around the sink, you start touching up your makeup as if by instinct. You find it a little strange that you not only know how to do this, but also feel the need to, but you suppose that the whole point of wearing Peach's clothes again was to look good for Zelda, so you don't mind. After you finish up there, you think about what you could do now. You didn't really need to be anywhere, so you could just hang out in your room and find out the extent of the changes. Although you didn't particularly want to change much about yourself again yet, you were also feeling a little mischievous, so you could use yourself as a middle step to swap two other people. You could think of a bunch of people it'd be funny to swap around.</span></div></div>",

The first thing you noticed aside from the clothes you were wearing being changed was that Peach's array of weapons had made their way onto a shelf where you kept your spare weapons. You weren't exactly sure how much damage you could do on the battlefield with a parasol, a frying pan, and a golf club, but considering the remote had given you the skills needed to use them, perhaps you'd still do it well enough. At the very least, you'd probably be able to cook better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next change you notice is that not only have the clothes you were wearing been changed, but also every item of clothing you owned. Even the differently coloured tunics you used for some of the fights were replaced by different colours of Peach's dress. \"Huh. At least I get some variety,\" you say to yourself. You find it kind of amusing how you're thinking about wearing dresses as no big deal now, you just need to get used to the feel of them. You also find a few screenshots from previous tournaments, and find that you are wearing Peach's clothes in every one of them. You suppose that makes sense, since reality was altered to make people think this was normal, although you half wish you actually had the memories and experience that would have come with wearing the clothes of a princess for your whole life, since it would help with adjusting to it if you decided to keep it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of checking just what has changed, you are bored. At the very least, this time has gotten you more used to the lighter, softer feeling of the dress, and all the other feelings of the other bits that came with it. You still think the dress didn't look the best on your male body, but you were still determined to see if Zelda would like it, and you didn't want to borrow someone else's body yet, especially not a girl's. After staying inside for so long, you were itching to go out and have a bit of a walk around, or get some exercise. Your hand rested on the remote. You could always take it with you to have a little fun messing with other people. Although you didn't have any pockets to keep it in, and if you left it in your room, it would no doubt be safer in case you wanted to use it again to change something about yourself again.</span></div></div>",

Probably the most disturbing part is that under the dress, you can feel what seems to be a bra and panties, which feel very different from anything you'd ever worn in the past. Looking back down the hallway, you see Peach walking towards the gym dressed in your clothes, not knowing anything was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure you like what you've gotten yourself into. Peach's clothes felt weird, especially on your male body, and you didn't want to be dating Mario instead of Zelda. It wasn't permanent, but the thought of doing anything romantic with another man was enough to make you sick, even if everyone thought you were a woman right now. You definitely needed to swap with Peach again before she left, so you aimed the remote at her and got ready to swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Peach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a familiar voice behind you.

You briefly glance down at yourself to see that Peach's is in fact filled with the curves it was made for. You have to admit that her clothes feel a lot more comfortable on a female body, but you feel even more uncomfortable than before thanks to all the unfamiliar body parts you now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you today?\" Zelda asks. For a moment, you are worried she'll notice something is wrong, but as if by instinct, you reply without a hint of the worry you were feeling inside affecting your speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good. I was actually just heading over to the garden.\" You figure the life swap had let you act like Peach without any problems so you could take over her life exactly as she had left it, if you wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun. I was heading to the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Zelda make small talk, you notice out of the corner of your eye that Peach is getting further and further away, taking your life and body with her. You notice that she looks and acts exactly like you, which makes you realise that with her clothes and body, you look exactly like Peach now. If Peach got away before you could swap, you didn't really know when the next time you'd see her would be, and you'd be stuck as a carbon copy of her, living her life, until you found her again. You definitely didn't want that, but were you ready to risk another misfire by swapping behind your back? The other option would be to swap with Zelda. Sure, you'd still be female, but at least you'd be swapping with a female you were familiar with. And in Zelda's life, you'd have more opportunity to see Peach in your old life, although it might mean Peach and Zelda end up as eachother or something.</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure if this was something you'd want to keep permanently, but for something temporary, you were going to enjoy this to it's fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room shared by Peach and Zelda. You had been in here before when visiting Zelda, but now you'd actually be staying here. It seemed a lot cleaner than your old room, probably two princesses were the ones staying here. It might have just been your imagination, or because you were shorter now that you were Peach, but it seemed more spacious than your old room too. Peach's stuff was on the left side of the room, so you start looking around for a place to put the remote where Zelda, and anyone else who came into the room, wouldn't see it. You eventually settle on the chest where Peach kept all her weapons (which were really just assorted sporting equipment and the like). Hidden under all that stuff, no one should see it even if the chest was open, unless you were using the weapons during a battle, and you'd still know where it was if you wanted to play around with the remote some more. Now that it was safely hidden away, you could do what you wanted without worrying about getting stuck in some sort of situation you didn't like. If something happens that makes you not like this life, you can just try out something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to head out to the garden like you had been planning to originally before you went to hide the remote, but Peach's full length mirror catches your eye. You could feel every difference on your body, and you could see the difference when you looked down, but seeing Peach's body mimicking your every movement in the mirror really hammered it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you mutter, still not quite used to your new voice, \"That's really me.\" You place a hand on the mirror as if to confirm this. You try doing the poses from Peach's taunts. You thought you might look a little clumsy doing it, but thanks to the remote you do it perfectly, and look cute doing it. You never thought \"cute\" was something you'd like being, but Peach's smiling face looking back at you in the mirror says otherwise. You figure that if you do go back to your own life and body (and switch your relationships back of course), you might need to take these vacations from being Link more often. Maybe you'd even get Zelda get involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was for another time. Right now, you were Princess Peach, admiring yourself in the mirror. Your eyes slowly drift downward to your own body. Maybe the garden could wait. If you were going to be using this body for a while, you'd need to be familiar with it, right? Or perhaps you should save that for tonight. You and Zelda were now staying in the same room after all.</span></div></div>",

Everyone you pass treats you the same way they'd treat Peach, since you are Peach now of course. It's a different kind of respect, one that comes from being royalty rather than a fierce warriors. It's a rather refreshing change of pace, albeit a small one compared to everything that's gone on so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching the garden, you find that two people are already there; Wii Fit Trainer, who is doing some sort of meditation or yoga or something, and Villager, who is planting some flowers. Thanks to the remote, you know which flowers Peach herself had planted, and what to do to tend to them. You pick up a watering can and begin to water the flowers, humming to yourself a bit. You were certain that that was part of Peach's personality shining through. As you pruned them a little, you were almost certain you wouldn't be enjoying this as much as you were if you had still been in your old life. You seemed to be taking pride in how much they'd grown.

Her clothes should apparently stay with her life, which would mean you would look exactly like the princess, and everyone would believe you were her as well. It was a rather daunting thought, knowing not a bit your old self would exist with you to the outside world, only in your mind.

You could even feel her makeup applied to your face. You now looked exactly like Princess Peach, but everyone still knew you were Link, the Hero of Time. This was incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up from your self-examination to find your old body is nowhere to be seen. While you were busy looking yourself over, Peach must have gone about her business and went to do whatever it was she was doing before you borrowed her body and clothes. \"Well,\" you say to yourself, getting yourself used to your new voice, \"I guess even if I wanted to swap back I'd have to wait.\" You didn't want to swap back yet anyway, you were enjoying yourself too much. But now that you had Peach's body and clothes, what next? Were you just going to go about your daily business with your new body? You were going to head to the gym before this remote had flipped your life upside down (even though you hadn't actually swapped lives yet), so maybe you could go continue with that. Although, after becoming Peach, the remote excited you. Perhaps you could use it to swap other people around, since you weren't ready to give up your new body just yet.

The thought of completely leaving yourself behind frightens you a little, and you take a few deep breaths to calm yourself down (feeling your new breasts rise and fall with your breath) as you prepare to press the button. Building up the courage, you bring your finger down on the button before Peach (who had your old body wearing her dress) left your sight and you lost your chance. It is a little disorienting how quickly you are thrust into the position Peach was in and away from your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see that you still have Peach's body, but it is now clad in the pink dress everyone recognised her for. You can also feel her crown, earrings, and even her makeup, adorning your head. It feels odd, but you suppose it will just be something you'll get used to like the body. You look back behind you, to see what appears to be you walking away in the direction of the gym. If you hadn't known it used to be Peach, you wouldn't have been able to tell at all. You were a little scared at first, but now you were excited to try this out to the fullest. You had gone from being a manly warrior, the hero of Hyrule, to being a princess, and one of the girliest competitors in the tournament, and no one except you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what to do now. Peach seemed to have been headed to the garden, so you could always just continue to head over there and try to immerse yourself in your new life. You glance down at the remote in your gloved, female hand. That small metal box held more power than anything else you'd ever seen, and it was yours. You certainly didn't want to lose it and leave you stuck as Peach before you decided if you liked being her or not, or even worse, have someone else see the remote and take it from you. Perhaps you should put it away somewhere safe in your room. It takes you a little moment to realise that you'd now have Peach's room, which she shared with Zelda, but the thought doesn't seem all too important. But just looking at the remote in your hand made you want to take it with you, to experiment with it, even if you left yourself as Peach you could still use it to mess with other people.</span></div></div>",

While you are interested in experimenting with it, you decide that too much of a good thing can be bad, and elect to hide the remote for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to quickly make your way through the halls looking for Peach's room, finding it necessary to hold up the hems of her dress as you do so. \"Not easy being a princess...\" you mutter quietly, eventually finding Peach and Zelda's abode. While Peach has no pockets, you manage to find the key on her person somehow (perhaps where she keeps the turnips?) and open up the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is that the room given to Peach and Zelda as <i>far</i> more spacious than the one you were given. Perhaps it was because they were royal? The walls were mostly white, with small trimmings of pinks and blue. It was all rather ornate. The room was divided into two halves, and judging by the beddings (the right bed being mostly deep shades of purple, blue, and some gold while the left was more white and pink), you judged that the left bed was most likely yours. Thankfully, a large curtain cut between the abode, meaning that it was unlikely that your new roommate would catch a glimpse of your new possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your half of the room, you notice a trunk at the edge of the bed. It's locked, but a key is easily discovered on top of Peach's dresser. She clearly didn't expect any sort of intrusion. You open up the trunk, and find its mostly filled with sporting equipment. Golf Clubs, tennis rackets, etc. You stash the device underneath these things and lock it, choosing to hide the key under Peach's mattress. If anyone DOES come looking for the remote, its unlikely they'd be able to track it here specifically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get up, you notice a full length mirror next to the dresser. Its the first time you really managed to see your new self in completeness. \"Woah... I'm really a different person...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to run your fingers through your hair, which is now very thick. Your eyes are particularly drawn to your new chest, and you become aware of your new... equipment as well. You look to the door, and you doubt that anyone would barge in at this time of the day. Most other smashers are likely too busy, including Zelda. Do you decide to maybe stay and get 'acquainted' with your new identity? </span></div></div>",

It presumably contains a multitude of other outfits, ranging from other dresses to sports attire. The idea of putting on a little modeling show (and maybe finding a more convenient outfit to wear than that excessive dress) had its own level of appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands unconsciously went down to your hips, your thumbs around the waistband of your panties, as you thought it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess clothes or more clothes?</span></div></div>",

Be your own woman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmongst her outfits, Peach also packed several dresses identical to the one you were wearing before, only colored differently - fairly standard amongst contestants.

They feel a lot more simple/practical than the dress, and show a lot more of your arms and legs. You scan yourself over in the mirror with your new outfit, and notice that Peach isn't quite as dainty as you'd thought she was. She was obviously not as strong as your normal body, but she seemed fairly athletic once you saw her dressed for the occasion. You put one hand to your hip and lift an arm, giving a joking flex. You stifle a bit of laughter, imagining a buff Princess Peach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider maybe testing out your new body's potential at the gym.

Looking down at yourself, you find exactly what you had expected; Peach's feminine body covered by her pink dress. You squirm a little, feeling how different every inch of your body felt, except for your head. Worried about the consequences of this, you luckily find that you still have the remote, now held in your dainty, gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Link,\" you hear someone say behind you. You turn, holding the remote behind your back, to see Peach, waving daintily with your manly fingers. You note that she still has her crown and earrings and the like, which causes you to notice that you still had your usual hat on, probably creating an odd looking outfit when combined with the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say nervously, waving back. She smiled as she walked past you, and continued on her way. She seemed to find nothing wrong with the fact that you had her body below the neck. You run your left hand over your hips and butt. It was definitely an interesting change, but your weren't sure this was what you wanted. You look around, only to find that in your examination of your body, Peach has already left and gone on her way. You sigh. \"Well, I can change back whenever I like. Might as well try this out for a while,\" you say to yourself. You turn around, feeling the dress swishing about your legs, and head towards your room to see how this turned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there, you become very aware of all the differences with your new body. Every slight breeze would blow up under your dress and onto your feminine legs. Your larger hips would sway back and forth as you walked, and your breasts also moved slightly. With everything so different, you could barely concentrate on any one feeling. You eventually make it to your room and instantly go to the full length mirror hung on the door to the bathroom. You can't help but laugh at what you see. You look kind of silly with your head stuck on top of Peach's body. Thinking it over a little bit, you take off your hat, and are surprised at how much better it looks. If you had Peach's makeup and jewelery along with her dress, and maybe a bit longer hair, you wouldn't have looked too much out of place. Your attention is slowly drawn away from your face, and towards the body below it. Your dainty hands slowly reach up and give your breasts a squeeze, letting out a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... is this cheating?\" You quickly consider whether playing around with Peach's body would be considered cheating on your girlfriend, Zelda. \"Hm, nah. As far as anyone else knows, this is my body. It shouldn't matter if I play with it a little.\" You could play with it a bit more, perhaps a little more thoroughly, and without the dress covering it up. Then again, you still had the remote, there were plenty of other things you could try.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided that things were thoroughly muddled for now. You had Palutena's body, Bowser's clothes, and your own life, while Palutena had your body and clothes, and Bowser was wearing Palutena's clothes. You could easily swap things around even more, but for now, you were satisfied with how everything was. You could always do some more swapping later if you wanted. Leaving Bowser to walk around in Palutena's outfit, you head back to your room to put the remote away somewhere safe. You didn't exactly have any pockets to put it in, so if you weren't going to be doing any swaps, it would be safer to leave it in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked back to your room, you couldn't help but marvel over how different everything felt. You had already experienced having a female body when you swapped heads with Peach, but now you also had a female head, as well as Palutena's \"assets\" being larger than Peach's, among other things. On top of that, you were walking around practically naked, save for a spiked collar around your neck, and a pair of spiked arm bands on your wrists and upper arms. Every little breeze seemed to caress Palutena's body, and you could feel it turning you on a bit. You could feel Palutena's hair dancing around your back and butt, flowing down behind you. It was all so different and exciting, but the most exciting part was probably the fact that no one else would see anything out of the ordinary. As far as they knew, you had always had Palutena's body, and there was nothing wrong with you walking around practically naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally got to your room, and began looking for a place to store the remote. You eventually settled on putting it up on a high shelf, one you could only reach by standing on your bed. That would ensure that your roommate, Toon Link, would never be able to find it. You did notice, however, that all your weapons had disappeared from your room. If you remembered from the manual, your weapons were apparently considered part of your clothing, so Palutena now owned your weapons, while you had no weapons, since Bowser fought hand-to-hand. You couldn't help but wonder how you'd fare in the tournament, fighting naked with no weapons, and Palutena's body. Still, the tournament didn't actually start for a while, and if you found yourself struggling during practice matches, you could always do some more swaps. Speaking of Palutena's body, you run your hands down your body, feeling your newly acquired curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I could definitely get used to this,\" you say, hearing Palutena's voice come out of your mouth. While you were definitely interested in exploring your new body, you kind of wondered if anything else had been affected by your changes. You no longer had any weapons, so your fighting style would probably have to change, but you couldn't help but wonder if people would treat you any differently now that you had Palutena's body, and Bowser's clothes. They should act like this was all normal, but that didn't mean they'd have to act exactly the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

More concerning for your immediate future was the fact that instead of being your girlfriend, Zelda would be your best friend, and you'd be dating Mario instead. The gender swap wouldn't really give you much of Peach. Rather it would turn you into a female version of yourself, and Peach into a male version of herself. Although, since Peach was really girly, the female version of yourself that you'd turn into would probably be more girly than if you swapped with, for instance, Samus. Still, if you wanted to swap with Peach without really taking much of Peach, that was the option to go for.</span></div></div>",

You're still technically you, but everything feels so different. You look down at yourself to find an unfamiliar body where your own body should be. Your tunic had transformed into something resembling a dress, while still being practical enough for the adventuring you did, and you no longer had pants underneath the tunic. Your boots also had a slight heel to them; not enough to be incredibly obvious to an observer, but enough that you could tell the difference while wearing them. Your fingernails were a little longer, and were painted green, and despite not being able to see them, you knew the same was true for your toenails. You could feel a bit of make up on your face, and guessed it was about the same amount as Peach usually wore. As for the body itself, you had much longer hair than before, and it ran down to about the middle of your back, and was a brighter blonde than before. Your limbs overall felt a bit thinner, your waist especially so. Despite the loss in muscle mass, you still felt fairly strong. Your breasts were fairly small, but it still felt strange having them in the first place, to say nothing of what you now had below the belt. You hips and butt felt a bit bigger, not too big but certainly bigger than what you had as a guy. You had also dropped a bit in height, and although you couldn't see your face, you could tell your features were a bit softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change is a bit overwhelming, and you find yourself just standing still, trying to take everything in. You can feel the steady rise and fall of your chest as you breath deeply, trying to calm down a bit. You look down the hallway at where Peach had once stood. Peach was still there, but it wasn't the Peach you had once known. Oddly enough, you knew that the two of you had still retained your old names despite the gender change. Princess Peach was now Prince Peach, ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom. You couldn't see much from where you were standing, as she had been walking away from you the whole time you were taking stock of your new body, but it was clear she was no longer a woman, and in fact she wasn't even wearing pink anymore. Her pink dress was now some sort of purple suit befitting of a prince, and she seemed a bit taller, and her hair seemed a bit closer to orange than blonde. Still a little freaked out by the suddenness of the changes, you slowly raise the remote to swap back with Peach, but you are interrupted as you receive all the memories of your new life, as if you had been a woman all your life. Every little moment, changed to make it so that you were a woman. It was actually kind of surprising how little had changed, aside from your body and the way people treated you. It was enough to make you think about staying this way for a bit, if only to explore just how much your life had changed. You shake your head, feeling your long hair moving about as you do so, trying to break yourself out of your little daze that was set on by all the changes, so you can decide what you want to do before Peach leaves.</span></div></div>",

You'd spent the day stuck in Samus' body due to a careless mistake and a bit of dishonesty, and you'd been regretting every moment of it.

You'd tried to come up with a way to get the remote back from Samus, but you hadn't come up with anything that would work. You'd seen Samus occasionally when you dared to venture out of your room, but she had made sure to avoid you, preventing you from convincing her to swap the two of you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you feared that the worst was yet to come. Although the fighters in the tournament were assigned specific rooms, fighters who were romantically involved were also given special \"couples rooms\", which they could use if they wanted to spend the night together.

You could only imagine how this would change things with Zelda. She might think you were still a man, but with a female body, some things would almost certainly change in your love-making session. You still weren't comfortable with having Samus' body, so you certainly weren't ready to get intimate with your newly acquired female parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the clock in your room. It was getting close to the time when you were supposed to meet Zelda at your couples room, and you still hadn't come up with a way to get your body back. You didn't want to keep Zelda waiting, but you also didn't really want to go through with this while you still had Samus' body. Maybe you could come up with an excuse to not go through with this? It'd upset Zelda, but it would give you more time to try and get your own body back. You crossed your arms beneath your breasts, frowning as your looked down at the feminine body that was now yours, and thought about what you should do.</span></div></div>",

Even though you had had a female body before, having performed a gender swap before, this felt rather different. While a gender swap had given you a female version of you own body, creating a body you were unfamiliar with, you had now received one you were very familiar with, although not from this angle. This was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to find that just as you had Zelda's body, Zelda now had yours. You find yourself having to hold back a laugh at seeing your body wearing Zelda's clothes. Zelda looks up from her self-examination at the sound of your snickering, and pulls a feminine pose, saying \"Oh, you like what you see?\" Once she adds a wink, you are unable to hold back your laughter, and she starts laughing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look ridiculous,\" you saw in between laughing. \"My body and your clothes really don't work together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Zelda replies. \"Although I bet everyone thinks it works pretty well. As well as my body worked with them, in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true.\" You knew the remote made everyone think this was normal, so despite how weird your body looked in Zelda's dress, everything would think that was how Zelda had always looked and would have no problem with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what else can we do with this device?\" Zelda says, looking over the remote held in her now masculine hands. \"Maybe we can find some other potential targets to swap with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to see that Zelda was as excited about this remote as you were. \"Sure, let's have a look around for some more people. But, uh...\" You weren't sure whether it was just Zelda's body, or whether it was the combination of Zelda's body with your old outfit, but you didn't feel very comfortable right now. Perhaps you just needed a bit more time to get used to having a female body, but there was a much more obvious solution available. \"Do you think we should swap back before we do some more swapping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling uncomfortable in my body?\" Zelda asks, sensing how you felt. You simply nod in answer to her question. \"Yeah, I know what you mean. But maybe there's another solution other than swapping back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe we'd feel more comfortable if we had the right clothes for our bodies.\" You think about it. You already had Zelda's body, so taking her clothes as well would end up leaving nothing of your male self. Of course, since you weren't swapping lives, everyone would still recognise you as Link, despite looking exactly like Zelda. \"Or, we could just put up with the uncomfortableness for now while we find some other people to swap with.\"</span></div></div>",

It looks a lot better too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of strange that people are still going to see me as Zelda even though I look like you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you say, putting your hands on your new hips. It still felt a bit odd having a female body, but you guessed it'd just be something you needed to get used to. It was a strange thought, that you could have a female body at all, let alone get used to one, but having fun with this remote would probably be easier if you got used to both genders. \"So, shall we go find some new targets to swap with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, let's.\" The two of you head off in search of other people to swap with. Even though you had been standing there in Zelda's body for a while now, actually walking around still felt very different.

It might be fun to swap places every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, right now we haven't really swapped places, since everyone still sees me as Link and you as Zelda, but I get what you mean.

Having swapped before, you are less shocked, but are still caught a little off guard by it. The only swap you had used was a gender swap, so you had had a female body before, but that had been a female version of your own body, whereas now you still had your own head atop a body you were very familiar with, Princess Zelda's. Granted, you weren't so familiar with it from this angle. Actually having this body yourself was definitely a new experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Zelda says, holding a hand up to her face and just marveling at the fact that despite it originally being your hand, she has control over it right now, \"This is amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you reply. \"It seems like this should be impossible, but here we are, heads on each other's bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda starts to pay a bit less attention to your body below her neck, and a bit more attention to you, who currently had her body below the neck. She begins to laugh a little bit. \"We probably look ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou join in the laughter. \"I guess we do. Although everyone else is just going to think this is normal.\" You pause for a moment, taking in all the new feelings Zelda's body was giving you, before saying, \"So, do you want to swap more or just stay like this for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda seems a little surprised by your question. \"You want to do more than this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only if you want to, I'm happy to just stay with your body for now. I mean, there are still other buttons we haven't tried, and we could try swapping with other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda thinks about your proposition, looking down at the male body she currently possessed.</span></div></div>",

Luckily there was no one around to wonder what the two of you were laughing about. Once you are done laughing, the two of you take a closer look at yourselves and how the clothes have adjusted to your bodies. \"Wow, you even have my makeup on,\" Zelda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have your whole wardrobe, and that includes your makeup,\" you reply, noting how strange it felt to have Zelda's makeup applied to your face, among other things. And now that you were thinking about it, you realised that now that you owned Zelda's makeup, you knew exactly how to put it on. \"You should have all my weapons too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda looks over her shoulder to see all of your weapons strapped to her back. \"Huh, I guess I do. This device is amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to try using it more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Zelda replies enthusiastically.

You didn't think the dress was bad or anything, but you hadn't been trying to convince Zelda to let you keep her clothes. You just thought it would be easier if you didn't worry about swapping back before you swapped more. \"Well, uh, anyway, who should we swap with?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll swap myself another time, if you don't mind,\" Zelda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's fine,\" you reply. You didn't have a problem with Zelda not swapping for now. You knew she just needed a bit of time to get used to your transformation before she undertook one of her own. \"So, shall we put the remote back in our room for now so it's safe, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a good idea.\" The two of you head towards your shared room. On the way, you notice Zelda looking at you from time to time, amused by the fact that this princess in pink in front of her was actually her boyfriend. \"Wow, you don't just look like Peach, you're walking like her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Zelda hadn't pointed it out, you probably wouldn't have noticed, but you were definitely swaying your hips as you walked, just like Peach used to. \"Well, I pretty much am Peach now. Except that I still live in Hyrule and I'm dating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. It still seems strange that you're pretty much a complete different person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still me on the inside. I'm just a princess instead of a hero now. Although I can let Peach's personality take over when I want.\" The two of you make it to the room, and you hold the door open for Zelda. \"Ladies first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda just laughs. \"We're both ladies now, silly.\" As Zelda enters the room, you hear her say, \"Oh, that's different.\" Entering as well, and closing the door behind you, you instantly see what Zelda had been referring to. The room seemed pretty much the same as the last time you had visited Zelda here, except that instead of being on opposite sides of the room, the two beds had been pushed together into the middle of the room, no doubt something you and Zelda had done upon arriving at the tournament in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where should we put this?\" you ask, holding up the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, Zelda opens up an empty drawer in her bedside table. \"Does this seem safe enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the remote inside the drawer, and say, \"Yeah, it should be fine. I doubt anyone's going to come looking for it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda closes the drawer again, standing back up with her hands on her hips. \"Well that sorts out one thing then, Li-... Uh, should I be calling you Link or Peach now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when we're around other people you'll have to call me Peach, since that's who everyone else thinks I am now. But since we're alone, just call me whatever feels right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright then... Peach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we're not using the remote, how about we just go on with our day as normal for now. I still have things I need to do, and you probably need some time to used to being Peach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I guess I'll see you at dinner then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then.\" And with a wave, Zelda leaves the room, leaving you alone. You wondered what you should do now. Now that Zelda was involved, you didn't want to use the remote without her, it just wouldn't be as fun. You could just go out and see how different your life was now that you were Peach. Although, you life wasn't all that had changed, and simply looking down gave you a good idea of something else you could try out.</span></div></div>",

You'd probably be doing the same thing if you had a new body too.\"  Zelda looked away, knowing she couldn't deny that she'd probably be curious about her new body too, had she switched. \"Besides, if I'm keeping this body for a while, I'm going to end up seeing it naked eventually. Might as well just get it out of the way and get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's one way of looking it at...\" She lets her arms drop by her sides. \"Sorry about going off at you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I understand why you would.\" You smiled at the argument being sorted out so quickly, although you still felt a bit awkward about Zelda walking in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by her slight blush, Zelda probably felt a bit awkward about it too.

You responded in kind, finding your hands going lower and lower to her rear. Whatever clothes the two of you HAD been wearing were soon discarded as you went wild with passion using your new body. All the sensations were new and exciting; it was titillating in a way you would have never thought. \"Keep going!\" you tell her as you rolled on your back, your girlfriend on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, the two of you had finished up, both lying on your backs. You stared at the ceiling for a moment before turning your head and saying, in Peach's voice, \"that was pretty weird, I'm not going to lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda considers it for a moment. \"It... really was. I would have never done something like that before. I think the remote must have changed my... preferences.

You begin to gather up Peach's clothes that were strewn about and redress. With a bit of difficulty, you clasped her bra as you turned to Zelda and said, \"we should try it again sometime. Maybe even with more different bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda had begun to get dressed too, and was much faster about it. She was getting back into her dress as she gave an uneasy smile. \"Yeah... maybe. I admit I got a bit too caught up in that though. I have to go now - I need to attend to some things.\" She got her heels on, but forgot her tiara and gloves as she hurriedly rushed out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled a bit at Zelda's behavior, and her jumps from uncertainty to confidence, as you turned to a mirror. \"Well Peach, I gotta say, it definitely is interesting being you.\" you say, staring at your half dressed reflection. Your hair is askew and messy, but you don't care much at the moment. Looking around, you suppose you ought to redress. You could put your dress back on, but then, you also have the entirety of Peach's wardrobe about to have some fun with. Not to mention, Zelda's clothes are around too if you want to try out something even more different on your current self. </span></div></div>",

You're sure Zelda won't mind if you try on something of her's, probably. Looking through the dresses Zelda had brought specifically for the tournament, you notice a variety of different-coloured versions of the same dress. As Link, you'd had a bunch of differently coloured tunics for the tournament, but now that you were Peach, you guessed you probably had a bunch of differently coloured dresses as well. You pick out one that had pink in the place of Zelda's usual purple, and brought it over to the bed. You're not entirely sure why you picked the pink one, but perhaps Peach's body/life knew what would look good on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a little while to get the dress on, having no experience with putting on women's clothing, but you eventually succeed. It fit surprisingly well. It feels a bit heavier than Peach's dress, and it leaves your shoulders and some of your chest exposed. You found it kind of interesting how different the two garments felt. Looking in the mirror, you had to admit that it did kind of look good on Peach's body. It wasn't her usual style, and you think it'd still look better on Zelda, but but it does still look good. You let out a bit of a giggle, thinking about how silly it was that you were spending your time trying on dresses. For the time being, though, you were Peach, so this really wasn't that weird at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fun as it was dressing up in Zelda's clothes, you knew you couldn't go walking around outside your room dressed like this, and so you take off the dress and put it back where you go it from. Your eyes return to the dress you had discarded on the floor earlier, before Zelda had accidentally interrupted you. You could get dressed and go do something else, but as your eyes wander back to you and Zelda's wardrobes, you can't help but wonder if there's anything else you want to try on.</span></div></div>",

You quickly make your way to the gym, and find Samus on her way out, probably heading back to her room after a training session. Instead of her Power Suit, she was dressed in her Zero Suit. If you recalled correctly, the Hands wouldn't let her switch between the two mid-battle anymore, so she was competing twice, once in her Power Suit and once in her Zero Suit. You quickly point the remote at her and press the life swap button. In an instant, you switch places with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react, you hear Samus's voice behind you. \"Hey Samus,\" she says, waving to you. You turn to see her heading into the gym, dressed completely in your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Link,\" you reply, feeling a little weird referring to her by your name. You wave back, and she heads inside the gym, and you begin to walk away, towards Samus's room. As you walk, you take note of how you look. You can't see your face, but you can feel Samus's makeup on your face, and Zelda's hair is pulled up into a ponytail. Looking down, you see Zelda's body clothed in Samus's Zero Suit, leaving nothing to the imagination. You would have probably never seen Zelda wearing something like this, so the fact that the remote made that possible is pretty amazing in itself. But you'd definitely never see it from this angle. To be the one in control of this body, it was unbelievable, or it would be if it wasn't currently happening. Of course, due to the life swap, you were no longer Zelda's boyfriend, you were intergalactic bounty hunter, Samus Aran, except with Zelda's body. And Samus, in your life but still with her body was the hero of Hyrule, dating Princess Zelda, who had your old body. When you think about it that way, reality seems pretty messed up right now, and you've only done two swaps. But thanks to the power of the remote, everyone thought it was normal, so as long as you were okay with how reality was, it didn't matter. You'd just need to make sure you were in a situation you were happy with once the tournament ended, or at least in a position where you could switch things around in a world you were familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach Samus's room. This could be the perfect time to get a bit more acquainted with your new body, provided Samus's roommate wasn't here. You weren't sure where they're be at this time of day. You pull out the key to the room from... somewhere, and unlock the door.</span></div></div>",

You are surprised by how quick it was, and the fact it didn't make any lights or sounds that would indicate it was doing something this amazing. You quickly turn back too look at where you were, and see Zelda, dressed in your clothes, walking off in the direction of the gym, possibly to do the training you were planning before you got distracted by the remote. The swishing feel of the dress on your legs as you turned to look brings your attention to your own situation. Looking down, you see that you definitely still have your own body, but you are dressed from head to toe in Zelda's clothes. You could feel her tiara on your head, the armor on your shoulders, even the cloth she used to tie up her hair was wrapped around your much shorter hair. You could even feel her bra and panties on you underneath the dress. It was an odd experience to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think of what to do next, you realise that you no longer have the manual with you. You had put it inside your quiver, which Zelda (who thought she was you) now had. You figure you were planning on keeping your tunic anyway, even with Zelda's life, so you start to aim the remote at Zelda, ready to swap clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda!\" It takes you a moment to realise that the voice is calling out to you, and you turn to see who it is while hiding the remote behind your back. As it turns out, Peach was coming from another hallway, waving to you. You wave back with your free hand, trying not to show that you're a little worried about Zelda getting out of your sight before you can get your tunic back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Peach,\" you say. You do your best to try and sound like Zelda, and strangely it comes naturally. You make a mental note of that. You may have kept your own mind and personality, but the remote had allowed you to mimic Zelda perfectly to help you claim her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You headed to the library?\" she asks. You panic for a second. You actually weren't sure where Zelda was headed before you decided to become her, but it did look like she was going to the library. You mind once again fills you in that Zelda was heading to the library, which means that's were you are now headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was just on my way over there.\" As you converse with Peach, you keep peaking over at Zelda. She was very far down the hallway now, and if you were right, she'd soon be turning the corner into the gym. If she did that, you wouldn't have a clear shot to get your tunic (and the manual) back from her unless you actually went to the gym, which might make Peach suspicious since it was in the other direction of the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Wanna head there together?\" Now you were worried. If you went with Peach, you'd miss your chance to get your tunic back. You'd either have to find a way to distract a bit with Peach or get her to leave so that you could aim without her asking about what you were doing, or just suck it up and wear the dress until the next time you saw Zelda. Alternatively, you could try to swap without aiming so the swap would happen and you wouldn't make Peach suspicious. There was the chance of a misfire though.</span></div></div>",

It's not too bad, and eventually, you reach the library. \"It's so nice to be able to research with another woman interested in the studies,\" says Peach as she picks out some books. \"Uh...yeah,\" you say. \"Likewise.\" You spend most of the time on autopilot, relying on Zelda's natural skills.

We should meet here again soon.\" \"It was a pleasure,\" you say. To your surprise, it's the truth.

The shock came from the fact that the dress, which had before been readjusted to fit your body, had now returned it its original dimensions. Of course, the reason the clothes had returned to their original dimensions was because their original body was filling them. You now not only were living Zelda's life and wearing her clothes, but you also had her body. If the manual was right, you should also have her abilities in magic now, in exchange for your weapon skills. There was pretty much nothing of the original you left aside from your mind, which was affected a bit to allow you to smoothly live Zelda's life. You were a little worried about the possibility of loosing yourself and completely becoming Zelda. The manual did mention that aside from a few mental changes to help with the swaps, such as that you were currently experiencing from the life swap, but you weren't sure if you trusted it. In actuality, the manual was correct and you were in no danger of losing yourself in Zelda's personality unless you wanted to, but that didn't stop you from worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Let's go,\" Peach says as she takes your arm and practically drags you in the direction of the library. She always did strike you as very upbeat and enthusiastic. As she takes you along with you, you glance back at where Zelda was. There's no longer any evidence that she had once been Zelda, aside from the fact that you knew she was. You are only able to get a quick look of her before she goes into the gym, but she looks exactly like you now. Since she also thought she was you, she might as well be the real Link now. You would definitely be taking back some of her (or more accurately right now, his) features next time you saw him. But for now, Zelda had gone inside the gym, and you were stuck as Zelda, heading to the library with Peach to pick out a few books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were there, Peach tells you she's going to look for a new cookbook, and leaves you by yourself. When you reply to her as she leaves, it startles you a little that you have Zelda's voice, but you suppose her vocal chords came with the rest of her body. Not really being one for reading, slowly walk through the aisles, looking for something Zelda might like, since you pretty much are her now. It occurs to you that this could be a good time to head off and find Zelda, but Peach still had a view of the door. You could pick out a few books and then quickly take them back to your (Zelda's) room before Peach was done and then go find Zelda. Alternatively, you could accept that for the time being, you are Zelda, and try messing around with the remote for a bit to see if you can create some humorous results, or improve your situation.</span></div></div>",

So you just end up roaming the aisles of the library, collecting a few books that you knew Zelda would like, and borrowing them so you could take them back to your room. You had taken longer looking through the books than you had thought, as Peach had already left by the time you were done. You head towards your room (which had originally been Zelda's) to put the books away. You would be on the lookout for potential targets to swap with, but your arms your full at the moment, which would make operating the remote a little difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually make it to your new room, and struggle to open the door while carrying everything. You're about to just put the books down on the floor so you can open the door, when you hear a voice call from a little ways down the hallway. \"Hey Zelda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognise the voice as your own, or at least, your old voice. Looking up from your little struggle with the door, you see your old body walking down the hallway towards you. Technically it was still Zelda, who just thought she was you, but really there was nothing left about her that made her Zelda. \"Hello Link,\" you reply, still feeling a little odd talking to your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me get that for you,\" Zelda says as she opens the door for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" As you head inside and place your books down, an idea comes into your head. This whole thing might be more fun if both you and Zelda were in on it. She might not like that you had swapped with her without her knowing, but you had no doubt she'd be as curious about the remote as you were. Of course, swapping by yourself could be fun too; then you could do whatever swap you wanted without someone bugging you about it.</span></div></div>",

You offer the remote to Zelda, and she takes a hold of it (without taking it out of your hand, you needed to be able to see the swap too), points it towards Lucina, and presses a button. Just as quickly as your transformation had occurred, Zelda's hylian dress had been replaced with Lucina's clothes, the Parallel Falchion strapped to her hip. It was interesting watching a swap occur that you weren't part of. It just sort of... happened, with no warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" Zelda says, taking her hand off the remote. \"Now i should have my own magic abilities, as well as Lucina's skill with a sword. And her clothes should be a bit more practical to fight in than my dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, not bad.\" You glance over at where Lucina and Ike were sparring. She was still fighting against Ike, but she no longer had a sword, and she was wearing Zelda's dress. However, something catches your eye. During their little practice fight, Lucina pulls out some sort of needles and throws them at Ike. You recognised the needles as those Zelda used while in her Sheik disguise. \"Hey, you can still use your Sheik disguise, right?\" you ask Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I should be able to. It's not like my ability to transform is linked to my clothes. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucina's using your Sheik weapons,\" you say, pointing at Lucina and Ike's sparring match. Sure enough, Lucina was not only using the needles, but also the Burst Grenades Zelda had prepared specifically for the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. How did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the clothes swap does swap all the clothes you own. I guess that included your things from your Sheik disguise. Maybe your Sheik outfit is one of Lucina's alternate costumes or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check something,\" Zelda says before promptly disappearing into a burst of light. The light fades to reveal Zelda's Sheik disguise, but not as you remembered it. Her hair was still blonde, and she had a more boy-ish, athletic body, but she was still wearing Lucina's clothes. The only difference between her attire as Zelda and her attire as Sheik was that Sheik now wore the butterfly mask Lucina had used to disguise herself when she traveled back in time. \"Well, that's strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have the same outfit and everything, and probably the same moves too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the only thing that changes is my strength and speed now. Great, I'm a clone of myself.\" You frown slightly at her use of the term 'clone'. Many fighters referred to fighters with very similar moves as \"clones\", but when people like Toon Link and Lucina started to take offense to the term, it began to be used less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's if you're even competing twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right. Without two move sets, I might not even have two spots. Is there any way to check?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should have new memories to match the new reality, as long as our old ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you think back through your new memories.</span></div></div>",

You here?\" Peach called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yeah, I'm in the bathroom... I'm about to take a shower!\" Link improvises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I'm sorry. Nevermind me,\" Peach tells him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a quiet sigh of relief, Link realizes he can still have his fun in the other room.

But things seemed different when she walked about the halls. It was difficult to explain, but the looks they gave her were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea only cemented in her mind when Link was holding a door for her. \"Oh, thank you Link.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled with an unusual warmness. \"Anything for you, Peach.\" Before she process that, he gave her a quick peck on the cheek and went on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched the spot in shock. <i>The nerve!

Was your old body behaving strangely? \"He's always been a good boyfriend to you, did he do something wrong?\" The fact that, logically, you would've been Peach's boyfriend didn't even enter your mind. Perhaps you believed you swapped relationships and usually Selda would be dating Peach. Or perhaps you couldn't even consider thinking too hard about those differences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach stared at you in surprise. \"B-Boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give him a talking to if he bugs you, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach slowly shook her head. \"...N-no, it's alright.

You decided to lock the bathroom door just to make sure she wouldn't come in. \"I guess I shouldn't worry about it,\" you mumbled. If Peach kept acting weird, you'd ask her if she pressed it. She'd probably try to swap back soon if she made a switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting your mind to other matters, you grin as you unwrap the towel from your body, sauntering over to the bathtub which you begin to fill up. You throw off what was left of Zelda's undergarments as the room fills with steam and jump into the large, rather luxurious tub as it reaches fullness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" you sigh as you lower yourself in. You couldn't recall the water in your room getting this hot. In fact, your bathroom only had a shower - not a tub at all! You supposed this was one of the perks of being a princess. It was very relaxing, and it washed away some of the stress you had felt over Peach nearly discovering the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the hems of your hair touching the water, you suppose you better use the chance to wash off. Holding your breath, you dive underneath the water for a second. When you pull out, you feel your soft hair dripping down your back. Everything just feels soft and different as Zelda, you admit you could get used to it as you move to wash yourself. \"Worth it,\" you whisper as you find a bar of soap and begin to scrub down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later - later than you'd like to admit, you finally got out of the tub, wrapping your towel around yourself once again. Your face was rather red after all the exploration you'd done, but you had plenty of fun in the process. As you dry off, you put your ear up to the door, listening into the room. It seemed that Peach had left, to your relief. \"Probably means we didn't swap.\" You go to the cabinet to pull the device back and return to the main bedroom. \"Got to find it a real home...\" eventually you settle on what seems to be a jewelry box of some sort with one empty space that just barely fit the remote. The box locks, meaning it'd be hard for anyone to take the remote out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling dry, you throw the towel off and search the room, eventually finding a bathrobe to cover Zelda's (now yours) naked body. It was a light shade of purple, and was incredibly comfortable. You imagined it was quite expensive. \"The princess lifestyle is looking better by the minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to look around and find Zelda's makeup table. Sitting down, you realize her hair needs to be completely rebrushed, and her makeup needs doing again. You weren't sure how to address this at all, but suddenly find that Zelda's memories take autopilot, doing her hair up probably and applying her usual light coat of makeup. It was amazing; you were Link deep down, but it was so easy to fall back on Zelda's identity if you wanted too. It was almost as though you were both yourself and her at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at your new face up close, you wonder where to go from here. Being Zelda was great! However, you sorta worried for the real Zelda. While you were living her life, she was you, but totally unaware. It was almost like she didn't exist for the moment, which was worrying. You wanted to atleast check on her, even if you don't switch back right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you decide on? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything just felt a bit euphoric after using the remote, and you hoped it wouldn't end any time soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found Peach at her own little vegetable patch, planting turnips. You knew firsthand that those things weren't for eating, they HURT. \"Hey Peach!\" you call as you approach, prompting her to turn and look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello there Zelda. Enjoy your bath?\" She asks with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I certainly did,\" you reply. \"I just wanted to know if you wanted to go grab something to eat with me? It's already evening and I didn't even have lunch today!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Certainly, just let me finish up,\" she replied as she continued to go about the replanting. She didn't realize that you were looking her over while she did, making a small list in your head of future bodies to try out whenever you happened to move out of Zelda's. A part of you felt bad for thinking about people that way, but the remote was just too much fun, and you're adventurousness was telling you to keep trying new things out. Eventually she finished up and the two of you chatted genially as you walked, although you were secretly thinking of settings on the remote to use on Peach all the way to the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were gone, did someone discover the remote back in Zelda's room? </span></div></div>",

You leave Peach and Zelda to their conversation and head back to the rooms. You frown a little as you notice the way you are walking. Now that you had Zelda's body from the neck down, you were moving like she would to an extent. If the feeling of having her body wasn't weird enough, you now also had to put up with her hips swaying side to side as you walked. It was definitely not something you liked now that you were the one doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost try to enter your old room, when you remember that you're Zelda now, and thus you should be using the room Peach and Zelda share. You head inside and hide the manual in amongst the other books on Zelda's shelf. Now as long as you didn't switch lives again, and Peach didn't get too nosy, you'd always have access to the manual. Now there was the issue of making yourself normal again, although still with Zelda's life. Right now you had your own tunic, being worn by Zelda's body from the neck down, and on top was your own head, decorated by Zelda's jewelery and makeup. It was an odd combination, but probably not as odd as Zelda now looked, considering she had both her dress and your hat, which really didn't go together, and your male body underneath the dress. You felt like you should do something about this, but you'd have to find Zelda and decide on what to swap first. Finding Zelda should be the easy part, since you had been heading to the gym before you found the package, so she should be there if she thought she was you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for deciding on what to swap, there were a multiple of different things you could do. Now that you had the manual back, getting your tunic was less of a concern, so you could just do a head swap and try out wearing a dress again. However, you were thinking about borrowing Zelda's body before you decided to borrow her life. Sure, you only had her body from the neck down, but it was definitely something. If you left your heads on your new bodies, maybe you should do a clothes swap so that you each had the clothes that matched your body. If you really wanted to get complicated though, you could try to make it so that you had the clothes that matched your life (completely, not just the top or bottom), and the body of your girlfriend. If you switched your heads back, and then swapped your clothes with someone else, then with Zelda and another person, you could swap your heads without getting your clothing mixed up, and you'd just have to swap your clothes back with the people who had used as a reserve to hold your clothes. It was a little complicated, and had the chance of going wrong, but if it worked than you'd completely be Zelda except for your head, which would have Zelda's jewelery and makeup on it. The thought excited you, plus if it worked like you thought it would, whoever you used as a reserve to hold you and Zelda's clothes would end up with the clothing of the other reserve from the neck down. That could mean you would get the Zelda experience, and have the hilarity of seeing, for example, Mario running around in Peach's dress. And then again, you could just go with your original plan before the head swap happened with was to be Zelda, but look exactly like yourself, body, clothes, and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were the more normal looking one between you and Zelda, so as long as you didn't mind your girlfriend (although boyfriend would be the more correct term right now) looking like a crossdresser, you could just leave things as they were, and maybe go have fun using the remote to mess around with other people. Or you could put the remote away and just enjoy the rest of the day as Zelda. There were a number of different things you could do.</span></div></div>",

You position yourself in front of a sandbag and swing your sword at it a few times. That way Zelda shouldn't walk off once you swap heads with him. Speaking of which, you swap heads with Zelda, which causes you to end up with your head back on your old body which was currently wearing Zelda's dress. After walking around in Zelda's body for a bit, it feels a little strange to have your old male body back, but it won't be for long. You check to make sure Zelda hasn't walked away, an sure enough, she's still there slashing the sandbag. You turn around and aim the remote at Little Mac and press clothes swap. This puts you in Mac's tank top and shorts, while Mac continues working the bag in Zelda's dress. You chose to swap with Mac first because you though it would be funny to see him in Zelda's clothes, and you were right, as you have to try and hold in a laugh at the sight. However, you need to make sure your tunic and hat stay together too, so you swap clothes with Zelda, putting her in Mac's boxing outfit, and you in your original clothes. Luckily she hasn't notice you're here yet, because if it had been you (and she is you right now) and you had seen Zelda right now, you would have come over to talk to her at the very least, and that would have messed up your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Samus, you hit clothes swap again, putting her in your tunic and you in her zero suit. The skin tight suit had a very different feeling to the other 3 outfits, which had been more loose, and probably wouldn't have been to bad if you had been wearing it on Zelda's body instead of yours. As it stood, the tightness on your groin was a bit uncomfortable, but it was definitely something you'd be interested in trying out at a later date once you had acquired Zelda's body. Seeing Samus attacking the bag with your sword, you decide to try out a kick with Samus's rocket boots. The rocket activated just as your foot hit the bag, and you could really feel the power behind the kick. Now you were even more interested in trying Samus's clothes more, but for now you returned to the task at hand. You point the remote at Zelda and press head swap. In an instant, you are back on Zelda's body, now wearing Little Mac's much more loose clothes. You can still feel Samus's hair-tie in your hair though. Now you had the body you wanted, you just needed to get the clothes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first though, you need to get Zelda back into your tunic. You point the remote at Samus and hit clothes swap. You are once again in your old tunic, and Samus is wearing Mac's outfit, but her hair is back in a ponytail like it was before. You swap with Zelda again, and now she is completely you except for her head, putting you back in Samus's zero suit. You were right in your earlier thought; the suit was a lot more comfortable on a female body. However, that was for another time, because right now you wanted Zelda's dress back, since you hadn't actually worn it on a female body yet. You point the remote at Little Mac and press clothes swap. Just as with the zero suit, the dress feels a lot more comfortable hugging Zelda's curves than it did sticking to your male body. And with that, your plan was complete. You step back to admire your handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was hacking away at a sandbag with the Master Sword. She now wore your old tunic and hat, and below her neck she had your strong body. On top of all that, she was living your life, so she believed that she was actually you. Over on the other side of the gym, Samus was punching and kicking her own sandbag. Instead of her zero suit, she was wearing the tank top, shorts, and boxing gloves of Little Mac. Before the swap, she had been entering the tournament twice, once as Samus and once as Zero Suit Samus, but considering all she'd own of the power suit now was the helmet, you weren't sure if that would be the case anymore. Near her was the newcomer, Little Mac. Despite the added power he could have by kicking with his rocket boots, he still seemed to only be using punches. However, even though he wasn't using them offensively, he still maneuvered around the bag in Samus' high heeled rocket boots as if he had been wearing them his whole life, and from his point of view, he had. Since the manual said you'd gain any skills required with your clothing, that meant that Mac probably owned, and knew how to operate the power suit, so he had probably taken Samus' place as a double participant in the tournament. Speaking of double participants, you were now wearing Zelda's full outfit from head to toe, and below your head you had the body that the dress was made for. You were also living Zelda's life, so everyone thought you were her, and you had all of her magical abilities. With those magical abilities probably also came the ability to transform into her alter ego, Sheik, which meant you'd also be having double participation in the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you think that maybe you can keep Zelda's dress in this form, and take Samus' zero suit in your Sheik for, but you realise that would also give you the power suit, so you'd probably be participating in the tournament three times. The thought intrigues you though. You do still want to try out transforming into Sheik, but you could also go and mess with other people using the remote.</span></div></div>",

However, once you see who's clothes it is, it becomes ever clearer that you must have been pointing the remote in the entirely wrong direction. Instead of your green tunic or Zelda's dress which was at least sensible, you were now wearing Peach's pink, puffy dress. You could feel the change from boots to high heels, the tiara to a crown, the larger earrings now dangling from your pointed ears, the ring on your hand. You can even feel the more subtle change of Peach having more makeup applied than Zelda had, a feeling you doubt you'll ever get used to. You look up again to see that, as you assumed, Peach is now wearing the clothes that belonged to Zelda, and she actually doesn't look too bad in them. It makes her seem a bit more mature, although that illusion is broken once she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go then!\" Peach snaps you out of your trance by taking you by the arm and practically dragging you along to the library. You do your best to keep up with her, still marveling at how you somehow knew how to walk in high heels. You definitely didn't want to keep Peach's clothing. Not only did you feel ridiculous (and probably looked it too), but the material felt a lot softer on your skin than anything you were used to wearing. It wasn't a bad feeling, it just made you feel a bit weird inside. That said, it was definitely very light and easy to move about in, much more so than your old clothes with your weapons strapped to your back or Zelda's outfit with the armor on the shoulders. You could get used to this sort of freedom, but not if it meant you had to participate in the tournament without any weapons to protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two of you reach the library. \"So,\" Peach says, \"I'm here to try and find a new cook book. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind fills in the blanks for you, and you answer in a manner just like Zelda would. \"Oh, I'm here to find a few books for some late night reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Peach almost seems disappointed to hear this. Her pouty expression contrasts with her regal appearance she gained with Zelda's clothes. It's so comical you consider letting her keep the outfit, until you remember that that's supposed to be your outfit right now and you feel a great deal more sensible wearing that, even if it is still a dress. \"Knowing your tastes we'll probably be looking on opposite sides on the library. Guess I wasted your time for nothing.\" You are about to tell her that it's no problem and that she didn't waste your time, because even though she caused the predicament that got you stuck wearing her dress, Zelda would have told her that it was okay. However, before you can get a word in, her mood does a 180 and she seems completely cheerful. \"Well, I guess I'll see you later. Bye Zelda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks away, waving to you, the fact that she calls you Zelda again catches you off guard and you forget that you need to swap your clothing back with her. By the time you realise that you still have the pink dress, Peach is long gone into the vast maze of bookcases that i the library. You knew she was looking for cook books, but not being much of a reader (or chef) yourself, you didn't know where they would be located in the library. You can't help but laugh a little at how strange this predicament you've gotten yourself into. Here you are, the hero of time, standing in the entrance to the library with a reality altering remote, dressed like Princess Peach with the rest of the world thinking you're Princess Zelda. You couldn't have made this up if you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about what you could do now. You still want to get out of this dress, even if you were starting to get used to the softer feel of it, so finding someone to swap clothes with is your primary goal. Zelda was going to be here looking for a book to read, so you wandering around the library shouldn't draw any unwanted attention. You could use that to your advantage to see if you can find Peach in here again, or really anyone with better clothes than this. Alternatively, you do still want to get your old tunic back and the manual, so now that Peach is gone you could head back towards the gym and hope Zelda is still there. You don't think Peach's dress really suits Zelda, especially now that she'll be acting like you, but it'll certainly look better on her body than it would yours.</span></div></div>",

That way you could pick up the manual once you're in Zelda's life and it wouldn't still be with your old life.

The Hands had said you weren't allowed to switch into your Zero Suit mid battle like you did during the last tournament, but you could still use it if you entered the tournament twice, once as Power Suit Samus and once as Zero Suit Samus. You weren't going to miss the chance to beat some of the guys twice, so you had been training twice as hard to make sure you were just as power without the power suit as you were with it. On the way back to the room, you happened across a small package on the ground. Seeing nobody around who could have dropped it, you decide to take it with you back to your room to see if you can identify its owner by the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in your room, you open up the package at your desk to see what's inside. Luckily your roommate, Wii Fit Trainer, wasn't here to question what it was you were doing. Inside the package was a strange looking remote that didn't look like it for any sort of TV, and a manual explaining what the remote was. This remote was unlike any other technology you'd ever encountered before. Not only could it do seemingly impossible things like swapping people's heads, but it also had the capability to completely alter reality to make everyone except a few given people perceive the change as being normal, and believe nothing has happened. Even though you assumed this would work as the instructions told (whereas some other people would have to test it out themselves to believe it), you still wished to see it in action. Perhaps once you had gotten a feel for how it worked you could find out how it created such effects and perhaps weaponise it for your suit (and maybe find a few hidden features if there were any). Leaving your power suit in its charging station, you head out of your room looking for someone to swap with. Even though you wanted something interesting and different, you were pretty much willing to swap with anyone you came across. Turning into a hallway, you spot someone over at the other end, luckily with their back turned to you, making this a perfect opportunity for a swap. The person was...</span></div></div>",

For one thing, you could do a head swap with him to experience what it was like to be a guy, but also get the hilarity of seeing Link's head on your skin-tight suit clad body. However, that might also mean that Link ends up being the owner of your power suit (except for the helmet) and you wouldn't be able to figure out how to add some sort of feature like the remote's power to the suit. Still, you could just leave Link with your body until you wanted to make such a feature so you could continue to have a laugh at his expense until then. A relationship swap could also hold some interesting results. That way you wouldn't lose your power suit or any parts of your body, but you'd still get a very different experience.

Just as the remote had promised, she seemed to notice nothing different about her change in attire, and kept walking just as normal. Looking down at yourself, you felt a little ridiculous wearing her puffy, pink dress. You could feel everything about her outfit, from the large earrings dangling in your ears, to the high heeled shoes on your feet. Sure, you looked more normal wearing it than if someone like Link had found the remote and ended up switching with Peach, but it still wasn't something you'd wear normally. Of course, the circumstances right now were anything but normal, although you were the only one that knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you had gotten a taste of what this little baby could do, you wanted to find out how it did it. You could take it up to your room to try and take it apart to see inside of it, but you had a little decision to make first. Right now Peach was walking away with your zero suit, leaving you in her dress. The tournament was still a few months away, and you'd see Peach every day at breakfast and lunch, so there was really no rush to get your clothes and suit back. And yet, if you could swap back at any time, why not now and save you the trouble of trying to not feel embarrassed as you walked around in the most girly dress you'd ever seen. It actually was rather comfortable, but you were a little afraid of it ruining your tough image, even though you knew the remote had made it so that everyone thought it was normal for you to be a badass bounty hunter in a princess outfit.</span></div></div>",

Alternatively, a much safer form of experimentation given the situation would be to actually use the remote. After seeing what it could do you did want to see the other buttons in action as well. Peach was still within view, so you could still swap with her if you wanted, or you could go find someone else to swap with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, swapping all sorts of things would also make it complicated if you wanted to swap everything back to normal. You could just stick with Peach's dress for now. Supposedly the remote made everyone believe it was normal for you to wear Peach's clothes and vice versa, something you were inclined to believe thanks to Peach's lack of a reaction, so you always just see how much your life had been changed to adjust for your new attire, and your lack of any weapons or your Power Suit. You could try going to the gym to test out how well you could fight in the dress. Without any of your weapons, you'd probably need some new special moves, possibly some of Peach's old ones.</span></div></div>",

Checking the full-length mirror at the back of the door, you had to admit that you look and felt kind of cute. The dress was tailored to fit your body along with the rest of your outfit. Your hair was out of its normal ponytail and it's falling loose around your shoulders. You could see the crown on your head along with the large blue earrings in your ears. You also find makeup on your face. It actually look good on you and made your face look feminine. Speaking of makeup, you notice all of Peach's makeup supplies are around the sink, and out of instinct you started to touch up your makeup just like Peach might have. When you're done, blowing to the mirror a kiss while you're at it, you leave your room and head to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find the gym to be deserted, and you didn't run into anyone else on the way there so swapping is out of the question for the moment.

It could run the risk of accidentally breaking it and you don't know want to know what'll happen as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince no one was around you could easily just leave it on the bench near the sandbag.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pikachu puts his paw down on one of the buttons, and in an instant, your perspective shifts. Instead of sitting on a chair at your desk, you were now standing on the desk itself, however your line of sight was still closer to the ground than it had previously been, and one look at the person in front of you was enough to tell you why. Sitting in the chair in front of you sat your own body, but instead of your human face, Pikachu's head sat atop your neck. It was freaky, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika...\" Pikachu mumbled, holding his new human hands in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis prompted you to look down at yourself. You were greeted by the furry yellow body you had grown so used to having ride around on your should while you were here. You hold your paws up in amazement, wiggling the little fingers you now possessed. You try to look behind you at the tail you could feel sticking out of your body, only to almost hit yourself in the face with it, not being used to having an extra appendage to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" you say, feeling the fur that now covered your entire body, save for your head. The world looked so much larger from your perspective now. At this point, Pikachu had stood up and was looking around your room, marveling at his new size and dexterity. You try to get off the desk and follow him, to fall flat on your face, due to not being used to your new smaller limbs or rodent body. It certainly didn't help that Pikachu's body, while capable of walking on two legs, was much more suited for running around on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu noticed your fall, and rushed over to you, seemingly much more comfortable moving around with your body than you were with his. \"Pika pi?\" You assumed he was asking if you were okay after the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" you say. You'd suffered worse than that. Pikachu had an idea, however. He knelt down and extended an arm towards you, much like you had done to him many times before. Recognising the gesture, you decide to play along, walking on all fours and climbing up what had up until now been your own arm. Your climbing was a little more clumsy than Pikachu's, due to your inexperience with the body, but you eventually make it up to Pikachu's shoulder, resting next to his furry yellow head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure you had a good grip on his shoulder, Pikachu walked over in front of the mirror in your room, allowing you both to see the strange amalgamations of human and Pokemon you had become. Pikachu couldn't help but laugh, and you even joined in a little bit too. You looked like some sort of science experiment gone wrong, although luckily this should be easily reversible with just another press of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Pikachu had stopped laughing, you decided that while this had been fun, you wanted to get back to figuring out how the remote worked, something that would be rather difficult with Pikachu's small body. \"Pikachu,\" you say, making sure not to be too loud since you were right next to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu turns to look at you, before deciding it was a bit difficult to have a conversation with you sitting on his shoulder, despite you having done it with him many times before. Instead, Pikachu opted to sit down on your bed, pick you up off his shoulder, and place you down on his lap so he can see you clearly. It catches you off guard, and you have to fight the instinct to wriggle out of his grip and he picks you up. It serves as an unsettling reminder of how small you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting again, you say, \"Pikachu, this has been fun and all, but I kind of wanted to figure out how this remote worked.\" Pikachu nods silently, not wanting to interrupt you. \"But for that, I need my body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Pikachu's ears droop down, as a sad expression covers his face. \"Pika pika, pikachu,\" he asks. You really wished you could understand him right now, but if you had to guess, you'd assume he probably wanted to keep your body for a bit longer. You weren't sure how to feel about this. On one hand, you had wanted to get back to what you had originally planned to do with the remote, and Pikachu's body made you feel small and vulnerable. But on the other hand, you just couldn't resist Pikachu's sad little face, even when it was attached to your body. Maybe it'd be alright to keep his body for a bit, or play around with the remote some more. What's the worst that could happen?</span></div></div>",

Perhaps he couldn't tell what exactly it was you were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was trying to figuring out how exactly this remote does this sort of thing, when it should really be impossible. I was planning on...\" Your voice drifts off. It suddenly occurs to you that following through with your plan right now might not be the best idea. Even if you could find a way to take the remote apart safely, would it still work correctly once it was put back together? What if you broke it while you'd taken it apart? Then you'd be stuck with your head on Pikachu's body for the rest of your life. Were you willing to risk that?</span></div></div>",

Rather than sitting at your desk, you are actually sitting on top of it, your legs dangling off the edge. More importantly, though, you can feel the cool air of your room on your skin, and the wood of the desk pressing against your bare rear. Looking down at yourself, your eyes went wide as you realised you were no longer wearing your Zero Suit, not anything at all, for that matter. You quickly move your hands to cover up your private parts, face flushing red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at the chair where you were once sitting, you notice Pikachu has taken your place, and is now wearing your Zero Suit, resized to fit his little body. Had he done a clothes swap then? Something about that didn't seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, I didn't realise that this would leave you naked,\" Pikachu says, catching you off guard as he suddenly speaks perfect English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika,\" you mumble in reply, shocked by the words coming out of your mouth. You resist the urge to cover your mouth, as both of your hands are currently occupied. You had meant to ask how Pikachu was able to speak, but for some reason, that had come out instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess I can't really speak anymore now that you're me,\" Pikachu explains. Now it all makes sense. He must have done a life swap. Now you were Pikachu, despite looking like yourself, and as a Pikachu, you couldn't say anything except your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was a fun test to let Pikachu swap something with you, you felt a bit awkward being completely naked, even if no one would notice anything odd about it, and you weren't exactly fond of the idea of being treated like an animal. \"Pika pi, Pikachu,\" you say, gesturing between yourself and Pikachu as best you could without removing your hand from across your chest, trying to ask Pikachu to swap back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to swap back already?\" Pikachu asked, trying to clarify your meaning. You nodded, hoping Pikachu would understand why you didn't want to stay like this.</span></div></div>",

This all catches you rather off guard, so by the time you've stood up off the desk, Pikachu is already out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush out into the hallway, still self consciously covering your body, and frantically look both ways, hoping to spot the little yellow mouse who's life you were in. Unfortunately, it seemed Pikachu was too fast for you, as he had already disappeared from sight. You let out a sigh. This was definitely not how you'd intended things to go. You didn't want to be stuck in Pikachu's life, but there was nothing you could really do since Pikachu had the remote. You just hoped he wouldn't swap too much without you knowing about it. You could try to chase after him, but with no idea about where he'd gone, you'd just be running around aimlessly in the nude, not something you were keen on doing. Maybe you'd be better off waiting in your room until Pikachu eventually came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a click behind you. \"Pika?\" you mumble in confusion as you turn around. You gasp as you realise that that was the sound of your door closing. You quickly reach for the handle, hoping you can still get in, but alas, the door locked itself behind you, and being in your life, Pikachu is the one with the key. \"Piiii,\" you whine in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were somewhat at a loss for what to do. You had two real options. One was to wander aimlessly, hoping to find Pikachu and convince him to swap back, while the other was to wait in Pikachu's room instead of your own, and hope that he'd come find you once he got bored of being you. Neither seemed like a particularly appealing option, but that was all you had.</span></div></div>",

Your chest was completely flat, and you felt a strange pressure in your pants as something grew tight in your groin. You looked up at Pikachu, and noticed that there was now a small divot in his tail, making his tail look like it had a heart shape to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPika...\u201d said Pikachu in amazement as he turned around and looked at his tail. You weren\u2019t sure, but his voice sounded slightly higher than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you...\u201d You began, then clapped your hands over your mouth in shocked embarrassment. Your voice sounded so much deeper now. You were almost certain that Pikachu had swapped genders with you, but you still needed to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu was having a good giggle at your expense, clearly enjoying your surprise at your new male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat and spoke again. \u201cDid you use the gender swap button?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPika,\u201d Pikachu said with a nod once he stopped giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d you said. You stood up from the chair at your desk, and held an arm out to Pikachu. He climbed onto your shoulder, and you walked over to the mirror in your room to get a better look at your new male body. You seemed to be about five inches taller, meaning you were about six feet and eight inches tall. You also seemed to be slightly more muscular, though you were still quite slim. Your face was still the same general shape, though your nose and chin were now slightly more square, and the beauty mark on your chin was gone. As you\u2019d noticed earlier, your breasts were gone, and your Zero Suit was tight against your male body, showing off your muscles. There was also an obvious bulge between your legs that was only enhanced by the tightness of your Zero Suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished examining your own reflection, you quickly look over Pikachu. To your annoyance, the only visible sign of Pikachu gaining a female body was that his heart shaped tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is interesting,\u201d you said, and Pikachu nodded. You walked back over to your desk, and Pikachu jumped off your shoulder and onto the desk as you sat down and picked up the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to swap back, or stay like this?\u201d you asked Pikachu.</span></div></div>",

You saw Peach wearing your zero suit, which hung to her body, with your paralyser and a toad by her legs, <i>\"I guess that makes sense, it is her loyal subject.\"</i><br>\r\n\"Yes Peach,\" you replied, and looked down, and saw the shorter body of Zelda's clothed in more sensible purple dress and boots.<br>\r\n\"You just seemed to go into a day dream,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you smile, she seemed unaware of everything, as you run your hands though your hair, not finding anything of Zelda's, like her tiara, her earrings or her bands on her bangs. Instead finding a large amount of make-up, large blue earrings, and a small crown that all belong to peach, which you now noticed was absent from Peach's head, with your one hair band holding up her wavy hair in a pony tail, like she normally did when she was doing sport, \"Where do you think Zelda is?\" you asked, trying to change the topic.<br>\r\n\"She said she would Meet us, I don't know what taking her,\" Peach looked around for any signs of her friend.<br>\r\nStanding up, feeling strange in the softer boot when compared to your rocket heels or Varia suit boots, \"Let's go find her,\" you announced. <br>\r\nYou heard something simiar to fire ignition, as Peach used your heels to boost her of the chair and in front of you, \"Okay!\" she said, racing ahead of you, each foot step clanging against the floor, \"Wait For Me Princess!\" the toad yelled running after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take to long to find Zelda, she was on her way, \"Sorry,\" she apologized, \"I was on my way, when I saw Samus's room. I had to check why you were disappointed early.\" Zelda had what you expected. Underneath Peach's clothes, you could see your body frame, but on her head, she had less make up then your you, but more than Peach, the cylinder shaped earrings and her Tiara going around the crown of her head.<br>\r\nPeach and Zelda began to catch up, \"Excuse me,\" you said, getting their attentions, \"I've got to go somewhere but I'll be back in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you a bit then,\" Zelda said, as Peach waved as you walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped into a bathroom, \"Somehow I must have taken into the power from the remote. When I pierced the remote, did the screwdriver conduct the energy, directing it into me?\" You concluded while looking at your self in the mirror, looking like a mash of your friends.<br>\r\n\"So what were those buttons on the back then,\" you asked, putting a finger to your chin, and losing your self in thought, \"But first I should...</span></div></div>",

Lifting a gloved hand to the small crown on top of your head, then down past your face, which was covered in make-up, to your ear lobes, which were pierced with large blue, dangling orbs.<br>\r\nLooking down, Zelda's body which was under your head, covered in Zelda's own clothes. It was odd, but somehow, you kind of liked it.<br>\r\n\"These to belong to my close friends, I should undo the swaps,\" Samus said, and then she black out for a second. When she looked around, she was no longer in the bathroom, she was now in the corridor with Peach, who was still in your clothes, impatiently tapping her heavy rocket boot heel against the ground, \"What is taking Zelda so long,\" she huffed.<br>\r\n<i>\"The swap undid it's self as I asked it too. But it didn't say anything in the instruction about voice control, or an undo button. But it didn't say anything about the hidden buttons either, maybe the other buttons have functions too,</i> You thought. <i>\"I should undo the swap with Peach too,</i> you thought, noting how Peach now had her pink dress back. <i>\"So I can do the undo swap thing just by thinking, and seems to only do one at a time.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a grasp on each shoulder, before you were shaken, \"Sammy!\" You head a voice call. Shaking your head, it was Peach, \"Are you okay, you weren't responding to me.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you smiled awkwardly, \"I was rather deep in thought,\"<br>\r\nPeach made a little smirk, while raising a curious, nosy eye brow, \"What about?\" she asked leaning into you.<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" you lied.<br>\r\n\"Nothing you say. Your lying, bit a girl can't be expected to tell all her secret,\" she pouted, stepping a way, a lighter clacking noise can from her normal shoes.<br>\r\nLooking over your self, you see that you again, but that didn't feel right. It felt hollow, and unsatisfactory, and you had an urge to use this newly acquired power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are Zelda,\" Peach said with a short tempered tone. <br>\r\n\"Sorry I took so long. So what are we going to do?\" Zelda asked.<br>\r\n<i>\"I should go with them, I have been avoiding them, and leaving a lot today. But I have to conduct more research on the remote, and record by current knowledge. of it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, before we decide, Samus, what do you want to do?\" Zelda asks, taking into consideration your recent behaviour of coming and going.<br>\r\n\"I plan to come with you two. I feel like I've been letting you down by coming and going, so I'm going to stay with you two for a much bigger length of time,\" you replied.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Peach exclaimed in her cheery attitude, before placing a hand to her chin, to think, \"The gaming room. We haven't been there yet,\" Peach suggests.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with that,\" Zelda stated her opinion, and then turned to you.<br>\r\nYou smiled, \"Sounds great to me,\" and you wall made your way to the gaming room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a long way, so the walk was only a few minutes long, and to your disappointment, you didn't see anyone else to swap with. But that changed once you got into the gaming room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping in, you could see a large room, filled with a great number of games, with an even larger array of genres and forms. Looking around, there was quite a few of the other fighters here. <br>\r\nIn the centre of the room, was several tables. Three of which were in use. One was being used for a game poker, since the currency from  each world and time period was different, actual money wasn't used, instead chips were evenly distributed, meaning it wasn't as risky, but more fun and friendly. You could see Shulk and Reyn, Captain Falcon, Wario, and Falco.<br>\r\nCaptain Falcon had his arms crossed, and had put his cards on the table. You had played him before, this meant he has a good hand, otherwise, he would be looking at his hand, trying to evaluate the chance of winning.<br>\r\nWario was greedily pulling in his moustache. You couldn't tell what this mean, was it a bluff, a habit, was he confident? It was hard to tell.<br>\r\nFalco held his cards in front of his face, hiding the smirk visible to you at your angle.<br>\r\nReyn was growling, \"Reyn!\" Shulk shouted, \"You're suppose to secretive about this.\"<br>\r\n\"Not my fault I got such crumby cards,\" he complained.<br>\r\nShulk sighed, head in his palm, \"Don't tell them that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother table was the snooker table, only two people were there, given that it is a two person game. You saw Chrom waiting by the table, while Dunban was carefully aligning his aiming cue. After doing that, he slide the actual cue on top, and shoved it forward into the balls. <br>\r\n\"Nice hit. I'm surprised you can do all that, with just your left arm,\" Chrom said in a complimenting tone.<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Having spent a year using just my left arm, and fighting in many battles with just the one arm, I have grown used to it and found ways to make due.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother table near by was occupied, but unlike the poker table, being circular for the game, and the snooker table. It was small and square to play one of the many table top games available. Here, you could see, Robin and Olimar playing Chess. It was Robin's turn, as he was looking over the board, tapping a book on his lap, evaluating the next move, while Olimar was standing on the edge of his stool, worrying and anticipating his opponents next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in a further away part of the room, a game table football, was being played, by Pacman, and Mr. Game and Watch, who was moving much more fluently then he did before, and judging by Pacman's large and very expressive face, Mr. Game and Watch was giving a very good game, challenging and competitive enough to be fun, with out getting on each others nerves, something that the hands tried to encourage. This was been demonstrated by most people in the room, with one of two exceptions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking by the wall to your right was a row of arcade cabinets, being played by the Villager, Toon Link, who when he first saw it, was in awe, and ended up being late for the tournament, the same thing happened with Ness, who was also there playing. Bowser Jr. was also there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, there was only two other people in the room at the time, Greninja, and Wii Fit Trainer, who were playing twister in the large empty part of the room, the only thing there was a cupboard of a load of games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do?\" Peach asks, only to be replied to with a magical chime as Zelda disguised herself as Sheik, and in a lower voice, which she claimed was habit with the Sheik appearance, \"I'm going to join the twister game,\" prompting you and Peach to follow.<br>\r\n\"Mind if we join in?\" You asked.<br>\r\nWii fit trainer shook her head, \"No, we were just about to start,\" she said.<br>\r\nYou, Sheik, Fit, and Greninja were around the mat, while Peach manned the spinner.<br>\r\n\"Fit, Left hand, red dot,\" Peach said, and Fit easily did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple rounds later, \"I'm going to look around,: you said.<br>\r\n\"Okay see you soon,\" Peach waved, \"Greninja, Right foot, Green Dot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood against a wall, and looked at the other fighters around you, who were still the same as earlier, having either played again, or were still playing. \"What should I do, there is plenty of people here to use this power on,\" you saw, surveying the room, and it's users.<br>\r\nThen you started tapping a couple fingers to your own head, \"But what does it allow me to swap?\" you say, forgetting the buttons.<br>\r\n\"Body, clothes and head,\" you recite to your self, but then the rest just kind of flowed more naturally to you, \"Gender. Relationships. And lives.\"<br>\r\n\"So many choices,\" you start imaging the possibilities.<br>\r\n\"I haven't tried it yet, so why not a relationship swap. But who with?\" you asked your self spotting Shulk. You grin, \"Maybe I could swap our relationships with Shulk's group here,\" you think, then making swap map combination, knowing that the swap only works between you and the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany swaps later, \"There... That's done.\" You say, nothing much seemed to change, on the surface, the only change is the toad by Reyn's leg.<br>\r\n\"Hey. Sammy,\" you heard Peach shouting, you noted the change in tone, feeling more like the relationship between the two guys, but with bit of respect put in.<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"Yes, Peach?\" You replied, feeling more nature with this response.<br>\r\n\"You seemed to be a little spacey, are you all right?\" she asked, being as concerned for your well being as she normally is.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Yeah,\" You rub an eye, \"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then, if your sure,\" Zelda says, in her Sheik voice, before continuing their game, the three of them looked pretty twisted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping aside, you slump down into a chair, and started formulating swap patterns you could do.<br>\r\n\"So many choices,\" you sighed, \"Too much, if only I could swap everyone at once, without having to decide. Or coming up wit them, that way I would be able to react to them as an observer.\" To that thought you smiled, and laughed a little, \"Yeah, if I could Scramble everyone's traits.\"<br>\r\nWhen you opened your eyes, you gasped in shock. Over by the twister mat, in the ninja's clothes, was the imspression of the frog ninja, the clothes hugged tighter to his smaller, longer, frog like frame. Peach's dress laid flat against the black block that was Mr.game &amp; Watch's body.<br>\r\nThe Wii Fit trainer was Still wearing her Sports bra, and Yoga pant, but now she was wearing Reyn's body.<br>\r\nThis was getting very confusing, as you stood up, the whole room looked bigger, as your fat rippled. This feeling was an unfamiliar too you, and cycling though the people in the room, your pace turned pale.<br>\r\nLooking down, you saw the Zero suit being stretch out around your new obese frame.<br>\r\nLooking to the poker table, Wario was still greedily smirking with your face, and fiddling with the blonde hair trailing down his back.<br>\r\n\"Urgh,\" you grunted in the much bigger voice, disgusted to be in the body of the one person, aside from Mother brain and Ridley, who were also invited, you couldn't stand.<br>\r\nA flat circle rested on your shoulder, causing you to turn around, \"Samus,\" A concern flat voice said, \"You really don't look to well. Maybe you should some sleep, or talk to one of the medics,\" Peach recommended.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you grunt in the lower tone, casing you to cringe, <i>\"If only I could reset all this, and undo all the swaps.\"</i><br>\r\n\"Would you like me to walk you to your room?\" a voice you never expect to be so glad to hear. Turning to Peach, she was back to normal, in her own body, talking to you as one woman to another as an equal.<br>\r\nYou yawned, and stood up, the experience and sudden exhaustion caused your legs to quiver. And nodded.<br>\r\nPeach smiled happily, \"Okay, glad to see that your beginning to see reason.\"<br>\r\nShe called out to Zelda where you were going, before stepping out, pulling you by holding your hand, walking slowly and carefully to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was the same walk as early, but due to your state, it took longer, you never would have expected it, but you were thankful to have Peach there. Sure she was one of your closest friends, but at times she could be annoying, and the things she tried to get you too do, and you never expected her to be this dependable and helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at your room, Peach laid you down on your bed, closing the blind to keep out the late afternoon soon.<br>\r\n\"Do you need anything else?\" she asked, sitting at the end of the bed.<br>\r\nYou shook you head, \"Well, get some sleep. Don't be afraid to ask for help, everyone does at some point, even powerful people like you.\"<br>\r\nShe stood up, and as she walked out, \"Sweet dream,\" she smiled gently, turning out the light, and closing the door.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Peach,\" you whispered, tiredly.<br>\r\n\"Why am I so tired?\" you asked your self as you nodded off.</span></div></div>",

In the bed, Samus tossed and turned in her sleep, dreaming.<br>\r\n<i>In her dream:</i><br>\r\nSamus was on an orbiting space station, it was large, large enough to have all her friends with her.<br>\r\nShe was approach by Zelda and you, as a puppet to Samus's subconscious.

But in my dream, some swaps happened, but I can't remember them all.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you undo the swaps?\" She asks looking for a way out of her predicament.<br>\r\nPulling off the panel, \"This buttons have other functions, one can undo, and  one can reset the swaps.\"<br>\r\n\"Will you undo it?\" She asked hopefully.<br>\r\n\"I would, but then you would see the new thing as odd. If only I could make you aware of the changes,\" You replied.<br>\r\nZelda stared wide eye at you, \"Was another change, body swapping with Fit?\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"I guess aware is another function,\" you say, going and writing that down.<br>\r\n\"So I guess you can see at the swaps then?\" You ask her.<br>\r\nZelda put a finger to her chin, and thought about the people she knew, testing her two sets of memories.<br>\r\n\"Reset,\" You commanded.<br>\r\nZelda lost her train of thought as her clothes changed back, and did everyone else.<br>\r\n\"So what will happen next?\" Zelda asks you.<br>\r\nShaking your head, you confessed you don't know.<br>\r\n\"Well, Peach and Fit are looking for Dr. Mario, because of your sudden exhaustion earlier, it raised concern.\"<br>\r\n\"I think it was the swap power, a lot of swaps happened, the energy must have come from somewhere, I guess I was the source,\" You explained your theory.</span></div></div>",

You did the same, you could hear a light skipping, following that was a light patting, then a normal foot step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door, which was already open, opened further, as Peach attempted to sneak in, she tip toed around the room, holding up her dress with index finger and thumb, looking to her side as she avoided anything that would make any noise. As if trying not to wake me up.<br>\r\nShe was followed by Wii Fit trainer, she walked in normally, her index and middle finger on one side of face, her thumb on the other, while the last fingers were curled up. Peach tried to be friends with just about everyone everyone, this often worked, she had a cheery tone would often win others over, others would be won over eventually when they realized her charm, while others couldn't stand her. Fit was in the second category, at first, she could stand Peach but in the couple months she had been here, she grew to like Peach, but still found her hard to cope with at times. She seemed to know I was wake, and was irritated by Peach's unique obliviousness. <br>\r\nDr. Mario then entered normally. He then walked to my bed side, as Fit pinched Peach's chin, and turned her head towards me. Peach then hurried over to a nearby seat, as Fit then stood at the end of my bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Mario slowly made his way up to me, \"Wii Fit and Princess Peach expressed their concern for your health, would you tell me about it?\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"Well, I was up in the games room, I played a bit, but then stepped back, and soon I started to feel tired, and I couldn't think straight that well and struggled to walk properly.\" <br>\r\nHe hummed, \"Well, it sounds like sudden fatigue. Were you stress, are you eating right or over exerting yourself?\" He asked gently and slowly.<br>\r\nThinking back, the swaps were causing stress, but your training but you into a healthy daily regime, to make sure you were at the height of physical and mental health.<br>\r\nZelda subtly shot a look, telling you to keep it secret. <br>\r\n\"I've been eating healthy, and my exercise I do each day aren't physically detrimental.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you feel now,\" he says thinking over the information he has.<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling much better after a little sleep.\"<br>\r\nHe nods, \"Well, because I have a limited understanding of your chozo DNA you, I don't know your how to solve your problem. If you have anything more to tell me, see me, and hopefully we can make you better if this happens more often,\" he says taking his leave, as do Peach and Fit.<br>\r\n\"We'll be back in a bit,\" Peach says waving.<br>\r\nBefore she leaves, fit tells you to look after yourself better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the room, Zelda brought something to mind. <br>\r\n\"Do you want to tell them. Peach is our best friend, and Fit is a new friend and your room mate, it could be more helpful for her to know about this.\"<br>\r\nYou thought about it, then... </span></div></div>",

Luckily there was no one around, so there was no one to interrupt your thoughts. Your new clothes weren't too bad, but it felt very strange wearing them on your new body. Ike's body felt big and strong, but it was still very strange compared to your old one. Your head was filled with both your old memories as Samus, and your new memories as Link in this vastly altered reality. At least you weren't going into this world blind, but you would have preferred to be yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at the remote in your hand, which was still sparking a little. You had to try and fix this thing; there was no way you were going to sit idly by and just deal with this warped reality. But where would you even begin? All your hi-tech tools were back with your old life as Samus, Link didn't have anything like that. Maybe the Hands had some tools lying around you could use. Although, the remote still seemed to mainly be in one piece, aside from the hole your tool put through it. Perhaps it still worked. If it did, perhaps you could just fix reality by hand.

Thinking back, and racking your brains, you found that you were now living Fit's life, which made you wonder, how else had you changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you saw that one of the walls covered in a large mirror, which provided the chance you needed to get a good look at your new self. In the mirror was a strange sight. Your reflection depicted a bit of a humiliating mesh of your bros. as the hands put it.<br>\r\nYou were no longer in your zero suit, you were missing your paralyser and rocket boots. In there place was a red t-shirt with a blue \"1\" with white out lines, black shorts and blue shoes. \"Are these, the Villagers clothes?\"<br>\r\nAnother massive change, partially concerned by the clothes, was your new body. It was a body you could Identify more easily, it's long furry blue arms with black paws and a spike protrusion on the back,  the black canine like lower legs with thicker thighs than the lower half and your old ones with thicker coating of blue fur, sharing it's colours with your arm fur, and lifting up your T-shirt, you could see a bleach colour white fur covering your torso. \"And is this, Lucario's body.\"<br>\r\n\"Thankfully, there is one thing that I kept,\" you saw putting a paw to your face, which was still your, but lacking the hair band, causing it to fall down your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the floor was a little uncomfortable as your new legs and strange positioning to them, and started to think aloud. \"What should I do now?\" you ask your self, looking at the remote in your... paw, it was broken, and the buttons were no longer luminous. \"I could return to my room an try to fix it, but how with these,\" you say looking over your new appendages. \"I could get help, but no one would believe me. And who could I get, my relationships would have changed. But whose relationships have I got?\" you ask, thinking back to who you spend most time with. Thinking back, you saw the angel Pit serving you happily. <br>\r\n\"So I must have Wii fit trainers life, Villagers clothes, Lucario's body, my own head, and Palutena's relationships.

That alone indicated that you had at least swapped lives with one of them.<br>\r\nSearching through your memories, you found that while you still had your own, you also saw images of working together with Isabelle, the anthropomorphic dog that was also an Assist Trophy in this tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that you must have swapped lives with Villager. In a way this was comforting; although you technically had the life of a young boy, it was at least better than having the life of a robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to see what else had been swapped, you hurried over to the mirror in the room. As you looked at your reflection, you began to feel worried. As far as you could see, there wasn't anything left of yourself physically!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incredulous face staring back at you certainly wasn't yours. Not only was the spiky brown hair on your new head a far cry from your own long, blonde hair, but the face itself was distinctly that of a young boy; a face that you recognized as belonging to Pit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes you were currently wearing weren't yours either. You had a red baseball cap on your head, a blue and yellow striped t-shirt was covering your torso, your legs were clad in a pair of blue shorts, while your feet were tucked into a pair of white socks and red sneakers. You also noticed that you were carrying a yellow backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no doubt about it; these were Ness' clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now starting to freak out a little. So far, you had discovered that you had ended up with heads, lives and clothes of young boys! You hoped this pattern wouldn't continue, but had an odd feeling that it somehow would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new body also seemed familiar. You lifted up your new t-shirt to get a better look at the body you now had. You recognized that too, although it had been a while since you'd seen its owner; it belonged to Young Link!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that the remote had given you the body of a former fighter was somehow more worrying than the fact that you were now basically male; if the remote could even affect those who had been fighters in the past, and perhaps even the trophy characters, then getting everything back to normal would be next to impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to give it a try, though. It would be going against everything you believed in if you at least didn't try to set things right. You looked through your jumbled-up memories again, hoping that perhaps you had at least kept your own relationships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you saw images of relaxing alongside Bowser, whom you now somehow felt a familial feeling towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feelings of worry became something approaching panic as you fully realized how you had been mixed-up by the remote; with Villager's life, Pit's head, Young Link's body, Ness' clothes and Bowser Jr.'s relationships, you had in essence gone from being the woman Samus Aran, to being a young boy in every way!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to your training by the Chozo, you managed to calm yourself down quickly, but now that you knew how you had been changed, you were more aware of how different you felt.<br>\r\nThe most obvious changes were your new, shorter height and the small, but noticeable new 'addition' between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the reflection of your new face (formerly Pit's) blushing as you felt said 'addition' slighly pushing against your new shorts.<br>\r\nBeing a boy felt very different from what you were used to and you weren't quite sure that you liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the malfunctioning remote, you were now technically experiencing something that no other woman had before: being a young boy!<br>\r\nFrom a scientific standpoint, you could gain some valuable knowledge if you decided to examine this situation more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting Pit's face into a thoughtful expression, you began to think about the best course of action.

You were wearing your blue form-fitting Zero Suit, with your Paralyzer strapped to your hip and your Rocket Boots on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't look any different,\" you said slowly, turning to Fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFit giggled. \"You, um, you actually have my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you said, looking Fit up and down.

She has your body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, thinking. Rosalina had your body? So that meant that you had originally been a tall woman with blonde hair and dark blue eyes, instead of a woman with featureless white skin. Thanks to the remote, you honestly couldn't imagine yourself looking like anyone else, but you were thankful you were still a woman. At least, you thought you were still a woman. You remembered switching genders with Peach, then with Fit, so Fit had Peach's gender, Peach had your gender and you had Fit's gender. At least, you thought so. Did gender change with body swaps? You thought back to last night, when you'd given Fit Peach's gender. She'd become much more comfortable in the pink dress she always wore after you'd given her Peach's gender, and she still seemed to be acting as she was last night. You guessed that meant she still had Peach's gender, even if she had what was supposedly Rosalina's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't swap my gender around, did you?\" you asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, no, I wouldn't do something like that,\" said Fit. \"Don't worry, you're still a woman, and so is Rosalina. I'm still a woman, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did swap clothes with Peach,\" said Fit, giggling and blushing with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned again. That pink dress belonged to Peach? Even when she'd still had her original gender, Peach always wore a tank top and yoga pants. Then again, if Fit was telling the truth about the swaps she had performed, you had no way of knowing if that was how things always were or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"Is that everything?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's everything,\" Fit said, and you were certain she was telling the truth about the swaps she had performed..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and dragged a hand down your face as you mentally recapped the swaps so far. First, you had swapped genders with Peach, and later with Fit. If Fit was telling the truth, then after Fit had taken the remote, she'd first swapped bodies with you, then swapped bodies with Rosalina. After that, she'd swapped clothes with Peach. That meant that Peach had your gender and Fit's clothes, Fit had Rosalina's body and Peach's gender and clothes, Rosalina had your body and you had Fit's body and gender. This was an absolute mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still have the remote?\" you asked, feeling incredibly tired all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFit nodded, and pulled the remote out from the folds of her dress. \"I'm really sorry for taking the remote without asking you,\" she said. \"Do you... do you want it back?\"</span></div></div>",

You kind of wondered how that would actually work, having a robot's body but living the life of a human. Would you still need to eat and drink like a normal person? Would Mega Man still function as a robot despite having a human body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea was to try the clothes swap. This one was also a pretty straightforward function, exchanging any clothes the user and the target owned, adjusting it to fit the body of the wearer. However, Mega Man was a robot. He appeared to be wearing armour that was something like a simplified version of your own power armour, but it wasn't something he was wearing, it was a part of him. Would the remote count that as part of his clothes or part of his body? If the latter, would the remote simply leave her naked and give all her clothes to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth features would provide an interesting test of the remote's capabilities, but they weren't the only ones available. There were still four other swaps to choose from if you decided to not try either of these.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to test out exactly how the clothes swap would react to someone like Mega Man, you aimed the remote at him, and pressed the clothes swap button. You were admittedly a little anxious about doing this, knowing it could very easily leave you naked in public, even if reality would adapt to make it seem normal. As the swap suddenly took effect, it would seem your fears were well founded, as you felt a light breeze over your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mega Man, it wasn't difficult to tell why. Mega Man was still walking through the hallway, now with your Zero Suit stretched over his mechanical body, your jet boots fitted over his boot-like feet. It was rather odd to see him wearing clothes like that, considering his body already looked like it had armour on in some places. Regardless, Mega Man continued walking as if nothing had changed, confirming the reality altering aspects of the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at yourself, you confirmed your expectations. While Mega Man had received your clothes, he had also kept the armour-like parts of his body, and thus, had given you nothing in return. You were left completely naked, not a single article of clothing adorning your body. Even your hairtie had vanished, letting your hair fall loosely down your back. You shivered a little, having nothing to protect your body from the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pleased to see that the remote did in fact work as advertised, but you were more than a little embarrassed to be standing around naked in the hallway. Even if reality had adjusted to make it normal for you to wear no clothes, that didn't stop your from feeling rather self-conscious about having your body on display for all to see. It also didn't help that you were currently part of a tournament, and if the remote's manual was to be believed, this swap would have given Mega Man all your weapons. It would probably be best to swap back with Mega Man. This had really just been a test of the remote's capabilities, after all. Now that you'd seen the remote in action, you could just swap back and try to figure out how the remote actually worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAverting your attention from your own body, you look back up at where Mega Man was, hoping to swap back with him. Unfortunately, it seemed to had spent a little too long lost in thought, as Mega Man was nowhere to be seen. The hallway was empty, besides you. Mega Man must have left to go where he had been headed before you swapped with him, unknowingly taking your clothes with him. Where others might have panicked in this situation, you instead did you best to keep calm and think over your options. The tournament grounds weren't so large that you weren't able to navigate them, and Mega Man couldn't have gotten too far. It probably wouldn't be too difficult to find him, but if you headed off in the wrong direction, you'd be stuck wandering around naked for longer than necessary. On the other hand, the world considered this to be normal now, despite your embarrassment. Mega Man had your weapons, but you probably still had your tools, so you could still go back to your room and try to analyse how the remote actually worked, and then swap back with Mega Man the next time you saw him. If course, this would mean remaining naked until then, and the possibility of being stuck without clothes if you weren't careful during your examination and messed up something with the remote. Finally, you could use the remote again, but on someone else. Just because you didn't have clothes right now, that didn't mean you had to get your own clothes back immediately. You could find someone else to swap clothes with, and then decide whether to go searching for Mega Man or to examine the remote. Of course, this final option meant that the person you swapped with would wind up naked, and Mega Man would ultimately end up wearing that person's clothes. However, the world, save for yourself, would see it as normal, and the person left naked wouldn't be embarrassed about it like you currently were, so you didn't see that as such a big consequence.</span></div></div>",

As you lowered your foot, you managed to adjust to the data constantly streaming in, and were able to run a complete diagnostic on your body.

You'd love to go take this off and find something more comfortable to wear, but somehow you don't think Peach would appreciate that.

It seemed like you still had Peach's body, but you were now dressed like Palutena, the Goddess of Light, and holding her staff in one hand. Taking advantage of your confusion, Swapper quickly runs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get back here!\" You yell, almost tripping over Palutena's heels in an attempt to catch up with it again. You briefly wondered why Palutena hadn't had any verbal reaction to the swap. Peach had definitely reacted to the swap between the two of you, and both of you had been aware of that swap, regardless of which of you was holding onto that creature. Perhaps it had different settings, changing who was aware of the swaps of something. After all, no one seemed to think it odd that Peach was running around in Palutena's clothes right now. Although, you noticed you no longer had access to Peach's memories, and instead had Palutena's. So now everyone thought you were Palutena, even though you looked like Peach? It hurt your head just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you give chase, you also wonder how Peach and Palutena would be affected. If Palutena hadn't reacted to the swap, she probably thought she was Peach. But was she just Peach, or did she think she was you trapped in Peach's body? And Peach, she'd still think whoever was in her body was you. You can only imagine how strange it would be if Peach confronted Palutena, thinking she was you, only for Palutena to think she was really Peach and have no knowledge of the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak as he was, that little creature was pretty fast on it's feet, and not being entirely used to walking in high heels, even after walking around in Peach's shoes (quite literally) for a while, you were having difficulty keeping up.</span></div></div>",

But then I'd still be Peach instead of me, and I'd be dating my old body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf let's out a big sigh. \"Fine, suit yourself. I've shown you why keeping Peach's body might be good for you, but of you still don't want it, do what you want. I know I'd prefer you didn't swap back so I wouldn't have to deal with the real Peach. But of you want your body back so badly, the thing went that way,\" he says, pointing in the direction Zelda had headed. \"Do try to find it before.Zelda does and make sure she doesn't get her hands on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't leave to follow Zelda immediately. Ganondorf had.put forward some good points. Perhaps it really would be easier to get together with Peach while you were swapped with her.

This was all so surreal now that you weren't rushing to find the swapper. You guess you'd have to share a room with Ganondorf?

It was a concession you would have to make if you really were to keep Peach's life though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf opened the door, and motioned for you to move in. \"Ladies first,\" he said in Zelda's voice with a chuckle. The Princess of Hyrule seemed... unnerving with Ganondorf at the helm. For both of your sake, you hoped he'd at least pretend to be her when the time came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you eventually made your way into the large room. It was decorated mostly with purples, whites, and pinks. You could tell pretty easily which side of the room housed which princess. It all looked... rather comfortable. Silks, cloths, and cushions scattered all over in addition to a lot of space. Both princesses seemed to have sizable wardrobes and closets as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my,\" Ganondorf mused, \"much nicer than the little dungeon the hands gave me in my old body.\" He ran a hand through the soft curtains that hung around Zelda's bed before looking into a mirror. \"She's got quite the face as well...\" He put a hand to his hip and cocked his head to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to ignore Ganondorf's narration and narcissism and went about examining your new quarters in silence. While Peach had very nice and expensive looking items, she seemed to have packed relatively lightly. She had several dresses that were identical to the one you were wearing in all but color, some more casual attire that seemed fairly sporting, and a trunk full of tennis rackets, golf clubs, and the like, but otherwise didn't seem to be tied down by too much. You half expected to find Toad locked away in one of her drawers, but you suppose he'd just have a small room to himself with the other minor characters.

We have nothing to hide,\" Ganondorf says, a good deal more confidently than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Nothing at all?\" Samus says, getting up in your face. Her tone was no longer as playful, sensing that something was wrong. Having been friends with Peach since the second tournament, she could probably tell that you were acting differently to how Peach would usually act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to avoid her gaze, you say, \"I'm not hiding anything, I promise!\" She looks over at Ganondorf, who simply nods in agreement with what you had said. You almost think she believes you, when suddenly she takes a step back and pointers her Paralyser at you. Between your nerves at being discovered, and the fact that you were currently in Peach's life, Samus's sudden change in mood catches you off guard enough to make you let out a small scream. Even Ganondorf lets out a bit of a gasp in surprise. \"You- You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Samus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus's voice had turned cold and unforgiving. \"You're right, I wouldn't harm Peach unless we were against each other in a match. But you are not Peach. And you,\" she points the paralyser at Ganondorf, \"are not Zelda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- How did you...?\" Ganondorf asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach is terrible at keeping secrets,\" Samus replies a little smugly. \"If you were really Peach, you would have blurted out whatever you were hiding the moment I got up in your face. And the fact that you supported her and went along with it would mean that you were in on it too. So you should blame your little doppleganger friend here. Now who are you really!?\" Ganondorf seemed ready to fight back, while you looked like a deer caught in headlights, not sure how you could possibly fight Samus with Peach's frail body.</span></div></div>",

Could you find her a new body where she wouldn't bother us so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then that's,\" Samus says, realising what this thing was. Before she can finish her thought, the creature nods, just happy to be of use, and runs up to Samus and grabs her arm, catching her off guard.

She looks down at herself. \"What happened to me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you or Ganondorf can try to calm whoever was in Samus's body down and reason with them, you hear another shout from down the hallway. \"Get back here and change me back!\" All three of you look in the direction of the voice to see Swapper running towards you, being chased by an angry-looking Bowser Jr. in his clown car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...

You weren't entirely sure where she was going, but at least she was out of your hair for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now let's swap Junior back,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowser, your son won't be sent off to Samus's world until the end of the tournament. You'll have plenty of time to swap him back later when Samus won't be as much of a threat,\" Ganondorf reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're putting an awful lot of faith in that little creature.

The Hands scheduled them to help newcomers get used to the kind of fights that went on in the tournament. Since you were a newcomer, you were supposed to be there. And now you were late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach the stage, it seemed all the other newcomers were already there. At least, all the ones you knew about. There were all lined up in front of the ring that made up the main part of the stage, and you couldn't tell who the instructor was from the way the other newcomers were standing in front of him. At the very least, it seemed they hadn't started the actual training yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached, Swapper popped his head over the side of the Clown Car to try and see who was here, and what he could do with them. Now that he'd set his swap mode to 1, he figured it'd be fine to swap, since you'd be the only one who'd see it happening and Ganondorf couldn't get mad then. Since he remembered you saying how you'd wanted to keep Samus' body, or something to that effect, he specifically took interest in the female newcomers at the training session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swapper, get down,\" you said quietly, trying to get him to hide back down in your clown car again, \"We can't let people see you.\" Before you manage to get him down, Swapper grabs your arm, and takes aim at one of the other newcomers.

Instead he found himself holding something in his arms. He looked down to find a strange creature nestled into his chest. It was yellow and round, and had the resemblance to a star. He yipped when the creature moved in his arms and matched his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at him as he quickly released his arms from the star and grasp at his mouth. His voice was so high! Much like it had been when he had become Samus. In fact, looking down at his clothes, he realized that he was now wearing mostly blue, same again as Samus, but this time a dress and heels! And that the thing he had been holding in his arms was a Luma! The Swapper had swapped himself and Rosalina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser Jr was quick to look in the direction of her old body. She looked and saw a slumped over body in her old clown car, which had been hovering in place. She squinted and saw as best she could with this hair in her face, that the Swapper was also unresponsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luma was quick to dart into her field of vision, interrupting her investigation and began trying to communicate with her. Its began to point to the bodies she had left behind and gestured to themselves. Bowser Jr stared blankly at the creature suddenly acting out. It did this several times before Bowser Jr was able to understand what it was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry guys. I gotta go!\" Bowser Jr said in a very un-Rosalina like fashion before running off with Luma grasped in her hands. Boswer Jr ran out of the stage and down the hallway, trying to get in as much distance as possible before stopping around what looked to be a secluded corner. She then turned to Swapper who had made itself comfortable in her grip. Bowser Jr pulled Swapper into the air in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do dat for? Mr. Ganondorf said he doesn't want us caught!\" She stuck her finger into Swapper's face. Swapper's eyes softened and began to water a little at the sudden scolding. It tried to explain itself by pushing it arms in different directions, floating up and down, and doing twirls. Bowser Jr could only stare blankly ahead. She knew that the Luma was trying to tell her something, but she could even begin to piece it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand! Wh-!\" but before Bowser Jr could offer up response, another voice cut her off and began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey-a Rosalina! You and Luma having a fight?\" Bowser Jr quickly grabbed Swapper and shoved it behind her back before twirling in the air to see the newcomer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no! It was Luigi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"Bowser Jr hesitantly stammered out. This was a problem. Pops had told him about the dangers of being around Mario and what it could happen to him. He didn't mention it as much, but sometimes Luigi was talked about in the same way. Bowser Jr had to find a way out of this. \"Nope! Me and Swa...Luma were just...hanging out?\" she offered up. Luigi didn't say anything for a second and Bowser Jr though for sure she was caught. She was sure that Luigi was squinting at her, sizing her up, before he adopted a dopey grin and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then! As long as you guys are okay! See ya!\" he said waving off and then rounded another corner, out of sight as quickly as he came. Bowser Jr gave a weak little wave at the space he was standing in. Her grip on Swapper relaxed, and it was able to fly in front of her face. It began to gesture to Luigi and then back to her. Her eyes then widened in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I get it now! If me and you are Rosalina and Luma, no one will be suspicious as much!\" Swapper let out a little sigh before nodding its head in conformation. Bowser Jr jumped into the air with relief and joy, \"This is perfect! We need to go tell Pops and Mr. Ganondorf about this!\" she said. She grasped Swapper into a tight hug and flew off down the halls to find the two men turn princesses. </span></div></div>",

She flew as fast as she could, not only to be able to find her father, but also looking around in case she sees someone like Peach or Zelda. Surprisingly, she didn't see the either of them. She tried her best not to think about it and made her way through a few more arches before finally setting on an alcove on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the double doors, who she knew was now her father's and Mr Ganondorf's new room. She balanced Swapper in one hand and raise her other to knock, when she notice delicate feminine voice drifting out. She lowered her hand down and brought an ear up to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like this?\" She heard. That was Peach's voice, or her father's new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, now you are pressing too hard. You're going to break the stick. Here, give.\" And that was Zelda's/Mr Ganondorf's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Watch it! You're gonna mess up the rest of my makeup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already done that yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser Jr giggled to the sight he walked in to. Sitting at a vanity at the end of the room was Peach's body with Bowser inside. She had her eyes clenched shut and lips perked as Zelda's body with Ganondorf inside was gripping Bowser's face and applying lipstick on her. Bowser growled as Ganondorf removed her hand from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about now, huh? Good enough?\" Bowser said pouting, crossing her arms. Ganondorf rolled her eyes and gestured to the mirror behind her seat, \"See for yourself.\" She swung around in her chair. Looking back at Bowser in the mirror was a normal looking, albeit pouty Peach, who looked more adorable than threatening. This realization only caused Bowser to pout further, which only caused her to look more adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adverted her eyes from her face in embarrassment and saw what appeared to be Rosalina and Luma standing in their now open bedroom door. Bowser went wide-eyed and quick spun back around to directly look at them. Ganondorf also looked behind him to see what had Bowser so concerned about and went still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, Rosalina! Luma!\" Bowser was able to stammer out. \"This isn't what this looks like! Gan-Zelda was just showing me...\" she trailed off, any excuse coming up short of a real explanation. Ganondorf herself remained silent, and choose to watch Rosalina, trying to gauge her reaction and any move she would make. She didn't need to look hard as soon Bowser Jr and Swapper began to giggle again at her father's lack of composure.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Papa, its me.\" Bowser Jr says through her fits of laughter. Bowser gives out a small sigh of relief, but the embarrassment still remains. Ganondorf becomes more relaxed at learning about who she really is. She then walked over to the boy now cosmic princess, and was a little surprised to see the dramatic difference in height, as she had to look up to met her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junior, I thought we agreed that we wouldn't cause attention to ourselves? We need to keep this plan quiet if we want to get anywhere.\" Ganondorf said, slightly scolding the boy's actions. Bowser Jr only nodded in agreement before gesturing down to the Luma still in her arms. \"We were! But then I told Swapper how I missed Samus body, and how we need to not get caught, and then it saw Rosalina at practice...\" her list trailed off but Ganondorf was able to get the message. She was about to speak again before Bowser Jr cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! And then we ran into Luigi!\" she said suddenly. Quickly Bowser, who had forgotten his embarrassment, leaped off of his vanity and ran over to her son. It was quite comical to see the petite Princess Peach having to stare up at the towering princess. But this didn't deter him.  \"What?! Luigi?! What happened!? I told you not to go towards him!\" It was now Bowser who was scolding him, but Bowser Jr again nodded to agree, \"I didn't! He came towards me and started to talk to me and he thought I was Rosalina and didn't do much and then he left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Ganondorf said, bring a hand to her chin. Bowser glared at the Hylian princess with suspicion, seeing that look before, but now on Zelda's face. \"What are you scheming over there <i>Zelda</i>?\" she asked in a mixture of sarcasm and anger. Ganondorf looked up at her and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>Peach</i>, I think I just found a solution to our problem.\" Both Bowser and her son looked confused at his internal answer. Ganondorf began to pace the room between them. \"We both have secured Princess Zelda and Princess Peach's bodies and lives.\" She gestured to both herself and Bowser. Bowser took a seat at the vanity again for his speech. \"However, we still have problem's despite this accomplishment.\" She then pointed out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ridley has managed to do the same as we have, securing Samus Aran's body and life... but also managing to keep the real Samus from exposing him.\" Ganondorf then gestured back to them. \"We have not been as successful, and we have both yours and my previous bodies on the run, looking for help in stopping us, with no way for either of us to interact with them.\" She then began to stride over to Bowser Jr, who still stood in the middle of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, say the princesses were both to stumble upon a familiar face. Say, another princess? Friendly. Helpful. Mother of the stars?\" she asked to everyone in the room. No one else needed to say anything. Bowser and Bowser Jr looked on with realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGanondorf then crossed the room back to Bowser. She placed her hands on her shoulders and they both looked on at Bowser Jr. \"Assuming that becoming a Luma hasn't removed its swapping abilities?\" Bowser Jr looked down at Swapper who shook its body in response. \"No, it says it can still swap things.\" Ganondorf nodded, \"Good, then bring them both to our old quarters. Bowser and I will take care of the rest.\" Bowser Jr nodded her head and flew out of the room in search of her 'friends'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser looked up at Zelda's form who still had her hand on her shoulders, \"What are we going to do in our old rooms?\" She was silent at first, but then Bowser felt pain. Ganondorf was applying pressure down onto her. She looked down at her and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to be in distress...\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Swapper enjoyed the feeling of being carried through the air by Bowser Jr's new body. They both flew down hallways and corridors, looking for the two princesses turned villains. Bowser Jr wasn't sure on how much progress she was making as she couldn't find a trace of either the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly floated herself down on a passing bench, taking a rest from all the levitating she was doing. She allowed the Luma in her lap cuddle into her new body, and allowed herself to stare off into space. She knew that the two of them were looking around for the remote, but Bowser Jr had the remote falling asleep in her lap, so that didn't help much in locating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could use her new body to find out where they are? She knew that this body had magic, as she had been using it to float around subconsciously, and only just found out how to actually land. She shook her arm a little and felt a small stick in her sleeve. A little more shaking brought a thin wand out of it and into her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a few experimental flicks of the wrist and watched little lights and stars float out of it. They slowly danced in the air before fading as they hit the ground. Bowser Jr was surprised to see how easy it was to use magic in this body. She tried to give a bigger motion, waving her whole arm, and watched as the light and stars were bigger and actually shook the area. The Luma in her lap stirred a little by her magic, but kept itself asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser Jr was amazed by this new power of hers, and felt that this new body might be better than the Samus one she had once yearned for. Samus's body had been nice, but her new body was easily comparable. Same height, fit body, long blonde hair. But now she had not only her companion who could travel with her indiscreetly, but magic to boot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer comparison of her new life was interrupted by two heavy sets of footsteps making their way towards her. She placed her attention at the noises and turn down the hall where they were coming from to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was somewhere down here. I felt magic-...Rosalina!\" The body of Ganondorf said, with a look of joy and relief that didn't belong on his face. Trailing behind him, making their own set of heavy steps was Bowser's body, who held the face of sadness and confusion, but also looked relieved to see her. Not knowing that she wasn't the real Rosalina, Zelda and Peach approached her and Swapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosalina, I'm so glad we found you! Listen, I know how this looks, but neither of us are actually Bowser and Ganondorf!\" Zelda said frantically as the two of them both stood in front of you. Bowser Jr sat there silent, couldn't believing her luck, but also trying to figure out a way to emulate Rosalina. She let her hand drift over Swapper's sleeping star body, and slowly began to stroke it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Rosalina!\" Peach began, her giant claws clasped together in pleading, \"The real Bowser and Ganondorf stole our bodies! And our lives! We need to get them back! Please believe us!\" Both of them looked at the cosmic princess expectantly, hoping that she would believe them and help them to safety. Neither of them had any clue that Bowser Jr were not only not Rosalina, but the creature causing their troubles was asleep in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided this was the best possible time to start the plan her father and Mr Ganondorf had asked of her, and slowly nodded her head, \"No, it's okay...I, uh, believe you two...\" Bowser Jr was trying her best to sound like Rosalina. Hopefully they didn't catch on in time. \"I talked to, I guess, the real Bowser and Mr Ganondorf just now. They seemed, kinda weird?\" she 'explained' to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda seemed a little confused at Rosalina's strange behavior. Normally she wasn't this expressive or unsure of herself. But then again, the whole situation seemed less than normal, and he didn't think that she was fully able to handle it. He overlooked this inconsistent change, and was just relieved to hear that Rosalina believed the two of them. Peach also shared his ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Rosalina! You have no idea what we've been through! Everyone is treating us like criminals! Even Mario...\" he trailed off. He stopped his speech and frowned as his tears began to well up. Zelda walked over and gave him a small squeeze on the shoulder in comfort. Bowser Jr was a little unsettled by seeing her father's body act in such a way, or seeing Ganondorf being affectionate towards it. Luckily, Zelda took his confusion for Peach's story than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario acted in a particular way towards her. And seeing as she looks like Bowser...\" he left the rest up to Bowser Jr's imagination. She nodded only to appear like she understood and was on their side, but was internally laughing at her discomfort. How does Princess Peach feel to be treated like her father and herself! Take that prissy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But back to the problem. When you were talking to Bowser and Ganondorf, did they happen to mention a creature with them? Or where they were going? Anything suspicious?\" Zelda dug for answers. Bowser Jr knew that this was the perfect time to begin the next part of the plan. She nodded her head, and pointed in a direction down the hall. \"Yeah, they both said that they were heading to their-uh...your rooms?\" Too many bodies to remember and too many pronouns to get anything out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing Zelda nodded his head in understanding and gestured to his and Peach's bodies, \"I suppose they mean that they were going to their old bodies room.\" He cupped his face in his hand and thought to himself out loud, \"But what are they looking for in their quarters...? Maybe the creature? But we had already checked their rooms...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and grabbed Peach's hand. \"Rosalina, we need to stop those two before anything else happens. Can you help us?\" he asked, offering her his other hand. Bowser Jr was doing back flips in his mind. The plan was coming together so well. She let her small hand fall into the large gloved one that Zelda now owned and nodded. \"Of course. I'd be happy to help\" she offered an internally insincere smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda didn't seem to notice and pulled her up, with Bowser Jr moving Swapper under her arm to allow it to keep sleeping. Zelda took the helm as he marched them towards the direction of their current bodies room. Peach following him closely behind, looking timid in Bowser's large reptile body. Bowser Jr took up the rear, unknowingly leading them into a trap.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oddly enough, it seems to come natural to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus seems caught off guard by this. \"Oh, er, hi Peach,\" she says, a nervous smile on her face giving away the fact that she wasn't really Samus on the inside. Although right now you could care less about whether she was Samus or Pikachu; right now you only cared about getting yourself back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't have happened to have seen a little grey monster, about this tall, would you?\" you ask, making gestures to get your point across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

Samus didn't really like the idea of hurting her own body, but in this case it seemed necessary, espcially since Pikachu was still holding her up above the ground. Drawing on the electric energy stored in her cheeks, she let out a quick burst of electricity, enough to make Pikachu fall over and drop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pikachu gets up, he finds Samus slowly walking over to him, getting used to walking on all fours. <i>\"So,\"</i> she asks, <i>\"Ready to swap back yet?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Pikachu could no longer understand her words, he had a pretty good idea of what she was asking.

And was she really going to let Pikachu keep <i>her </i>body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus began to struggle in Pikachu's grip, and Pikachu responded by holding her even closer, shushing her and telling her everything would be \"Alright\". Everything would not be alright! This was <i>not </i>alright! And if Pikachu wasn't going to help her, she'd have to fix this on her own! Giving Pikachu a light shock, she jumped out of his hands and ran down the hall, heading in the direction she thought Peach was going in. \"<i>She was looking for a 'little grey monster', right? That must be the thing that did this to me... I'll make it fix me!

As a veteran of Smash Bros., you had seen your fair share of odd individuals as well as interacted with them. Hailing from a multitude of different worlds, the paticipants were many and varied, with strange and unique backgrounds and fighting styles. However, it was also the reason why you sometimes had difficulties making friends with newcomers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most recent additions had been particularly hard for you to become friends with; a young adult human boy who went by the name of 'Joker'. From what you could gather, he came from a world where certain individuals could harness the power of something called a 'Persona'; a kind of manifestation of someone's hidden inner strength, or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could certainly attest to his prowess; you were currently on your way back to the room which you presently shared with Mewtwo, having just been defeated by Joker in a match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. Even Mewtwo was more sociable than Joker was at the moment. Of course, as a veteran of previous tournaments, Mewtwo had had a lot of interactions with other Smashers, (yourself included), and while he could seem to be grumpy most of the time, he was certainly not unsociable. It was just tricky to find something to talk to him about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker, on the other hand, had not had many interactions with other fighters yet; not that surprising since he literally only joined the roster yesterday. He still seemed to be a little on edge with some of the other fighters; mostly the non-human ones. You strongly suspected this to be because of the fact that he was often fighting against bizarre creatures called Shadows back in his own world. Some of these Shadows could take the forms of knights, animals, mythical beings, ect. Since there were plenty of Smashers that fit those descriptions, you could understand why he might feel a bit uneasy here. If only there was some way to help him to understand the other fighters a little better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted when you felt one of your boots hitting something. It was some sort of package. With your curiosity being peaked, you decided to open it. The package contained an odd-looking remote and a piece of paper with instructions. As you read through the instructions, you were a bit dubious at first; a remote that could allow whoever was holding it to swap bodies, clothes, lives and other things with someone else, seemed to be completely ridiculous! Then again... You had seen Master Hand and his crazy brother making all kinds of weird stuff happen during the Smash Tournaments. A remote with such power wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your tail swish with anticipation as you realized what this meant. Perhaps you could use this remote to help Joker feel more at ease with everyone! The only question was how to best go about it...<br>\r\nYou thought hard about the options available. You could of course try to swap bodies between Joker and yourself, or with one of the non-human fighters, but you didn't think that this was a good idea. It might make things worse for him instead of better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could also try to swap yourself with one of the human Smashers and then approach Joker that way. Sure; you might feel weird if you decided to swap bodies with a human, but it might be the best way to make Joker feel completely home here.<br>\r\nAs you stood there in contemplation, it suddenly struck you that you didn't even know if the remote actually worked; it could still be a prank! And even if it wasn't, there was no guarantee that it could even reverse any possible swaps that was made with it! You certainly didn't want to swap Joker with someone, if you were unable to swap him back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no choice; you had to test the remote with yourself to see if it was reliable enough. You just had to find someone else to swap with. You didn't have to speculate about whom you should test it with, as your keen ears picked up approaching footsteps coming down the corridor. You decided to make the test-swap with whoever it was. The footsteps got gradually closer and closer before making it around the corner and you saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

You had just gotten done flying around the tournament grounds, and you were tired and ready to relax. Well, not exactly flying, but the Hands' power did let you use a limited version of the Power of Flight without Palutena's assistance, so you were using that. You were on your way to the leisure room when you bump your foot on something. Picking it up, you find it's a package with a remote and instruction manual inside. You have no idea what it is, or who could have left it here, but since no one seems to be around to pick it up, you take it with you to the leisure room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you get there, you flop onto the couch, exhausted. Flying was a lot of fun, but also a lot of hard work. Since no one was around to question what you were doing, you decide to go through the manual to see what the remote is for. To your surprise, the remote is not for a TV or something like that, but for switching around aspects of reality between a given target an the person using the remote. This really intrigued you, especially the part about altering reality so that nobody notices the change, or just accepts that it's normal. Would it even work on Viridi and Palutena? Could the power of this remote even defy the gods? You really needed to test this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour energy seemed to have miraculously returned. You throw the box in the bin and race over to your room to put the manual away somewhere safe, all the while formulating a plan. You'd swap something with the first person you came across. Swap something so obvious, so ridiculous, that it would be impossible for Lady Palutena to not see and not laugh at you for. Then you'd go find her and see if your changes would get any reaction out of her. If she didn't have a laugh about your head on someone else's body or you wearing an outfit that looked ridiculous on you, you'd know for sure the power of this remote. Of course, you'll have the remote set to swap mode one. You wanted to test out it's mind altering capabilities, not freak people out with the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back out into the hallway and slow your pace. The remote might make the swaps seem normal, but they might still question why you're pointing a remote at them out of the blue. Doing your best to stay quiet even with all the excitement, you look for someone and try to make sure they don't see you so you can do the swapping.

Plus there were certain other advantages to having a body like that. Maybe her powers would even come with it. Although if you really wanted her powers, you could go for a life swap. That way even if she could see through the changes, she wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Although maybe if you gained her powers, she wouldn't have the power to see through the swap, and you'd have to go see Viridi in the living quarters for assist and background characters to test it. No doubt Viridi would laugh until she cried if she saw you dressed up like Palutena. She was actually pretty nice once she got over the whole \"kill all the humans\" thing. Of course, these were just two of the six options you had available to you, and the other options would probably be just as good. You end up deciding to go with...</span></div></div>",

You can still feel your laurel on your head and your short hair, but looking down revealed that you had Palutena's godly body beneath your neck. It felt very different to your old body, a feeling you were interested in exploring, but now that you knew the remote would actually swap swap things, you had to know whether the reality altering would even make the gods think that this was normal. Luckily since you had left your body around the corner, Palutena spotted you and walked over. You did your best not to laugh at how she looked. Her hair was dragging on the ground because your body was shorter than her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pit. Have you been training?\" she asks. She probably assumed you were slacking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you replied, putting your hands on your hips. \"In fact I just got back from a training session.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" The sarcasm is thick in her voice. \"Well unlike you, I've got to get to training with the other newcomers. I'll see you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to walk away in the direction she was headed before you look her body. \"See ya.\" If Palutena could really see what happened, she would have been mad, or at least laughed at the sight of your head on her body. Palutena didn't act any different than usual, so now you know for sure you can play around with the remote as much as you liked without anyone being the wiser, not even gods. Before Palutena is out of sight, however, you consider whether you should get your own body back. You were definitely interested in the different feelings you were getting from Palutena's body, even without her powers, but you weren't sure you liked the feeling of not having wings. That said, you could use a limited version of the power of flight while on the tournament grounds, and when Palutena used the power of flight for her attacks, she grew a pair of wings, so maybe you could do that.

Considering what you could do now as Palutena leaves your view., you decide that you want to get a better look at how you actually look with your head on Palutena's body. You turn around and head back the way you had come, heading to your room. You notice that your hips sway back and forth as you walk, which for some reason brings a smile to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to your room, before you can even check the mirror, you notice some of Palutena's clothes lying around in places where your old clothes had been. You suppose that since you took Palutena's body below her neck, you got all the clothes and such that came with it. You lean Palutena's staff against the wall where you usually put your bow, and leave the remote on your bed, and head to the bathroom so you can look at yourself in the full length mirror that was on the back of the door. As soon as you see yourself, you burst out laughing. Your head looks utterly ridiculous attached to Palutena's body. You make a few silly poses, which only makes you laugh even harder. As you start to calm down, your attention starts to be drawn away from your head and to the body below it. You run your hands down your body, feeling every curve, and giving yourself a little pat of the butt. You give your breasts a little squeeze, and can't contain yourself. \"Ooooohhhhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to think about whether or not you should really be doing this. You were still very loyal to Lady Palutena, and this was her body you were playing around with. \"Well, it's my body for now,\" you say, sounding like you're trying to convince yourself. \"I can do what I like with it.\" Your roommate, Fox, should be busy with other around this time of day and wouldn't be back until later. You can use the time to explore and experiment with this body a bit more. Perhaps without the clothes. Then again, the remote was still sitting on your bed, you could go an experiment with that instead.</span></div></div>",

You scoff at his actions and think why he would be so...so....you stop, realizing that you are judging him like Palutena usually does when peering down to look upon the mortals, you even notice you're radiating her heavenly glow that circles her during her judging making him look extremely intimidating....you need to find Pit...wait, damnit Palutena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rush out of the room hoping she isn't too far away so you could quit feeling so conflicted, you look around the surrounding area in hope of that but unfortunately don't find her. \"Ugh, why am I so fast when I want to go somewhere!

Luckily you spot one of your friends, Falco, talking with the Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu about recoveries, it seemed pretty heated: \"look all I'm saying is you really shouldn't spam your recovery, eh? What do mean I do the same thing!\" You didn't want to hear the rest of the conversation so you cleared your throat (hang on, do goddesses even need to clear their throats?) to alert them of your presence, They stop arguing and turn to face you with Falco looking at you strangely, \"uh do I know you?\" he said scratching his head. \"Well to my knowledge, no, but I'm one of the newcomers Palutena, you may know me from my servant Pit?\" You say with Palutena's feminine and beautiful voice, Falco's eyes grow wide in realization, \"oh yeah! Hey sparky, look its the girl Pit keeps talking about!\" Falco turns to Pikachu and points towards you like, \"get a load of this guy\". Pikachu merely waves and smiles (actually I think that's all Pok\u00e9mon can do to communicate without saying there name) and motions to Falco to continue the conversation, \"oh yeah, sorry. So, uh, whaddya need Palutena?\" Falco asks with his trademark sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm actually looking for Pit right now and I was hoping you could tell me where he is right now, if you could I would be very thankful\" you answer while they both look around to check the coast, \"thankful eh? alright I'll help you find ol' wingboy on one condition\" Falco answers holding up one feather to drill in the point. \"You meet me at the smash park tonight so we can get to know each other better, we can get better acquainted for the tournament I mean\" You were now aware that he was scanning your body (\"PALUTENAS BODY FOR THE LAST TIME\" you think to yourself) and apparently he was liking what he was seeing. Now you knew you weren't exactly the sharpest arrow in the quiver, but you knew what Falco meant to do with him, you meant Lady Palutena, that night and were half tempted to smite him now for even bringing that up, but you knew that Lady Palutena would soon be kicked out of the tournament for smiting another smasher. \"What if I refuse this...offer?\" You asked curiously and straring daggers at the anthropomorphized flacon, you were left in shock as Flaco shrugs and says \"eh, nothing off my back, you can just leave right now and I'm sure you'll find him eventually.

This was Palutena's everything, and you had stolen it for your own selfish purposes, it was your duty to return it...or at least it was your duty, you felt anger at your indecisiveness, you could eadily just walk away with Palutena's life, not even she knew what she had lost.

You try to run down the hallway where Palutena had left, only to almost trip and fall thanks to Palutena's high heels. Walking as fast as you could without tripping, which wasn't very fast, you make your way down the hallway to try and catch up with Palutena, but as you came to a crossroads in the hallways, there was no sign of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a big sigh. For the time being, you were stuck as this strange amalgamation of Pit and Palutena. Palutena didn't have it much better than you did, but at least she was unaware of the changes so she wasn't bothered by them. You, on the other hand, felt very strange. Sure, you didn't have a female body below the neck anymore, you could still feel the changes. You could feel the weight of Palutena's long, green hair pulling down on your head, weaving its way around your wings, and resting on the floor. You could feel Palutena's dress clinging tightly to your body, somehow holding itself up despite your male body. You could feel the heaviness of all the armor and gold trinkets Palutena wore, and the staff and shield you held. You could feel your balance getting unsteady, as you wobbled on Palutena's heels. You tried moving your wings, only for your hair to get in the way and make things difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to do something about this,\" you think out loud. But what could be done? You could go over to the newcomer training session; that's where Palutena had been heading before you lost sight of her. Maybe you'd be able to find her there. Then again, you were pretty sure veterans not in charge of the session were only allow to spectate from the stands. Your aim would have to be pretty good to swap with Palutena from up there, and if you swapped heads with her, it'd cause some confusion as to why you were in the session, so you'd only really be able to reverse the body swap. Still it was probably better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were a little worried about the possibility of someone seeing you like this. Sure, they wouldn't see it as anything out of the ordinary, but you'd prefer to avoid having to talk to people while you looked like this. You also didn't want to risk being dragged off somewhere else while trying to swap back, or accidentally swapping with someone else. Then again, you didn't see much of a choice, so slowly and unsteadily, you head towards the stadium in which the training session was taking place.</span></div></div>",

Either way, you now found yourself across the hallway where Palutena had been, just like you would have if you'd performed a headswap. However, you still had Palutena's body below your neck. On top of that, your laurel and Palutena's dress had now been replaced with Palutena's tiara and makeup and your own tunic, which provided little to no support for your female parts. A quick look through your memories confirms what you had suspected had happened; you had somehow swapped lives with Palutena instead of heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the mismatch of body parts, clothing, and having two sets of memories in your head, you had been turned into a strange jumble of Pit and Palutena. \"Wow, I really messed up big,\" you say to yourself. You turn back to where you had been standing previously, hoping to undo the swaps and fix this, but are shocked to see that Palutena was nowhere to be seen. You run over to where you had been standing, the bouncing of your chest making you somewhat uncomfortable, and look around, but there was no sign of Palutena, or where she had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad, this is really bad,\" you mumble as you pace back and forth. \"What do I do now?\" You really wanted to swap back, but to do that you'd need to find Palutena first. The big problem, though, was that right now, Palutena was supposed to be at the newcomer training session. Not going could get Palutena in trouble, and if the Hands thought a newcomer wasn't performing to a certain standard, they could be kicked out of the tournament. If you got Palutena removed from the tournament while trying to find her (currently occupying your old life), you'd be sent back to Skyworld in her place, and you'd be stuck as this Pit-Palutena abomination until the tournament was over. Could you really go to the training session in her place, though? Sure, you had attended similar training sessions during the last tournament, and because of the swaps, you'd still have your own weapons, but you weren't used to Palutena's powers or her body. Although perhaps the remote could do something to you help you out there.</span></div></div>",

Would you be stuck like this forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point you noticed what button your finger was on. Your finger and been down a bit from where you had thought it was, so instead of performing a head swap, you had performed a relationship swap instead. Strangely enough, this meant that despite Palutena still being a goddess, and you still being an angel, Palutena would now be serving you. Or, maybe she was just loyal to you while you still did the missions? The manual hadn't really been clear about how much would be swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now you knew why the swap hadn't worked, and you could correct it. Or at least you could have if Palutena was still there. \"What!? Where'd she go?\" You run down the hallway, stumbling as you weren't used to your new center of gravity or wearing high heels, hoping to find where Palutena had gone. Unfortunately, during your freakout over the remote possibly not working anymore, Palutena, blissfully unaware of what was going on, had left, leaving you stuck with her body and her relationships until you found her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best not not freak out again and try to think calmly about this. Palutena had been going to one of the newcomer training sessions, so she would likely be heading over there. However, after swapping with her, you had her staff and her shield, so she had probably gained your weapons. You didn't have your bow with you when you swapped with her, so maybe she'd gone back to her room to get it first. Even if she wasn't at her room, you probably still had enough time to check if she was there, and then make it to the newcomer training session before it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can do this Pit,\" you say to yourself, taking a deep breath. \"Time to go get your body back.\" Walking as quickly as you could without tripping, you head towards Palutena's room to see if she's there.</span></div></div>",

In one hand you were holding the remote, but in your other, you were holding Palutena's staff. Looking down at yourself, you blush out of embarrassment to find that you are wearing Palutena's clothes. Her dress, her heeled sandals, her armor, it was all there. The manual had said this would happen, but in the excitement of the moment you hadn't really thought about that. You move around a little, feeling the dress swishing around your legs. It was an odd experience, but you figured you might as well keep it for now. You wanted to be the one in charge, and a goddess need a fancy dress... or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't heard any screaming or anything, but you still wanted to see with your own eyes if Palutena was unaware of the swap. You walk over to the corner you had been peeking around, finding it slightly amusing that you were now walking flawlessly in Palutena's heels, and take a look around the corner. Walking down the hallway in the opposite direction was Palutena, dressed in your clothes, and seemingly finding nothing wrong with this situation. If she still thought she was herself, she'd probably be heading to that newcomer training session that was apparently going on, but she seemed to be headed in the other direction. She really thought she was you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you didn't think this could really be considered a true test of whether the gods were immune to the mind altering effects, since you had stripped her of her god status when you stole her life. That said, you wanted to keep her life for a while, so you wouldn't be swapping back just for the sake of figuring it out. As long as Palutena was in your life, it didn't really matter if she could notice or not. Now that you had her life, and any bonuses that came with it, you needed to decide what to do next. You had thought about the newcomer training session before, and it might be nice to try out your new powers on the battlefield. On the other hand, you were still curious as to whether gods could notice the swap, and Viridi would get a kick out of seeing you dressed as Palutena.

You begin to head over to her room, still finding it somewhat amusing that you were walking around dressed as Palutena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her room, you knock on her door.

I'll swap with one of them, and then my old life will probably leave to go back to my room. Then, you can rush past like you're late for the training session, and I can quickly slip you the remote then. And then, you just swap with the other princess and they run off in Palutena's life to the training session. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it'll work.

You waved back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at where the pair of princesses were standing, you saw that Peach was unchanged, but she was now talking to Vidiri, who was wearing Zelda's clothes and had her hair down. She seemed to be doing her best to keep up the conversation until you came. You had a feeling she was going to take Zelda's life. She had been laughing about you being in Palutena's life, so of course she'd leave the much girlier life of Princess Peach for you. You begin to quickly walk towards the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\", you say as you near them. \"Coming through.\" Peach takes a step back for you to pass, and Viridi quickly passes you the remote as you walk past.

As the two of you walk, you can't help but think back on the events of today. This morning you had woken up as Pit, and so it would have stayed until you found that remote. Since finding it, you had become Palutena, in turn turning her into you. Then you discovered those secret buttons, making you and Viridi able to see every swap that occurred, even if you weren't holding the remote. Now, you were Princess Peach and Viridi was Princess Zelda. Peach was Palutena, Palutena was you, and Zelda was Viridi. It was crazy to think about how you had somewhat messed up reality in such as small space of time, jumping from life to life. And now you were going to mess it up a little more. Although it did make you think about how you were going to straighten this all out, if you were going to at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you ask, \"How long are we going to keep these lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we only got these lives so we could have a bit more freedom to roam around; there are plenty of other lives with the same freedom. Even my old life has that. And what about when the tournament ends? Are we going to try and get everything back to normal, or are we just going to leave everything as is, and maybe not even go back to our own world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViridi thinks silently for a bit, still walking around looking for Link or Mario. \"I dunno,\" she finally answers. \"I guess we'll figure out what we want to do when the time comes. If we find a life we like better than these, we can take it then. And when it's time to leave, we can just see who we want to be and swap before we have to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Sounds good.\" Just swapping whenever you wanted, it seemed like an interesting life. Or really, lives, since you didn't need to stick to one life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Viridi snaps you out of your thoughts. It seems she's spotted one of your boyfriends.

You found it to be a somewhat odd name, considering they were working together, and not one hunting the other, but that's what the Hands insisted they were called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they only arrived recently, so they're excused from today's training session,\" you explained, \"You're not really thinking of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's two of them,\" Viridi interrupted, \"And we won't draw any attention if everyone just thinks we're a dog and a duck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we life swap with them we'll be naked, and we probably won't be able to speak properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? We can worry about the clothing problem later. We have a clothes swap function we can use. And as for the talking, look at them.\" She points to the duo again. The duck seems to be quacking at the dog, who nods and barks something in reply. \"We can't understand them, but they can understand each other, so we should have no problem once we take their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, alright. If you say so.\" You still weren't sure about this, but Viridi seemed to think it was a good idea, and it was only a matter of time before someone came looking for one of you and then the plan would be ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so here's what we'll do. I'll swap with one of them, then when the one in my life leaves, you rush past like you're in a hurry to get to the training session.

Once it's no longer paying attention to you, you turn back to the duo, thoroughly weirded out by seeing a duck act like it was one of your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hallway, the dog was still conversing with its companion, but its companion was now a naked Viridi, sitting on his back.

The dog pays no attention to you, but Viridi quickly tosses you the remote, and you turn and life swap with the dog.

You couldn't help but blush at the situation. At the very least, Viridi wasn't very heavy right now, so you had no problem holding her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViridi leans her head over your shoulder to talk to you.

Not trusting yourself to speak, you just nod. \"[Well okay then, let's go find someone to swap clothes with.]\" Since Viridi was now the duck that always rode around on the dog's back, it was up to you to take the two of your somewhere to find someone to swap with.

You peek around the corner, aim the remote at Palutena, and press the gender swap button. With no flashy lights or sounds, everything changed. Palutena was no longer the Goddess of Light, but rather the God of Light. You were viewing her from a distance, and from behind, but she seemed taller, and a little more muscular. Her hair was shorter, and sort of spiky like yours used to be, although it was still green. Her clothing had changed as well, becoming more like a tunic rather than a dress, although it was still adorned with a lot of the gold trinkets she had previously possessed. Her sandals had also lost their heels, becoming simpler and more practical. She still had her staff and shield with her, and was continuing on towards the newcomer training session as if nothing was wrong. Palutena was unaware of the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" you whisper excitedly, but noticing that the voice coming from your mouth was undoubtedly a female one. Just as Palutena had becoming male, you had become female. Looking down, you were greeted by two mounds of flesh pushing out from under your tunic, although your tunic had also adjusted itself to your new gender, becoming longer and more like a dress, while still being practical enough for your missions. Your new breasts weren't as large as Palutena's used to be, by they still looked pretty big from your point of view. Your arms and legs had become more slender and feminine, and your nails had been neatly manicured. Your hair was no longer spiked up, and now ran down your back, stopping just between your wings. The strangest part, though, aside from the breasts hanging from your chest, was the emptiness you were feeling between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it works,\" you mutter to yourself, not sure you like how your new voice sounds. This all felt very foreign. It was like you were you, but at the same time you weren't you. Stranger still were your memories. Along with your original memories, you had gained a second set of memories where you had always been female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting a little too weird for you. You peek around the corner again, looking for Palutena so that you could swap back.</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, it could be interesting to see what being a robot feels like, but you still need something that Paluetna will notice in an instant. You could kill two birds with one stone by doing a head swap, so Palutena would recognise your face and you'd still get to have a robot body.

Regardless of how you had become friends, you were friends now, but that didn't mean you'd be going back on your plan to find someone else to swap with. In fact, Peach made the perfect candidate for swapping because swaps with would certainly end up being obvious and ridiculous. You could always borrow her dress for a while with a clothes swap.

You didn't really want to mess up Peach too badly, and you weren't sure you wanted to lose your wings yet. A clothes swap should get the desired reaction from Palutena anyway. In an instant, the swap is done. No lightshow or fanfare, it just happens. Peach is now walking down the hallway dressed in your tunic. She even has your sandals on her feet and your laurel on her head. It was amazing to see the change happen so instantly, and Peach treating her now outfit as if it was completely normal and she had been wearing it her whole life. It actually didn't look to bad on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, however, you probably looked as ridiculous as you had hoped for. Just as Peach had received all your clothing in the swap, you had received all of her's. From the pink dress and heels, to the crown and large earrings, to the white gloves and silky underwear you could feel under the dress, it was certainly a very different experience to what you were used to wearing. You could even feel what you assumed to be makeup on your face. Looking at your back, you find that the dress has not only adjusted to fit your smaller male body, but it has also adjusted to allow your wings to come out the back. You let Peach go about her business, and go off to go find Palutena. Whereas you would have been running to find her before, somehow you knew exactly how fast you could walk in your new heels without hurting yourself or tripping. Not being able to walk in heels was the main issue you saw with taking Peach's clothes, but now that the remote had helped you out there you saw no real downside to keeping Peach's clothes for an indefinite period of time. Maybe you'd even keep it after the tournament when you went back to your own world, it was certainly comfortable enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of walking around looking for Palutena, all the excitement from the remote starts to wear off and your exhaustion from your earlier flying starts to come back, and the heels certainly aren't helping. You figure there was no real rush, you'd see Palutena in a few hours at dinner time anyway, and if she could see through the changes, she'd come see you if she saw Peach. The thought of going back to your room to rest for a bit is looking very good right now. But you do still want to know the extent of the remote's powers of deception. You don't want to go making a complete mess of yourself with swaps only to have Palutena know about the swaps and scold you for messing everyone up. You end up deciding to...</span></div></div>",

Opening the door, you are glad to see your roommate, Fox, wasn't here. That'd let you explore the changes without him asking what you were doing. The first change you notice as soon as you walk into the room is that your bow that had been sitting in the corner of the room has been replaced with Peach's parasol. You figure that means you're going to be fighting in close range in the tournament then. A pair of your tights that had been sitting on top of the washing pile were now a pair of pink panties. Your other weapons on the shelf had been replaced with Peach's frying pan and golf club. Peeking inside you wardrobe, you notice that all of your clothes, not just the ones you had been wearing, had been replaced with Peach's. You even have the palette swaps of her dress replacing your palette swap clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go inside the bathroom to check the full length mirror, but the first thing you notice in there is the variety of makeup littered around the sink. You suppose that's yours now, and if your experience with the heels is anything to go by, you should know how to apply it. Ignore that for now, you close the door so you can see the full length mirror on the back of it. Just as you would have assumed from looking down at yourself, you are wearing Princess Peach's complete outfit. You hadn't noticed when looking down at yourself, but the bra actually created two small bumps on your chest. If your hair had been longer, you would have sworn the person you were looking at in the mirror was a girl. The outfit would probably have worked better if you had blonde hair like Peach, but you weren't planning on dying it any time soon. Since you had still been wearing the heels, you kick them off and lie down on your bed. You had originally just planned to borrow Peach's clothes to test out if Palutena could see the swaps, but now you weren't sure you wanted to give them back.</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to go around swapping with people at the moment and you weren't interested in working out at the gym because while you liked the dress and all, you weren't sure if you wanted to wear it all day especially with the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decided to go take a look at your wardrobe to see if there's anything more practical you could wear. Among st the outfits in the wardrobe you find several dresses identical to the one you're currently wearing, only colored differently - fairly standard among st contestants. You find several garments for sports - all pink. Your favorite color wasn't pink but you had to make do with what you had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the latter outfits, you find a leotard, a short tennis dress, a t-shirt and athletic shorts, and a few go-karting outfits. You decided to wear the t-shirt and shorts combo as it's the most practical. But first you had to take the dress off, you quickly ran over to the bathroom for privacy. You slowly feel your way around your body, tugging the dress. \"I need to get this off...\" you mutter, and you finally just pull it over your head, throwing it to the ground. You further struggle with the leggings and all of the other trappings of your dress. Now you were down to your underwear which consists of a frilly pair of panties and a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly put on the t-shirt and shorts, they feel a lot more simple/practical compared to the dress you just took off. You quickly scan yourself over in the mirror with your new outfit, and notice that you look slightly more masculine with them on. Obviously, it's because the t-shirt and shorts show off a bit more of your muscles. The t-shirt is also adjusted to allow your wings to come out of the back just like Peach's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, since you don't have any fights to go to for a day or two, you could go show off the remote to Viridi or Palutena. You haven't seen Viridi much since she originally came to the mansion but you could go see Palutena as you originally planned.</span></div></div>",

Have you swapped anything yet?\" Peach looks really excited by this. You wonder how she'll react to knowing that you used the remote on her, but you figure you should tell her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Actually, you were the first person I tested it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps. \"Really?\" She starts looking over herself for something that seems different, but finds nothing wrong, since the remote changed reality so she thought she always had your body. \"Is there a setting that can make me see the swap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to the manual, and how Swap Mode 2 makes the target also aware of the swap, but still makes everyone else unaware. \"I think there is. I'll just need to swap us back on this mode and then switch us again on another mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Please do.\" She waits patiently for you to do it. You point the remote at Peach and press head swap again, putting you back on your own body. Peach makes a confused expression, thinking nothing has happened, before she realises that the remote just made her think nothing happened. Then, you press the button labeled 2, and press head swap again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time when your heads swap, Peach makes an incredibly shocked expression, looking all over at her body, or more accurately, your body below her neck. \"Wow! This is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" You can't help but laugh at her enthusiasm. And now you're not afraid to react because she actually knows what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach gives your wings an experimental flap, something she is amazed by. She turns you you and asks, \"So, everyone else thinks it's normal for us to have eachother's bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. Well, since you didn't notice it before I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if I hadn't come and talked to you, how long do you think you would have kept my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. I was really just looking to swap something obvious so I could test if even gods like Palutena would be unaware of the swaps. I guess I would have just kept it until I felt like trying something else out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case... can I maybe keep your body for a while? I'm liking how it feels to have wings, even if I can't fly with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are honestly surprised by this. Why would Peach want your body? She had a great one of her own. Although you suppose she did state her reason, the wings. Still, if Peach wanted to have your body, that'd mean you could keep her's, and you certainly had no objections to that at the moment. \"Um, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach's face lights up with excitement. She pulls you into a tight hug, which feels a little weird with her body pressing up again your new breasts. \"Yay! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, no problem.\" The two of you looked like a bit of an odd pair with your heads on each other's bodies, but you were both having fun so you didn't really care. \"So, what should we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

You were actually liking the idea of sharing this experience with someone else. That way you wouldn't just have to think about what you could do, or laugh about the results, in private, you could actually talk about it with someone. While looking around, you hear Peach giggling to herself as she looks at your body (which was actually Peach's body, but you were thinking of it as yours since you were going to be keeping it until either you or Peach felt like swapping it back). \"What's so funny?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe.

It gives no indication that it worked. \"I'd be friends with all of Mario's friends, and he'd be friends with mine? And instead of being my boyfriend, he'd be my girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. You'd have to check with one of your friends who was unaware of the swap. Although I think that means we aren't really friends now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't friends with Mario?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. We just didn't click.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you can swap relationships with one of Mario's friends so then we'd be friends again.\" She suddenly gets a very sly grin her face as she realises something, and speaks in a very teasing tone. \"Oooooorrr, you could swap relationships with Mario, and become my girlfriend.\" She winks at you as she says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but blush at this. Peach was clearly a bit older than you, at least in terms of your physical age, and she seemed to be in a very happy relationship with Mario. Why was she suggesting that she give that up and let you become her partner? Was the remote affecting her mind? No, that couldn't be it. The manual promised that your personality wouldn't be affected. Maybe she actually had a crush on you and her relationship with Mario had gotten stale? You really had to think about what you wanted, but you also had to make your decision before Mario left, in case you did want to get Peach's relationships from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you swapped relationships with one of Mario's friends, then you'd be friends with Peach again and things would be normal in that regard, but you'd also have a completely different set of friends, and possibly some other kind of relationship. It really depended on which of Mario's friends you chose to swap with. On the other hand, you knew exactly what you'd be getting into if you swapped relationships with Mario. You'd end up being Peach's girlfriend, but you'd also end up losing some of you old friends, being replaced with friendships with mostly the female participants of the tournament. Peach did have friends outside of just the girls, but she did seem to spend the most time with them. Not that you'd mind, you were mostly a girl now anyway. After a lot of thinking, you decide to swap relationships with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You say to yourself, \"Why not.\" Making sure Peach's hand is still on the remote, you point it at Mario and press the relationship swap button. Once again, nothing seems to have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that makes us boyfriend and girlfriend then,\" Peach says as if this sort of thing was an everyday occurrence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it does.\" You can't help but blush at the thought. You can't believe that with the click of a button, you've suddenly become Peach's boy... er, girlfriend. Peach notices your blush and giggles, before giving you a kiss on the cheek. This, of course, just makes you blush even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any real way we can check if it actually worked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could go talk to someone to see how they treat us. Or we could just go look for some 'physical evidence' like a letter or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach thinks for a bit, which gives you time to look over her current form. You had earlier thought her head didn't look too out of place on your body, but the longer you look, the more you think she might look just as ridiculous as you do. With her long blonde hair, her princess crown and earrings, and her makeup, her head doesn't really fit. You prefer it this way though, so that you're looking at Peach's face on your body instead of your looking at a copy of yourself. Although you do now wonder how it would look if you completely had eachother's outfits, instead of just what was worn below the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach snaps you out of your daze as she suddenly exclaims, \"Oh, I know! C'mon, I'll show you.\" She takes you by the arm and starts running in the direction that you presume leads to the garden. At least, that's what you can tell from where you're headed, and the fact that you're supposedly headed somewhere where there'll be evidence of your relationships changing. As you ran alongside Peach, you once again marveled at how well you were moving around in Peach's heels and dress. If you had simply worn her clothes without the remote to help you adjust, you would be tripping over the hem of the dress and wobbling in her heels, probably hurting your ankle. This way, not only were you able to try out these sorts of things without any long term consequences, but you don't have to take a long time adjusting to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you had suspected, Peach leads you to the garden, and over to a specific tree. \"When I joined the tournament, Mario and I carved something into this tree.\" She walks around the tree, looking for the carving. \"There!\" You walk around to where she was standing, and find a heart carved into the tree, with the letters \"P&amp;P\" inside it. \"When Mario and I carved it, it had 'M&amp;P' in it, for 'Mario and Peach'. I guess now it stands for 'Peach and Pit'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really did swap relationships then.\" You can't help but smile a little. This remote had truly changed your life, and if you didn't like it, you could just change it again. Peach gives you a hug from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you really are my girlfriend now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I am.\" The two of you just stand there for a little while, enjoying the moment under these odd circumstances. After a while, you start to move around the remote in your hand, and ask, \"So, what should we do now? I think I'm pretty happy with where our lives are at right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too. I don't think I want to change anything about us just yet. Although, I guess we could still use ourselves as a middle step to swap two other people and mess with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could get some pretty funny results with that. Although we could just put the remote away for now and enjoy our life as it is for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I'm fine with either. You can choose.\"</span></div></div>",

You were stood outside the door, which had on the slide <i>Peach and Pit</i>. Peach giggled, \"Even more evidence,\" and entered.

Pit though about the situation, he was currently, laying on a couples bed, resting a head on his boyfriend's, Princess Peach, chest, which was his own, as the man in the relationship, if you could call him the man with a princesses body, he should be the one being rested on. But Pit disregarded the thought, as because of the remote, he couldn't say what normal was. Peach took hold of the remote, and smiled a little, \"Don't swap without me,\" Pit said drowsily.

You had already caught up with some old friends and intended to do some training, but in the meantime you were heading off to the leisure room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather, you were; until you found yourself face-to-face with an abandoned package someone left on the ground (being only about a foot and a half tall had its advantages and disadvantages sometimes). Inside, there appeared to be a remote, along with a manual describing its usage. Glancing over the booklet, you're surprised to learn what the purpose of this object truly is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging the box back to your room, you wonder about the capabilities of your find. While you had long believed that such feats could only be done by Arceus himself, it wouldn't surprise you if the Hands had decided to include something this powerful to the tournament (after all, they made use of Manaphy's Heart Swap ability in the last tournament, so the idea sounded similar). But at the same time, there wasn't any way that this thing could change everything without anything noticing. So of course you had to test it and make sure that it could do what it said. Just to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the fact that Lucario did not appear to be in your shared room made the process of storing the box and manual unnoticed rather easier, it did mean that you were out of a test subject.

Maybe Peach would finally be yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the remote didn't merely alter anything you wanted, it swapped things between people. You still think it might be interesting to try and maybe it could give you the edge against Mario. Even more unfortunate was the fact that it seemed your fingers were a little large for the buttons.

Even Peach herself no longer knew who she was, as she believed herself to be King of the Koopas. Bowser was blown away by the power of this device as he began to run his gloved hands through his new hair and pat down his new curves. \"Amazing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he realized that the hallway was a bad place to be so 'adventurous'. He didn't want people to get too suspicious, so he swiftly walked off to a more secluded area, Peach's room. It seemed to be empty, so he had all the time he needed to plan and have fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at himself in the mirror for the first time, noting his new make-up and jewelery. He gave his new rear and chest a few long squeezes and laughed. \"This is the ultimate kidnapping!\" Bowser exclaimed with glee. \"I didn't steal Peach, I stole her body, and even she doesn't know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gives a little jump for joy, but quickly cuts the festivities. He's still the Koopa King! This is very serious! Now he can execute his plan perfectly. Using Peach's body, he can easily have her break up with Mario. And since Peach thinks she's him, he doesn't have to worry about convincing her of anything. And he has all the time he wants to 'have fun' in the middle as well.</span></div></div>",

You had actually been out of commission for a long while before the Hands requested your participation in the tournament. You had just had a training session together with the other newcomers and were now heading back to your room to relax for a while by yourself, since you knew your roommate, Villager, wouldn't be heading back to the room for a while. In the hallway leading to your room, however, you find a mysterious parcel sitting abandoned on the floor. Since there didn't seem to be anyone around who could have dropped it, you decide to pick it up and take it into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the bed and examine the contents of the parcel. Inside is a device that looks like some sort of TV remote and a manual that likely explains what the device is. After reading through the manual, you are amazed by what it does. For robots such as yourself, it shouldn't be too hard for anyone with a decent knowledge in robotics you take apart two robots and put them back together with eachother's heads, or program two robots to make them think they were eachother. However, that would be far from the instantaneous switch the manual promised. Not only that, it supposedly worked on anyone, including living beings. Perhaps it could even mix and match and put your robot head on a biological body. This was something you definitely wanted to see for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to get up and test it out on someone, but another idea strikes you. If you had to take the remote with you everywhere if you wanted to perform swaps, it might eventually be seen and someone would demand an answer. However, you had a very special way of fighting, the variable weapons system. With this, you would be able to utilise the weapon of any defeated foe, and in fact, that was how you had pieced together your moveset for the tournament. Theoretically, if you shot and destroyed the remote as you would a robot master, you might be able to copy the remote's reality altering properties into your own coding. You would do so without thinking, if not for the fact that it may not even work, or if it did the functionality you receive might be limited to only one mode or only a few different types of swaps. Even if it did work completely, you were worried you'd get carried away with the swapping and find yourself in a situation you are unable to return from. For instance, a life swap transferred all skills required to be a certain person to the person now occupying the life, and that would include all your various weapons. If you were to perform a life swap through your variable weapons system, you would have no way of returning to your old life or performing more swaps, as the remote would be destroyed and its functionality would be trapped inside whoever was in your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou way up the pros and cons of keeping the remote as is and destroying it to add it to your variable weapons system.

In a moment you were back to your own life, and the first thing you did was chase Rosalina down. \"Hello?

You took out a cable, attaching one end to the computer and the other end to the port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina turned around, \"I really apologize, but I\"-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed a key on the computer, then aimed the remote at Rosalina, hitting the Life Swap button again. You turned around and saw that what the first part of what you had done was successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina was standing still, her naked body rigid in the position you were in when you had used the remote. You walked towards her and saw your reflection in her glassy eyes, the cable entering her head nestled in her hair. She was now a deactivated robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing something, you check the mirror. It appeared as if your scalp was smooth, with your helmet and the squares on it flattened into a tattoo-like covering. That was interesting, but there were more important things to confirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the computer. A dialogue box on the screen said \"Program installed. Press OK to re-activate.\" You open another window - it was a text program with the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. When someone says \"I am your owner, Roy. G. Biv.\" in my presence, I will erase all prior \"Owner\" designations and designate the speaker as my \"Owner.\"<br>\r\n2. I may not injure my \"Owner\" or, through inaction, allow my owner to come to harm.<br>\r\n3. I must obey the orders given to me by my \"Owner\" except where such orders would conflict with Rules 1 and 2 of this list.<br>\r\n4. I must protect my own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with Rules 1, 2, and 3 of this list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You had converted these rules to a program, and now the program had been installed in Rosalina's programming. You press the OK button. Rosalina shuddered briefly. You waited a second and then gave your first orders, \"I am your owner, Roy. G. Biv. Remove the cable from your head, turn to face me, and state the designation you have for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina robotically removed the cable and then turned to face you. \"Owner,\" she said with a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" you replied.

It was the same color but not the same texture. It was a metallic arm, cold and hard. You squeezed the arm in your hands, taking in the coldness with your new human hands that were capable of taking in such coldness. \"Interesting,\" you tell yourself. You then start stroking her hair to get its texture and realize that you have no prior reference. You wonder if your sister Roll's hair felt the same way, or if Rosalina's hair was now somehow different then the hair of other humans. Next was her eyes. Rosalina's eyes were glassy screens, the way yours had been, displaying images of eyes at an intensity suitable for the ambient light conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step away and get the remote. You aim it at Rosalina and press the body swap button. As expected, you find yourself a little taller, and raising your hands shows you Rosalina's hands. But their texture isn't human - it's metallic. You look at the bed and see that Rosalina was now in your humanized body. Not only that, but Rosalina was still on the bed. Even though she was in a human body, she was still following her programming. Those were definitely interesting and useful results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you were a robot, you did a thorough scan of yourself. Interestingly, you found data that was separated from the rest. Scanning it, your analysis indicated that the data was there but did not come up on basic searches and reads. Finding this data without the through scan you had just done would have taken quite an effort - an odd concept for you. But now that you found it, reading it indicated that it was all the data for Rosalina's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used the remote to perform another body swap, then tried again to access Rosalina's memories. It was doable, but it definitely took more effort than accessing your own memories. You considered what to do next. If you wanted to make use of your current resources, you had some options. With Rosalina's life, you could invite some of her friends over. You could order your robot Rosalina to call your sister (or her sister now, you supposed) Roll over. Or you could try another option.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The program you had installed in Rosalina for the short period of time that she was living your life had been given the deepest access to one's robotic programming that could be allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been a risk that when you swapped lives back that the program would remain in the life of Megaman, but that had not occurred. It was if the program was now part of Rosalina's core... whatever was analogous to a living being's core programming. A soul? In any event, you could reasonably calculate that the programming would thus remain a part of Rosalina regardless of what life she was in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Master\" designation was also an interesting emergent event. Rosalina's mind probably designated \"Master\" as the human's equivalent of \"Owner.\" In her mind, one was a Master of people but an Owner of property. It was a minimal divergence, but also a reminder that reprogramming people could have unpredictable consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to test something else. You aimed the remote at Rosalina and pressed the Body Swap button. As expected, you found yourself a little taller, and raising your hands showed you Rosalina's hands.

But then again, nothing in either of your particular backgrounds required it - You could have been an artificially-created lifeform, and Rosalina a crafted one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou switched your bodies back and continued to hypothesize - were there circumstances under which the remote would perform such a conversion during the exchanging process?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour locked the door, pulled out a printer and hooked it up to your computer. \"Remove your clothing rapidly, stand, and rotate slowly,\" you ordered. You had to act fast, as you lacked the data on when your roommate would return. As Rosalina did so, you opened up a graphics program and quickly composed a graphic consisting of Rosalina as a nude robot based on the input you were receiving. \"Place your clothing back on,\" You ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou printed out your graphic. Once Rosalina was fully clothed, you gave her the order, \"Point the remote at this graphic and use the Body Swap button.

There was no one around, so whoever had dropped it clearly didn't care about it too much, so you didn't feel too bad about snooping a little and seeing what was inside. Inside, you found a strange TV remote, and a manual explaining what the remote did. Since your toe didn't hurt anymore, you continue your trip towards the gym, taking the box with you and reading the manual on the way. You could barely believe what you were reading. This remote claimed to alter reality in unimaginable ways. This could take you out of your boring old life of being a trainer completely. You really wanted to try it out, so you were pleased to hear the sounds of other people working out when you neared the gym.

Before long, he was going through your daily routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced over at you and offered a small smile. \"Hello there. Ready to work out today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat clinched it, you'd definitely switches lives with Falcon. No one else started conversations like that. You wonder why that is. It got right to important business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, how would Falcon answer that? He never attended training sessions... but he had some kind of phrase he said somewhat frequently, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I don't need to see anyone else's moves.\" That sounded right and the Falcon-that-thought-he-was-you agreed, nodding politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the remote worked!

Ness and Lucas was it? Lucas is significantly more nervous as he follows behind Ness, but both of them have looks of admiration as they approach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Ms. Trainer!\" You've never been called a Miss before and it startles you enough to stop your exercises. \"W-We're big fans and we were wondering if you could train us. Just a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but grin in excitement. \"Of course! Exercising every day is the key to a healthy lifestyle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverjoyed, the kids follow your lead and complete your daily routine. You haven't had any students since you arrived at the Tournament, but now not only did you have students, they were big fans as well! Was this the kind of admirers Captain Falcon received regularly? You could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing about your day, the other differences become clear. Heroes would treat you with respect and give encouragement as they passed you by. Villains would glare and mumble something about \"do-gooding trainer, improving people's health\". It was wonderful!

The red button next to the undo button is the Reset button, which undoes all the swaps you've ever done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be handy if we went crazy with the swaps,\" you said. \"What's the yellow button do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the set button,\" said Samus. \"It basically locks in all swaps that happened before pressing it, so they won't be undone if you press the reset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the set position permanent?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus shook her head. \"If you want to reverse all your swaps, you can press the set button again to remove your set position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, then pointed at the green button. \"What's this button do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the scramble button,\" said Samus with a grin. \"Press it, and everyone in the room gets swapped around, depending on what mode you have it set to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you said quietly. \"That could be really fun... and really confusing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Anyway, these last two buttons are the aware and unaware buttons, respectively,\" said Samus, pointing at the orange and purple buttons at the bottom. \"They make the target either aware or unaware of any and all swaps you perform with the remote, depending on which you use. Speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took your hands and pointed the remote at you and pressed the aware button. You didn't really notice anything different, but before you could say anything, Samus pointed the remote at herself and pressed the aware button. After pressing it, Samus blinked a few times and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Sammy?\" you asked, setting the remote down and taking Samus' hands in yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Samus, sounding slightly breathless. \"Yeah, I'm okay. Didn't mean to scare you. It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" you said, giving Samus' hands a gentle squeeze. \"Take your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus smiled, and leaned over and gave you a quick peck on the cheek. \"Thanks, Fit. I was just hit by all my memories of my old relationship with Captain Falcon, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. This could be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry, Fit,\" Samus said. \"I'm not going to go back to him or anything like that.\" She smiled. \"Besides, I'm more interested in seeing where this goes, where we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped slightly, and you felt your cheeks burning bright red, which caused Samus to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute when you blush,\" said Samus, as her own cheeks started to go a little pink and she leans in closer to you. \"Do you... do you mind if I kiss you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no,\" you managed to say as you start leaning closer to Samus as well. \"I don't mind at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and leaned in a little closer. You felt Samus' lips against yours, and Samus raised one of her hands and tilted your head a little to get into a better position for the kiss. You weren't sure how long the kiss lasted for, but your head was spinning when Samus pulled back from the kiss. You opened your eyes and blinked a few times as a stupid grin spread across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you said. \"That was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing,\" said Samus. \"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

Just like that, Samus was wearing her Zero Suit again, and you were back in your workout clothes, which were still rather messy. Apparently, when the remote performed a clothes swap, it kept the clothes in the state they were in when the button was pressed, even if that wouldn't make sense after the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Fit,\" said Samus. \"Feels so much nicer to be wearing my own clothes again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself,\" you said. \"Now <i>I'm</i> the one who has to get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that,\" said Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" you said, walking over to your wardrobe and opening it. There were a few sets of your standard blue clothes, as well as copies in green, red and yellow; palette swaps, you think the other fighters called them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recommend the red,\" said Samus as she walked over to her own wardrobe. \"If we're going to be training together, we might as well match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Training...?\" you said, slightly confused. Then, one of your new memories came to the surface. When you'd first arrived for the tournament, Samus had asked for some private fitness lessons from you. That was how you two had started your relationship... or rather, how the remote had rationalised giving you Captain Falcon's relationship with Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, now I remember,\" you said. Then you realised Samus had said something about matching. You looked over your shoulder at Samus, and noticed that she'd taken an orange sports bra out of her wardrobe, as well as a pair of short shorts and boots in the same colour. You turned back to your wardrobe, and grabbed a red tanktop and a pair of sweatpants to match. As you turned around to head to the bathroom, you saw that Samus had already unzipped her Zero Suit, and had already pulled her arms out of the sleeves. The upper half of the Zero Suit was now hanging around her waist as she reached down and took her Jet Boots off, giving you a good look at Samus' exposed breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy!\" you said, feeling your cheeks heat up again as you tried to keep your eyes away from Samus' breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Samus. \"We're both women, aren't we? Besides, you're probably going to see me naked at some point in the near future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, well,\" you stammer, before you get your composure back. \"A little warning would be nice, next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" said Samus, standing up and pulling her Zero Suit down past her hips. Your cheeks got even warmer as Samus stepped out of her Zero Suit, completely naked, so you turned and quickly walked into the bathroom. You took a few deep breaths to calm your heart rate, then took off your blue workout clothes and got dressed in the red clothes you'd brought with you. When you walked out of the bathroom, Samus was wearing the orange sports bra and short shorts she'd taken out, and was putting her Jet Boots back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to go?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you said, tossing your dirty clothes into your wardrobe. \"I'm always ready for fitness training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus smiled warmly. \"That's the fitness trainer I know and love. Come on, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus took your hand, and you used your free hand to grab the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't want to forget this, would we?\" you said, showing Samus the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we would not,\" said Samus. \"Come on, let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

The differences weren't really obvious on your new body, though you immediately felt much more comfortable now that you were biologically female again. The changes were much more obvious on Lucario, though. While he still had your white skin and dark grey hair, his hair was now cut much shorter, and he was slightly more muscular. His chest now had well-defined pectoral muscles instead of breasts, and it was fairly obvious that he had male equipment between his legs, so to speak. With the swap complete, you wrap your paw around the remote and drop your arm to your side, hiding the remote in your blue leg fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a yell, Lucario released his Aura Sphere into the Sandbag, knocking the Sandbag back several feet. Lucario nodded in satisfaction, and glanced over his shoulder at you and Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samus, Wii Fit Trainer,\" Lucario said as he turned to face you. \"I didn't notice you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Samus said. \"We only just got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nodded. \"Will either of you be needing the Sandbag?\" he asked, pointing over his shoulder with his thumb at the item in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you,\" you said. \"We're just doing some fitness exercises together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see,\" said Lucario knowingly. \"Then I will return the Sandbag to storage. Enjoy your time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished speaking, Lucario walked over to the Sandbag and picked it up easily, slinging it over his shoulder and walking over to the storage area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went well,\" you said quietly, looking down at the remote. It was amazing just how powerful such a small item could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" said Samus. \"You'd better put that thing in your gym locker while we're training, though. Wouldn't want anyone to take it while we're not looking, would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" you said. \"I'll be back in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over your shoulder to make sure Lucario wasn't watching, then made your way over to the locker area. You find your locker, which was marked with your symbol. Normally, your symbol was a silhouette of you in the Dance yoga position, however, it had changed slightly. While the silhouette was still in the same pose, it was now of a Lucario in the Dance position. You put the remote in your locker and headed back out.

She smiled at you as you walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to go?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d you said. \u201cJust let me do some stretches and warm up first, then we\u2019ll start the training session.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus nodded, and returned to her stretches. You also started doing various stretches and warm up exercises, getting a feel for your new Lucario body. The first big difference was your tail. It changed your centre of balance, but once you figured out how to control it, you were able to use it as a counterweight in your yoga poses. The second major changes were to your legs and feet. While Lucario\u2019s upper legs were similar in size to your old body\u2019s upper legs, the lower legs were very short, and what appeared to be a backwards knee was actually your ankle. Even though you hadn\u2019t noticed the difference while walking, you still had to occasionally remind yourself to use your tiptoes when switching between yoga poses, rather than a flat foot. Lucario\u2019s blue, cream and black fur was a little itchy at first, but you soon stopped noticing it. You were also surprised you didn\u2019t scratch yourself with the sharp metal spikes sticking out of your chest and the backs of your paws. It was also a little difficult to adjust to essentially losing a thumb and a finger on your new three toed paws. Even so, an hour later, as your training session with Samus came to a close, you had fully adjusted to being in Lucario\u2019s body, and were actually starting to consider it <i>your</i> body, rather than <i>his</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, that should do it for today\u2019s session,\u201d you said. \u201cExcellent work, Samus. You are one of the fittest people I\u2019ve met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, thanks,\u201d said Samus as she wiped a hand across her brow. Her face was slightly flushed and sticky with sweat, and a few strands of hair had come loose from her ponytail. \u201cI had a lot of fun today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d you said. \u201cFitness should be fun, and I\u2019m glad more people are starting to see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s nice to have someone to work out with,\u201d said Samus. \u201cAnyway, I think some of the newcomers have organised a training session here in a few minutes, so we should probably grab the remote and go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and the two of you started walking towards the locker room. \u201cDo you want to head back to our rooms and have a shower? Or would you rather head to the cafeteria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s head to the cafeteria,\u201d said Samus. \u201cI could do with some food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d you said as you walked over to your locker and started undoing the lock. \u201cA balanced diet is an important part of staying fit and healthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus giggled. \u201cYeah, but I was thinking more about finding someone to swap with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d you said as you undid the lock and opened the locker. To your relief, the remote was still inside the locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho picked up the remote first?</span></div></div>",

Lucina is now living Greninja\u2019s life, and Greninja is living Lucina\u2019s?\u201d Fit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d you said, and started walking down the hall, pulling Fit with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, why do you and Lucina now have such long tongues?\u201d Fit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tongue was part of Greninja\u2019s life,\u201d you said. \u201cIt appears that the remote can alter someone\u2019s body so that fits their new life, at least to some degree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Fit slowly. \u201cI can understand why Lucina has her long tongue; she\u2019s still living Greninja\u2019s life. But why do you still have a long tongue? You\u2019ve got your own life and body back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \u201cI guess the length of my tongue isn\u2019t considered an important part of my life,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea struck you. You thought you remembered seeing Greninja eating once, but you couldn\u2019t remember if he had retracted his tongue back into his mouth or not. Of course, now you weren\u2019t sure if you were remembering Greninja, or Lucina living in Greninja\u2019s life. Either way, you figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to try.</span></div></div>",

You loved getting to participate in the Smash Bros Tournament; Bowser would usually restrain you before you got to fight back, so being able to let off a bit of steam in the arena was great for you. But that didn't mean everything was about fighting. In fact, you were on your way to the garden to tend to some flowers, when you happened to come across a small box lying in the hallway. You looked around for anyone who might have dropped it, but no one nearby gave any indication that they had dropped something and were looking for it. You take it with you and head towards Master Hand's office, since he'd no doubt want to know about any lost items being found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way there however, curiosity gets the better of you, and you take a peek at what's inside the box. Inside there seems to be a strange remote, as well a manual explaining how it works. Thoroughly intrigued, you take the manual out of the box and read through the manual. You can barely believe what it says. According to the manual, this remote could alter reality in strange and magical ways, anything from swapping two people's heads, to making everyone believe you were another person. You're sure whoever owns this thing wouldn't mind if you tried it out just once. No one would even have to know, since the remote could make everyone unaware of the swaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you frown as you find no other people in the vicinity to test the remote on. Or perhaps \"no other humans\" would be more accurate, since there were a few of the tournament's non-human competitors around. Would the remote work on them? The manual hadn't mentioned anything about it, so it was worth a try. It'd be interesting nevertheless. Looking around at your options, you narrow your options down to two candidates. One is the giant ape, Donkey Kong. It seemed strange to think that you were considering swapping body parts with an ape, and a male one at that, but he was incredibly strong. The other was the electric-type Pokemon, Pikachu. You honestly thought Pikachu was adorable, and couldn't help but feel a little jealous of how much time Samus got to spend with him. Which person do you choose to swap with?</span></div></div>",

She pointed the remote at Donkey Kong, borrowing her body, and somehow with her much larger fingers, pressed the body swap button, changing things back to how they were. Peach grew a large grin and ran, which looked a lot more like her frolicking gleefully and quickly, to get bests friends, Zelda and Samus, in on the swap action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile skipping, she thought about her friends locations, and said to her self under her breath, \"Where would they be?\" she hummed, \"Samus would be practising against sandbags to get better with her zero suit. And Zelda, oh that knowledge seeking would be worming her way though the books at the library here. Maybe I should get Samus first, Zelda doesn't like her reading interrupted,\" she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach headed of to the gym, were sure enough, Samus was kicking the tea out of the sand bags. Peach raised her arm, and yelled out \"Hey Sammy,\" she called out waving. Peach cringed, while she cared for Peach, sometimes her antics were a little embarrassing, but she took a sigh of relief that no one was there. \"Hi Peach,\" she said in her rare friendly manner. \"Hey, I've got something really special I want to show you and Zelda,\" Peach took hold of Samus's hand, Samus smiled, while she knew Peach would invent stories from her own imagination often, Samus was curious to what she had come up with this time, \"Okay Peach, just let me grab my bag,\" Samus requested and Peach stopped and loosened her grip, letting Samus go and get her stuff. The two left the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer and closer the two got to the library, the faster Peach skipped, \"Peach, you know that when Zelda finds starts a book, she doesn't stop, and with the library here, she isn't going any where.\"<br>\r\nPeach replies, almost squealing, \"I know, I no...\" Peach broke out into her excited giggle, which wasn't to dissimilar to a fan-girl about to pass out. Samus smiled to her enthusiasm, knowing just how excited she must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach and Samus arrived at the library, which was huge, 3 floor each with a several dozen book selves, and each book shelf having more book on then there was book selves per floor. Peach's mood fell, \"it would take ages for us to find her,\" Peach moped. \"Or asked the oracle,\" Samus suggested, walking up to the desk, \"Excuse me Farore,\" Samus said, getting the little green haired oracles attention, who looked up, \"Could you direct me to my friend Zelda, we think she is in the library.\"<br>\r\nFarore smiled, \"She's that way, behind a stack of books,\" Farore pointed the direction that Zelda was in, lifting Peach's spirit causing her to grab Samus before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they had run into the stack of book that Farore had mentioned, Peach walked around, Samus followed. Peach saw Zelda head down in a book. Peach turned to Samus and then back to Zelda, and gentle closed her book. Samus calmly explained,  \"Sorry to interrupt,\" the two of them could see her masking disappointment and a little anger under a disarming smile, \"Peach says she found something and wanted to show us.\" Zelda put the book down and Peach got ready for a little show and tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach present the remote and manual, \"This is a remote of swap, and it's manual, it lets me swap heads, bodies, relationships, clothes, life's or gender with someone. The manual explains it all.\" Peach said handing it over for them to read, but Zelda kept on turning the page before Samus could finish the page, so Zelda read it first and explained it to Samus once she was finished.<br>\r\n\"Peach, this is all very interesting, but how do you know this works?\" Zelda asked, hiding her scepticism.<br>\r\nPeach smilied, \"Because I tried it on Donkey Kong and it did what I asked.\"<br>\r\n\"So, your suppose to be big and hairy like a gorilla?\" Samus asked.<br>\r\nPeach shook her head laughed about the fact Samus had just asked such a weird question, \"No I swapped back.\"<br>\r\nZelda and Samus got into a huddle to decided if they believed her or not.</span></div></div>",

You could do a clothes swap and get back your own dress. Or perhaps you could do a body swap and get the trophy's mane of orange-brown hair. Either way would certainly match better than how things were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr.... You thought about the trophy. Technically the trophy was supposed to be living your life. You were becoming very curious about that. Yes, the trophy was a trophy right now. Then again, the smash competitors had been turned into trophies during the last tournament.

You body felt like some sort of plastic or something, and your skin was coated in some sort of finish that made the trophies shine. Your \"flesh\" was a lot more solid than real flesh, still allowing you to move around as you had before, but not moving when you did things like pinch yourself. You couldn't feel a difference between flesh and bones, probably because you had neither and your body was the same material all the way through. Even your hair had the same platicy feel to it, and felt less like individual hairs that merely moved as one, and more like one big solid block. You could still move it though, as you had been able to with your hair before, and all the other restrictions you had discovered about your body before still remained, such as being unable to move your face or remove your clothing. Even more than before your clothes felt like they were a part of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, becoming a living trophy was a rather fascinating experience.

She wasn't alive before, so does making her alive now make it good? Would it be right if I made her just a trophy again and never swapped back? Would that even work now? Hmm, it's still mean if she's only alive when someone comes to kidnap \"me,\" isn't it. Maybe I should share- Oh, this isn't fair! I just wanted to be able to relax. Now I have to handle this.

It catches you off guard, and you instinctively reach up to cover your privates.

You put your free hand on your hip, and hold the remote up where you could see it with the other hand. Sure, Donkey Kong's like could be a good vacation from being a princess, but now that you knew the remote worked, there was no reason to stop using it.

However, now you were curious; Could you move? When you had swapped bodies with the turnip you couldn't really move anything with how stiff the turnip was. The dress was a lot more flexible than the turnip, though, even if it was normally an inanimate object. Perhaps now that it was part of you, you could actually control it.

You decide to try sitting up. As easy as it would normally have been, the dress extends upwards until your head was at about the height it would be if you were sitting, with skirt of the dress still spread out on the bed.

She bends over to pick up the remote and seems to notice something on the back. \"Hmm, that's strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's strange to hear someone else talking in my voice!</i> You think desperately. You watch helplessly as the former turnip now living your life in your body puts the remote and manual back in the box before picking both it and you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on her direction, it looks like she's headed back towards your room.

The crown on your turnip head shakes, and the earrings stuck to the sides of your head vibrate. She lets the remote drop onto the bed, then gets down to your hands and knees and starts crawling towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What... what is she doing?! That's completely undignified,</i> you think as you watch her. She makes her way towards the drawers and maneuvers your hand to one of the drawers. She opens it, then closes it. Then does it again to the next drawer. It's on the third drawer that she pulls something out. Something round and brown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's... what is that?</i> You wonder, <i>Wait... It's mine. Why can't I remember it?I</i> You try to think of what else you may have forgotten, but suddenly there's a flash of light.

The orange button you pressed made you remember that. But now you were Princess Peach, although oddly the orange button seems to have made you forget much of that. <i>It's weird,</i> you think. <i>I remember doing what I just did, and remember that I remembered a lot more, but now it's all... fuzzy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you use the knobs on the drawers to pull yourself up to a standing position. You look at the trophy you made of the turnip that had once Princess Peach, wearing the clothes she used to wear and that you had swapped back with her, leaving yourself nude and unencumbered. You blink a bit, and then... shrug. <i>I don't know why you wanted to be a turnip, but I'll keep you safe,</i> you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Think! I can think now!</i> Your lips part in awe as you raise your hands again. The very possibility of though empties your mind of it for a moment. On an impulse, you rub them against each other, feeling the heat they generate. Then you clasp them to your face. You gasp subtly as you feel your hair on the back of your hands. You hold your hair in your hands. <i>It's so...</i> \"Soft.\" You close your eyes and smile as you stroke your long blond hair for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, <i>That's enough of that. So now what?</i> You take a deep breath, <i>I guess remembering I was a turnip means I have to learn what it means to be a human. Maybe the memories will come as as I live her life. I hope they do; I don't want anyone to realize I'm not really Princess Peach.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But what do I do with the remote?</i> you wonder. <i>I can't break it. Who knows what would happen? Let's see...</i> You put a finger to your lips and cradle your chin - that seems to be a human thinking thing. <i>I could hide the remote and go out, or go out with the remote. Maybe I can use it on someone else. Or maybe...</i> You concentrate, thinking as hard as you can. <i>The old Peach wanted to... give this remote to someone. Maybe I should do that.</i> </span></div></div>",

In your own world you were just called Link, but since there was already a Link in the tournament who had been participating longer, the Hands gave you a prefix for your name so people wouldn't get confused... only that it resulted in you getting confused a lot of the time. But that was the last tournament, and by now you had sort of gotten used to it. It still bothered you a little that the hands had just given you that prefix without even asking, and that you couldn't just be Link while you were here, but there wasn't really much you could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, you couldn't be much about it until you found a strange package lying in the hallway. Not one to turn down free loot, and not seeing anyone around who was looking for something, you open up the package yourself. Inside was some sort of TV remote and an instruction manual. You weren't too good with technology, what with your world being nowhere near as advanced as the stuff the Hands had, so you take out the manual to see how it worked. You were surprised to find the remote was not for any sort of electric device, but was more like a magic artifact you'd find in a dungeon. It could apparently change reality by swapping things between people, and it would only let certain people notice depending on which orange button was pressed. It reminded you of the Command Melody, but that was more like temporarily possessing someone to control their actions rather than actually swapping bodies with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really curious about this remote now. It could probably end up being pretty fun, letting you be whoever or whatever you wanted to be. Of course, this could just be some sort of prank. You needed to test it out first. But to do that, you'd need a test subject, so you go wandering through the hallways, throwing the box the remote had been in in the trash while you do so, looking for someone to swap with. While you would have preferred to swap with another normal boy like yourself, you had no such luck with the first person you found. But you didn't let that discourage you, as you said to yourself, \"Oh well, it's just a test.\" You point the remote at them, ready to test it on them.

It catches you off guard a bit, since you weren't really paying attention to which button you were pressing. At first you thought you have done a clothes swap, but the fact you were standing in a different place told you otherwise. You figured you must have done a life swap, so everyone thought you were Zelda now. That was amazing! You grinned, thinking of all the possibilities that opened up now that you know your new toy actually worked. The only problem now was that everyone thought you were a girl, a princess no less, but you could fix that pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grin quickly disappears. Once in your life, Zelda must have walked off to go somewhere else, because she certainly wasn't where you had been standing before.  For the time being, your life had run off, and you had no idea where it was, which left you with Zelda's life. You certainly didn't want people thinking you were Zelda. What if you ran into Link!? You certainly didn't want that happening. But if you couldn't get back to your own life, did you really want to take someone else's? Maybe for now you should stick with Zelda's life and try out the other buttons. You wouldn't mind ditching this dress, for one thing.</span></div></div>",

You had thought it was a dud, but it must have done something. After all, Peach wasn't your best friend; Peach was best friends with Zelda! Then it occurs to you; you had pointed the remote at Zelda before, and didn't the remote say something about swapping relationships? You really wished you hadn't thrown the manual away. So if you had swapped relationships with Zelda, then you'd still be you, but Peach would be your best friend, which was what seemed to be happening now. And along with that, you'd have all of Zelda's other relationships too... including Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder. Whatever it was you had wanted to do with this remote, it was certainly not becoming Link's boyfriend. You needed a way out. As Peach continued to drag you to your destination, you thought of what you could do. Zelda was nowhere to be seen, so getting your own relationships back was out of the question. You could either use the relationship swap button, or perhaps the life swap button as someone else's life would also come with their relationships.</span></div></div>",

Finding either of them would be great, but finding Samus would be better because then you could swap everything back in order and things wouldn't get all messed up. Although you supposed it didn't really matter if everyone else was messed up, since they'd think everything was normal. What mattered was making sure you were comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of comfortable, you weren't exactly comfortable walking naked in Samus' body. It might mess things up even further, but maybe you could swap with someone else and take their clothes. Sure, then they'd be naked, but they wouldn't notice anything wrong, and you'd be less uncomfortable about looking down and seeing a naked woman's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it's better than being a head with arms and legs,\" you mumble as you start walking, trying to ignore a cold breeze you were starting to feel.</span></div></div>",

You can even feel yourself wearing her bra, panties, heels, giant hoop earrings, and even the little crown on your head. Lastly, you notice you are holding her wand as well, not really sure what it does. You look up and see Peach talking to you. \"And that's how Mario saved me for the 89th time! So what did you think? Interesting, right?\" You don't really know what to say and just want to get away, so you respond in Rosalinas voice  with \"yea, totally, I think I can hear one of the Lumas calling for me, I better go see what he wants, bye peach!\" You say as wander off. As you are going back to your new room, you realize you aren't walking, but floating! This catches you off guard at first, but then you realize you can just go anywhere without having to take a step! Literally! Seems like you swapped with the better princess of the two. As you float back to your new room, you look down at your body. You never got the chance to explore a girls body while you were samus, but now you are getting a little curious. You stop and give your breast a little squeeze. \"Oooohh...\" you moan in her feminine voice.

That said, you did feel a little guilty about just stealing Samus' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I really live like this?\" you asked yourself. You lower your eyes in thought, before quickly looking back up again as you catch a quick glimpse of the body you now possessed. Either way, you certainly didn't want to keep walking around naked. As you searched for someone to swap clothes with, you eventually decide that so long as you kept the remote, you could always swap back later, so it didn't really matter what you did. You might as well try out Samus' body for now to see if you like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, you still needed some clothes if you were going to be at all comfortable with this. You kind of wondered whether it would be better to take a boy's clothes or a girl's clothes. Boy clothes were more familiar to you, but girl clothes would probably be better suited for your body. In the end, you decide to just go ahead and swap with the first person you come across, since that's what you did last time. Provided they have clothes, of course.</span></div></div>",

But when you opened the package, you found it had inside of it a remote that looked like it belonged to a flat-screen television, and to further inspection, it had some oddly named buttons on it. A life swap? Body swap? Head swap? Could this remote really do all of that? It also came with a very descriptive manual of what each button does and its effects. This definitely seemed like the real deal. The only way to find out for sure, though was to test it out firsthand. You took your new toy out into the hall and decided you'd hit a random button on the very next person to come around the corner. According to the manual, you'd still be in possession of the remote no matter what you chose. Normally, you'd stay far away from this kind of tech, but you'd been very very bored as of late. Since Nintendo hasn't added any more Sonic characters to the Smash Tournament, you've been very lonely. This could pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that arises the question.

There a training session scheduled for the newcomers later today, but you planned to relax for a while in your room before that. On the way there, you noticed something on the ground. Picking it up, you found it to be a small box, with a strange remote and instruction manual inside. You tuck your books and the box under one arm, hold the remote in your right hand, and read the manual in your left hand, all while still walking back to your room. You had every intention to return this remote to its owner, but if you knew what it was and how it worked, its owner may be a little easier to identify. However, this remote seemed to do something you had never even thought possible. It could alter reality without anyone except certain people indicated by the mode knowing anything was wrong. What if whoever owned this had already used this, but you just didn't know because the remote was set to mode 1? Had you always been the princess of the stars? Had you always had your tall, female body? While worrying about this, you bump into someone because you weren't looking where you were going. This causes you to drop pretty much everything except the remote, and you don't realise it yet, but you also accidentally press the life swap button, targeting the person you bumped into. Who had you bumped into?</span></div></div>",

You supposed you should have been watching where you were going. But something felt... off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I wasn't watching where I was going,\" you hear Bowser say. Well that explained why bumping your head had hurt that much, but why was Bowser apologising? He was a villain, normally if something like this happened, he'd just make some rude remake and stomp off. Speaking of stomping off, you hear Bowser start to walk away, but rather than the usual stomping, you hear the clicking on high heels on the ground. Something was definitely wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pain from the collision subsided, you open your eyes, and instantly realise what was wrong. Looking down at yourself, you saw that you dress had vanished, all your clothes had, leaving in their place only some spiked arm bands and a choker around your neck. The books you had borrowed from the library were no longer lying on the floor; only the manual and the box the remote came in were left there. You had a pretty good idea of what had happened; you had accidentally pressed the life swap button on the remote when you bumped into Bowser, so now you were living his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to find him and switch back as soon as possible! What would happen to the Lumas if you weren't there for them? What would Bowser do to them? You do your best to calm down. You remember how Bowser apologised for bumping into you, something he would normally have never done. Bowser probably thought he was you now, so the Lumas were in no danger of their kind mother being replaced with a cruel dictator. In that case, if you could somehow turn Bowser's life around and stop him from being a villain before you went back to your own life, perhaps you could remove the main villain of the Mushroom Kingdom once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as selfless as an act as that would have been, you felt incredibly embarrassed to be walking around practically naked. Bowser had already disappeared from sight while you were freaking out, and you couldn't exactly go barging into your room, since it wasn't really your room anymore. It would be something you'd expect Bowser to do, but even if you were living his life right now, you weren't Bowser, and weren't about to go and do something so rude. No, you'd have to return to your old life later, but right now you still had the remote, and wanted to find some clothing that would leave you less exposed. You had two options right now; you could stay in Bowser's life and use a clothes swap, or you could swap lives with someone else. Either way would leave you with more to fix if you wanted to turn everything back to normal, but if no one could tell the difference, maybe it wouldn't matter if you didn't swap everything back. Still feeling self-conscious about the fact that you were walking around practically naked, even if no one through it was strange, you head off in search of someone to swap with to obtain some clothing. But which swap do you decide to use?</span></div></div>",

But to your dismay, you were <i>still </i>naked, only this time your spiky armbands were gone! Looking over towards who you had hastily swapped with, you groan as you realize that you only swapped with Greninja, who was now wearing Bowser's armbands and stomping off in a Bowser-like fashion. You were almost tempted to swap back with him, but he already walked off somewhere else, ruling out that option. Now you had more stuff to deal with if you wanted to fix everything later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this...\" you say...or try to say, as it just comes out like \"Ah can't buhleev thith...\". Wait, what? Why were you slurring your words? Glancing down at yourself, you're more than a little shocked to find your own tongue practically pouring out of your mouth, elongated and wrapped around your neck like a scarf and draping down your side. Carefully, you reached up to touch it. You could kind of feel your own touch, but you could hardly taste anything with your now-exposed tongue. That must be why you didn't feel it at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really sure why this specific trait had carried over. Did Greninja use his tongue to battle? You didn't really remember, but you suppose he must use it in at least a few moves. That would explain why it carried over; it is a skill of his, after all. But that didn't make it any less weird and grotesque, so now you <i>really</i> wanted to get out of Greninja's life. You didn't really want people to treat you like a Pokemon anyway. Running down a hall now, you found yourself moving faster than you thought you could, another trait of Greninja's life. This wasn't a terrible perk, but not enough to justify keeping the weird tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, with Greninja's speed, it didn't take you long to find two other fighters talking to each other; and they were both human this time, thankfully. But that didn't make them easy choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Peach, princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. You wouldn't mind being in Peach's life for a while, at least until you got your own life back. She was another princess, like you, and you both lived in the same world, so she would probably be the easiest one to adjust to being. And if you wanted to get your own life back, probably the smarter choice, since you and her were friends. But that would mean giving Peach Greninjas life. You weren't particularly close friends, but you were still friends. Could you do that to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was Link, hero of Hyrule. He was a less appealing option, for a few reasons, but you didn't really know him that well, making it easier to justify giving him this life. Besides, you were going to fix everything later, right? There were a few advantages to being in Links life, one being that he knew most of the people on the tournament grounds, making it easy to get around and talk to people, and potentially find another life if that's what it takes to get yours back. One big problem is that you'd be <i>Zeldas 'boyfriend'</i>, something you weren't sure you were willing to deal with. But it was only temporary, right? You could deal with it for a while if you had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you spent so long dwelling over the choices that they've both said their goodbyes, and have turned to walk away from each other! Not wanting to stay like this for much longer, you point the remote at one of them, and press the Life Swap button...</span></div></div>",

Thinking back, you seem to recall that despite you gaining Greninja's  tongue, Greninja still seemed to have had his identifiable tongue-scarf when he was put into Bowser's life. So maybe the long tongue was a requirement of being Greninja, but it hadn't gone back to normal because having a small tongue wasn't a requirement of being Peach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were worried. Peach had already wandered off with Greninja's life, but right now you didn't particularly care what Peach was doing, despite the fact that she now possessed the same tongue-scarf as you and Greninja.

There had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at the remote held in your now gloved hand, you figure there had to be something this remote could do to fix this. It had already caused you so much trouble, but right now it seemed to be your only way out of living the rest of your life with a tongue-scarf. But how? The manual didn't really mention a way to fix something like this. Maybe one of the other buttons could yield some results. After all, you had only used the life swap button so far. It would be nice if you could just reset everything though. Maybe there was a way to do that that the manual didn't mention.</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, you resign to wait until you get the opportunity to fix this, however long that may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of walking, you make your way to one of the leisure rooms, and plop down on a couch, realizing you don't have to adjust your dress to sit comfortably in this outfit. You'd have gone to your room, but it's not yours anymore, and you're not comfortable going into Mac's. Not right now, anyway. For now, you resign yourself to merely watching the TV, an activity you don't particularly care for. When you're the princess of the stars, you have much more important matters to attend to, and don't really have time for time wasters. But now, you did, and you were wondering if you liked it or not. Maybe you could stay like this for a few more days...no, you couldn't. The Lumas need you. You weren't going to stay like this any more then absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lounged around, though, fingers awkwardly thumbing the remote, you gaze out into the hallway, and watch as the many figures pass by the room you're in. Many fighters and newcomers walk by, including Link and Peach, among others. Peach in particular would have a field day if she saw you watching TV, because try as she might, you never bothered with it before. Instead, she just glances in your direction as she leaves your view, reminding you of your predicament. Several assist trophies wander past, as well, such as Tingle or Midna. Even Pokemon, unconstrained by their Pokeballs, are seen passing by, such as a small and fluffy Eevee...followed by the towering form of Giratina. They just let them wander around the halls when not in use in the tournament?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven other newcomers walk by the door aswell, such as the stubby Villager or the goddess, Palutena. 'Goddess of the Stars'...that had a nice ring to it. No, wait, what were you saying? You really can't use the remote again...or could you? You weren't technically \"you\" at the moment anyway...you were Little Mac. You could always try being somebody else for the time being...not like you didn't have time to kill as it is, anyway. As long as you didn't do anything other then \"Life Swap\",<br>\r\n you could easily return to your own role as yourself when the opportunity presented itself. But the other buttons did make you rather curious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, that would invariably leave the others in incorrect life roles, and you weren't sure that would be fair to anyone else. They would be none the wiser, of course, but that would be rather rude of you. And it'd be hard to adjust to. Maybe settling for being Mac until you can fix this mess would be the best option. You were the princess of the star's, after all. It'd be uncharacteristic to doom everyone else to random, unfitting lives for a little bit of fun. But, again, they wouldn't be aware of it, and wouldn't mind...Maybe...</span></div></div>",

Stepping out into the hallway, you take a look around as others walk by you, paying you the same amount of attention they'd pay Little Mac himself. There's veteran fighters, who you wouldn't mind borrowing the life of temporarily. Specifically, Peach or Zelda, as you'd atleast be treated like a princess again. But the others...maybe. Other newcomers passed you by aswell, such as Palutena, a goddess you wouldn't mind being, if only for a little while, and Megaman, which intrigued you. What would it be like to be a robot? Probably cold and uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, many of the assist trophies pass by you, and you again catch the sight of the short but somewhat cute Midna. You weren't sure how the others treated her, considering she wasn't a fighter, but if you recall correctly Link was fond of her...and she'd be an inconspicuous form to lay low as until the newcomer training began. And several non-fighter Pokemon make their way through the halls, without a trainer of any sort to watch them, though they seemed very well behaved. They would be very peculiar to swap with, for sure, but... it'd be interesting, at least. Maybe even fun. Although you weren't too keen on being treated like an animal, in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a lot of options at the moment, and it was almost daunting.

You wonder whether his interest in playing video games would transfer to you if you switch with him. Palutena, on the other hand, was heading towards the library. You didn't know what a goddess like her would be reading in a library but you also consider that she probably didn't get to do what she normally did in her free time because of the restrictions the Hands put on using abilities outside of regulated areas.</span></div></div>",

He really couldn't be more different than you had been before this, so he seemed like a good candidate to swap with. You aim the remote at him, and pressed the button, being whisked away from Little Mac's life and into that of Mega Man. Unfortunately for you, Mega Man was a robot, and thus he didn't wear clothes, which meant you found yourself down the hallway where Mega Man had been, entirely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp at the sudden transition, and the sudden lack of clothes, or at least you would, but you were technically a robot now, and thus you didn't breath. Everything felt so different. Your mind was filled with all the data Mega Man had stored within him, and that included everything within his variable weapons system. You weren't entirely sure how you'd use some of them, since you had a human hand and not one that could transform into an arm cannon, but you suppose you'd figure that out if the time came that you'd need to use them. More concerning right now was that you had no clothes on. You quickly look around for someone to perform the clothes swap with. Even though no one saw anything out of the ordinary when they looked at you, it didn't stop you from being embarrassed by walking around in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mega Man!\" you hear someone say behind you. You turn around, resisting the urge to cover up your private parts with your hands, and find that the source of the voice is Villager, one of the other newcomers, who was leaning out of the doorway of the leisure room. \"You ready?\" Mega Man's memories tell you that the two had planned to play some games together before the newcomer training session. You kind of wanted to sort out your clothing situation first, but you didn't want to make Villager suspicious. No one saw anything wrong with you being naked, so maybe you could just try to ignore it for now.</span></div></div>",

You knock on his door, peering down at the box under your arm, rocking back and forth nervously. Not long after knocking, the door opens to reveal the Blue Bomber himself, Mega Man. \"Oh, hey Little Mac,\" he says, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I need a little help. Can I come in?\" You still find it a little off-putting that he calls you Little Mac, but hopefully he can help you sort things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He steps aside so you can come in, which you do, before closing the door behind you. He sits down on the bed and asks, \"So, how can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... the thing is, I'm not Little Mac. I'm Rosalina.\" He looks more than a little confused at this. \"I'm serious. I just, found this remote on the ground and I accidentally pressed a button and I switched lives with Mac and he ran off before I realised what happened and I couldn't switch back.\" You take a few deep breaths, before offering the box with the remote and manual in it to him. \"Here's the remote and the instruction manual. I thought since you're a robot you might be able to help me with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes the box off of you and reads through the manual. As weird as it was for you, you do realise how weird it must be for Mega Man as well, to see Little Mac acting this way. \"Well, the manual explains it, but unless we find Little Mac in your life, I'm not sure if we can do anything.\" You let out a sigh. That was not what you wanted to hear. \"I'll have a look at the remote though. Maybe I can find something the manual missed.\" You stand in his room awkwardly, feeling a little exposed in Little Mac's outfit, as Mega Man carefully examines the remote. You note that he doesn't actually press any of the buttons on the front, not wanting to mess something up. After a while, he squints at an area on the front of the remote and beckons you to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this little slit here?\" Her points to a spot on the front of the remote, under the buttons. Looking closely, you can see a small slit in the metallic surface of the remote. You nod. \"It seems to be some sort of a secret panel. See if you can open it up. I don't have fingernails so I can't really do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the remote from him, you fit your fingernail (which you noted was shorter than before) in the slit and try to wiggle it open. Just as Mega Man had suggested, a panel pops open, revealing 6 small coloured buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought,\" he says. \"Give me a second to see if I can analyse them without actually pressing them.\" You hand the remote back to him so he can figure out what the buttons do. You're not exactly sure how how he's doing it, but you presume it's some sort of robot thing. After a little while, he looks a little surprised. He mumbles to himself, \"So if I press this one...\" He points the remote at himself and presses the orange button. Had it been anyone else, you would probably have tried to stop them, but you hoped Mega Man knew what he was doing. He looks up at you, a little excited and says, \"Well, now I can actually see you as Rosalina wearing Mac's clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face lights up with joy as he at least makes a little progress. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. The orange button makes the person you're pointing the remote at aware of any swaps that have happened, and any that will happen later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you know I'm telling the truth then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all though. If you press the blue button, it will undo the last swap you've done. Just, leave my room before you press it so I don't have Mac confused about why he came to see me.\" He hands you back the remote with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Thank you so much for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. I can explain the other buttons once you have your own life back, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after this little encounter, I'm not sure I still want the remote anymore. What if something goes wrong again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the reset and undo buttons are for.\" Seeing you were still a bit fearful of what the remote could do, he makes a suggestion. \"How about once you have your own life back, you come back here and we try swapping something in a very controlled environment, so you can try it out without anything going wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds... interesting. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Now go ahead and get back to your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. I'll be back before you know it.\" With that you exit Mega Man's room. You had never been so excited for things to be normal. Being very careful not to press the wrong button, you press the blue button, and suddenly find yourself in your room, putting some library books on a shelf, instead of in the hallway. Looking down at yourself, you find that you are back in your usual clothes. A large smile spreads across your face. You're back to being you again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a voice behind you. \"Mama? Are you okay? You just stopped in the middle of what you were saying.\" You turn to see that the one speaking to you is Luma, the small yellow star child who wanted to accompany you in the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Luma, don't worry.\" You don't want to worry your child, so you do your best not to let the past however many minutes spent in Little Mac's life affect the way you speak to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"  You notice he is pointing at the remote. Looks like there's not getting around this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long explanation of what happened, and pressing the orange button for Luma so he'd know what was happening. After that, the two of you head over to Mega Man's room. The door opens almost as soon as you knock, revealing Mega Man with a big smile on his face. \"Good to see you back to normal. Come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while, but Mega Man eventually explains all the secret buttons to you, and you've labeled them. The blue one is labeled 'Undo', the red one 'Reset', the yellow 'Set', and the green 'Scramble', the orange 'Aware', and the purple 'Unaware'. After all that, Mega Man gets up off his bed and stands in the middle off the room. \"Well, if you want to try and swap something in a controlled environment so we can make sure nothing goes wrong, now's the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to swap something with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that way we can make sure whoever you swap with doesn't wander off before you can swap back. Although I guess that isn't a problem now that we have the undo button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Looking over the different types of swaps, you wonder which one you might try. You end up deciding on a...</span></div></div>",

It seemed like an interesting choice, especially now that you didn't have to worry about your old body walking away if you wanted to swap back. In an instant, your perspective had changed. You were on the other side of the room, where Mega Man had been standing, and your point of view was closer to the ground. Instead of your usual flesh and blood body below your neck, you could feel cold metal and mechanical parts, and looking down at your own body, or now Mega Man's body, confirms this. You move about a little to get a better look, and find your movements need to be a little more forced to control Mega Man's mechanical body. It feels so surreal, to have a living human head, but a mechanical robot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Mega Man, who is amazed at how freely he can move about with your body. \"So this is what it feels like to be human,\" he says to himself. It looks a little odd to see his robot head atop your shoulders, but you suppose your look just as strange. Since you had made Luma aware of the swaps he flies over to you and exclaims, \"Wow Mama! You're a robot!\" You can't help but giggle. This situation was so surreal, almost like you had dreamed the whole thing up, except it felt so real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you and Mega Man are done trying out eachother's bodies, you both sit down on Mega Man's bed. \"So,\" he says, \"This change your mind about keeping the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, definitely.\" Now that you had tried something out with Mega Man, your mischievous side was starting to come out. \"In fact, I think it might be fun to have a little play around with other people who don't know about the remote. A lot of other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMega Man seems to like your suggestion. \"Sounds like fun. So, how many other people are we talking? Like, the other newcomers amount of people, or everyone in the tournament amount of people?\"</span></div></div>",

Now we've just got to decide an order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea for that too.\" He gets up, still not used to how light your body felt, and gets a bit of paper and a pen. On the paper, he writes the names of all the newcomers except Pac-Man, including the two on you, in a circle. \"This is the order we arrived at the tournament.

Like Mega Man, you wanted a new experience, and you thought the best bodies for that would be Mega Man's, which you currently had, and Greninja's. Neither of them were human, or at least something like a human (since Palutena was actually a goddess), and it could allow you to experience something you wouldn't be able to otherwise for however long the two of you wanted to leave the newcomers swapped. You could always have swapped with Villager or Little Mac to hop the gender fence, but you figured there was plenty of time for that later, and right now you wanted something a little more extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure out who would get who's body for each choice. If you chose to stick with Mega Man's body, then Mega Man would get Palutena's body, Palutena would get Little Mac's, Little Mac would get Wii Fit Trainer's body, Wii Fit Trainer would get Villager's body, Villager would get Greninja's, and lastly, Greninja would get yours. If you chose Greninja's body, then the pairs of heads to bodies would just be reversed. Interestingly, no matter which way you chose, everyone would get a body that wasn't the same species as them, or was the opposite gender to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of consideration, you decide you want to have the body of...</span></div></div>",

You lean against the wall and flip through the manual, intrigued by this strange piece of technology. According to manual, the device could alter reality itself, and leave everyone except the user none the wiser. This was certainly a powerful artifact indeed, and one you were curious to try out. You look down either side of the hallway you're in, and find two possible test subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one end, you see your boyfriend and the hero of Hyrule, Link. You weren't sure you wanted to mess with him too much, but at least if you swapped with him, any traits you lost would be close by if you wanted them back. At the other end of the hallway was the fire-type pokemon. Charizard. Swapping with him certainly seemed more interesting, as he wasn't human, but you didn't see Charizard as often as you did Link. In fact, with how often Charizard was late to meals, or with how quickly he ate, there were many days were you wouldn't see him at all. You didn't want to, for instance, give yourself a firey reptilian body below your neck, and then not have an opportunity to get your own body back before the tournament was over and you had to go back to your own world.

That'd be kind of like the head swap, except you'd have Link's face as well, and you'd be looking at your own face whenever you looked at him. You'd get to keep your dress too. Of course, you could also put Link's body in a dress by using the clothes swap option. Except that way, you'd actually get to see Link wearing the dress, and you'd get to use both your magic, and Link's weapons in the tournament. Then there was the relationship swap for a more subtle change. You had no problem with your circle of friends, but it might be nice to switch things up and hang out with Mario and Pit every now and then instead of Peach and Samus. Plus, if you understood the manual correctly, that'd technically make you the man in the relationship between you and Link, which could be amusing. Lastly was the gender swap, where you could still be yourself, but you'd be Prince Zelda, and Link would be the heroine of Hyrule. It could be interesting to try out.</span></div></div>",

A life swap seemed rather interesting as well. You would have the body of a princess, but everyone would treat you like a large dragon creature.

It was an interesting experience to say the least. You walk forward a few steps to see how moving around feels, although stomping would be more 'accurate' than 'walking'. You feel a little slower and more cumbersome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou briefly consider swapping back, but find that's impossible for now, as Charizard has wandered off with your body, effectively preventing you from getting it back. You had initially wanted to try this out, but now it seemed a little big and awkward for you to control. But what could you do about it? Charizard had left with your body.

You'd expected this, however that didn't make the act of suddenly becoming naked any less embarrassing. You momentarily stop and cover up your genitals, and you gather looks by the other fighters walking by. But they weren't looks of lust or shock, they were looks of confusion, and it dawned on you. When is the last time you saw Charizard cover up? Never. Realizing how strange you looked doing so, you slowly remove your hands from yourself, and allow the cool air to encompass your whole body. It was a unique feeling, being so free. Not having to worry about being clothed, and being able to walk around buck naked without a care in the world. You make a mental note to clothes swap Charizard later after getting your own life back, just because of how nice it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut realizing that you've spent far too long looking at yourself, so you look up, and stifle a laugh. Charizard is wearing your dress, alright. Despite the proportions being modified to fit his body, it still looked completely ridiculous, as his large tail lifted up the back end of it, giving you a clear view of your own underwear. It was an amusing sight, to be sure. If you didn't know any better, you could swear people were glancing at his...well, if people thought he was you, and your dress was positioned in such a way, they'd probably do the same. Looking at his face, he had your crown and jewelry aswell, along with your lightly applied make-up. The whole thing looked quite silly, and you were liking this swap more and more by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you noticed something odd. He was...talking to Link? But Charizard's couldn't talk... \"Char-\" you begin and immediately cover your mouth. Slowly removing your hand, you try to speak. \"Char-i-zard...\" you say, speaking slowly. That was an unintended side-effect if you ever saw one! You were still making the sounds in your own voice, of course, but you were completely unable to speak! You suppose that was in-character with being the fire breathing dragon (or atleast, to appear as one to anyone else) but it was concerning nonetheless. But you were able to deal with it for now. The pro of being able to streak while nobody batted an eye, or looked at you in a sexual manner at all, heavily outweighed the con of being unable to talk, at least for now. Besides, this was temporary, you were fine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking back towards the dragon who thinks he's you, you suddenly realize that he's gone. \"Char.\" you groan. You were in no hurry to get out of this body, at least for now, but if you wanted to do it now, you'd have a little difficulty. Looking around at the other combatants, all disregarding you as if you were a pokemon, you wonder...what if you swapped with someone else, and got your life back later? That'd doom somebody else to the life of a Pokemon, but if they didn't notice or mind...did it matter? You were quite curious...</span></div></div>",

After a while, you tried to release it, and a burst of flames erupted from your mouth, scorching the sandbag. \"Woah,\" you muttered. Or, at least you would have if you could speak normally, it ended up sounding more like \"Char.\" Amazingly, despite the fact you had just spewed fire from your mouth, you couldn't feel any burns in your throat or mouth, just a bit of warmth that was slowly fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to try something a little more tricky, you take a few steps back so you can get a running start. As you charge at the sandbag, you concentrate on the warmth in your chest again, before leaping head first at the sandbag. You body catches alight as you fly through the air, but it doesn't hurt. The pain only comes when you collide with the sandbag, which sends the sandbag flying across the room, and you backwards a little onto your back. You let out a bit of a laugh at how powerful you felt with these moves. Since the sandbag you were using was now across the room, you move to a different one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard's up special was Fly, which would be rather self explanatory if you had wings. You weren't really sure what to concentrate on for this move, so your just focused and tried to push yourself off of the ground. Surprisingly, you find yourself lifted into the air, knocking the sandbag away in the process, before you slowly fall back down. Since you had all of Charizard's abilities, you'd probably be able to fly longer than that, but while in battle you'd be limited to using Fly like that. You'd definitely like to try out flying for longer one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final special was the down special, Rock Smash. Charizard always seemed to pull a rock out of nowhere when he did that move. You tried to bring a rock out the same way you summoned a phantom for your down special, and it miraculously works. A large boulder appears in your arms. It so large you can barely get your arms around it, but you seem to have no problem holding its weight. You grin at the strength that came with Charizard's life. Thinking back to how Charizard performed the move, you recall he'd smash the rock by banging his head into it. That sounded a little painful, but you decide to try it anyway. You pull back your head, and then swing it forward, headbutting the boulder. It is surprisingly painless, and the boulder shatters, sending three parts flying towards the sandbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your hands on your hips, quite satisfied with this training session. You were able to perform all of Charizard's special moves, despite having your own body, and it felt great. You'd still like to know what Mega Evolution felt like, but the Hands only let items other than the sandbags out of storage for actual matches, so you'd have to wait until one of the practice matches if you wanted to try it out. Now you weren't entirely sure what to do. You still had the remote,so if you wanted, you could try out someone else's life, or try one of the other swaps. You could also just keep Charizard's life for now and see how different other things were.</span></div></div>",

The body swap button would give you Charizard's body entirely, but you'd still be wearing the same clothes you've always worn.

Speaking of clothes, you could do a clothes swap, making Charizard wear your dress, and letting you walk around naked and have everyone think it was normal. It would be a little strange, having almost everything normal in your world except for the fact that people would expect you to wear absolutely nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the relationship swap. People would still believe you were Princess Zelda, albeit a princess of Kanto rather than Hyrule, but you'd be friends mainly with Pokemon instead of other human Smashers. You'd be curious to see how your relationship with Charizard's trainer, Red, would be when the tournament was over, but that'd leave you stuck with no way to return to Hyrule until the next tournament, so you figured you should probably leave your experimenting to within the bounds of the tournament. Lastly, the was the gender swap. Not being an expert on Pokemon, you weren't sure how much would change about Charizard if you were to make him into a female, but no doubt you'd end up changing greatly. It made you curious about what it was like to be a man, but after a while if you wanted to swap back, would you remember that it was Charizard you had swapped with? You couldn't really tell what his gender was aside from what people had told you, so if you didn't remember, you'd probably have to turn one of your fellow female Smashers into a man if you wanted your old form back.</span></div></div>",

Within seconds, your Hylian body is replaced with Charizard's orange, dragon-like form, as he receives yours. You find that despite the huge change in your body, you are still wearing the same clothes, only adjusted to fit your new body. This also meant Charizard was currently naked in your body, but no one would see anything out of the ordinary so it didn't matter. What did matter is you now needed to remember to keep your new tail low enough that it didn't lift up your dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about your new body felt so different, it was hard to describe. Aside from the addition of wings and a tail, your proportions were very different, with a much longer neck, skinnier arms, and thicker legs. Your facial structure was completely different, as were your hands and feet. The oddest feeling of all of this was the extra appendages to control, however. You were used to just have two arms and two legs, so adding a tail and two wings onto that felt almost like you had too much to control. And you could definitely validate your earlier assumption that Charizard was male, as you certainly couldn't feel anything resembling your old female parts hidden within your panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you say in almost a whisper. You are surprised that you can still manage to speak properly despite having Charizard's voice. You assume Charizard can still only make growling noises and roars even though he has your voice now. Along with keeping your old ability to speak, you can still feel the Triforce of Wisdom with you, and the magic power you relied on for your attacks. Which probably meant you had kept all your own skills while Charizard had retained his. You were curious as to how Charizard was supposed to fly without wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your immense transformation, possibly the most interesting part of the swap was the no one seemed to notice. No one thought it was odd that Charizard and your bodies had swapped places, but kept your original clothes. You could mess around with reality as much as you liked thanks to this remote, and no one would notice if you didn't want them to. You grin, flashing your sharp reptilian teeth, as you realise how much fun you could have with this little device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a grunt that sounds like your old voice, as Charizard begins to walk off. You weren't sure where he was going, so if you wanted your body back any time soon, you'd have to do it now. Of course, you didn't have to take your body back; you could just keep Charizard's for now and see how that went. Or, since you still had the remote, you could always try out someone else's body. Turning into a large dragon-like creature like Charizard had been interesting, but there were plenty of other things you could become here at the tournament.</span></div></div>",

That's why you came to this tournament when you heard that Kirby had been invited here long ago. Metaknight followed you, and now once again the three of you were here, getting ready for the big tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou liked the tournament. You didn't quite trust the Hands, but there was nothing like having an excuse to bash people and not get in trouble for it. Even better, sometimes you got to attack your hated enemy (or at least annoying friendly rival) Kirby. It was a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were strutting around the place, heading to your quarters, when you spotted a small box on the floor. You wouldn't have cared, but it was in your way. And you wouldn't have picked it up, but no one else was around. So you gave a small snort of annoyance and picked it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the box. Inside was a remote and a manual. You read the manual, if only to find the owner and get that smug moment of talking down to them for littering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manual, however, was very interesting. If it was right, the remote had the incredible power of swapping aspects without others realizing that reality had been altered. Now that you knew it was a valuable object, you \"ruled\" that Finders Keepers applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what to do with it? On the one hand, you could use the remote yourself.

You had been practicing and no longer used them in battle, so this would be a good way to get them to stop slacking off and do something. And if the remote messed up, this would be safer for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. If you weren't touching the remote, you wouldn't be aware of the swaps. On the one hand, as long as they stayed loyal to you (and why wouldn't they?) you didn't have to be aware of the swaps. As long as things went your way, you'd know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, maybe it'd be more fun if you were holding the remote as they pushed the buttons.

It grew a little tedious sometimes, but you were happy to help out where you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were heading to the gym, as you wanted to get a little more training in before the Hands started organising practice matches, when you noticed a small box lying in the hallway. Curiosity got the better of you, so you pick up the box and check what was inside. Inside seemed to be some sort of remote and an instruction booklet. A quick look through the manual reveals that this remote is far more advanced than it looked. Far more advanced than anything your world, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit you were curious about how it worked, or whether it worked at all. The easiest way to find out would to be try it yourself. Pressing the buttons with your paws might not be the easiest thing to do, but you were sure you could do it if you tried. However, you also wondered why this device was here. During the last tournament, the Hands had recruited a Manaphy to assist in battles using it's Heart Swap move, but Heart Swap was temporary, and this remote's instruction manual mentioned nothing of the sort. Not only did it not seem to be temporary like Heart Swap, but it could also happen without anyone being aware of the changes, making it unsuitable for something to be used in the tournament. You had a feeling this had probably been brought without the hands being aware of it. Perhaps it would be best to hand it in, and ensure they were aware this item was here.</span></div></div>",

You had just had a major training session with your trainer, Doc Louis, at the gym, and you had now parted way so you could go relax. Even though Doc was allowed to come to the main gym to help you with your training, he wasn't participating in the tournament himself so he had to stay in the living quarters for assists and background characters. On your way to the leisure room, you happened to notice a box lying on the ground. You thought maybe someone had dropped it, but the hallway seemed deserted, so you picked it up yourself. Inside was a strange looking remote, as well as a manual explaining how to use it. After a little read of the manual, you can hardly believe that this is real. You wonder what you could do with this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that comes to your mind is that you could make yourself taller. Even though you used your size to your advantage in boxing, you had always been picked on for your height, and this could be your chance to change that. Thanking about who you could swap with, Link seemed like a good choice. He was taller than you, but he also seemed strong enough that you could still hit just as hard after the swap. You thought about going off to find him and perform a body swap, but in the corner of your eye you see a flash of green. Someone is running through an intersection in the hallway, obviously in a hurry to get somewhere. You turn to see if it's the guy you're looking for, but before you get a clear view, you've already accidentally pressed the button and swapped bodies with them. Looking down in shock, you see that instead of Link's body, you've ended up with the body of...</span></div></div>",

This freaks you out a little, but what freaks you out more was that your point of view didn't get higher off the ground, it got lower. You quickly catch a glimpse of your old body running through the hallway in a bright green tunic before disappearing again. It seems you did swap with Link, just not the Link you were hoping for. There was no way you'd catch up to him with your short stubby legs now. Not only did you not like being even shorter than you were before, but you definitely didn't like having you head feel so massive. It was like its weight could cause you to fall over. You probably wouldn't see Toon Link again until dinner, so you'd have to wait until then if you wanted your own body back, but you definitely weren't waiting until then to get out of his. You wander the hallways looking for someone, anyone, who was taller then you currently were to swap bodies with. And as luck would have it, you came across such a person, and that person was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As luck would have it, while trying to find someone taller than you, you happen across the tallest person you know, one of your fellow newcomers, Rosalina. Considering you still wanted to be a hard-hitting fighter, she certainly wouldn't have been your first choice, none of the girls would have been, but right now you just wanted to get out of Toon Link's tiny body, so you'd even take becoming a woman right now. Making sure she didn't see you, you aim the remote at her and press the body swap button. Once again, there is pretty much no warning that anything is happening, but this time your point of view shoots up away from the floor. \"Phew,\" you mumble, \"I'm not a midget anymore.\" You quickly put a hand over your mouth, shocked by the very feminine voice that escaped it. You figured you should probably take a look at the body you'd be in until you found a more suitable one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was that you were no loner seeing out of both eyes, as your right eye is now covered up by Rosalina's pale blonde hair. Since you hand is already held up to your face, you take note of your changed facial structure. Your nose and mouth are a lot smaller, your eyes larger, and your jawline a lot softer. Done with your face, you focus on the rest on your body. Looking down, you are first greeted with two lumps of flesh sticking out of your tank top. You had certainly never viewed a pair of breasts from this angle before. Trying to ignore them for the time being, you take stock of the rest of your body. While you had certainly gained a lot of height, you had lost a lot of muscle mass. Your arms and fingers were very slender, as were your legs and waist. That in itself wouldn't have been too bad, but Rosalina's skinnier body combined with her larger hips made for an experience you never thought you'd experience, nor one that you wanted to. Not to mention how it felt to have Rosalina's 'lady parts'. This felt very strange to you, and you were definitely wanting your old body back as soon as possible, but since you were forced to keep this body, or someone else's, until you found Toon Link again, maybe you'd have changed your tune by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up, you see Rosalina at the other end of the hallway with Toon Link's body. Perhaps it was because you were a bit far away and were only seeing with one eye, but Rosalina's clothes didn't seem too bad on Toon Link's body. Maybe if his hair was a little longer, you'd barely be able to tell something was out of place. Since you had no desire to go back to Toon Link's body, that would probably be Rosalina's permanent look from now on. You let out a laugh at the thought of one of the tallest competitors in the tournament now being the shortest, but because of your voice it ended up sounding more like a feminine giggle, and you stop immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about what to do now. It was still a few hours before dinner, so you weren't going to be able to get your body back until then. Having just gotten a new body, you weren't as tired from your workout, so you could try to see just how much of your old power had been retained with your new body at the gym. The manual said that if you performed a life swap you'd receive any skills needed for that life, such as your boxing skill and power, but since you still had your old life, perhaps you could hit just as hard with Rosalina's body as you could your own. And while you were there, perhaps you'd come across someone else to swap with to give you a less feminine body to deal with until dinner, or just to try out some of the other functions of the remote if you got used to Rosalina's body. Of course, you could just head back to your room and get used to her body in private. You still needed to put the manual and the box the remote came from away so you didn't lose it.</span></div></div>",

When you get there, you put the remote and the manual in your pocket, and throw the box in the bin, before putting your boxing gloves back on. Just like the rest of your clothes, the gloves have been resized to fit Rosalina's smaller hands. This bothers you a little, but you decide to test your strength before laying your final judgement. Once you're all ready, you walk up the one of the sandbags and attack it with full force. You can feel Rosalina's slender limbs flying with as much power and force as your own muscley arms used to. A grin starts to form on your face as you continue to work the back. You shuffle around the bag, punching it from different angles, and find that you're just as light on Rosalina's feet as you were on yours. Giving the bag one final uppercut, you manage to punch the bag off its chain. Breathing a little heavily, you sit down to take your gloves off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a large smile on your face for the first time since you found that remote. It seemed that you were just as strong and fast with Rosalina's body as you were with your own. As long as you didn't swap out of your own life, it didn't matter what you looked like, you were still just as hard a hitter as ever. As an added bonus, the workout had gotten you more used to Rosalina's body and the way it felt. Now that you knew you could still fight the same with her body, you weren't as concerned about how soon you'd get your body back, and how much you'd get used to having someone else's body. In fact, the only downside you saw to this encounter was that your new breasts were a little sore. Since you had only swapped your body, but still kept your old clothes, your breasts weren't supported by a bra, so all the movement from your workout hadn't exactly been the best for them. You thought about trying out the clothes swap feature on one of the girls in the tournament so that your breasts would have a bit of support, but then that would also mean giving up your boxing gloves. Some of the competitors in the tournament wore armor or other things that just wouldn't be too nice to punch bare handed, so you were now comparing in your head whether that would be worse than having your breasts be sore after every fight. You didn't even realise, but you were thinking of Rosalina's body as yours, and you were thinking about things as if you would be keeping it permanently. Either way, you decide to head to the leisure room to relax, just as you were going to do after your first training session with Doc Louis before you found the remote.</span></div></div>",

That would definitely be interesting for you to wear, but you recall that Samus was participating twice in this year's tournament, once with her power suit and once without. Since swapping clothes with her would likely give you her power suit as well, you think that might mean you'll be the one participating twice. Thinking it over a little, it doesn't seem like too bad an idea. You were only a newcomer in this year's tournament, but if you could participate twice, you could prove twice as much how strong you were to the others. You get the remote out of your pocket, point it at Samus, and press clothes swap. In an instant, Samus is walking away in your old clothes, boxing gloves hanging around her neck. She also has her hair hanging loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking yourself, you find Samus' skin tight zero suit clinging to your body. You hadn't been able to see your body clearly underneath your old clothes, but with the zero suit you could see every single curve down your body. You can feel that your hair has been done up in a ponytail, although your right eye is still covered. You look down to see Samus' rocket boots on your feet. The remote should have made it so that you could walk in them without a problem, so maybe they could help to improve your speed and recovery during battle, or even use them for mid air attacks where your punching might fail. You move about a bit, since the point of this exercise you to get something to support your breasts. Thanks to the zero suit, no matter how much you moved around, your breasts barely moved. Content with your outfit and body now, you continue to walk towards the leisure room, hips swaying with each step. You notice that since your new zero suit had no pockets, the manual had moved into your free hand. This didn't bother you too much though. You just needed to make sure no one saw it or the remote itself and asked about it.</span></div></div>",

You sit down on the couch and cross your legs in a feminine manner, before placing the remote on your lap and reading through the manual again. You had been reading through it rather quickly when you first found it, so now you wanted to read through it thoroughly to make sure you hadn't missed anything. While you were absorbed in reading the manual, you didn't notice one of your fellow newcomers, Wii Fit Trainer, enter the room. That is, until she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you realise she was here, you quickly try to hide the manual behind your back or something. You fail to realise that it would have been a lot less suspicious if you had just continued reading as if normal. \"H-hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe furrows her brow at this action, and walks over behind the couch, leaning her arms on the back of it. \"Mac, what are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to remain calm, and fail miserably. \"I have no idea what you're talking about, Fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches over the couch and picks up the remote, which was still sitting on your lap out in the open, and holds it up in front of you. \"What's this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as she picks up the remote. You sincerely hope she didn't press any buttons when she did that, but you guess if she did she would have noticed the swap and freaked out. \"Careful with that!\" You take the remote out of her hand, being careful not to swap anything with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a serious look. \"Out with it Mac. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, knowing there's no way out of this. \"It's a remote that can somehow alter reality. It can swap things like bodies and clothes and stuff, and it makes it so everyone thinks the changes are normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's crazy,\" she says. Clearly she doesn't believe you. \"Uh, don't use it on me yet, though.\" Okay, maybe she believed you a little bit. \"Have you used it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, three times actually. The first time I accidentally gave my body away and the person with it ran off, so I had to use the remote a second time to get a body that was better than the one I accidentally got. And then the third time I wanted some clothes that'd help with my new body, so I just took them off someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you look the same as always.\" You are about to explain that the remote makes everyone think it's normal, but before you can she makes a face and said, \"Oh, derr, you already explained that. So, is there any way to make me see the changes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it said in the manual. But maybe the manual didn't say everything.\" You look over the remote closely. There wasn't anything but a smooth surface on the back, and the buttons on the front had all been clearly explained in the manual. However, looking really closely, you saw that there saw actually a small slit in the remote below where the buttons were on the front. Trying to pick at the slit with your fingernails, you manage to remove a panel, revealing 6 coloured buttons, that aren't labeled besides their colour. You point the remote at Wii Fit Trainer and say, \"One of these hidden ones should probably do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFit's eyes widen as you do this. \"Woah! You just found 6 more buttons that you don't even know what they do, and you want to try testing random ones on me?\" But before she can object any further, you've already pressed the...</span></div></div>",

You think it worked. Once she gets over the initial shock of going from unaware to aware, she begins to laugh, realising who it was inside the body she was looking at. \"Is that really you in there, Mac?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me.\" You blush a little, remembering that you were once a buff boxer, but now you had the body of a princess in a skintight suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why do you look like Rosalina? With... Samus' clothes?\" She still can't stop herself laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like I said, the first swap was an accident. I was looking to swap with Link so I'd be just as strong, but I'd be a little taller, but I ended up getting a little trigger happy. Instead of ending up with Link's body, I got Toon Link's.\" The giggles pick up as Fit pictures your reaction to getting even shorter. \"I didn't like being in Toon Link's body, so I just went to look for anyone taller than I was at the time, and Rosalina happened to be the first person I ran into. Since I wouldn't know where Toon Link would be with my body until dinner time, so I decided to see just how strong I'd be with Rosalina's body. As it turns out, because I still have my own life, I still have all the strength I had in my old body, even though I have Rosalina's now.\" Fit looks shocked by this, finding it hard to imagine Rosalina's body executing the incredibly strong punches you used. \"The workout also got me a bit used to how it felt to be in Rosalina's body, but my... uh,\" you pause, realising how awkward this would be. \"My breasts were a bit sore from the workout because I didn't have a bra.\" Fit erupted into laughter at this. You had a bit of a laugh with her too. Once the two of you calmed down, you continued your story. \"So, I decided I wanted to swap clothes with one of the girls in the tournament so I had a little... uh, support, and Samus happened to be the first one I found. And that's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Fit says in between fits of laughter, \"That certainly explains it. So, are you keeping Rosalina's body now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that I know I keep my strength regardless of my body, getting my own body back isn't much of a concern anymore, and I have gotten used to Rosalina's body, so I guess I'll be keeping it until I feel like a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I guess I'll have to get used to you being a girl then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I only look like a girl. Because I still have my own life, people should still treat me like a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's interesting.\" After a pause, with a silly grin on her face, no doubt due to the situation you've gotten yourself into with Rosalina's body, she asks, \"So am I going to be aware to every swap you do now, or is it just these ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" You don't know how to answer. The coloured buttons hadn't been explained in the manual, probably because they were supposed to be a secret, so you didn't actually know how they worked. You didn't even know what the other ones did, just that the orange button had made Fit aware to your changes. \"I'm not actually sure.\" Then an idea hits you. \"I do know how we can find out though.\" You hold up the remote, waving it around in the air. \"I could swap something with you and see if you notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was possible for Fit's face to get any paler, then that's what just happened. \"Uh, I don't know about that.\" Her voice was a bit shakey, and her stance was very defensive. Clearly she was worried about something going wrong, like ending up in a similar predicament to you, or you not wanting to give whatever you swapped with her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo try and ease her worries, you toss the manual to her. \"Here, you can choose what we swap if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" As she read what the remote could do, it was clear she was very interested, but at the same time worrying about how each of them would affect her. \"Um, let's try a...\"</span></div></div>",

There were many rooms, far more than there were for the main characters, but apparently they were smaller too. Fortunately you knew which room was his so you were able to reach it pretty quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked on the door and took in the telltale smell of chocolate as the man whose room this was opened the door and smiled, \"Hey, Little Mac!

Old bones just aren't what they used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him. He has been your coach all this time. Maybe you could use the remote to help him out. On the one hand, you could tell him about the remote and let him use it. But you're not sure it's best to tell anyone about the remote, even your coach. Maybe it'd be better to use the remote to switch bodies with him instead. You don't expect him to be going anywhere anytime soon, so it'd be like keeping your new body safe while you went out and switched with someone else. Then you could return and switch back.</span></div></div>",

Give me a day or two and I'll find a place for you.\" His red shirt and blue pants had resized themselves to fit his new frame, and they did so very well.

You were still as strong and fast as you were in Rosalina's or your original body, but you still felt fat and out of shape.

You start running in the direction you saw Palutena in your old body going to and you notice all the different sensations of your new body. Your now long green hair swishing around you and hitting your back, neck and face. The way your hips swayed while you ran. The empty feeling between your legs. And most noticeably, the way your new breasts bounced with each step you took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel tired after a few minutes of running so you stop to catch your breath. You figured your new body didn't have as much stamina as your old one.  While catching your breath, you notice that you had ran all the way to the library. You never really came here often because you were usually training in the gym. You take a look at the people who were currently there. The only people inside were Peach, Zelda and Rosalina. All of them were too busy reading books, and in Peach's case a magazine, to notice you. Your also saw that your old body was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter failing to find your original body, you think about what you should do next. The original plan was to swap bodies with Link. You would prefer that Palutena get her body back before you swapped with Link since she was a goddess and she couldn't be one if she was a guy. So the first thing you had to do was switch back with Palutena. You still wanted to get out of her body as quickly as possible but thought that trying to find your old body seemed like a lost cause for now anyway. You figured that you could always wait till dinner time to swap back with Palutena if you didn't run into her for the rest of the day. Now you try to decide what to do while you are in Palutena's body. You consider going about your day normally and try to ignore the fact that you were currently in Palutena's body. While you were thinking, you realize that your chest felt very sore. You may have swapped bodies with Palutena but you still had your original set of clothes so while you were running your breasts were bouncing around unsupported. You figured that maybe you should try and solve that problem first before doing anything else but swapping further would give you more problems to try and fix before you can have Link's body.</span></div></div>",

You were, however, surprised that they wanted you and Lucina to compete, rather than Chrom. Chrom wasn't mad or upset though, he was more proud of the two of you being chosen to compete in the same tournament as the Hero-King, and he ended up being able to tag along as part of your \"Final Smash\", some sort of ultimate attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had enjoyed your time at the tournament so far. All the fights were non-life threatening, the people were pretty friendly, you had actually gotten to meet Marth and Ike, and you had been able to learn some new tactics based on the strategies used by people from other worlds. In fact, you were actually heading to the library to return some books that you had borrowed. Or at least, you would be heading there, if you hadn't noticed that someone had left a box lying in the middle of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's this? Did someone leave it here?\" you wonder aloud.  You put your books down for a moment to check what's inside the box. \"Can't be too important if someone just left it here.\" Inside the box was some sort of remote control and a small booklet possibly an instruction manual of some kind. \"Hm, well, it's clearly more advanced than what we have in our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading through the booklet, you find out that the remote is not, in fact, for some sort of mechanical device, but is actually for messing around with reality through something you could only describe as magic. Was swapping things like this even possible? Well, if the rumors you had heard about Henry and Sumia were true, probably. But was it still possible to swap something and make everyone in the entire universe unaware of the changes, or even accept them as normal? It seemed like such an outlandish thought, and yet here you held a remote and a manual that said it could do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to investigate this further. But first, you pick up your books again and head towards the library, taking the remote and the manual with you. Considering how to investigate this device, you think about testing it out yourself, finding someone to swap with at the library and swapping yourself with them. If Miriel were here, she'd probably call such a test reckless or something, but what could really go wrong? At worst, it probably wouldn't do anything and you could just throw it away. Then again, you had made friends here at the tournament from worlds where technology like this, or at least technology that looked like this, was pretty commonplace. Perhaps you should get one of them to help.</span></div></div>",

And to know if it worked, you needed to try it out yourself. You thought it was a shame that it could only swap you and another person, rather than swapping two other people with each other, but you supposed you'd just have to cope with that and involve yourself in the swap. Who knows, it could end up being fun swapping with other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the library, you leave your books at the returns desk and look around for someone to swap with. Unfortunately, the library seemed all but deserted at this time of day, and you were only able to find two potential targets. If you had wanted to remain somewhat normal after the swap, you were out of luck; both the people you had found were women. You were hesitant to go through with this, but at the same time, you wanted to know if this thing worked. You figured you could always swap back once you knew it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPotential target #1 was Rosalina, a woman who travelled through the galaxy on her \"Comet Observatory\", acting as a mother-figure for a race of star children called Lumas. You obviously didn't have any relation to her outside of the tournament, but the two of you had run into each other here at the library, and during newcomer training sessions, from time to time, so you weren't strangers at the very least. Her Luma companion wasn't with her at the moment, and she seemed to be looking through some story books, possibly something to read to Luma before bedtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person you had found was Lucina, the other Ylissian fighter in the  tournament, and Chrom's daughter. The two of you had obviously known each other for quite a while before this tournament, so you did feel a little underhanded at the fact that you were considering swapping something with her. Then again, you needed a test, and if you felt too bad about swapping with her, you could always swap back and confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one last check around the library to make sure you couldn't find anyone, you decide on who to swap with.</span></div></div>",

After all, you just wanted to test this remote out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what you plan to swap, you decide to leave out Life Swap. It seems interesting, but it raises too many questions for you to test it out immediately. After all, you still didn't know if the remote would carry over to your possession after a Life Swap. For the same reason, you also leave out Clothes Swap and Head Swap, at least until you knew for certain whether the remote would stay with you. You also decide to leave out Relationship Swap, as having Lumas follow you around all the time would likely be awkward for further tests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left Gender Swap and Body Swap as his main options. Gender Swap would be simple and would show immediate results as to whether or not the device actually worked, as well as providing an interesting perspective on an entire half of humanity you did not fully understand. The downside to that would be that all of your life beforehand would be fundamentally altered so that you would become female, and you didn't know if that also included things like relationships, memories, or personality. On the other hand, Body Swap would have much the same results, only that everyone would still see you as Robin, the male tactician from the Fire Emblem worlds.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention the oddities that would probably arise from having a body of the opposite gender. Next was the head swap, which would place your head on Lucina's body, and vice versa. As with the body swap, people would still recognise it was you, but you'd still have your own face so it seemed more logical that way to you.

Your clothes mostly hid your body, but although you couldn't really see it, you could certainly feel how different Lucina's body was compared to yours.

Speaking of Lucina, you noticed that she was still looking through the bookshelves, completely unaware that she now had your body. Part of you kind of wondered how in the dark the remote really kept her. Would she find it strange if you brought up the fact that she had a male body despite being a princess? If you swapped with her now, but on a different awareness setting, would she believe that her own body was foreign to her?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are Ashley, the young witch under the employment of WarioWare Inc. Currently, you were employed at the Super Smash Bros tournament, in which your boss, Wario, was participating. You were considered an \"assist character\"; during matches, a competitor might use an item known as an Assist Trophy, which would summon a random assist character to the battlefield to help them in whichever way possible, in your case, using dark magic. It bothered you that the Hands, the beings running the tournament, had cast you as some sort of helper, while incompetent fools like Wario got to compete in the actual tournament. Clearly they underestimated your power, or perhaps it was the other way around. Perhaps they thought you were too powerful and it would be unfair to the other participants to have them face you. You knew this wasn't the case, however, otherwise they wouldn't have let a Goddess participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour familiar, Red, spoke up from behind you. \"Uh, Ashley, you might want to watch where you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he can finish his warning, your foot hits the item Red was worrying about. You stared at the box a little, not exactly caring what was inside. If someone had left it in the hallway, opened no less, it couldn't have been an item of much importance. Red, however, was more curious. While you watched, unamused, Red rummaged around with the contents of the box to see what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, check this out.\" He held up his findings, some form of electronic remote, and a small booklet, possibly explaining the proper use of said remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red,\" you said coldly, \"What possible use could we have for such a thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No seriously, check this thing out.\" He seemed insistant for some reason, holding the two items up for you to take. Normally, you wouldn't have done any such thing, but the Hands were very strict on what sort of arcane powers you were allowed to use, and as such didn't have much to do, so you took the items from Red and looked through the manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny normal person would have reacted with immense shock at what the manual proposed the remote could do. You, however, were no ordinary person, and were only minimally shocked, not that it showed on your face. This manual claimed the remote was capable to doing things you had thought near impossible, even with the use of magic. Swapping various parts of possibly even incompatible organisms, all while altering the fabric of reality itself such that no one would ever think something was out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't normally one for smiling, but a smirk came across your face as you thought of the possibilities this device presented, even if it meant it was better than your magic. Perhaps you'd be participating in the tournament after all. You could take the role of one of the competitors, preferably one with the ability to use magic, and show everyone you weren't to be trifled with. On the other hand, why bother with some silly tournament anyway? There were being of great power here, power which you could claim for yourself. There was, of course, the aforementioned Goddess, several powerful villains, though despite their best efforts, they never actually won, but the biggest of them all, were the Hands themselves. They had managed to pull together the greatest heroes and villains from across the universe, all for the sake of putting on a little show for crowds eager to see some fighting, and all this without the opposing factions tearing at each others throats. Clearly there was something to be gained from taking over for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Ashley?\" Red asked nervously, \"Earth to Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even acknowledge him. You had bigger things on your mind. You might need to find a way to make sure he still knew who and where you were so he could still serve you, but you could worry about that a little later. Right now, you had two big plans, and you needed to figure out which to accomplish first.</span></div></div>",

There would be plenty of time to take over someone more powerful later. Especially someone like Master Hand. You didn't particularly feel like running the tournament, and people would know something was up if you cancelled it. Finding a more powerful life would need to wait until after the tournament was completed and people were preparing to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was no reason you had to wait until then to use the remote at all. You could do your other plan for now, and switch again once the time came. For participating in the tournament, you'd need to swap lives with one of the competitors, which meant leaving Red behind. It's possible you could tell him a bout your plan and he'd still remember and come find you after the swap, but then whoever had been dumped in your life would know something was wrong, and if they had your knowledge of the arcane, that would lead to some disastrous results. No, you'd have to leave Red with your old life. You had enough experience now that you didn't really need him anymore anyway, especially if you were taking the life of a spellcaster who didn't require a wand to perform magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red, go wait in our room.\" you commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at him. \"Go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" He was clearly confused about what you were planning, if not a little annoyed that he wasn't part of these plans, but he complied, waddling back the way he had come. Now it was simply a matter of locating a competitor in the tournament. Unfortunately, the Hands had imposed restrictions of where assist characters were allowed to go outside of their quarters, and how long they could be there, so you wouldn't have that much time. While you'd prefer to take the life of someone more skilled in the art of magic, you really just needed someone with less rules restricting where they were allowed to be. Once you had such a life, you could use it to locate one of the tournament's magic users. Some people might end up in wrong lives along the way, but it didn't matter if they couldn't see anything out of the ordinary, right?

Apparently she didn't recognise you. \"Can I help you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for Palutena,\" you reply bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's out at the moment, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know when she'll be back, or where she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. Sorry. I could tell her you came looking for her when she gets back, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd appreciate that.\" This posed a bit of a problem for you. You could just head back to your room and hope Palutena came to visit once Rosalina told her that you were looking for her, but that would involve a lot of unnecessary waiting that would have been avoided had Palutena been in her room now. You weren't sure if there was an alternative, however. As an assist character, you weren't allowed to be wandering around in the competitors' living quarters for too long, and you could only avoid the Mii Fighters so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. What was your name again? Just so Palutena knows who it was that visited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina snaps you out of your thoughts. \"Ashley. My name is Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ashley. I'll be sure to tell her you came looking for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rosalina closes the door, leaving you alone in the hallway, you think of another possible way of getting into Palutena's life. If you swapped lives with Rosalina, then you'd be considered as one of the fighters in the tournament, and wouldn't have the same restrictions as your old life. Then you'd have plenty of time to find Palutena, and if you couldn't find her, then it wouldn't matter as much, since you'd be occupying the life of her roommate, so the two of you would see each other eventually. Of course, if you did this, Rosalina would be in your old life, and be the one totally loyal to you once you became Palutena, while Palutena would be Rosalina. While taking Palutena's life for your own was your primary goal, you'd also prefer that Palutena received your old life. That way you'd have a goddess (or more accurately, a former goddess) serving you.</span></div></div>",

It was disappointing that you had such grand plans, only for them to be foiled by one small detail, but you'd succeed soon enough. Soon, very soon, you'd no longer be Ashley, you'd be Palutena, the Goddess of Light. But right now, that simply wasn't in the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you make it to your room, you notice that Red is nowhere to be seen. It made sense, since Red was now Pit's familiar instead of yours. You suppose this meant you'd need to perform your magic without him now. However, closer examination of your room reveals you now own a staff, which looks somewhat similar to Palutena's, as well as a magic broom. Searching your memories of he current reality, you find that like Pit had been, you are the captain of Palutena's guard. Since Pit's weapons had been given to him by Palutena, as well as her using the power of flight to aid him in his missions, you had received a staff and a broom from her so that you could perform the very same missions. Since Pit no longer had the goddess he worked for to receive his weapons from, Red now transformed into a bow for Pit to use, just like he used to turn into a wand for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the remote down on your dresser, and pick up the staff, finding it to be fairly light and easy to move about. You were still going to be taking Palutena's life at the first chance you got, but at least she wouldn't be useless when she got dumped into your life. Since the staff was somewhat similar to Palutena's, maybe you could practice with it a bit for when you became her. You weren't sure how much of your arcane knowledge would be kept when you stole Palutena's life, but a little practice never hurt anyone. However, your eyes are drawn back to the remote. Even though you had your plan laid out perfectly, the allure of using it to mess with reality tempted even you. Perhaps you could try it out a little more. As long as you didn't life swap or relationship swap, it shouldn't mess up your plan, right?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't exactly wait here forever, and without somewhere to start from, you couldn't just wander around looking for her.

Putting someone else in your life would complicate things a little, but it was still possible to pull off. You'd prefer if you didn't have to bother with other people's lives though. Although, it would also help you find Palutena, since if the person you swapped with knew where she was, then you'd know where she was.

Once she reaches you, she grabs you arm and starts pulling you along, running back the way she had come from. \"C'mon,\" she says, \"You're going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say, a bit caught off guard by the fact that this woman had run up to you and was now pulling you by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a practice match in a couple minutes!

Villager had one if a few minutes from now, and the Hands didn't take too kindly to tardiness. You try to think about who the match was against, but you can't seem to remember.

Sure, as Villager you didn't have a way out, but you still had the remote so you could borrow someone else's life, and then continue your search.

Did you really need to keep him around? Once you had Viridi's life, you'd have her entire army at your command. Red had been a loyal minion, but sometimes sacrifices had to be made. \"Well, if we can find Phosphora, then we'll have to make a change to the plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red, head back to our room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I no longer require your assistance. It would do you well to forget that this remote ever existed, and to treat whoever is in my life as they are truly me.\" Turning you back on him, you head towards Viridi's room, since the Hands' had restricted her movements around the tournament ground even more than regular assist and background characters. You weren't sure if Red had obeyed your orders, but whatever he did, it was clear he wasn't still following you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching Viridi's room, you turn the doorknob, surprised to find it was unlocked. Clearly Viridi didn't expect an intruder since she had to stay in her room so much. You push the door open with one hand, and point the remote at her with the other, pressing the life swap button. You find yourself lying on Viridi's bed, dressed in her clothes, your hair repositioned to make one tail on the left side of your head, rather than two with one on either side. The opposite was true for Viridi, who now stood in the doorway of what used to be her room. Viridi, who now believed she was you, uttered, \"Sorry, wrong room.\" The apology sounded entirely insincere, just as it would have been had it been you yourself saying it. Viridi leaves, closing the door behind her, and leaving you alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider the current situation. You were currently Viridi, the Goddess of Nature, from the world the Hands had referred to as \"Kid Icarus\". You commanded the Forces of Nature, and had previously used something known as the \"Reset Bombs\" to wage war on humanity, and restore the land to it's natural form. It was because of this that Viridi had been brought to the tournament, to appear in the background of a stage based on Pit's first encounter with a Reset Bomb. Even though you had teamed up with Pit and Palutena to assist in defeating Hades and the underworld army, the Hands were still cautious of you, due to your past actions against the humans, and had placed many restrictions on where you could go and what you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shame that you had to give up a lot of freedom, as well as your role assisting in the tournament, in order to attain such power, but it was worth it in your eyes. You also seemed to recall that along with Phosphora, the competitors in the tournament from your world would apparently come to visit occasionally. Perhaps if Palutena, the Goddess of Light, visited you, you could claim her life instead and have both power and freedom. However, you felt a title such as \"Goddess of Light\" didn't suit you, so you'd probably return to Viridi's life once freedom was no longer an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, your freedom was still restricted, so you needed to find something to do to pass the time. Even though the remote had given you all of Viridi's abilities, it would probably be wise to ensure that knew how to properly use them. The Hands' had placed restrictions on what magic you were allowed to use, and it seemed the same was true of Viridi and her godly powers, but if the Hands didn't know you were using them, there was no problem. Speaking of the remote, you still had it in your possession. While Viridi might not have had as much freedom as you had, you could still leave for a brief moment in order to try using the remote again. You certainly weren't about to go swapping lives again, giving up your newly acquired position as a goddess, but that didn't mean you couldn't try out some of the other functions.</span></div></div>",

When you had been asked to come to the tournament alongside the mayor, Villager, you had been a little worried about leaving the town without anyone in charge, but the townsfolk assured you that everything would be alright. Your brother Digby even promised to take care of town hall while you were out. The Hands, the people running the tournament, had wanted you to be an assist character to help out with the tournament. You weren't very good at fighting, so you helped out by throwing healing items to the person who called you to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just gone to see the mayor, and were heading back to your room. The Hands didn't really like having assist characters wandering around a whole lot, so you followed that rule. However, on your way there, you came across a box left in the hall. A lost item perhaps? You'd have the get that back it it's owner. Unfortunately, the box didn't appear to have a name on it, and the address was just for the tournament grounds. You didn't really want to snoop, but you didn't really want to just leave it here either. The only alternative seemed to be to check inside the box and see if you could identify the owner from the contents of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside seemed to be some sort of remote and an instruction manual. You quickly flipped through the instruction manual to see what the remote could do, and nearly dropped the box in shock. This remote could change things about people with anyone noticing?! This seemed way too powerful for someone here to have, and you were sure the Hands wouldn't approve of it if they knew about it. You'd have to report this too  them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Of course, there was no guarantee this thing actually worked. But you couldn't actually try it out, could you? No, of course not. That would be against the rules, and far too irresponsible. But... maybe a little test wouldn't hurt, right? If no one knew about it what was the harm in it? You shook your head. \"Bad Isabelle! You can't be doing that to people!\" you thought. You headed towards Master Hand's office to hand in the remote so he could do something about it.</span></div></div>",

It was a paw, covered in yellow fur. Following the arm upwards, you saw that the person offering your notebook to you was you, or at least they looked like you, except their hair wasn't up in your usual topknot, and instead of your normal clothes, they were wearing the clothes Villager had been wearing when you went to visit him; a red shirt with a No. 1 on it, grey shorts, and blue shoes. Then you noticed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly weren't a dog anymore. Even just looking at your hand, you didn't have fur anymore, and you had thumbs. How did this happen? And then you notice the remote and the box, still held in your hands. You must have accidentally swapped bodies with Villager when you bumped into him! Doing your best not to freak out, you say \"Thank you, Mayor,\" and take the notebook from him. Now you definitely didn't want anything to do with this remote.

You firstly see Samus, the intergalatic bounty huntress. You definitely think about swapping with Samus, but another fighter catches your eye. This fighter is Greninja, a new Pokemon intorduced during the tournament.

At the very least, you had thought you'd be an assist character like Phosphora and Magnus. But nooooo, they stuck you in some stupid role showing up in the background of a stage. You didn't even do anything significant! You'd just show up in the background for a few seconds and then the Hands would drop the artificial Reset Bomb to transform the stage. You had told them several times that they could have just used a hologram or something instead of dragging you out all this way, but the Hands insisted on being authentic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could probably tell you weren't exactly happy about the situation, because they had placed even more restrictions on where you could go on top of those already in place for other characters, lest you get ideas about dropping a Reset Bomb on the tournament. Like you'd do that. You had just gone and talked (or perhaps 'complained' would be more accurate) to Phosphora about it, but your time was now up and you needed to head back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Hands,\" you mumbled to yourself, kicking the air as you walked. Or at least, you had tried to kick the air, but there was something in the way. A small cardboard box, with the top opened up, lay a little ways away from you. Apparently you had kicked it without noticing it was there. \"Hmph, what careless person would leave trash lying around?\" You pick up the box, intending to throw it away once you got to a trash can. You do have a peek inside the box though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Looks like something the Aurum would use.\" Inside the box was a small remote of some sort, as well as some sort of instruction manual. \"Hm... maybe this could be useful.\" You decide to take the box back to your room to investigate further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in your room, you started going through the manual to try and see what you could figure out. The whole time, you were muttering things like, \"What!? No way!\" Even gods couldn't do the things this remote could apparently do. You really wanted to try this out. Maybe you could just do a little test, surely that couldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the hands had forced you into this stupid supporting role, maybe you could do something a little bigger to have a better time here at the tournament.</span></div></div>",

In fact, whenever something valuable went missing, your room was one of the first places they checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't stop you though, you just couldn't help yourself when it came to stealing.

Next to it was a little booklet, possibly an instruction manual, and a cardboard box. The box you did remember picking up, and you guessed this thing was inside the box, and fell out when you emptied your sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a quick look through the manual, and are surprised by what you read.

You could pull off the greatest heist the Mushroom Kingdom, no, any of these worlds had ever seen! If you swapped with someone else while stealing, they'd get the blame if you got caught, and if you succeeded, you could put the stuff you stole somewhere safe for you to collect once you swapped back. Or better yet, you could just swap with the person you were stealing from to make them willingly give everything to you.

The earlier events with you swapping with Lucina had really side-tracked you. Plus, you were now pretty exhausted and your breasts were heaving and aching from your exhaustion. You really needed to do something about that. You never tried wearing a bra before because even though you were born with breasts and a vagina, you were still a male.  Although, with the remote, you could now get rid of those problems. You could swap with one of the females in the tournament. You didn't want to swap bodies anymore after what happened earlier and you didn't exactly want to swap lives with someone. From the options on the remote you could either swap genders or clothes with one of the female competitors. If you swapped genders with someone your clothes would change to its female equivalent. You would become a fully-fledged female and were expected to dress like one. You weren't really worried about being seen as a woman since you already looked like one physically and it had bodily functions and needs similar to a woman's. On the other hand, swapping clothes would just give you a female wardrobe and it would be considered normal for you to have it and you would be expected to wear them but you'd still be male. Although you realize that with that option you would no longer have control of the Monado. Both choices would give you women's clothing, it was just a choice on whether you wanted to keep your own clothes or get someone else's clothes.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes you kind of wished you weren't created from Pit, that you weren't just his incomplete mirror image, that you were someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile lost in your thoughts, you end up kicking a box that'd been left in the hallway. You walk over and pick it up, taking a look inside. Inside was some sort of electronic remote and an instruction manual. You smirk. \"Hmph, finders keepers.\" You take out the manual to see what the remote is for. Your eyebrows raise in surprise as you read. Swapping parts of reality around, and making it so only one person can see it? That seemed pretty crazy. You wanted to try this out. But how? You could always just swap something randomly with the first person you meet, but if you took a little time to plan, maybe you could figure out something good.</span></div></div>",

Had you not already been here at the tournament for a while, you would probably have guessed it was a robot of some sort. In reality though, it was a bounty hunter by the name of Samus Aran. Samus had been a competitor in Super Smash Bros since the very first tournament, and was one of the first female competitors. That was the part of bothered you. Samus was a woman, and you weren't. You were looking for someone to swap with, but was Samus really the best choice? Did you really want to swap with a girl. After not seeing anyone else around, you sigh, decided that you might as well test the remote on Samus. You could always swap back afterwards anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what to swap? The first two options were body swap and head swap. With a body swap, you'd gain Samus' body completely, but somehow still be yourself. You kind of wondered how that would work. Samus' body didn't have wings, so how would you be able to fly? Not to mention, loathe as you were to admit it, you were a clone of Pit, so would changes to you effect him as well? Similarly, with the head swap, you'd also gain Samus' body, but only below your neck, keeping your own head. You'd also gain Samus' Power Suit, save for the helmet, whereas with the body swap, you'd still keep your own clothes and weapons. Of course, there were still four other buttons on the remote for you to try out too.</span></div></div>",

The swap occurs almost instantly, catching you a bit off guard. The first thing you notice is how bare your back felt without a pair of wings protruding from it. Losing your wings felt almost comparable to someone losing an arm, and you didn't like it. You also noticed the weight on your chest, and the void between your legs, clearly indicating your new gender. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, but it still felt a bit awkward to have suddenly hopped over the gender fence. Although, if the manual was correct, then people should still see you as a man, despite your clearly female body. You look down at your new body, a bit of blonde hair falling in front of your eyes as you did so. You noticed that along with being slimmer and shapelier, taking Samus' body had also made you a bit taller, and you were glad to see that despite the change in your body, you were still wearing your usual black tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAverting your gaze from your own body, you look up to see how Samus had been affected. While you couldn't actually see her inside her Power Suit, you could see a few changes made to the suit itself; namely, the fact that it was a bit shorter now, to compensate for its wearer's new stature, and extra pieces of metal extended out of the back of the suit to cover Samus' newly gained wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself again, the large bumps sticking out of your chest obstructing your view. You know knew for certain that the remote did in fact work, and you had succeeded in making yourself look nothing like Pit, although since you still had your own life, you would probably still be a clone of him. You couldn't help but wonder if this swap had affected Pit at all, since you were supposed to be his mirror image, except now you looked nothing like him. That said, you weren't sure you were entirely comfortable with taking Samus' body. Not because you felt guilty or anything, Samus wouldn't even notice after all, but rather because of the body itself; the sudden switch to being female, and the lack of wings. You looked back at Samus, and then down at the remote, still held in your now feminine-looking hand, contemplating whether you wanted to swap back before Samus left your sight.</span></div></div>",

And so, you let Samus walk away with your body, leaving you with her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about what to do now, you decide to head to your room to put the manual of the remote away. You knew what the remote did now, so you didn't need to be carrying around the manual as well. It'd be better to leave it somewhere safe just in case you forgot what some of the buttons did. On your way over there, the difference between Samus' body and yours were even more apparent. The way your hips swayed subconsciously as you walked, the way your hair flowed behind you, the slight bounce in your chest with every step, it was all very distracting. Not unpleasant, but very different. The only part you'd really say you didn't like at all was the lack of wings, but that would be something you'd have to get used to if you wanted to keep using the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you had made it closer to your room, regardless of the distractions your body was providing, but you were suddenly interrupted when you heard someone calling your name.

The two of you had ended up becoming friends over a shared hatred of being called \"clones\" (although the term was a lot more literal in your case). Even though Pit and Palutena had spread the nickname of \"Pittoo\" around to the other Smashers, once Lucina found out you didn't like it, she stopped calling you that, but still found \"Dark Pit\" a little long and awkward to say sometimes, and ended up giving you the nickname \"Dark\".

The two of you eventually make it to the balcony, and as expected, there was no one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you say, turning to face Lucina, \"Have you decided which swap you want to try yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, yes,\" she replied, seeming a bit less nervous and a bit more excited than before. You smile. It was good to see she wasn't still freaked out by the remote's reality altering powers. You push the \"2\" button on the remote, so you'd still be aware of whatever swap Lucina decided to do, before handing it to her. She checks the manual again, which you assume is to make sure she's pressing the right button, before aiming at you and pushing one of the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich button did Lucina press?</span></div></div>",

However, you could also feel that your clothes had changed this time, and you seemed to be facing the opposite way on the balcony. The reason was standing clearly right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Lucina exclaimed as she looked down at herself, although you weren't sure \"herself\" was the proper word to be using in this situation. While she still had her own head, she had your body from the neck down, which was currently patting down as if to try and confirm that what she was seeing was real. You looked down at yourself to confirm that the opposite was true for you; you still had your own head, but you had Lucina's body from the neck down.\" You were holding the manual for the remote, which Lucina had been holding before the swap, but the remote had followed her head over to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\" you asked, placing your hands on your hips. The transition wasn't as jarring for you this time, as you'd already swapped with Samus before, but it still felt a bit weird to have someone else's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina was looking over her shoulder when you asked, watching in fascination as her new wings moved about. She turned back once you spoke up, however. \"This is amazing.\" Her worry regarding the remote and its reality altering effects seemed to have been replaced with excitement. She looked you up and down, clearly finding it amusing to see your head on her body. \"And no one else will notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in response. \"Yeah. As long as we use the right settings, everyone else will think we've always been like this.\" You looked for somewhere to put the manual to the remote, but found Lucina's outfit to be just as lacking in pockets as your own, so you chose to simply hold onto it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Lucina mused, looking down at the remote again. It was one thing to be told about how it worked, but it was another to test it out yourself, something you could certainly attest to. \"So, what do we do now?\" You noticed her wings still seemed to be moving around a bit more than you'd normally move them, so you assumed Lucina was enjoying having them. Your back did still feel a bit bare without them, but you were starting to get used to it after going through two wingless bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want, we can always mess around with the remote some more,\" you suggested. You didn't really have a plan for the remote aside from just trying it out for the time being, but you figured it might be more fun messing around with it if you had a friend along with you for the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, with each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant using it on other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina seemed to be a bit unsure about that, as you noticed her wings drooping a bit. \"I don't know. Doesn't that seem a bit... bad? Swapping with people without their consent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. It didn't seem like that big of a deal to you, but you supposed Lucina was more of a \"good guy\" than you were. \"Well, like I said, if we use the right settings, everyone'll think things have always been like this. Can't exactly get mad about something when you don't know it's even happened. It's up to you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina thought about your idea for a moment, before deciding what to do.</span></div></div>",

Having her come along with you for this little adventure seemed like it would be more fun than doing it alone, but there was only so much that could be done if Lucina didn't want to swap with other people. \"Alright, let's go then,\" you said, turning towards the door leading away from the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stop back first, though?\" Lucina called out before you could leave. \"I know we're going to be swapping with other people and all, but if we don't swap back first, then things are just going to end up even more jumbled if we want to get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" You stand still as Lucina targets you with the remote, and presses the head swap button again. In mere moments, you find yourself back on your own body again, and Lucina is back on her's. \"You should probably press the one button, so the people we're swapping with don't notice anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" she said, pressing the appropriate button as the two of you left the balcony. \"So, do you have any ideas for who we should swap with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.

It's Bayonetta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Who?\" You didn't recognise the name Lucina had told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pretty new around here. Apparently she was supposed to be some sort of secret fighter to get the audience excited by her reveal. She only arrived a few days ago, so I haven't had much of a chance to talk to her, but... apparently she hunts angels or something.\" She seemed to be a bit apprehensive about informing you of that part. And for good reason too, you were an angel, after all. The Hands had strict rules in place to make sure no one was killed during the tournament, though, so you should be fine even with her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright then. I guess I'll get to see what she's like once I'm her.\" Lucina chuckled at your nonchalance, finding it amusing how you didn't even seem phased by the fact that pretty soon you'd be an entirely different person, let alone a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you reached Lucina's room, and she briefly put an ear to the door, listening for anyone inside. \"Okay, she's here,\" she said, holding out the remote for you, which she'd kept since the two of you had swapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's make this quick.\" You grabbed onto the remote as well, holding your finger over the life swap button. Lucina nodded, before pulling out her key and unlocking the door. The moment it was open enough for you to see inside, you aimed the remote at the figure clothed in black inside, and pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fraction of a second, you suddenly found yourself inside the room, a little disoriented. Your body felt the same, but the outfit it was clothed in was rather different. Black leather hugged your torso and legs tightly, while you teetered on a pair of high heels. Your arms were cloaked in white gloves up to the middle of your biceps, and black hair spayed out from the shoulders and chest of the outfit. A large pair of earrings dangled from your ears, your could feel makeup on your face, and a pair of glasses rested upon your nose. Despite your outfit appearing to be normal clothes, now that you were Bayonetta, you knew that the outfit was actually made of your hair through some sort of magic. You looked up at the mirror you were positioned in front of, finding your appearance to be a little ridiculous, but not as much as it would have been had you tried to swap with one of the more feminine women competing in the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll talk to you later,\" you heard Lucina say, presumably to Bayonetta in your life, before she entered the room and closed the door behind her. She chuckled a little at your appearance, before asking, \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the same. I mean, I'm wearing her clothes, and I know things she knew but I didn't, but otherwise I'm about the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina breathed a sigh of relief. \"Good. I was a little worried you start acting like her instead of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk, deciding to put the remote to the test and see if you really could mimic Bayonetta like the manual said you should be able to. Despite having never actually met Bayonetta before, you somehow find yourself channeling her personality and letting it go somewhat on autopilot. \"Oh, I can act like her if I want to, darling.\" Your stance and tone even shifted to be a bit more feminine as you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Lucina exclaimed, stepped back out of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? How'd I do?\" you asked, letting your own personality take control again, but keeping the smirk on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really good. Are you sure you haven't met Bayonetta before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, feeling your new earrings shaking about. \"It's all just the power of the remote. Speaking of which, now that I've got Bayonetta's life, I think it's about time we found someone for you to swap with.\" You approached Lucina, seemingly having little trouble walking in Bayonetta's heels, and held out the remote for her. Just as with the previous head swap, the remote had followed you to your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right,\" she answered, taking the remote, still a little anxious about swapping with someone outside of the controlled environment in which she'd swapped with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" you said playfully, leading Lucina out of the room again, which Lucina remembering to lock the door behind her after tossing the manual onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're even walking like she does,\" Lucina mumbled as she caught up with you. Looking down at yourself, you noticed you did seem to have a more feminine strut now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess I am.\" The fact didn't bother you much. The world saw you as a woman now, so walking like this would only help further the illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you have someone in mind, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but I do have an idea about where we might find some people. It's better than just wandering the halls, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. So were are we headed?\"</span></div></div>",

Within seconds, the remote works its magic, and you find yourself sitting on Viridi's bed, wearing her dress. It catches you off guard a bit, not having actually tested the remote before this, but luckily Viridi, who was currently in your life, didn't notice anything wrong, and replies to the question she had asked you. \"It's alright. I think everyone who's competing is here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot particularly caring about this conversation, you let Viridi's personality go on autopilot as you converse with your old life.

You had already taken Viridi's life, and right now you had two ideas of what else you could do. You could either makes things a bit more normal for you by doing a clothes swap, thus taking your old clothes back from Viridi, or you could immerse yourself a little more in your role as Viridi by swapping bodies with her.

Perhaps this remote would be useful after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ganondorf, you had been defeated by Link and sealed away, but as Zelda, no one would suspect you of doing anything evil. You could claim the Triforce of Power when your old body was defeated by Link, and with Zelda's life, it shouldn't be too difficult to get Link to drop his guard long enough to take him down and claim the Triforce of Courage.

You walk off to Zelda's room, planning to stash the remote in there somewhere for safekeeping. However, on the way there, you realise something. The tournament had not even begun yet, and the Hands certainly wouldn't allow Link to kill your old life so long as the tournament was going on. The moment that your entire plan hinged on wouldn't be able to happen until the tournament was over! Were you really willing to live out Zelda's life until then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly head back to the place where you had first swapped with Zelda, but by then, Zelda had taken your old life and body and wandered off somewhere else. For the time being, you were trapped in Zelda's life, and her body... or were you? Sure, you might not be able to return to your own life, but you still had the remote, so you didn't have to remain as Zelda if you didn't want to. There were plenty of other warriors here at the tournament you could easily become.

You just happened to have the same name was him and look incredibly similar to him.

You sighed, one of the younger Smashers had probably ordered it and forgotten about it or something. Too much TV was bad for them anyway. There was some sort of instruction manual included with it as well. Perhaps looking through that could tell you what TV it was for, and you could leave the remote with it. However, the manual seemed to say that this remote wasn't for changing channels of a television, but for changing around parts of people. The thought seemed ludicrous to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably someone's idea of a joke,\" you muttered to yourself. You'd just take it to the leisure room and leave it with the TV there.

With that thought in mind, you alter your course and head in the direction of the leisure room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are Wario, best described as fat, greedy, and flatulent. You had first participated in the third Super Smash Bros tournament, and were one of the first ones there, eager to get to get the one-up on Mario again. However, now the tournament was old news to you, and despite receiving your invitation long in advance, you had shown up to the tournament incredibly late. So late, in fact, that the Hands had no choice but to make you one of the secret fighters that wouldn't be revealed until the tournament began, since all the advertising had already gone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing too lazy to train for the upcoming fights, you had become somewhat bored. The Hands closed off the kitchen between scheduled meals, so eating wasn't an option right now. You had recently visited the leisure room, established that there was nothing worth watching on the TV, and were now heading back to your room for a nap. You briefly wondered what your employees back at WarioWare Inc. were doing without you. Probably slacking off, you were really the only one who did anything for that company (or at least that's what you thought). At the very least you could make sure Ashley, Kat and Ana were doing their jobs, or doing as much as they could while they were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to your room however, you encountered a box lying in the hallway. Perhaps encountered is a bit of an overstatement; rather you had ended up tripping over it due to how short your legs were. Once you got back up and made sure no one was around to see you fall, you grabbed the box without a second thought and took it with you as you headed back to your room, mumbling \"Finders-keepers\" to yourself. When you got to your room, you tore open the box, an action which was unnecessary since the box had already been opened on top and was merely folded closed, and examined the contents. You were a little disappointed that the box held nothing valuable, just some old TV remote and an instruction manual, but you kept them anyway and read through the manual, since you had nothing better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile others, like those Crygor guys you employed, would see the amazing scientific potential behind the remote, all you saw was a potential money-making scheme. All you had to do was swap with one of the more wealthy people here at the tournament, like those princesses and such, and you could \"donate\" all their money to you, and no one would be able to tell anything was wrong. You grinned and rubbed your hands together at the thought of the riches you'd be able to gain from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that wasn't all you could use the remote for. Many people here at the tournament were somewhat significant in their own worlds, be they heroes, villains, or royalty, or a combination of the above. You could place your employees in some somewhat powerful positions to extend your influence all over the place, and gain some money in the process to boot. Sure, most of your employees were back in your world and not in this weird space-stadium the Hands had constructed, but there were certain benefits that came from having an alien on your payroll. You'd just have to call him up and get him to gather up your slacking employees and bring them here. And with your employees posing as many of the competitors in the tournament, you could always get them to throw the fight for you, making sure you'd win. Scratching your chin and letting out a fart in thought, you think about what to do with your new little money-making device.</span></div></div>",

They had installed these around the tournament grounds in case of emergency, and not to be used for personal calls, but you didn't really listen to their rules. Selecting the icon for Diamond City and dialing Orbulon's number, you tap your foot impatiently as you wait for him to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you hear from the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Bout time you picked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wario? I thought you were at that tournament thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. Which is precisely why I need you to gather up my employees and bring 'em here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure thing. I'll be there soon.\" That was something you liked about Orbulon. He didn't question your schemes. Supposedly it was part of his 'research' or something, but as long as he did what you said for cheap, you didn't care. Not bothering to say goodbye, you slam the receiver down and make your way over the area where all the assist characters stayed. Orbulon may be gathering your employees from Diamond City, but there were a few already here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the room shared by your employees. It seemed like assist characters shared their rooms with another assist. In this case, Kat &amp; Ana apparently counted as one, as did Ashley and her minion Red, so the four of them had to share the one room. This, of course, made things easier for you. You bang loudly on their door, not caring if you disturbed any of the other assists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens to reveal an annoyed Ashley, glaring at you. \"What do you want?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me. We've got work to do.\" Ashley rolls her eyes, not that you notice. You were looking around her room for any sign of the little ninja twins, Kat and Ana. \"Where are the kids staying with you?\" You hear the faint sound of someone landing behind you, and instead of answering you question, Ashley just looks at the hallway behind you. You turn around to see that Kat and Ana have managed to sneak behind you. \"You two come too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" the girls say in unison, before disappearing again. Ashley gets her minion, Red, and then follows you towards the spaceship docking bay. Presumably, the ninja girls were following too, just very stealthily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrbulon's Oinker had not yet arrived by the time you got there, so you had no choice but to wait. Ashley turns to ask you, \"So why did you...\" Before she even finishes her question, you shove the manual into her hands, not keen on having to explain everything twice. Ashley narrows her eyes in annoyance, but reads the manual anyway. Her eyes go wide, \"WHAT! But that's...! How?!\" You grin. So this was something even that little witch's magic couldn't replicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ashley could could say more, you heard the telltale sounds of Orbuon's ship, the Oinker, approaching the docking bay. \"About time he showed up,\" you mumble to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You nodded, along with Ashley and the ninja twins, who had miraculously appeared out of nowhere while everyone was getting off the spaceship, this was pretty much everyone you had on your payroll. You could have gotten Waluigi involved in this as well, but he wasn't getting his hands on your money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, everyone's here,\" you say. You swipe the manual out of Ashley's hands, and hold up the remote so your employees can see. \"This here is my ticket to riches.\" Many of your employees groaned, a little sick of your hare-brained money making schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMona, however, was a bit more enthusiastic. \"So, what does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy T. chimed in as well. \"Yeah, it just looks like a TV remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shove the manual in their direction, and say, \"Read this. It'll take too long to explain.\" In all honesty, reading would probably take about the same amount of time as you explaining, but you just didn't want to explain. Mona took the manual from you and read it aloud to everyone. Everyone listened intently, fascinated by what this little remote could do. Well, everyone except you, who already knew what the remote did, Ashley, who was silently fuming that this remote you had stumbled across could do something her magic couldn't, and Kat &amp; Ana, who had been secretly reading the manual over Ashley's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mona was done, Dr. Crygor asked, \"Have you tested to see if it works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time for that. We just need to hurry up and do my plan.\" Clearly you hadn't thought this through much, but you didn't think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is this plan?\" Mona asked, the most eager out of the entire group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how does it involve us?\" Penny added, possibly a little concerned about how Wario expected them to use this remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, plenty of the bozos here hold some sort of power in their own world. All you gotta do is switch lives with them, and whatever else you want I guess, and then I'll be in control! Wa ha ha!\" Your employees looked at each other awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was the one to speak up. \"And if we refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This is my chance for riches beyond my wildest dreams!\" This elicited many eye-rolls from your employees, as they knew no mater how much money you gathered, you'd never be satisfied. \"So if you don't want to help, you can go find yourself a new job!\" That seemed to quieten any concerns your employees had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are we all going to be able to see the swaps?\" Dr. Crygor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you replied, picking your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't exactly all hold onto the remote whenever we need to swap, that'd make the group too obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that he was obviously right, you were still annoyed at the interruption. \"Grrr. You're the tech guy aren't you? You figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd happily do so if we weren't lightyears away from my lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the back of the group, Orbulon spoke up. \"I can take it into my ship to see if I can work something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but make it quick. And in the meantime the rest of you figure out who you're gonna be. You know who's in the tournament, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of your employees thought about it for a bit, as they knew some of the fighters but not all of them, 9-Volt was rather enthusiastic about it, however. \"Ooo, I know! I know!\" You had a feeling you knew why the Hands hadn't hired him as one of the assist characters for Diamond City; he was far too excited and hyperactive about being here at the tournament grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis large friend 18-Volt tapped on his should and asked, \"But what about the secret fighters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to calm 9-Volt down a little. \"...Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to do everything here myself?\" You asked out of frustration. You point at Ashley, Kat and Ana, \"You girls have been here long enough, you should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat and Ana looked at each other. \"Uhhhh...\" That had been too focused on their training to really pay attention to who was here at the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed. She had gotten here the earliest out of all of them, since she had expected to be a fighter in the tournament rather than an assist character. \"Red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little demon minion grumbled, \"I'll make a list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. But no swapping with any nobodies, like those apes or that fitness girl. There's nothing to to be gained from switching with them.\" You hand the remote to Orbulon, trusting that he wouldn't screw anything up, and that your employees would decide who they were going to be without much trouble. This amount of trust was actually pretty hard for you.</span></div></div>",

Everyone seemed to have some sort of demand about who they wanted to be. With good reason, they were giving up their own life and becoming someone else just to satisfy your selfish needs since you were the one who payed them, but their chatter annoyed you regardless. For instance, Mona wanted to be able to visit you easily if she wanted, so she'd probably need the life of one the people from the Mushroom Kingdom. Kat and Ana wanted to stick together, and they wanted to be able to continue their ninja training. Ashley wanted a life where she'd still be able to use magic, or something similar.

The blue button, Undo, had an arrow pointing to the left. Red, Reset, had an octagon, like a stop sign. Yellow, Set, had an arrow pointing downwards. Green, Scramble, had arrows pointing every which way. Orange, Aware, had an open eye, and it's opposite, the purple Unaware button, had a closed eye. The plan was to make sure everyone what been hit with the Aware function, before you and Orbulon would take them out one by one to find the person they wished to swap with.

Your hair was no longer in tails. Now it was in a style that it covered your right eye, but you knew that already. On your head was a sort of tiara with golden wings on the sides and a small silver crown in the middle. Each wing and the small crown had a gem studded into it. Golden winged bracers held detached sleeves in place. The golden necklace around your neck joined with the broach on your strapless dress that looked like a compass star. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dress was two-layered, and at the bottom the light blue gave way to unadorned ruffled white fabric. The dress was slit up the left side, and an eight-pointed star was there where the slit ended. The star itself was part of the belt (or was it a sash?) that wrapped around your waste. It was brown with a strip of red at the bottom, from which hung a simple repeating pattern of golden adornments. You were wearing short-heeled shoes, and their leather straps went up your leg, ending just below the knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look ridiculous.\" You tell yourself. And you do - this clothing was not meant for a child, and you should fix that right away.</span></div></div>",

You can only assume that was a side effect of swapping lives with someone who was unconscious. You sat up, only to find yourself looking at... yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in front of you seemed to be an exact copy of yourself, except this copy seemed to be wearing Palutena's clothes, adjusted to fit your smaller body. Just to confirm you weren't just looking into a mirror, you look down at yourself. It seemed you weren't wearing your usual clothes either; instead being clothed in Rosalina's dress, with your hair hanging loose and covering up one of your eyes. You look back up, noticing your doppelganger seemed to be doing the same. Red was looking between the two of you, somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...me?\" your doppelganger finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem that trying to swap lives with two people at the same time had split you into two copies of yourself, one for each life. Looking at where you had previously been standing, a woman you didn't recognise was laying unconscious, wearing your dress. She seemed to have features of both Rosalina and Palutena. Just as you were split into two to fill two lives, Rosalina and Palutena had been merged together to fill one. You slowly stood up, watching as the other you did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't what I expected,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think we can make this work,\" the other you says, as if finishing your thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" If there was ever a perfect partner to have in an endeavour such as this, it would be another you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed, who had said nothing during this entire encounter, suddenly spoke up. \"This is doing my head in.\" It seemed watching you speak to yourself like this was a bit too much for Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get used to it. You still need to swap with Luma,\" you tell him. He groans, picking up the remote and walking over to Rosalina's bed, where Luma had been sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you get to keep Red? What about about me?\" The other you asked. It seemed the two of you didn't agree on everything, despite being the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palutena has an entire army at her command, don't complain,\" you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I suppose you're right.\" While you made sure Red did as he was told, the other you busied herself looking in the mirror. Red ended up performing a relationship swap rather than a life swap, but this was preferable, as it would allow Red to keep his powers. Before you can do anything else, your double speaks up again. \"I look ridiculous in this,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This clothing wasn't meant for a, um, child.\" You, and by extension your double, hated being called a child, but you supposed she didn't have any other word to use in this context. She was right though, while Rosalina's dress wasn't too different from your own, and still looked pretty good on your body, Palutena's outfit was clearly meant for a more mature body, and didn't look as good when being worn by your double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we still have the remote, and an unconscious victim,\" you suggest, gesturing towards the Rosalina/Palutena combo that was currently living your life. With the remote, your double could get your normal clothes back, or get a body more befitting her new attire. You could swap as well, if you so wished. Perhaps you should get a body more befitting your role as mother of the stars. You assumed that having both of you press the button at once, like you'd done with the life swap button, would split Rosalina/Palutena's body apart again, and give you each one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of you could do anything, though, you heard a banging on the door. \"What's taking so long in there!?\" Wario shouted from outside the door. \"Hurry it up!\" Both you and your double glared at the door.</span></div></div>",

Not that you cared what she was saying, as long as it got you closer to your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Ashley opens her eyes and said, \"She's in the the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you shout, \"Let's get goin'!... Uh, lead the way.\" You didn't want to admit it, but you didn't actually know where the library. With another sigh and a glare, Ashley heads in the direction of the library, followed by Red, after he turned back to normal, Orbulon, and yourself. It takes you a little while, but you eventually make it to make it to the library, and with a bit of luck (or perhaps a little interference from Orbulon and Ashley) you manage to not run into anyone on the way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" Ashley says bluntly, pointing down one of the aisles of the library. Following where she was pointing, you see Rosalina, the supposed \"princess\" who didn't seem to rule over anything. Ashley holds out her hand for the remote. You wouldn't have given it to her if there was another way, but the remote said it only worked on the person who pressed the button and the person they were pointing the remote at, so you handed it over to her. \"Red,\" Ashley says before swapping, \"Once I swap, fly in and get the remote from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Red says, transforming once more, this time into a broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, with the press of a button, Ashley was now down the other end of the aisle, dressed as Rosalina, while Rosalina stood where Ashley was before. Before Rosalina can say anything, Orbulon uses his device to make her fall unconscious. Red, in his broom form, flies over to where Ashley was, and transforms back so he can use the remote, which Ashley gives him. From where you stood, you could faintly here the Luma child say, \"What's that, Mama?\" before his life was stolen from him (but not in the usual sense).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luma was knocked unconscious too, and now the first part of your plan was complete. Orbulon grabbed the unconscious Rosalina and Luma, who now thought they were Ashley and Red, and got ready to head back to his spaceship. Ashley handed you the remote, Red now floating around at about head height. \"Good luck with the rest of your plan,\" she says, although it comes out sounding rather sarcastic. \"I'll be going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you won't,\" you demand. \"We need you so we can find everyone else we need to swap with.\" It hadn't been a part of the original plan, but considering Ashley had been able to locate her target, she should be useful in finding everyone else's targets too.

The box contains some sort of remote, as well as a manual that most likely explains how the remote works. You can't really pick up the manual and read it, but you manage to perform a manual analysis of the remote via your optical sensors and wireless connection. It would seem the remote was able to alter reality in strange ways by swapping things between people.

If you can figure that out, you might even be able to link the remote up with the electronics in the tournament grounds to get everyone in on the fun.

Although you had participated in the previous tournament, commanding your Pokemon from the sidelines, the Hands no longer wanted fighters who could switch between forms mid battle, and that included you switching Pokemon. With that in mind, they felt your participation was no longer necessary, and only wished for your Charizard to compete. They had still gotten you in to design a trophy modeled after you, for their Hall of History. That in itself was an honor, but not as much as it would have been if they let you participate in the tournament. Since you had previously been a participant, they let you say hello to the other participants and catch up for a while before you had to head home. It had been nice getting to see everyone, but your time was up, and it was time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way to the exit, however, you find a package lying on the ground. You plan to take it back to its owner before leaving, but find no label on the box identifying the owner. You check inside the box to see if you can find something about who owns it from the contents. Inside is some sort of remote, and an instruction manual. Since you have nothing else to go off, you quickly read through the instruction manual. You are surprised to find that this remote is far more advanced than anything in your world. In fact, it seemed far more advance than anything from any of the competitors' worlds. Switching around bodies and lives, and making it so no one else notices? That seemed crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were originally going to try to find its owner, but now you weren't so sure. Maybe you could do a life swap or something so you'd still get to participate in the tournament, albeit a little more up close in personal than last time. But then you'd be stealing someone else's place, and their whole life. And unless you swapped with one of the Pokemon, your own life would be gone, back to your own world, and you'd have no way of getting it back... well, unless you did a relationship swap from your new life with one of the Pokemon.</span></div></div>",

The only thing was then who to swap with? It'd probably be easier for you to swap with another human (or at least human-like) competitor, just so you didn't have to deal with some weird stuff like people treating you like an animal. However, that'd cause a few complications once the tournament ended. The person in your life would probably head back out to your world once you swapped, but you'd be staying here in their life. Then once the tournament ended, you'd end up getting sent back to their world. Of course, once the tournament was drawing to a close (or at any point really) you could do a life swap or relationship swap with one of the Pokemon competitors so that you'd get sent back to your world and reclaim your life. Things would get a bit jumbled up, but you could probably manage. Of course, all this could be avoided by swapping lives with a Pokemon in the first place. That way the Pokemon would end up in your life, so you'd end up back in your world when the tournament ended and you'd be able to go back to your own life. It also meant you'd gain all of the Pokemon's moves, with the downside of being treated like an animal. You'd also lose your clothes, but you could fix that with another clothes swap.</span></div></div>",

Now there was the question on who to swap with. The newcomers would be at some training session, so they'd be easy to find. You didn't really know any of their personalities though, so you weren't sure whether you could convincingly act like them.

On one side was Samus, clad in her Power Suit. You had actually sort of become friends with her during your time at the tournament. She had befriended a Pikachu participating in the tournament, and since you were the only human here from the Pokemon world, she'd come to you when she needed advice. You'd probably be able to imitate her fairly well, and since she was the only competitor from her world, you wouldn't really have to worry about people talking about what went on outside of the tournament. However, you would feel a little bad about taking her place in the tournament, and trapping her in your world just so you could get back to your own life. On the other side of the gym was Ike, beating up a sandbag with his large sword. You weren't as close friends with him, so you probably couldn't imitate him as well, and there were other people here from his world, but because you weren't as close to him, you didn't feel as bad about taking his life.

You look down at yourself, although you can't really see anything except the power suit, which covers your whole body. There are probably slight alterations to the suit to accommodate for your body, but you can't really tell. Under the suit, you can feel your body covered completely by Samus's skin tight Zero Suit. Its tightness is a little uncomfortable on your groin, which reminds you that people will see you as a girl now. You turn to look at the entrance, where you see Samus, dressed in your clothes, looking into the gym with a sad smile on her face. You felt a bit guilty, stealing her life and everything, and leaving her in yours to go back to your world. You look down at the remote in your hand. Maybe there was something you could do. Maybe you should go talk to her before she left and find a way to include her in all of this. Maybe you could make her aware of the swap and see if she was okay with this, or get her to help you find a life you could use that you wouldn't feel so guilty for taking but could still imitate fairly well.

But I got too guilty seeing you walking away with my life to go back to my world. So I swapped back and thought I'd ask for help from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" You can't see her face clearly, but she sounds a little weirded out by the fact that you swapped lives with her. \"How can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you could help me find someone else who's life I could have instead. Someone who I won't feel as guilty about taking their life for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you planning to get back to your own world if the person if your life leaves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I swap lives or relationships with one of the Pokemon, I'll get to go back to my own world. It'll just screw things up a little and leave them stuck as a resident of my world. So, will you help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. But only because it makes reality so no one else sees the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll help me find someone to swap with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Although, you sure you don't still want to be me?\" You can hear in her voice that she's clearly joking.

You give a serious answer though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're okay with living in my world from now on, then sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, but what'll happen to my world then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll still have someone doing all the hero-y stuff you do.

Or I guess you could keep my life as a trainer and I could find a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" You're honestly a little surprised that she's actually considering letting you keep her life and spot in the tournament for now while she goes back to your world in your life.

After a while, though, he looks back at you, and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You'll do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharizard nods. He seems to be happy at how excited you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just hold onto this so we can both see the swap.\" You hold out the remote, pointing it at Charizard, and Charizard grabs onto the end of it with his claw. You press the life swap button, and soon the two of you had swapped places the remote was still in your hands, but now you were completely naked, and Charizard was dressed in all of your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's interesting.\" You hear an unfamiliar voice say. You look to see Charizard examining the changes. You didn't expect him to speak, though. \"Huh, I guess I can speak your language now.\" You keep your mouth shut, a little hesitant to hear what you'd sound like spouting Charizard's dialect out of your mouth. \"So, is this it? Everyone thinks I'm you, but I still look like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. Then Charizard suggests something you hadn't really considered. \"Could this thing swap our bodies too? If I'm gonna be a trainer, I want to have a human body too.\" Now it was your turn to think about it. Were you ready to give up your body, just like that? Living Charizard's life, pretending to be him, that was one thing, but actually becoming a Charizard was another thing entirely. Although you were already starting to feel a little self conscious about walking around nude. Perhaps having the body of a fire breathing dragon, one accustomed to not wearing any clothing, might help with that.</span></div></div>",

You nod, and try to say, \"Okay.\" It ends up coming out as \"Char,\" though, and you sound just as dumb as you thought you would speaking like Charizard. You point the remote at Charizard again, he grabs onto it, and you press the body swap button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the change is much more drastic. Rather than simply losing your clothes, your entire body had been restructured. You were much larger, your skin felt scaly, you had extra appendages in the form of your new wings and tail, and all in all, everything just felt different. It was too much to put into words. Charizard seems to be a bit surprised but all the changes too. However, he seems to have gotten over it quicker than you have. He says, \"Well, I guess I should be going back to our world.\" He reaches up and pats you on the head. You finally understand why he liked it when you did that so much. \"Good luck in the tournament. Don't lose for me.\" And with that, Charizard heads out of the gym with your life and body, waving to you, presumably heading to the craft that would taking him back to your world. You wave back with your little dragon-like claw. Even though it was probably about the size of your normal hand, it felt smaller due to the larger size of Charizard's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomp around the gym a bit, getting used to controlling Charizard's large, reptilian body. You felt so big and bulky, but your arms felt scrawny by comparison. Having such a long neck and three extra limbs to control was a bit confusing too. You weren't sure how you were going to get used to all this by the time you had to compete in the tournament. It'd take a lot of practice. However... You look down at the remote, still held in your claw. If the manual was right, Charizard would only be aware the two swaps you made while he was holding onto the remote. You could still swap body or clothes and the like, and he'd still think whatever you had was his original body. You could just borrow someone else's body; someone you'd be a bit more comfortable as, perhaps.</span></div></div>",

The competitors are legends, and your place here is as an almost literal trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already on your way out when your shoe bumped into a small box on the floor.

With this device you could become a real somebody, get back into the spotlight, maybe even become something more than a background character in Mario's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now you were still you.

You took the box from her unresisting hands, \"Thank you, I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was looking around the room, confused. You wondered briefly if she remembered being the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. \"Is something wrong?\" You asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach sat on the pink and white bed, \"To be honest, I'm not quite sure why I'm here. I remember the modeling session where they built a trophy based on me, and then exploring this place, and running into that guard, and coming here...\" Peach rubbed her temples, \"But what am I doing here, and why did I have that box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Peach, \"You're probably disoriented. I remember standing still a long time so they could get the trophy just right.\" That wasn't technically a lie, so you hoped she would buy it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach thought. You could tell by the look on her face that she wasn't sure if she believed it, but there didn't seem to be any other explanation in her mind. \"I guess that makes sense,\" She finally said. \"But that doesn't explain why I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you to deliver some of those wonderful wind-up toys of yours, the ones that look just like me,\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach looked like she had just swallowed a fish. \"Oh. Well Princess Peach, those aren't ready yet, but I can have a batch here by tomorrow, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to not frown. You had taken the life of Princess Peach, and her name had come with it. Not being referred to as Pauline would take some getting used to. \"It's no problem,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach smiled, \"Thank you.

With Shulk being asked to fight in the  tournament, the Hands had requested that you pay them a visit so they could model a trophy after you, whatever that meant. It was a shame you didn't actually get to fight like Shulk did, or help him out like Dunban and Riki, or ever just stay and cheer him on, but you'd be cheering him on back home all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Hands's helpers had done their thing, you were free to go back home. You wanted to say goodbye to Shulk first though, so you wandered for a bit instead of heading straight to the exit portal. On your way, you happen across a box lying in the hallway. Since no one in the immediate vicinity seemed to be looking for it, you decide to pick it up yourself and check inside. Maybe you'd find its owner while looking for Shulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the box was some sort of odd looking remote control. \"Heh, looks like something Shulk would like,\" you muse. Along with the remote, a manual was also inside the box. \"Ah, instructions.\" According to the manual, this remote was not for  any sort of electronic device, but rather for altering reality by swapping things between people. \"Blimey...\" You were at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were somewhat tempted to just test it out here and now on someone nearby, but machines were really more Shulk's thing. Perhaps you should find him and show it to him. \"I wonder what he'd have to say about something like this.\"</span></div></div>",

You had been called to this interstellar stadium to be used as a model to create a trophy based on you, since one of the trainers from your institute's predecessor, Wii Fit, had been selected as a fighter in this tournament. You had been sent since you had just finished up work with a client and had a little time before your next client would arrive. You had no interest in this tournament. You could barely believe that any Wii Fit Trainer, U or not, would neglect their work for this long just to participate in some sort of fighting tournament. Not to mention some of the fighters you had seen. From portly plumbers to obese bikers, it seemed like the beings who put together this tournament together needed a fitness trainer on their team more than anyone, and yet the trainer drafted into the tournament had neglected her duties of whipping these fighters into shape. It was almost no wonder she was sent over other trainers; she clearly wasn't cut out for the job and they were probably just trying to get rid of her somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile musing over this, you notice a box lying open in the hallway. Unhealthy, AND messy? You could barely believe the Wii Fit institute would associate themselves with these people. You pick up the box, intending to throw it in the nearest trash can. However, judging by the box's weight, it was clear whoever had left the box here had not removed its contents. Normally you weren't one to snoop, but something about the box made you curious so you checked to see what was inside the box. It seemed to be some sort of television remote, once again adding to your view of how lazy these fighters must be, as well as a manual explaining how the remote worked. Deciding you should at least give these people a bit of a chance, you check the manual to see what the remote is for. To your surprise, the remote is not for a TV system, or any form of electronic device at all. Rather, the remote can somehow alter reality in strange ways by swapping things between the user and the person the remote was pointed at. That idea was absurd! Although it did get you thinking, perhaps you could do some good for this tournament after all. If you switched with someone here, you'd be able to give the fighters a proper training regime. Especially if you swapped with the Wii Fit Trainer already here; you'd be doing away with a lousy trainer and it wouldn't seem too out of character for her. Of course you had no real interest in actually fighting in the tournament, so maybe you should swap with one of the assist or background characters instead.</span></div></div>",

You recognized her from the newcomer introduction. A tall figure in a blue dress with a star flying with her. But that changed after you button had sunken in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant that had changed. Her dress had been replaced with a long sleeve t-shirt and pants, both the same colour of her dress, they look a little like pajamas. Her Hi-heels were now flat, but that was the least of the changes. Her face was now devoid of any make up, her hair was shorter, a little passed her neck, and flattened out. She was also now flat on her chest. And her curvy figure was much more straight, she had also gained more muscle mass, becoming less slender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, figuring that the remote had something to do with it, you saw that the button was the one with circles and sticks. But that wasn't the only change. You own small red, plant-animal body had also changed. The center of your button had pulled inwards, and your chest and hips had expanded outwards. There was also now a wrapping covering your body. Undoing it, you saw two dots on your chest, and something in between your legs. You pulled it closed feeling ashamed.<br>\r\nYou were quite confused to what just happened.</span></div></div>",

You have yearned since your childhood to take part and compete amongst your favourite Nintendo characters. You were one of the millions of fans to receive a letter by the Hands to take part in the tournament, upon further reading you saw that you would be required to use one of your Mii's off of your Wii U or 3DS to send to the tournament to fight in your place. The letter also noted that once the Hands receive the Mii, you'll be sent a helmet allowing you to control your Mii. Due to the giant number of people who received the invitation, the Hands had constructed a way to send seperate groups to different realities so all could partake and as to save space on the grounds. Due to alternative realities you could not take the helmet off until the tournament was over and that only 10 minutes would pass in your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou excitedly boot up your Wii U and open up the Miiverse. Selecting your Mii you are shocked but not entirely surprised to see a tab containing a smash ball saying \"submit Mii.\" Dropping your Mii into the tab, a message shows up saying \"Thank you for your participation. You will be sent your helmet momentarily. Please make sure you are sitting or laying down when you put it on.\" After about 5 minutes the helmet appears on your desk. Putting it on, you start to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up you see that your in a pod. Opening it up an getting out you see pods across the whole room. Walking to the door you see a wireframe fighter at the entrance. After it welcomes you and explains everything to you, you are told to immediately head to lunch for inauguration.<br>\r\nDuring lunch Master Hand appears on the stage (lunchroom is a cafeterium) and asks all of the Mii's to join him for inauguration. Once all of the Mii's are on the stage he introduces all of you. During this, you notice the non-Mii fighters scoffing and not taking respecting your presence. This bothers you, and to top it off, Master makes a comment that even he doesn't consider you serious fighters. Immediately after you head to the gym wanting to improve your technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay there till close and are asked to leave. On your way back to your room, you trip over a box. Upon further observation, you see that the box contains a device and a manual. Reading the manual you are shocked to see what it is capable of. You can use this to gain the respect of the other fighters. But who do you use it on?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>What is this story?</b><br>\r\nFans of swapping fiction may be familiar with a usual technique used to instigate the swaps, being a futuristic remote of sorts. Such a remote is the main plot point of the story, however now this remote is coming to the world of Super Smash Bros for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. How such a remote arrives in this world will be explained in the first chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease note that this story is based on Super Smash Bros for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and as such, will not make reference to future installments. For example, although Ridley has become playable in Super Smash Bros Ultimate, he will still be treated as just a boss character in this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules</b><br>\r\n1. No cursing. This is set in the world of a kids game after all.<br>\r\n2. Sex can be had, but don't describe the intimate details.<br>\r\n3. Please don't use characters who have not yet been confirmed for Super Smash Bros for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. You can use any playable characters, assist trophies, pokeball pokemon, etc. but if it has yet to be confirmed for the latest game in the series, it is treated as not yet having come to the tournament grounds.<br>\r\n4. Do not give the remote new features. Do not make it swap two people who aren't the user. Do not make it swap partially (e.g. lower body instead of full body). Do not make it alter the users personality because of a swap.<br>\r\n5. After the first chapter, please use 2nd person. (e.g. \"You aimed the remote at Mario and pressed the button\") I will be more lenient with this rule if the chapter is actually good, but please do try to stick to 2nd person.<br>\r\n6. Don't overuse chapters that are merely a \"more options\" chapter. It is being used at the start to select the main character, and it's fine to use it to select one of the 6 swap options, but don't spend, like, 10 chapters just deciding who's around a corner.<br>\r\n7. Characters may have a slightly different personality to canon for the sake of the story and the setting of Smash Bros, but don't change them drastically (e.g. psycho killer Villager will not be accepted).<br>\r\n8. Follow the continuity. If a character has found the remote and seen their target in a previous chapter, don't make them find the remote and see their target in the next chapter as well. These chapters are supposed to be happening in chronological order. Also take into account not just the previous chapter, but any chapters before that. (E.g. If a chapter claims Fox's roommate is Pit, then don't change who his roommate is later.). That said, because of the branching nature of the story, different branches may have different continuities. Follow the continuity of the branch you are adding to. (E.g. If a chapter claims that Captain Falcon and Samus are dating, but you're adding to a branch where Samus has been stated to be single, then Samus should be single in your chapter.)<br>\r\nIf a chapter breaks these rules, I will not hesitate to delete it, and you will be notified as to why your chapter was deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Remote</b><br>\r\nThe remote is similar in size and shape to an iPhone, but instead of a touch screen it is a grey metal box with buttons on the top. The buttons for swaps are red, while the swap mode buttons are yellow. There is also a secret panel on the back that can be removed to reveal a few extra buttons, but the panel is hidden very well and will most likely not be found unless the remote is carefully analysed with the utmost care. The secrets are not ever mentioned in the instruction booklet, which came in the package with the remote. Regardless of the swap used, the remote will always stay with the user. (e.g. If you use a Life Swap, you'll end up in the targets life exactly where they were, except that you'll still have the remote in your hand.) Regardless of the swap used, it will always be the user and the target that are the swaps, i.e. the remote is incapable of swapping two targets that don't include the user. The user, and the one affected by the swap, is the person who presses the button, but other characters can also be aware of the swaps regardless of the mode if they hold onto the remote while the swap occurs. Swaps will happen almost instantaneously and will give no indication that something is happening, such as a light or sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Swap Buttons</i><br>\r\nBody Swap - Button is labelled by a man's sillouette (similar to what you'd see indicating the men's restroom). This button will swap the physical body of the target with that of the user. The swapees will retain their original lives and clothing, only their bodies will be swapped.<br>\r\nHead Swap - Button is labelled by a side on sillouette of a face. This button will swap the head of the target with that of the user. The swapees will retain their original lives, as well as anything they wore on their head, but anything held with their body such and clothes and weapons will remain with the body, and thus be given to the other person. Unlike most swaps where the swapees stay in place, in this swap the heads travel to their new bodies, and reality will adjust for this provided the right mode is set (e.g. Mario is talking to Peach when Luigi head swaps with Peach. Mario will think he has been having a conversation with Luigi the whole time.). They will also gain any skills that would be required for their new body, such as putting on a bra or walking in heels.<br>\r\nClothes Swap - Button is labelled by a sillouette of a t-shirt and pants. This button will swap the clothing of the target with that of the user. Swapped clothing includes jewelery, piercings, tattoos (not that I know of any Smash Bros characters who them them), makeup, and weapons. All clothing the character owns will be swapped, not just that which they are wearing. They will also gain any skills that would be required for their new clothing, such as putting on makeup or fighting using a sword.<br>\r\nLife Swap - Button is labelled by a hollow man's sillouette. This button will swap the life of the target with that of the user. While on swap mode 1 or 2, this will cause everyone (or everyone except the target) to believe that the swapees are eachother. They will essentially be the other person only they will retain their own bodies, but no one is aware of that fact. This means that characters will refer to them by the name of the life they currently occupy (although feel free to refer to them as the original character during narration if you don't want it to get too confusing), and they will have will have the clothes, skills, and relationships that match the life they are occupying.. If the swap mode is set to 3, they will gain eachother's clothes and skills, and any physical evidence of their name or relationships will be changed to match the other person. Since everyone is aware of the swap, they will still treat the swapees as if they are themselves, but they may feel weird when treating them by their original names or acting upon original relationships.<br>\r\nRelationship Swap - Button is labelled by the sillouette of two hands holding eachother. This button will swap the relationships of the target with that of the user. Relationships include freindship, romance, rivalry, etc. While on swap mode 1 or 2, people will treat the swapees as they would the other person, but they still know that it's the original person. Any physical evidence of said relationships (e.g. letters from one person to another) will be transfered between the swapees. While on swap mode 3, only physical evidence will be swapped, but people may feel weird when acting upon original relationships. In order to adjust for relationships since most of the characters come from different worlds, if someone swaps relationships with someone from another world (game), adjustments will be made for them to live in that world. (E.g. Link swaps relationships with Mario, Link is now a citizen of the Mushroom Kingdom and uses the mushroom logo in the tournament.)<br>\r\nGender Swap - Button is labelled by the symbols for male and female interlocking. This button will swap the gender of the target with that of the user. The swapees will keep their original clothing, life, weapons, etc., but everything will adjust as if they were born the opposite gender (provided it is a swap between a male and a female). The level of masculinity or femininity of the swapees will also affect the outcome (For instance, a male would end up as a more feminine female if he swapped with Peach as opposed to if he swapped with Samus.). If the swapees are the same gender, only the level of femininity or masculinity will be swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mode Buttons</i><br>\r\nAll mode buttons are labelled by their number.<br>\r\nSwap Mode 1 - In this mode, only the user, and anyone else holding the remote will be aware of the swaps. Everyone else, including the target, will treat the swaps as if they are completely normal. This is the mode set by default.<br>\r\nSwap Mode 2 - In this mode, only the user, the target, and anyone else holding the remote will be aware of the swaps. Everyone else will treats the swaps as if they are normal. Targets will only be aware of swaps they are a part of. (e.g. Mario swaps clothes with Peach, then swaps clothes with Luigi. Peach will believe Mario is still wearing her clothes, while Luigi will believe he is now wearing Mario's clothes.)<br>\r\nSwap Mode 3 - In this mode, everyone is completely aware of the swaps. Any swaps that wouldn't make sense with people being aware, such as LIfe and Relationship, are explained withing the description of the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Secret Buttons</i><br>\r\nThese buttons are all hidden under the secret panel, and are not explained within the manual.<br>\r\nUndo - A small blue button that will undo the last swap. Handy if the person you swapped with (and want to swap back with) is not around for you to swap with.<br>\r\nReset - A small red button. This will reverse all swaps up to the set position. If not position is set, then everything will just return to normal.<br>\r\nSet - A small yellow button. This will set a position for the reset to reverse to. If reset is pressed after set, only swaps that occur after pressing set will be reversed. (e.g. from the Swap Mode 2 example, if Mario pressed set after swapping with Peach, then pressed reset after swapping with Luigi, he would only reverse the swap with Luigi.)<br>\r\nScramble - A small green button. This will select one type of swap, and then perform that type of swap randomly on everyone in the close vicinity.<br>\r\nAware - A small orange button. This will cause the person the remote is pointed at to be aware of any swaps that have happened, and any that will happen later. If this feature is used on someone who is set to unaware, they will return to normal awareness dictated by the mode.<br>\r\nUnaware - A small purple button. This will cause the person the remote is pointed at to be unaware of any swaps that have happened, and any that will happen later, regardless of what mode the remote is set to. If this feature is used on someone who is set to aware, they will return to normal awareness dictated by the mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Setting</b><br>\r\nThe Super Smash Bros tournament is a tournament held by the brothers, Master Hand and Crazy Hand. They gather fighters from all throughout the galaxy, with a few handpicked from outside of their own galaxy. The grounds for the tournament have been built floating in outer space, with a colossal dome over the top to keep the air in. At the moment, the fighters are merely training and preparing for the tournament. Even though they all want to win, most of the competitors have made friends with eachother. Even the villains put aside their differences... to an extent. At the very least, they don't engage the heroes in combat whenever they see them. There are living quarters with each character's room (every room is shared between 2 characters. Olimar will always share a room with someone who doesn't need oxygen so he can have the oxygen drained out of his room. That way he doesn't always have to wear the space suit.), a cafeteria, rooms for leisure activities, and a gym. However most of the tournament grounds is taken up by the large stadiums where the battles will actually take place, and where most of the characters prefer to do their training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's the basics for the story, sorry if it was a bit long. But now, enjoy. Oh, and feel free to add chapters. I won't be writing the whole story myself.</td>",
