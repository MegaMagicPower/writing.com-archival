            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You <i>hate</i> cleaning the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since you were a young boy, you've always hated even entering the attic. It's dusty, moldy, dimly lit, and it's full of old junk that nobody could possibly care about, you figure. I mean, it's in the attic, isn't it? Nobody puts shit in the attic that they want to keep close at hand. Now that you're home from college for the summer and you've been tasked with cleaning it out, you can see that hasn't changed one bit. On nice days like this, you should be out doing something with your boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust look at all this garbage. All this antique furniture left by your grandfather, you bet it probably looked somewhat presentable when he had it, but it didn't go with anything in your parents' house, so off it went into the attic, forgotten. This may very well be an archaeological find, judging by how old some of these items look. You open the round window at the front end of the attic so you don't suffocate in the stale air up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're walking you bump your knee on a vanity with a missing mirror and accidentally knock over a vase which was precariously perched on its corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" you mutter, hoping your mom didn't hear that. As you bend over to pick up the pieces, you notice something gleam off the beam of your flashlight. Something very strange-looking indeed. You reach under the vanity and pull it out to inspect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a sizeable knife, probably the most beautiful one you've ever seen. The first thing you notice as you gently swing it around is how incredibly light it is. The handle is like a tight coil of polished silver with a sleek guard to protect the fingers of whoever wields it. The pommel has the brightest gem you've ever seen, the magenta-tinted stone catching your flashlight and making it dance like a kaleidoscope on the floor and wall in front of you. The onyx-colored blade is firm, razor sharp, and delicately curved ending in an incredibly fine point. This looks more like a priceless work of art than a knife. You not only have no idea how it got in that vase, but also how it's stayed in such pristine condition when everything else in here looks like it would crumble if you breathed on it wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the knife on top of the rickety old vanity and continue your inventory of the attic. There's, what, <i>three armoires</i> up here? Who even needs that many bulky, ugly closets? You walk over to the dustiest one and brush off a few cobwebs. Slowly, you pry it open, the ancient door creaking to reveal nothing but a couple old coats. They're wrapped in plastic, but somehow the super-powered moths living in your attic have managed to get through them and devour significant portions of them anyway. You push them aside to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"FUCK!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bat, cranky from having its beauty sleep interrupted, takes flight in the direction of your face! You scream and stumble back, tumbling over the vanity and falling to the floor. It breaks with a crunch and you hear the knife clatter on the floorboards. You shelter in place, putting your hand over your head as the bat circles the room. Eventually, it finds the open window and makes its exit. You get up quickly and rush to shut the window so it can't get back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\" you gasp as you wipe the sweat from your brow with your wrist. Wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wasn't there a hand here a minute ago?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down wide-eyed at your right arm to see that it ends in a perfectly smooth stump of flesh. It looks like you never had a hand. You'd scream again if it weren't for the shock. Out of the corner of your eye, you spot something moving on the floor by the rubble of the vanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... couldn't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was, your hand. Your detached hand performing the exact movements you're making and feeling. You attempt to hold up two fingers, and the limb complies. You give yourself a thumbs up, again all systems go. You bend over and pick up your hand, noting how strange it feels to be holding it like this. As you look it over you notice no significant damage other than a couple minor scuffs from landing hard on the floor. It also ends in the exact same stump your right wrist does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting two and two together, you try to put hand and wrist together. Thankfully, two and two add up to four. Your hand is securely attached back on your wrist. No amount of tugging seems to pop it back off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did that happen?\" you ask yourself, until you notice the gemstone-encrusted pommel of the knife poking out from the rubble of the destroyed vanity. You brush the wood aside and retrieve the blade. It's still in immaculate condition. There's only one explanation as to what could have happened to your hand, but it's just... insane... right? Right!? Your heart flutters as you decide to take the ultimate leap of faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing...\" you say as you tightly shut your eyes and grip the knife, swinging it down quickly. You don't even hear a chop, you just hear and feel a thud. When you open your eyes, your left hand is resting on the ground, again, no blood or pain. You bend over and pick this one up too, examining it. After you're sufficiently sure what you're seeing is real, you put it back on and wiggle your fingers, testing them. Everything continues to be all good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be fun. Weird, but fun,\" you say, forgetting all about cleaning the attic. But, who should you talk to first about the knife?</span></div></div>",

Sure, there's been plenty of teasing between you two over the years, but it's always come from a place of love and mutual respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pocket the knife and descend the attic stairs, making a U-turn in the narrow upstairs hallway. Your brother's door is covered in stickers and kitschy fake road signs. You knock, but the door slowly creaks open. Nobody's home. You shrug and let yourself in, There's all manner of sports memorabilia and a couple posters of swimsuit-clad women. So stereotypical of the jock older brother to have a room decorated like that, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the photo on his desk of Paul and his girlfriend, Amanda. If you swung that way... damn. Suddenly, the world goes dark! You feel an intense pressure on your head! And then... a noogie? You realize that the universe is not, in fact, abruptly collapsing, but that it's just your brother sneaking up on you to give you his customary \"welcome-home\" greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Ross!\" he bellows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Paul, get off me!\" you shout through laughter. Finally breaking free, you give Paul a real hug and he happily returns it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really summer break already?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, man, I'm home for a few months,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! We should go out and play football with the guys later!\" Paul enthusiastically suggests. You've never really been a sports geek, but you like to spend time with Paul so you usually humor him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later, big bro, right now I have to show you something I found in the attic.\" You reach into your back pocket and draw the knife. The blade shines in the sunlight pouring through the window. Your brother backs up cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Ross, watch where you're waving that,\" he warns. You scoff, much to his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, man, you don't understand. This is, like, some kind of magic knife or dagger or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother looks incredulous. \"Really?\" he says, clearly not buying a single thing you're selling. You decide you don't want to argue about this so you decide to just show him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise not to freak out,\" you say. But before Paul can even ask why, you bring the blade to your neck and chop straight through with absolutely no resistance. Your head leaps off your neck and into your startled brother's hands while you stand there crossing your arms, headless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now </i>do you believe me?\" you ask from your new vantage point. Paul stammers and stutters, trying to process what's happening. You shut the door and lock it, noting your surprising dexterity despite losing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... magic, huh?\" he finally squeaks out, sitting on his bed with your head still held tight in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my guess, anyway,\" you say, shrugging your empty shoulders. Paul looks both parts of you over and after a bit of deliberation, gets a mischievous gleam in his eye. Uh oh. You recognize that look. Soon, his knuckles are grinding on your scalp once again in a brotherly noogie. At least it didn't take him long to warm up to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce things settle down, you sit down next to him and hold your head in your lap. Paul begins to rapid fire questions at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does your head go back on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just need to touch it back to my neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it only do heads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I managed to cut off my hands earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, feels kinda good, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you controlling your... the rest of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say as you wave to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Paul says, putting more thought into the next question. He blushes a little and finally asks...</span></div></div>",

Don't attach your head! I wanted you to be headless with me,\" he interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you want too. I'll gladly be headless with you,\" you say, giving him a friendly smile. Your body gets up and brings the blade into Paul's neck and cuts it, in a very easy way. His head starts falling off, but thankfully your body grabs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how do you feel bro? You like it?\" you asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels awesome, I love the feeling!\" he giggles and says excited, his body touching his own empty neck stump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all of that. Paul's body grabs you and sits you on his lap, your body is petting Paul's head softly. Both of you enjoy this calm time, being headless and chilling in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you hear a notification sound, it's Paul's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, Paul?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go, my team needs me for football practice...\" he says, kinda disappointed because he wanted to be headless for a more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!!

Taking that as his cue, Taylor started his show, seductively narrowing his eyes and grinning as he leveled your package with his mouth.  He moved in painful slow motion, half a dozen warm and teasing breaths pouring over your dick as he slowly inched it forward before finally closed his lips, with only the head between them.  Your closed his eyes entirely, his expression going from impish to serene in record time as he gently lapped at your glans.

Within half a millimeter exact) you always thought that Taylor's more curved shaft and bigger, pinker head always made his look more impressive than your did.

Leaning down and taking Taylor's entire length in a single thrust, you found that Taylor agreed, his throat producing a low and satisfied grumble as his free hand firmly gripped the back of your short cut hair.  While you didn't have the raw talent and honed technique that Taylor had, what with him being your first boyfriend while you were his forth, the frantic pace you moved at as you tried to catch up with his head-headstart was doing a good job of compensating for the skill gap.  Feeling Taylor's precise tongue movements resume, you made a mental note to 'practice' on yourself with the knife before your next date.  Really surprise him with how much you'd improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your thoughts, Taylor surprised you with a grand display of his superior skills.  Your eyes widened and your sucking came to a screeching halt you felt Taylor tip his head back, open his mouth wide, and allowed the head and half your shaft to slide down his throat, your balls sinking into his mouth which closed tightly behind them.  Just as you were about to worry if Taylor would accidentally swallow one of your most precious pieces, his throat clamped down tightly against your cock and his tongue firly pressed a ball into the roof of his mouth, holding you secure.  The sensation of this before anatomically impossible deepthroating instantly buckled your knees, dropping you hard on your ass as you moaned uncontrollably.  Taylor leaned forward slowly, his tongue massaging your slightly fuzzy balls while his throat squeezed and released the head of your cock.  When he was low enough for you to see his face, his cheeks puffed up like a squirrel hoarding nuts and his complexion red with exertion, he smiled, and began jerking off right in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sights and sensations were too much for you to handle, and with a sharp gasp you came down his throat, gsqueezing your empty groin as the pressure released.  Feeling you empty your load down his throat, Taylor closed his eyes and jerked faster, not wanting to pull you out until he was done but also not wanting to asphyxiate on your rod.  Just as you were leaning in to help speed him along, Taylor finished, plastering your nose, forehead, and hair with what had to be his biggest load ever.  You were a bit embarrassed that you didn't get to finish him off yourself, but judging by Taylor's ridiculous o-face he didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his mouth and grabbing your sack firmly, Taylor dragged your sopping wet tool out of his mouth and took several long, deep breaths.  \"Think... this belongs... to you...\"  He panted, holding your cock out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\"  You say, taking your cock back in one hand and trying to wipe some of his mess off the lenses of your glasses.  \"Nothing a nice hot shower won't fix.  Care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch,\"  Taylor said, pausing and waving his hand for added dramatic flair, \"You could not STOP me from joining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on then, let's go.\"  You said, grabbing Taylor's hand with one hand and continuing to carry your detached cock in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't even occur to you to put your dick back on, your body already so comfortable walking around in its modified state.  Perhaps it was this comfort, and the sight of your magic knife on the table, that caused Taylor to say \"Wait a sec, why are you showering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around, confused, and used your saliva caked cock to point at your cum soaked face.  \"Uh, because I'm not going to walk around all day like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but like, why is ALL of you showering?  Only two of your parts are really dirty.\"  He said, reaching out and grabbing the knife off your desk.  \"And since it's all my mess, I think it's only fair that I be the one to clean it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding, you shrug your shoulders and say \"I cannot fault the logic.  Go ahead and clean me, you dirty boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter clapping his hands rapidly in front of his chest and squeeing with delight, the single cutest and gayest thing you'd ever seen your boyfriend do, Taylor took a fistful of your hair and slide the knife through your throat from front to back.  While the knife tickled like crazy, you managed to keep still enough for a mostly level cut, and when Taylor somewhat painfully) lifted you off of your shoulders the look in his yes showed that he was completely satisfied with the quality of the cut.  \"God, how could you manage to become even more adorable?\"  He asked, bringing your blushing severed head in for a quick kiss before tucking youn under one arm like a ball and taking your cock with his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwaddling to the bathroom with his pants still around his ankles, Taylor set your head and genitals down in the rim of the sink while he stripped naked and started the shower.  While he was busy, you had your headless, dickless body feel around for your bed and climb into it, laying out spread eagle and letting out a deep, contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really needed to clear out the attic more often.  Who knows what else is up there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God you were wearing your safety goggles, I could've taken your eye out!\"  Taylor said, lifting your glasses off of your face and running them under the hot water, patting them down with damp washcloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, if you were the last thing I saw I wouldn't mind going blind.\"  You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you sweet talking skank, stop before you give me a cavity.\"  Taylor said, in a way that made it very clear he wanted you to go on.  Setting your glasses aside, Taylor picked up your head and cock and stepped into the shower, setting your head down on the alcove meant for storing shampoo and soap and whatnot which he'd already taken the liberty of clearing of all shampoos and soaps and whatnots.  Standing under the running water and lovingly scrubbing down your cock and balls, you felt your member struggle desperately to build up a third erection in the span of 20 minutes.  It managed only a strained half-mast, even with your body rubbing your neck and crotch stumps in the other room, but the lecherous grin Taylor shot you as he squeezed your raw cock showed made it seem like the sexiest thing in the world to him.  When he finished cleaning your tool off, and after he gave himself a good once over with the soap and shampoo to remove any excess sweat, Taylor swapped out your head and began cleaning you off with a soapy sponge.  Cradled between your boyfriend's lean arm and firm chest, warm water lapping over your face, the scent of lavender filling the air as he scrubbed you clean with what seemed like the softest sponge in the known universe, your body sprawled across your bed, and all of that in the wake of the best blowjob in your life, you smile contently and before you know it you managed to fall asleep right in Taylor's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long you were out, but when you wake up you're...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Heh, feeling kinky, Ross?\" Taylor says. You smile and kiss him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you're keeping mine, I'm gonna need a replacement,\" you say with a mischievous grin. Before Taylor can fully process what you just said, you quickly swing the knife through the base of his junk and attach them to your own null crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stinker, I'll get you back for this,\" Taylor threatens teasingly. Suddenly, the feeling of your boyfriend's much larger junk zips through your nervous system and you realize you can feel and control his junk. Taylor, on the other hand, is now realizing that he no longer has feeling of any junk at all. He grabs at his smooth bulge between his legs, playing with the null stump and moaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh, it's like there's something there but the feeling is dulled... like I'm rubbing my cock through four layers of clothing...\" Taylor grunts. Meanwhile, you're getting quite a bit of enjoyment out of his stolen equipment. You can comfortably fit both hands on his shaft and his balls are nice and heavy in your palm. Your boyfriend was packing a serious monster, but you've certainly tamed the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will give that back, right?\" Taylor asks as he watches you stroke what used to be his, a tinge of worry coloring his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... don't worry, babe...\" you moan reassuringly, \"I'd never steal something like this for good from you. I love you too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, Ross...\" Taylor says, standing over you and proudly displaying his null crotch. The sight of your boyfriend's genderless body makes you even harder. \"Let me show you how to use that thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor pushes you onto your back on your bed, straddling you and planting his butt on your belly as he kisses you passionately. His fingers find your nipples and give them gentle pinches. He knows what you like, you can feel your new junk throbbing with desperate need. Taylor seems to sense this- or maybe he just hears you moaning into his kisses -and pushes his butt back, his hole teasingly pressing against the tip of your long, thick cock. Taylor briefly gasps in a cute high-pitched voice as it makes contact with him, causing you to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you know I'm not usually a bottom,\" Taylor says, trying to fight off a blush and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What changed your mind today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aside from having pretty much no other option right now, you think I'm gonna pass up a chance to take my own dick? That's every guy's dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're <i>pretty sure</i> that isn't true, but you just shrug and put your hands on his hips, guiding them up and over your cock, which is now standing straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready, babe?\" You ask, basically trembling with anticipation. Taylor answers by simply easing down onto your borrowed shaft, taking only a few inches. He lets out a cute squeak as you produce a deep moan, you've fucked Taylor before, but that was with your own cock. This is like a whole new sensation. He suddenly feels much tighter and your new tip is so much more sensitive. It's incredible. Your legs are jelly as he starts to slowly move up and down his former dick, taking just a little more of the length each time he lowers himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he finally lets in the last inch and his soft butt makes contact with your groin, Taylor having officially taken his entire own cock balls-deep. You feel yourself on the very edge of orgasm when your boyfriend leans forward and kisses you, holding your cheeks and panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat does it. You're sent over the edge as your new balls tighten up, your shaft begins to throb faster, and you feel yourself pumping a hell of a load into your boyfriend's tight ass.You don't even have enough energy left to moan, you sinply hold him tight and lay there as waves of bliss radiate through your body in time with each throb. Finally, the pressure dies down and you are both left panting and sweaty as you cuddle in the afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Ross... how was my junk? Everything you imagined?\" Taylor says, half asleep in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more...\" you say, \"that was the greatest load I've ever shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmh... same...\" he says. Wait, same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, how is that possible?\" You ask, sitting up in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... near the end I just started to feel this sort of tingle between my legs, even though there was nothing there. It got stronger and stronger until I just felt this warmth all through my body, like when you get good shivers down your back, but it came from my crotch and spread everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy... so you liked not having a dick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I think I'd prefer having one to not having one, but this was definitely fun, and I'd totally do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you want it back?\"</span></div></div>",

Taylor looks down at it like it's made of solid gold. He spends a little bit of time carefully deliberating what to remove first, but it's clear when he's made his decision. He carefully places your cock and balls on your bedside table and undoes his pants, letting them drop to the floor along with his underwear and exposing his rock hard dick and heavy balls. You barely get a look before-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Schwick!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey land with a soft plop on your pillow, Taylor's crotch proudly displaying the same smooth round bulge as the one between your legs. He starts to rub and gently squeeze his null mound, moaning softly. The sight is making you pretty horny as well as you start to copy him. You pick up his detached genitals and set them down next to yours, both of your throbbing on the table as you smile and look into his eyes. You embrace him and start to make out, your smooth crotches rubbing together and sending waves of intense pleasure up your spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall on the bed on top of him and start grinding on each other, enjoying every moment of this. It's pure bliss and you are intensely thankful to share it with someone you love. After a short while, you both feel a warmth radiate from your crotches as you gasp and moan, blushing as you hold each other tighter. You feel amazing, renewed even, like a surge of energy just ripped through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... fuck... what was that, Ross?\" Taylor croaks out, panting in the afterglow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I think we just came...\" you reply, similarly winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Came? With what? Our cocks are still on your table, they're definitely hard but they're also dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, babe, but if I had to guess... I think we just had a null orgasm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor blushes and smiles, looking down at his round soft crotch and rubs it gently. You place a hand on it with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor, you feel so warm down here...\" you say softly. Taylor nods and puts his hand on your crotch bulge, causing you to shudder a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you, Ross,\" he says. \"I think, for now at least, I want to stay this way. Can you keep an eye on my junk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do? I mean, sure, but... for how long? A week? A month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure yet, I just wanna see how life like this is for a while. I'll. let you know when I want my dick back, Ross.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or if you want it back,\" you say, laughing and kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah. What about you, do you wanna be null with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis experience has been particularly wild, that felt way better than any orgasm you've had before.

It also seems to have awakened something inside you, because right now there is nothing in the world more important to you than taking it back to your room, locking the door, and not coming out for several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically sprint down the attic stairs and into your room. You close the door, lock it, and barricade it with a chair. Probably overkill, but you definitely don't want to be disturbed at a time like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart races and you can feel your face turning red at the thought of your first real idea. You bring the knife up to your neck and shut your eyes, swiftly chopping straight through it. You feel a pleasing sort of peeling sensation as you tumble forward off your shoulders and land face down on your bed. It's surprisingly easy to direct your headless body remotely to find you and pick you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" is all you can muster, looking at your headless body from your own hands. The stump between your shoulders is smooth and alluring. It really looks like you never had a head to begin with. You set your head down on the bed and stand in front of yourself, poking and stroking the stump. It just feels <i>so good,</i> so sensitive and alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour libido officially gets the better of you as you watch your headless body slowly pull your hoodie up, the shirt under coming with it a bit and exposing your slender midriff. This feels somewhat narcissistic, lusting after your own body like this, but it also feels so right that you really don't care. You watch your body toss the hoodie to the side as it playfully removes its shirt as well. You start to dance sensually and slowly, the way you would imagine a stripper dances. You breathe heavily as a disembodied head, watching your body's chest rise and fall at the same rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it moves on to the good part. Your body undoes its belt, tossing it aside and shaking its butt at you, your jeans sliding off your legs and revealing the tight briefs you put on this morning. You've never seen your ass from this angle. You've certainly been missing out, because <i>damn.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You been working out?\" you joking ask your body. You wave your hand at your head in a way that says <i>\"oh, hush, you~\"</i>, pretending your body is someone else. This little exchange causes your crotch to bulge even more. Looks like you discovered a kink you didn't even know you had... or even knew existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, uh... me... show me your... my goods?\" you say, trying to talk all sexy but stumbling over your words and confusing your boner. You put your hand on your hip and rub your elbow in an embarrassed fashion. \"Maybe I should work on my dirty talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off the awkwardness and return to putting on a show for yourself. You dance and sway closer and closer to your head on your bed until you get the brilliant idea to just rip off your underwear. Your respectable 6 inch cock bounces out and almost hits you in the nose. Unable to contain yourself, you puck up your head and push it onto the head of your cock, sucking on your own tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the dancing and general kinkiness of your first headless self-suck proves to be more than you can handle at the moment and you blow your load almost immediately. You take yourself by surprise and accidentally spray cum all over your face. Luckily, your glasses kept it from going in your eyes. You throw on some clothes and pick up your head, tucking it under the crook of your arm and stealthily making your way to the bathroom to get some toilet paper to wipe your face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're on your lap cleaning yourself, you can't help but love the feeling of being headless. There's no two ways about it, this knife is your key to a happier and more interesting life. But what to do with it next?</span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t hear or see things around one without the other, your eyes and ears are on your head after all... and though you suppose relocate an ear, hearing alone doesn\u2019t help your body find its way, and your eyes in particular are not very useful off your head without some serious modifications: you need your glasses to see clearly. Without them anything more than a few feet away from you turns into fuzzy blobs. besides, the thought of removing an eye with the knife gives you the willies... that and eyes where they don\u2019t belong are creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sullen sigh you place your head back on your neck and roll said neck until it pops.

Though, if memory serves it broke because it got fumbled one Christmas, and got put up in the attic because your dad was gonna fix it but never got around to it. <i>If</i> it\u2019s anything like your flashlight the fact that it\u2019s broken shouldn\u2019t be an issue... but it might hurt, potential a lot, as broken bits in machinery seem to smart until the magic fixes them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could find something or someone else to use/show the knife on/to.

You're taken aback not only by his warmth but by his beautiful face. You could get lost in his big brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh?

Al smiles, crossing his arms and looking at you quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ross, what's on your mind?\" He asks, acting like you two are old friends already. You glance over your shoulder, noticing a few more customers browsing the shelves. It's probably a bad idea to play with the knife where other people can see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can... we go somewhere a little more private?\" you ask. You realize this is starting to sound a lot more flirtatious than you intended. Alejandro, on the other hand, doesn't seem to mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, man, follow me. There's a rack near the back of the store we can hide behind.\" He takes your hand and leads you through the store as you blush. Soon, you reach the fabled <i>Rack at the Back of the Store.</i> Truly the legends didn't do it justice. With only a couple of CDs from some 70s band you've never heard of under a dusty and misspelled \"CLEARANEC\" sign, you doubt anyone will disturb you back here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlejandro shoves it aside a little, revealing a door frame without a door leading into a disused storage room. There are a couple of cardboard standees of musicians you don't recognize and an empty metal shelf with some cobwebs, but more importantly an air mattress, a camping lantern, a stack of magazines, and a couple of six-packs of warm cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice place,\" you whisper as you walk inside and he pulls the rack over the hole, \"is this like a secret clubhouse of yours or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl giggles quietly and scoffs. \"Something like that, yeah. As far as I know, the cashiers don't know about this room. It's the perfect place to go when I want to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, this is one of the cooler things I've seen in a mall,\" you say, inspecting the closet. Behind you, you hear the jingle of a belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you ready?\" Al says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hold on!\" You whisper-shout, turning back with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Isn't this what we're doing? I thought you were asking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I mean, you're really attractive and everything, but I wanted to show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl scoffs again, putting his belt back on. \"Tch, come on, man! I even showed you my hideout! This had better be a cool something.\" He brushes his hair from his face, lightly scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk. \"Oh, you won't be disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the knife from your holster. Al backs up and puts his hands up, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell, I don't have any money, dude!\" Al says worriedly. You put your hands up as well, trying to show him you mean no harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand, I'm not robing you and this isn't a normal knife,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a normal knife?\" Al repeats. \"What do you mean by that?\" He asks, keeping his distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this, just don't freak out too much, things are about to get really weird...\" you warn, turning it around and using it on yourself. You slice straight through your neck! Your head pops off with a little bit of pressure, flying forward a little and landing on the air mattress unharmed and looking straight up at Alejandro. His face turns white as a sheet, but thankfully he doesn't scream or run away. He relaxes his stance and looks down at you, mouth completely agape, then to your body, still standing up as you make it put one hand on its hip and use the other to give a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you it was about to get weird,\" you chide, \"don't be shy, you can pick me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl kneels down and inspects your detached head, poking your nose to check if you're real. \"Ow,\" you say. He picks you up, his hands a little clammy from shock, and starts to rotate you, checking your head out from every angle. Your body stumbles a little from dizziness, but you're able to remain standing. He then tucks you under the crook of his arm like a football and approaches your body slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't bite, Al,\" you say teasingly. He reaches out and touches your neck stump. His touch tickles a little, but mostly just sends pleasurable tingles down your spine. Al also seems to be enjoying the act of massaging your neck stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... the most fuckin' metal thing I've ever seen...\" he mutters, still in utter disbelief of the situation before him. \"This doesn't hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... when you touch my stump it feels amazing...\" you say, barely holding back moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I like...\" Al says, trailing off and lifting your detached head to his eye level. You wink and smile at him, enjoying his bewilderment. He reaches forward and places you back on your neck stump, your head reattaching seamlessly. You're a little disappointed that he put you back, but you also enjoy that he's now begun to feel at and inspect your reattached neck for any kind of seam or scar. He's amazed to find none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is wild...\" he says, looking you over some more. \"The knife you have does that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw you checking out the music and... I kinda wanna try it on you, I mean, if you're into it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ross, my man, are you kidding? This is the coolest shit I've ever witnessed, I'd be psyched to participate in whatever crazy magic you got going on!\" Alejandro says, unable to contain his excitement while managing his volume enough that nobody in the store hears him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" you chirp, blushing with pride and raising the knife again, \"where do you want me to cut first?\" It takes Alejandro no time at all to come up with an idea.</span></div></div>",

She's dubious, but she takes it, rotating you every which way and checking for any sort of trick. She gives your body a glance... and then suddenly turns your head around and tucks it under her arm so you can't see yourself! She then spins your dumbfounded body around and unzips your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I'm not the only one you tried to hit today!\" She says, throwing your shirts out and on the sink counter. It isn't long before she finds your prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaah!\" She yelps, dropping the stolen cock and balls into a sink. \"Is that real too? Ugh, I hope I didn't just touch yours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I got that from some other guy I found sleeping on a bench,\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw him earlier while I was doing my daily walk. Never would have known he was packing like this...\" she says, picking the package back up and inspecting it meekly. She gives it a couple strokes and notices it throb as the balls tighten up. A tiny bead of pre forms at the tip. She seems enamored by the idea of holding a living detached penis. You begin to formulate a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm really sorry I tried to take your hand, I promise I won't try to steal parts anymore. If you give my head back and let me go, I'll give you that cock I stole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman puts your head on the counter, still holding the dick in her hand. She seems to be considering it...</span></div></div>",

Once home, you head straight to your room and lock the door, dumping out your shirts from your backpack and unfurling your prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's really a magnificent cock, you didn't have any time to admire it when you were stealing it, but boy did you hit the jackpot. You start to rub it so you can check it out in its full glory. Before you know it, the detached dick is standing at a highly respectable seven inches. The tip, while circumcised, is dark pink and nicely flared, standing out from the shaft that you estimate is somewhat thicker than a D-cell battery, but not thick enough that it'd cause any pain. The balls are plump and sag lower than yours, but not so low that they'd be swinging around drastically. There's definitely a satisfying pliability to the sack, though. Overall, a wonderful cock that you'd be happy to sit on any day of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat <i>is</i>  why you took it, right? You wanted the most realistic toy money could never hope to buy. Or did you want to replace your own junk? It's nothing to sneeze at, of course, but this set is definitely bigger. An upgrade could be nice.</span></div></div>",

Detachment and swapping hijinks quickly ensue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Information about the knife:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n+ There is no pain or blood involved in a cut with the knife.<br>\r\n+ The stumps left behind are smooth and have skin/hair/fur/etc covering them to match the surrounding area of the body.<br>\r\n+ Detached parts are under the control of whoever they were last attached to, no matter how far away they are from their part.<br>\r\n+ Parts can be attached to other people or where they don't normally go, for example person A could swap heads with person B or person A could switch the positions of his head and his genitals.<br>\r\n+ When a part is swapped with someone else, they get to control it. Heads are king/queen, they control anything their consciousness is connected to.<br>\r\n+ If, during a swap, person A puts on person B's body without putting person B's head on person A's body (leaving that body without a head \"synchronized\" with it), the body can either go limp and fall over <i>or</i> it can enter a sort of \"autopilot\" mode. Whatever is hotter in your current situation. ;3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules are as follows:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n+ No killing characters.<br>\r\n+ <span class=\"clred\"><b>Nothing</b> sexual or swap-related involving animals or minors. I have zero tolerance for this.</span><br>\r\n+ LGBT+ oriented chapters are OK and encouraged!<br>\r\n+ No ultra-short chapters. If you're going to add, please try to contribute something other than a single binary choice with one or two sentences.<br>\r\n+ No chapters that immediately undo the choice someone writes in.<br>\r\n+ No more than two heads to a single body, if you decide to take a path in that direction.<br>\r\n+ If you want to add a new character for the main character have sex with, don't jump straight into it. Leave a little bit of buildup to establish and develop their relationship. It doesn't have to be over several chapters, but you can't just go right from \"nice to meet you\" to \"let me fuck your head.\"<br>\r\n+ <span class=\"clblue\"><b>Proofread your chapters before adding them.</b></span> <b>Please use good grammar!</b></td>",
