That was before the sun shined in through his windows and onto his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s face scrunched up in little irritation before opening his eyes. Seeing that it was day, he reluctantly sat up with a groan and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning already?\u201d Naruto questioned tiredly before checking his clock and saw that it was 10:00 a.m.. \u201cGuess I should get up then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got out of bed and quickly made it up before heading to the bathroom and make himself some breakfast. As he ate his bowl of cereal, Naruto wondered what he was gonna do for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. What am I gonna do on my day off? I don\u2019t have any missions and I don\u2019t feel like training today.\u201d Naruto said before shrugging. \u201cEh. Maybe I\u2019ll go out and see if I  can find something to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting away his bowl and getting dressed, Naruto headed out into the village. As he walked down the dirt road with his arms held behind his head, he looked out for something to do, but didn\u2019t see anything fun. To Naruto, it was just a boring day in the village right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in mind, Naruto thought had some things he could try. He thought about meeting up with one of his friends to see if they wanted to hang out. He also remembered an address Pervy Sage had given him for the best sex club, called Reflections, in case Naruto ever wanted to get some \u201cexperience\u201d. Not that he ever would on normal circumstances. He wondered if there was a third option? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Naruto deal with his boredom? Does he run into one of his kunoichi friends, his age or older? Does he decide to try the ses club after all? Or does Naruto find something else to try? </span></div></div>",

I only have 2 rules for you all to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: <br>\r\n#1) Please focus on Naruto Uzumaki from Part 1 and Part 2 series. Nothing from the Boruto series. Everybody hates Boruto. Anything with Boruto will be deleted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2) This is NOT an all fetish story. That means NO VORE! NO FULL BODY SHRINKING!! NO CLOTHES TRANSFORMATION!!! NO PISS/SCAT!!!! Anything with this will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s all that I ask of you is to follow these rules. I\u2019m sorry, but when writers do add that stuff, you see a huge decline in other writers, because the people who\u2019ve added this stuff have cut off all directions in an interactive story and ruined it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just got tired of seeing all of that, which is why this is a more specific story for people with specific fetishes. </td>",
