If they do it it might not work, and nothing would change. If it does work then you can see what it is like, but since you would be on the inside of the pokeball with Gardevoir you might be trapped in there with her until another trainer let's you out.  On top of that you are a living human, and pokeballs are designed for pokemon only, so if it does work then you might be turned into a pokemon as well.  If your luck is bad you might even be a shrunken pokemon.  And if it is really bad it might use Gardevoir's gender as a base and turn you into a female pokemon.
