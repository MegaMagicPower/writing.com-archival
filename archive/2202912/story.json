Her belly sagged heavily beneath her barrel, and her butt was rounder and jigglier.  Her legs were thicker, and her face had gotten plumper as well.

But while Applejack may have been the Element of Honesty, Rarity knew she was lying to herself.  She had been snacking a lot while working, accepting treats brought over and eating them without a second thought.  She hadn't gone out much for exercise, and the villains had all been quiet lately, so adventuring for exercise was out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There has to be a way to handle this fat,\" Rarity said, frowning and thinking.</span></div></div>",
