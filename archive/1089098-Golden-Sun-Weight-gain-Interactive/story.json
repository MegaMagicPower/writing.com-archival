Sheba also voiced her opinion, saying that she too thought the psynergy would be beneficial to their party, while Piers was against needless risk and Felix remained in doubt still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much debating, Jenna started to become irritated 'It's time someone made up their minds around here, i've made up mine, and i'm going in!'

She huffed and continued boldly -well, kind of- through the snuffy cave. She gained confidence from the lack of monsters, which was a pleasent suprise. She wandered on, pebbles flying from her steps. The silence gave her a nice chance to think about things that had happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then, there was a crackle of rocks grinding behind her! She flipped round, pulling out her staff, ready for action. There was standing... A Gnome Mage...! She looked at the tiny thing, half grinning. She briskly walked over to it, the Gnome Mage bewildered by this. She gripped the staff and gave the gnarled head a quick thwack, knocking it flat. It promtly faded to ash, pretty normal. She quickly turned round and continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The next half hour was uneventful, which, by this time, she had grown quite bored... Suddenly, she saw a light at the end of the cave. She picked up the pace, sprinting to the source. She quickly came to the psynergy tablet and snatched it from it's placehold. She read the stone encravings; \"item dublicate\". It lit up, granting the power to Jenna. As the light faded, the tablet disappeared, and she looked around. She quickly noticed a strange, chocolate cake had appeared where the stone was. She thought out loud; \"wha- how? Ah, I am pretty hungry. I wonder if they would want any? Would be a good test! Now, how many...\"</span></div></div>",

Luckily, they landed safely on the table. She decided to continue with the cakes where they were. Again, she focused. She heard several plops, but didn't stop until she felt something brush against her face. Jenna instantly openned her eyes to see a cake wall and took a startled step back. She had filled the cavern with cakes! 2000 to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jenna knew it would be a long way back to the exit, and taking the cakes back would be harder, so she decided that to have a QUICK taste.

Her arms filled with fat, plumply rounded. Her chest had grown too, each breast larger then her head, which was also very swollen, in the chin and cheeks. Her butt had become more massive as well, and her hips and legs nearly twice as wide. All this extra weight, estimated at 200 lbs, had crushed the bed underneath her while she was sleeping. It was impossible to have gained this much from just one hearty meal, what did that waitress put in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to stand up, tho she had a hard time trying to stay on her feet. Her enormous belly and butt made her feel unbalanced. She could barely move around, and yet still... she felt hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have an eating problem\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said in a near comical self relevation, if she could get this fat and still want more, she wasnt thinking straight. In fact, she might even have to ask her friends for help after all, despite the incredible embarassment it would involve. Especially now, it would be hard to hide from them, she must weigh 600 lbs now.

So she struggled to get through, first sticking her arms through, and then forcing her belly to pass. Her hips were the biggest pain, as she took minutes to squeeze them free. Unfortunately the sudden release made her lose balance, and she fell down on the floor. Just at that time, a knock was heard on the door. \"Sheba, you in here? Come on, you cant hide from the beach forever!\" Jenna's cheerful tone rang behind the door. The door itself was of course not locked, so it would only be a matter of time before she would get in. And right now Sheba felt even more affraid to show her current state to them, she wanted to hide! But try as she might, she was simply to heavy now to lift herself off the ground in such short time, she just fell back to the ground with every push. The door knob turned, she was coming in!</span></div></div>",

Which was a good thing since his companion made a sudden return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he quickly pulled Mason away. \"Mason, what is wrong with you?\" Reeves asked while trying to keep his voice down. \"You can't just go punching holes in walls. We do not owe this place!\" Mason pulled himself loose. \"I just heard noises, that is all.\" He looked back at the stalls, trying to see through the hole if anyone was on the other side of the door. \"You were lucky then, that nobody is actually here to see you make such a scene.\" As luck would have it, the lights were too dim for him to make out what was actually a fat mass of wind adept. Though it did not stop her from weating ounce after ounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's go away before anyone catches you with the damage you have done. The maids will clean it up. As for you, I am sure we can find something else to punch.\" He lead his friend away, as he rubbed his knuckles. \"If you say so.\" Finally the pair had left the room, leaving her to get the hell out of here. Though she was still stuck here and there, it took a lot of maneuvering to break free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she did, by smashing the door down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMason must have unhinged it a little, and now it was totalled. She wished she could fix it, but she also wished to not get caught. Time was of the essence here. Now Sheba realized that it was too dangerous to continue like this, she had to confide in her friends and ask them for help. So she waddled out of the restroom, taking each step slowly to make sure she would not fall down again. Because she feared she was getting too heavy to get up. She dared not imagine herself in such a position, a beached whale for all the other guests to mock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo close, she thought, so close. Yet there was a distraction along the way, an unguarded kitchen. The doors were wide open, nobody was in sight, this was all very curious indeed. The food inside smelled so nice, if only she could taste just one bit. If only she did not need to be elsewhere..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she resist the temptation?</span></div></div>",

Before her stood a feast for kings: steamed vegetables and exotic fruits, sweet deserts and rich drinks, boiled meat and steaks the size of tables. Whether there was a large celebration this night, or an open buffet for the entire town, these things she did not know. All Sheba knew was that there was nobody in sight, a chance like that she could not pass up. Every bit of reasoning and logic in her mind was overpowered by her hungering massive body. It wanted more, and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she digged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter who knows how many meals, how many hours, she had eaten enough. She was satisfied and could store no more. It was all a blur to her, she could barely remember what tasted best or what took longest to go down. But what were the costs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were rather astounding to say the least. Again her body had reacted to the food intake like an overactive factory. There was not an inch on her body that had not been given an extra layer of fat. Her arms were as thick as pillows, her legs as wide as tree trunks. Her butt and chest had swelled up as well, though their weight increase was nothing compared to the blubber that was her belly. She must have gained a hundred pounds, two-hundred even! This time she knew she had gone too far. \"And yet, I allowed it to happen.\" She started sobbing. \"What is happening to me? Why can't I stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a sound rang across the room, someone was coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have liked to hide, she could sitll barely move, but her bulk was now far too immense to be obscured by any structure. She had gone into the kitchen, and now she had to pay the consequences. What would she do, what!?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ripping the lid off, she quickly tipped her head back, the container with it, and greedily guzzled the sweet contents. The fat spread throughout her, her belly, leg, arms and breasts swelling up and testing the endurance of her clothing. Her body ballooned and surged in all directions as the food filled her at an alarming rate, as she refused to breathe while stuffing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She finished the tub at too great a pace and chucked it backwards (in the direction of the door), causing an almighty *CLUUUNG* to ring out, alerting and arousing the inn-keeper's suspicions that someone was, in fact, in the pantry, freeloading.
