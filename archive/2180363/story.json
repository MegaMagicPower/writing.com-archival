            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're just casually walking down the street, no particular destination. beam of purple light suddenly engulfs you. After a few seconds, you regain your senses and stand up again. Things seem a little odd. But as you are trying to figure out what, something like a tree coming down startles you. It isn't quite as tall as you, but you instantly notice lines on the object and the numbers <b>9 10 11 12</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fourteen inches, perfect size for a plaything.\" says a voice from above \"And you're just the right type, fit and durable. Yes, you promise to provide hours of fun for your buyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up in shock, you exclaim \"GIANTESS!\" It was a rather old woman. Before you get half a chance to run, fingers curl around your waist and effortlessly lift you off the ground \"PUT ME DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense.\" she scolds, offering a smirk to her captive \"I didn't shrink you just to let someone have you for free. My shrink ray costs quite a bit to charge and you're hopefully worth thousands on Ebay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes you were stood on a desk and photographed, then without a word in response to your protests, dropped into an empty vodka bottle. Which was corked, and set on a shelf with several others. You could see your captress pecking away on her desktop, but the giant body blocked the computer screen. When finished, she gave a satisfied grunt and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror filled you as you read <br>\r\n<b>SHRINKERGIRL002 </b>:: ITEM#117 :: <br>\r\nDescription; This teenager was nosing around my place and seemed a perfect candidate. As with everything from SHRINKERGIRL002, guaranteed minimal handling. Just enough for capture. A bit of potluck, while the pictures clearly show a fit body, we don't know if this one is male or female. That will be up to the lucky buyer to discover for him/herself.<br>\r\nKeep this item for yourself. Put a bow on the little head, make a present for a lucky little kid or a pet for a lonely grandparent.<br>\r\nBottle included to keep your purchase safe and secure.<br>\r\nSeven day bidding<br>\r\n<b>06:23:57:12</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Look!\" exclaimed your delighted captress \"Two bids already. $250 and $308.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a week, admittedly you were well fed and allowed to wash. And you watched with alarm as some of the other bottles were taken from the shelves, but newer ones also containing people, were added. Your captress lifted you off your spot with delight and counted down \"3 .. 2 .. 1 SOLD! You were a little goldmine. $2,558.93. And eager too, look, the buyer is already processing payment. Even better, a local. You'll be in their hands in mere hours. Picking you up on the way home from work.\" She kissed the bottle leaving a lipstick stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang sometime later. You knew with a sense of total panic, it was for you. And it was. Your captress picked up the bottle containing you and opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My receipt.\" said the visitor, politely handing over a sheet. It was a  man, 40s  you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess took the paper, scanned it briefly, nodded and handed you over just like a store item. \"And just one thing\" she said \"I ask this of all my customers. Who did you buy this little toy for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a toy!\" you protest, but the giants either don't hear or don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man took a closer look at you, grinned, tapped the glass with a fingernail and chuckled \"Oh, I don't mind at all ...haha... I bought this for ________\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the sex is a little\u2026well, we\u2019ve christened every room in the house if you get my meaning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to back away from the billboard sized face, but only managed to hit your head. You spun around rubbing it, to see a set of huge fingers twitching a bit around your bottle. It was very disturbing. And since you weren\u2019t paying attention it was a shock when the whole bottle, you included naturally, tilted over and began swinging back at forth. You wailed \u201cHEY Careful!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell all I can say is enjoy yourselves.\u201d The giantess waved the giant away from her home, she was a couple thousand dollars richer. \u201cBy the way! Drop me an email when you discover the sex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe casually lifted his new plaything to his head in an agreeable salute and opened his car door \u201cGood doing business with ya. Bye.\u201d He got in the driver side, leaned over and laid you down on the floor of the passenger seat. A last stroking of the glass and a pleased look up and down his plaything and he was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a sex toy!\u201d you protested loudly. Soon, unfortunately, you were too busy steadying yourself in the bottle. It rolled about every time the car accelerated or decelerated or turned. It also worried you that every time the car stopped, his huge eyes roamed your body. You could even feel them on you when the bottle stopped with you facing down. And if anything, that was worse! You screamed futilely, more than once \u201cSTOP LOOKING AT ME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car stopped finally, and shut off, you happened to be face down. Giant fingers slipped under the bottle and the car floor seemed to fall away. The fingers manipulated the bottle until you face his grinning face. Rather unnecessarily you thought he told you \u201cNow no noise outside. Don\u2019t want someone else to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike someone could hear me.\u201d You complain, much to his amusement. Whether to the good or bad, getting in the house was a nonevent. Part of you hoped a neighbor would see you, but would ANOTHER giant be helpful? Anyway, the bottle was set on the dining room table as the hat was put in the closet. You pounded on the glass \u201cLemme outta here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sat at the table and touched the bottleneck, tilting it with a finger, giving a breathy smile \u201cWell, since you\u2019re so eager my little toy, let\u2019s see you.\u201d He pushed the bottle further and seized on the cork, twisting it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effortless actions of the giant were highly violent to you. His next move was even more disturbing, cork gone, the giant slowly upended the bottle causing you to begin sliding. And worst of all, his hand was waiting at the open end. \u201cUh-uh. Uh-UH! No please!\u201d you pleaded and cried trying desperately to catch hold of something on the completely smooth inner surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, plaything, come on.\u201d He urged playfully at the little struggling form \u201cAfter all, I been holding you ever since I picked you up. And I don\u2019t quite believe that woman didn\u2019t play with you a bit. You\u2019re just too sweet looking. Into my hand\u2026thaaaat\u2019s it\u2026ahhhh there we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis comments did nothing to ease your anxiety as you slid down closer to the top of the bottle. He didn\u2019t even know if you were a boy or girl. You really didn\u2019t want those huge hands actually touching you. Suddenly a bit of a growl and the bottle shook violently. All grip lost, and just a little rattled, when next you could focus only one foot was still hanging on the lip of the bottle. You tried to push yourself up, but found a slick soft surface under you. And worst of all, giant fingers curled around you and lifted you to the giant face. You yelled \u201cPUT ME DOWN! YOU PUT ME DOWN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, plaything.\u201d he scolded gently \u201cBehave or Daddy hafta pank.\u201d He rolled the little body over in his hand and tapped the stuck up mounds of flesh a couple times. Then, more for the fun of it, dragged his fingers across for a bit. Only stopping when he got a hardon. Switching hands, so the shrinky faced him, the man asked with a grin \u201cSo? Are you a boy? Or a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is this gift for a boy or a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since we don't know if I bought a a boy or a girl.\" said the giant \"I think we'll leave the new toy to discover that for itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess chuckled \"Good plan, sir. But you can just tell me, say whisper in my ear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" he shrugged, lowering your bottle to his waist and leaning next to the giantess's shoulder. \"It's for my _____\"</span></div></div>",

Rather the Alpha of her group of friends, who were noisily returning home from school. It was the last full day and they were all excited for summer. Patty was the type that, despite some babyfat, you could see some curves coming. She pushed open the door and called out \u201cI\u2019m home Daddy!\u201d<br>\r\nThe giant had organized things most carefully to obviously torment the hell out of you. He\u2019d stood his laptop on end near one end of the dining room table and put your jar behind it. <br>\r\n\u201cGot a \u2026heheh\u2026little surprise for you!\u201d he called back, instructing \u201cHop into your usual dinner seat, Pat.\u201d<br>\r\nYou shot an annoyed glance at the awful, to you, joke. And experienced a thrill of fear at the situation. There was a bit of hair and a hint of forehead over the top of the black wall.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really safe to put your laptop like that, you always told me.\u201d Patty reached for it, with a look of concern.<br>\r\nYou cringed at the sight of giant fingers, with still not a clue as to whether a boy or girl was on the other side of the wall. All the giant\u2019s preparations and \u2018thinking out loud\u2019 seemed purposely designed to drive you mad.<br>\r\n\u201cThe laptop is fine this time, kiddo.\u201d The giant gave his daughter a tolerant smile \u201cJust makes the surprise a ..hehheh\u2026 little more fun. Now just lean up some, reach your hands around \u2026 easy, careful\u2026 You\u2019ll find a..hehheh\u2026 little\u2026 present.\u201d<br>\r\nPoor shrinky you yelled \u201cSTUPID JOKE!\u201d then saw, not parts of fingers, but whole grasping hands coming around the wall between you.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that? Asked Patty, all she heard was a muffled drone.<br>\r\nThe giant chuckled \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon. But I promise, it won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, Daddy.\u201d She replied, leaning over a bit more and her hands met. She fiddled with what she touched \u201cFeels like a bottle.\u201d<br>\r\nYou were too busy instinctively ducking away to notice the skin wasn\u2019t the same shade as that of the giant man. After what seemed like forever, but was at most a minute, those grasping fingers took hold of the bottle.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd NOW you may see your present.\u201d Said the giant with a MC voice.<br>\r\nPatty eagerly gripped the bottle in one hand and lifted it off the table. Eyes roaming over her gift, she commented with a hint of disappointment \u201cWell, it\u2019s nice, but Daddy I\u2019m getting a bit old for dolls.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you to say?\u201d asked the giant.<br>\r\nCrossing your arms over your chest, you sullenly reply \u201cSome witch thought she could shrink me and sell me on Ebay. HE thinks I\u2019m a present.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt talked!\u201d Patty squealed in delight \u201cWhat else does it say?\u201d<br>\r\nThe giant man gave his daughter an indulgent smile, then scowled \u201cThat is NOT what I told you. Introduce yourself PROPERLY or you might be puuunished.\u201d<br>\r\nThe giant face was partly obscured giant fingers and distorted some by the glass of the bottle. You\u2019re reminded of Boss Nass, making you cringe in fear \u201cI\u2019m Peyton, I\u2019m a living dolls product. Play with me.\u201d It was the worst ten words out of your mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cLiving? As in a real person?\u201d the giant girl\u2019s fingers tightened on the glass and her face lit up. But she had another question \u201cPeyton? I\u2019ve met both boys and girls with that name. Which is this? Kinda hard to tell.\u201d<br>\r\nThe giant man tapped the bottle smirking \u201cGlad you asked that, sweetie. Truth is Ebay said they didn\u2019t know. It was up to the buyer to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask.\u201d Was Patty\u2019s first thought. Now she was all smiles.<br>\r\nThe girl\u2019s fingers kept shifting and moving, causing the bottle to turn about. Every once in a while you could see those curious eyes. couldn\u2019t help wondering what the young giantess was thinking. The ring on her index finger kept clinking the glass, hurting your ears.<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, you could.\u201d Dad allowed thoughtfully then pointed out \u201cBut, then it\u2019d be obvious when you change its clothes.\u201d<br>\r\nPatty blushed violently at the suggestion \u201cBut Daddy! What if he\u2019s a boy?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNever stopped you changing Ken\u2019s and Barbie\u2019s.\u201d he argued with a smile at his daughter. Then he accepted an enthusiastic hug, easily lifting small girl. He dismissed her with a quick push on the rear \u201cGo have fun. Dinner will be at six as usual.\u201d<br>\r\nThe journey up the stairs consisted mostly of being twirled about and gawked at from every possible angle. You muttered \u201cThank God for the cork.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He smirked down as the doll-sized body bounced about declaring \u201cI\u2019d paddle your little ass for that, but I\u2019ll leave the training to Your. New. Owner! Hahaha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Careful there!\u201d you caution, but silence yourself. The effortless way he rattled your prison was disturbing. You stumbled a bit, but the glass walls prevented a fall. Still a bumped head and knee was an unpleasant demonstration of your status. At least the giant was gentle when setting the bottle on the floor of the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the car pulled into a driveway. The giant snagged a shopping bag commenting \u201cCan\u2019t have the birthday surprise ruined by seeing the present too soon, can we?\u201d The swinging motion was frightening, especially being unable to see. \u201cAHH! There we are! Happy birthday13th!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Daddy.\u201d Came the response, nothing in it provided a clue as to gender. But a new teenager had some potential, maybe you could control him or her since you were older. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpatient and eager voice almost demanded \u201cWha\u2019d\u2019ya get me? Huh? Wha\u2019d\u2019ya get me? Huh? What? HuhHuh? C\u2019mon! Wazzat in da bag?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of a hole in the bag you could see a hand, you recognized it as the giant\u2019s since those finger spent a lot of time curled around you\u2026 it was gripping a comparatively narrow shoulder. \u201cNow now. Calm down. Let\u2019s see, this is rather a unique gift. I\u2019d call it BOTH fun and educational.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d you could hear a young voice complain. Hair seemed short, must make this a giant boy \u201cThis isn\u2019t some stupid computer game is it? You really don\u2019t pick the good ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaddy laughed heartily \u201cNo. it is NOT a computer game. Like I said it\u2019s a toy. Just an educational one. One I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll have fun with it, and you\u2019ll be learning too. Best of both worlds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure.\u201d Clearly skeptical, tinged with disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m quite serious.\u201d Daddy insisted quietly \u201cYou know we have problems, now that you\u2019re growing up, talking about certain things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngster squealed in alarm \u201cDADDY! Come on! You promised!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSex is a fact of life kiddo.\u201d He replied calmly \u201cAnd I totally understand you not wanting to talk to me about it, since your Mom passed. That\u2019s where this idea came from. With this, you can talk about whatever you want, experiment, do whatever you want and without any fear of embarrassment. And all without dear old Dad around, in COMPLETE safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat whole speech sent a thrill of outright panic through your body. There was only one reason a parent would have difficulty discussing sex with their child. This was a father of a brand-new teenage girl. Just as this alarming thought percolated through your brain a very different hand from what you\u2019d been somewhat used to entered the opened bag and its fingers curled around the bottle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOMG It\u2019s a little man!\u201d exclaimed the girl, as soon as her hand was free of the plastic, which fell away discarded. She quickly looked you over, grinning and licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got quite the eyeful as well. She was dirty blonde, shorter than her father. And from what you could see, quite the looker. Though at present the spinning about made it hard to focus on one spot. When the fingers finally settled around the bottle, you were presented with blue eyes bigger than your head and a lightly freckled face. The giant tongue seemed obsessed with lip licking. Lower was, even if you were full-sized, a huge chest. The t-shirt declared YEAH? WHATRE YOU STARING AT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, Laurie, when I made my purchase from Living Dolls the description left out gender.\u201d Said Daddy with what could only be described as a wicked grin, rather worrying. He delivered \u201cSee I know you really haven\u2019t decided for yourself, so I figured you\u2019d want to. If it\u2019s a girl you could learn all about yourself\u2026hehe\u2026in miniature. And if it\u2019s a boy \u2026 well\u2026 you could learn about them, without worrying the old man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of Laurie\u2019s freckles faded as her cheeks reddened, though her eyes only flickered to Daddy. They were mostly roaming up and down her wonderful present. She emitted an ecstatic sigh as her pulse quickened and her vagina began itching. Her fingers were touching all over the bottle, even the bottom and naturally, the cork. She asked plaintively \u201cCan I goto my room?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a second. I\u2019ve thought of a couple rules for your new toy.\u201d Said Daddy, acting sternly parental \u201cMaking sure it\u2019s fed and, just as importantly bathed, is your responsibility. Your room is yours and what happens in it is your business. BUT whenever your toy is outside your room, it\u2019ll be fully dressed. I imagine your Ken &amp; Barbie clothes will fit. And, I\u2019d really hope I don\u2019t hear any \u2026err\u2026 noises. Know what I mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeaked in protest almost from the first word, but he\u2019d kept on talking over you, but finally \u201cWhat kind of rules are that? Don\u2019t I get a say? You practically gave her total freedom!\u201d If anything, Giantess Laurie was looking even more eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never bothered with how she played with her dolls.\u201d Retorted Daddy without a concern, kissing his daughter\u2019s temple, pulling her into a hug \u201cAlthough one thing, my little sweetie. A Living Doll is just like us, be careful or you might damage it. Even kill it. Okay? It was rather expensive. Now, go play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurie was again eyeing her new toy with great delight, slowly twirling the bottle in her hands. Looking back, she gave a grateful smile \u201cThanks so much, Daddy. I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d you screamed. Your objection, instead of benefiting you, only served to encourage the young giantess. The giant had basically confirmed every bit of what you said. And by the time that worry was processed, she\u2019d carried you to her room\u2026never mind the giant eyes still all over your body, \u201cLook\u2026Laurie, right? Let\u2019s talk about this, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged in response, still smiling, still gently moving the bottle about in her hands and studying her new toy. She did stop the spinning and her left hand pushed her door shut. Her smile broadened as she clicked the latch \u201cSure, got ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, little doll. How about, first... we get you out of there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026okay, yeah. Hardly been out most of the past week.\u201d You agreed with some uneasiness. Especially as the giant fingers fiddled their way up the side of your prison. The locking of the door flashed through your scared mind. Then, with hardly any effort, in contrast to your futile attempts, the cork was gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Touching her tablet she asked \"Will it be a boy or girl getting this item?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since it'll be surprise for the new owner to find out.\" he began, tapping the bottle and grinning \"I don't see any reason to give the new plaything advanced warning.

I am NOT a plaything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant lowered the bottle to his side and tapped on the tablet screen, before tipping his hat in a gentlemanly manner to the giantess and heading for his car.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A short ride later, the giant eased his car into a garage. You could see the concrete ceiling that suddenly felt like a prison despite how high it seemed. The giant got out, almost giving you hope of escape, but he simply reached through the car window and picked up the bottle you\u2019re in. He explained your situation \u201cKid\u2019s pretty much a jock. You might\u2019ve noticed the basketball net as we were pulling in. Just can\u2019t seem to motivate the good grades. So, maybe with you to play with we\u2019ll cut back on the social life. HEY KIDDO GET DOWN HERE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just hand me over as some kid\u2019s plaything!\u201d you hammer on the glass. But are ignored as the giant arm swings and the next thing you know all you can see blue canvas and yellow stitching. And worse, the giant chose that moment to rip one. The glass did nothing to deaden the odor. \u201cYUCK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThudding of feet on steps announced the approach of \u2018kiddo\u2019 who pleaded \u201cWhat, pop? I\u2019m studying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore likely on the phone with tonight\u2019s date.\u201d Was Pop\u2019s sarcastic retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that far from teenage years yourself, you blush in sympathy, but so far no real clue exactly who \u2018kiddo\u2019 was. If it wasn\u2019t the hand across the glass containing you, it was the Levi\u2019s sticker, blocking your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Pop! It\u2019s fun.\u201d A teenage voice complained. It was a little squeaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop tapped his giant foot far below \u201cYour grades have been slipping all year. Ever since you discovered the opposite sex. It must stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to beat me?\u201d the tone of the question was fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop sighed \u201cOf course not, kiddo. Some parents do subscribe to the negative feedback philosophy, and maybe that\u2019s an option for later. Right now, I opted for a more positive approach. Here ya go, Terry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were utterly shocked as the bottle you\u2019re in was tossed almost to the ceiling and you could see the floor rapidly approaching. The devastating impact was prevented by a still jarring act of being caught by what you almost instantly identified as a pair of quite younger hands. And though the position was awkward, it was clearly a boy. Quite a handsome lad, you could only hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA doll?\u201d he asked with some curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop countered \u201cNot JUST a doll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY GOD!\u201d exclaimed Terry, still spinning the bottle and passing it from hand to hand \u201cIt\u2019s a shrinky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop smirked and queried \u201cOh? You\u2019ve heard of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friend Mike has one. Saw her once.\u201d The teen tapped on the glass and grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop put on his strongest parenting voice \u201cI want it clear, there are certain rules regarding this particular gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYEAH!\u201d you yelled pounding on the side of the bottle, having no real impact, but you were deeply in favor of rules. Especially if it involved your treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen looked up, well\u2026mostly\u2026 he was fascinated by what he held, eyes flicking up and down the little body \u201cBit bigger than GI Joe. Sorry, Pop, you said rules?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Said Pop firmly \u201cThis is more an incentive to stay in a bit more. It did cost a pretty penny. In fact, nearly 3 grand. It doesn\u2019t leave the house. That\u2019s as much to prevent escape or thieving as anything else. As for what you do\u2026 indulge yourself\u2026 just in your room. And close the door. I don\u2019t want to see, or hear. You get my meaning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly did \u201cHEY! WHAT KIND OF RULES ARE THOSE?\u201d pounding violently on the inside of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a boy or a girl?\u201d asked Terry, who had nodded somewhat absently in response to Pop\u2019s rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which the giant man shrugged absently \u201cI bought it not knowing. Does it really matter? I\u2019d suggest \u2026ahh\u2026 unwrapping and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Pop!\u201d the boy exclaimed, briefly offered an enthusiastic hug\u2026 and bolted for his room. Once there, Terry did as he was told, pushing his door shut and \u2026with a smirk aimed at you \u2026 flicked the door latch. He twisted off the cork, sat at his desk and commanded \u201cCome on out, and let\u2019s check you out. So are you male or female?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
