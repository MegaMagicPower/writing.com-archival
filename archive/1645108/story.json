As you walk through the park, you feel a few droplets on your face and look up as it starts to rain. The rain picks up and becomes heavy quicky. You start to run so that you can find shelter. Looking around for anything, you see a cave nearby. Wanting to get out of the rain as soon as possible, you head into the cave. As you enter the cave, you walk in, and suddenly feel yourself start falling and suddenly black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you find that you are now in a strange hallway. You stand up, and notice that your clothe are dry. \"How long was I out?\" you ask yourself out loud. \"Actually, where am I?\" You look at the hallway and see that it seems to go on endlessly in both directions. \"Hello?\" you call out, but hear only your echo. You also see that there are many doors lining the walls of the hallway. \"Whats with all the doors?\" You look around and then notice something nearby on the ground. You see that it is a piece of paper and pick it up to find that it is a note. You look at it to see that it reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Hallway of Lives! Beyond each door is the life of another person, and by stepping through it, you will have that person's life! And if you are unsatisfied with that life, you may return to this hall and choose a different one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nWhen you enter a door, you will take on that life. Your body will remain unchanged physically, but you will be treated as the person whose life was labeled on the door.<br>\r\nWhile in that life, you will have everything that they have; clothes, possession, family, friends, and other stuff. Things such as clothes are adjusted as necessary.<br>\r\nIf you enter a door for the life of someone of the opposite gender, you will still be treated as the gender of that life despite not actually being that gender.<br>\r\nWhile you are in a life, you will aquire the skills necessary to live as that person.<br>\r\nEach door is labeled with information of the person whose life it leads to. Name, age, gender, as well as other information about the person.<br>\r\nWhile you are living a person's life, that person is in your life. They are unaware of the change, and will act like you.<br>\r\nOnce you go through, you must stay in that life for a minimum of 1 day before you may return to the hallway.<br>\r\nAfter the minimum time is up, you can leave at anytime you want.<br>\r\nYou have a key that is used to open the doors. When you want to leave your current life, you use the key in any door to return to the hallway. When you enter a door, it disappears, and it reappears when you want to use it. This is so you don't lose the key.<br>\r\nYou can't become famous people. Sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow enjoy yourself in the life of another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Hallway of Lives?' Take the life of whoever's door you walk through?\" you say out loud. You think it sounds crazy, but it also sounds interesting. \"Guess I'll give it a try. I've got nothing to lose.\"</span></div></div>",

You take out the key like the instructions said and unlocked the door. As you opened it, you saw a girl's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped through, you noticed things quickly changed. You were no longer standing up, and were now lying in a bed. You sat up and took notice of your surroundings. It looked like a typical teenage girl's room. You then looked down at yourself and saw that you were also now wearing a girl's nightgown. \"Guess it worked afterall.\" you comment to yourself. You stand up and inspect the room, and one of the first things you notice is a few pictures on your dresser. One is of you with two other girls, and another is a family picture that shows you with who you assume to be your parents, and a younger brother. In both of them you are wearing typical clothes that would be found on a girl, yet no one seemed to find it odd. \"Looks like I'm Christina Robins now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to get dressed, you look in the dresser. The first drawer you open has several bras. You pull one out and see that it seems to be meant for a really flat-chested girl. You keep the bra and move on to the next drawer and pick out a pair of panties. Shortly after, you pick out a blouse and skirt and other items of clothing. After a few minutes, you are now dressed in your chosen attire. You look at yourself in a mirror and see what you look like dressed like this. You think you look a bit strange, but like what you're wearing. You then see some makeup nearby and decide to use some. You find that you seem to know how to use all of it as you start applying it, despite never having used any before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after your done, you hear a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Part-time student at Olympia high school, full-time detective.<br>\r\nAt the age of 16, you began solving crimes and such. But you weren't 16, you were 18. Around this age, most teens would be interested in leaving school, leaving their parents, going to college. But you weren't most kids. You were more interested I solving your most recent case... Who killed Faidara Joestar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you knew about her while she was alive, she was a foreign exchange student from Britain. Her parents were a mixed couple of Japanese and British. She wasn't doing particularly well in school, she often complained to you about her C average at school. She also was involved in about 5 school clubs (which could explain the C average). You begin to suspect that she may have made some enemies whilst at these social clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the body was found, you were one of the first at the scene of the crime. \"Was this how she was found, chief?\" You ask the chief of police. (We didn't move her whatsoever, this is how she was found\" he replied. The good news was that they didn't alter the body in any way, shape, or form. (According to the chief anyways) but the bad news was that the body was laying on its side, so you will have to move it to investigate the wound. You get permission from the chief to investigate the body and have at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the former Joestar on her back and life her shirt to examine the wound. \"It appears to be a cut mark\" you shout to the chief. You begin to measure the length of the cut. Somehow, it was deep enough to nearly cut through the other side of the body. You inspect the body a little more and find something odd. It appeared to be a happy face on half of it, and a sad face on the other half of it. \"This could possibly be a serial killer we are dealing with here\". You know that serial killers often leave a mark, and this one looks awfully familiar. You finish up looking at the body and head over to your Intel department (aka, your room). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, master walker\" your butler Jeevs says to you as you walk in. \"Thank you Jeevs, speaking of which, could you get my case file out from the various serial killings in the area?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"The big binder?\" He asks back. You sadly reply with \"yes\". He comes back after a few minutes with it and you begin to look through it to find an similar symbol. After about an hour and 4 glasses of tea, you find the appropriate symbol. It belonged to a Franklin Phillips. You brought him in and he was executed though. This was a little strange because the case wasn't particularly popular. It barely got any coverage. That would mean it would have to be someone close to the case to know his symbol. Now that you are equipped with this newfound knowledge, you set out to speak with...</span></div></div>",

She looked shocked when she saw Alex standing behind his new mother. \"Hey there sport\" Cindy sad trying to pass off as Ed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, he knows\" Ed said as he opened the door wider. \"Come in out if the rain and let's talk this out. Can I get you something to eat or drink.

I was just looking for a quick change of pace, and you weren't ever supposed to know. How do you know?!\" Ed (formally Cindy) said as she took off her boots. Cindy (formally Ed) walked in with a cup of coffee and sat in a chair. He gracefully lifted a leg to cross over and pulled at his gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question. Alex you must have went through your own door.\" Cindy sad smiling. \"It must be odd for you to see my chest hairs poke though this light pink fabric.\" Cindy looked at Ed who had a nervous smile on her face. \"Well I'd get used to it for the time being. I'm your mother.\" He sad with a half toothless smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed, I just took two buses at 4am to get here and tell you the deal is off. I need my life back\" the new Ed complained. She walked over to him in her holey socks and dropped down on a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Cindy stood up and straightend his nightgown. \"Oh I don't think so ED a deal is a deal. We both agreed to fix the others issues and until that happens this...\" He sad twirling. \"...Is all mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Ed had a look of shock on her face as she watched this man dance in her clothes. She sunk back down on the chair and started to cry. Alex put his hand on her wet shoulder and began to consoule his former mother. \"Oh mom, I mean Ed? Don't cry, how hard can it be. Just do it quick and you'll be back here in no time.\" He got her on her feet. \"Plus I know what's going on. Maybe I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy stopped his dance and rushed over. His nightie lifted and exposed his panties. \"Oh I don't think I like having MY son assisting a strange man from work. No you'll be too busy with your new chores Alex.\" Cindy fixed himself and pulled his robe up. \"Now Ed, I know the bus can be crowded this time of day so just once I'll drive you to work. Let me get dressed and we will get going. Alex, I want you upstairs to clean your room or something but I do not want you talking to Big Ed while I'm getting ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Cindy marched upstairs pulling Alex with him....</span></div></div>",

Your son just saw me in this!\" Ed said holding out the side of Cindy's gown and matching robe. This caused Cindy to laugh a little and oddly enough she was getting a bit turned on. Even though the \"life changing hallway\" didn't work, he did seem to be walking a bit more feminine. All of a sudden a loud unexpected FART came from Cindy. \"Ew, gross Cindy I have to wear those briefs today.\" Ed whined. He stood there now in Cindy's pink colored panties with white trim, and her matching white bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ed, That's not like me\" She took off her undershirt without giving a second though about exposing her breasts to Ed. Ed, not thinking anything wrong, turned away from Cindy and expertly unhooked his bra and handed it over to Cindy. Once Ed had his under shirt on he realized how tight it felt. Cindy fumbled with her bra and eventually started swearing. \"God dam it this shouldn't be this hard\" she cussed as Ed came over to assist her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go Cindy, I know they can be tricky.\" Ed said realizing what an odd thing he just said. Now the two of them stood there in miss matched underwear wondering how to switch them. Ed picked up the night gown he was just wear and pulled in up to just his waist and slid his paint nylon panties off and handed them to Cindy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ed but this is my house remember? Turn around and I'll give yah these.\" She said pulling down Ed's briefs. He spun around and pulled them up under the night gown. Again he noticed how tight they were, but didn't think anything of it. He gingerly slipped of the gown once again and Cindy grabbed. After tossing it on she grabbed the robe and handed Ed his coveralls. Now these were way too tight. Cindy looked at the Gown she was practically swimming in. \"Something is wrong here Ed. Did you really stretch this stuff out this poorly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd could barley move in his old outfit but before he said anything Cindy opened the bedroom door, with her panties in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

I discovered the place when I was your age, and let me tell you, it\u2019s been a fun experience living\u2026god, I\u2019ve lost count of how many lives I\u2019ve inhabited. I wanted to tell you about this, but we Inhabitors are kind of sworn to secrecy. Now that you\u2019re officially an Inhabitor, I think there\u2019s no need to keep secrets from you anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut what of the people you swap with? How does the truck driver feel about you swapping lives with him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mike? He\u2019s pretty oblivious to his situation. Basically, he\u2019s got all my personality and memories, and no memory of this life. He\u2019s pretty much living my original life on autopilot. So, anyone who hasn\u2019t been initiated into the Hallway won\u2019t be able to tell anything\u2019s amiss with him, nor me as long as I keep up the act.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you mean I\u2019ve probably been living with different people as you all my life?\u201d<br>\r\nYour mother smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cNot as often as you\u2019d think. When I was pregnant with you, Stacey and Nicole, I stayed in my original life and carried each of you to full term. And even on my maternity leaves, I looked after each of you. I love all my children, and I don\u2019t trust a drone on autopilot to look after them as much as myself. But I think now you\u2019re all old enough to the point where I believe I can swap lives with other people a little more often. And listen, if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with anyone acting as my original self, you\u2019re always free to live as someone else for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust another question, mom\u2026does any else in the family know about the Hallway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d your mom explained\u2026</span></div></div>",

Who the hell is this?\" She said pointing to Alex with one of her long pink fingernails. She wasn't a bad looking woman but a whore no doubt. She had dark skin wrapped up in a tight short yellow dress, with long flowing sleeves. Her hair was done up with a silver band which matched her silver stripper heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the reason Summer left.\" Roy said taking Alex by the arm. \"This is my nephew Alex.

The light around was the small porch light with bugs humming by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so upset he marched up to porch a wrapped his hand on the door.

Alex saw she was only in her briefs and a wife beater. \"Oh sit down Lillian, I know what this is about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stepped out the front door into her porch in just her under clothes. She odded back to Lillian letting her know everything is ok and that she'll handel it. \"What the he'll mom!\" Alex shouted once the front door was closed. \"Why the he'll would you leave us? Are we really that bad?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stood there with shock and anger in her eyes. \"All I want is some time to relax and explore this opportunity Alex.\" She looked over at her son who had tears in his eyes. \"Get this through your head, I am Roy now. I am no longer your mother Alex. I have a loving wife and a respectable 10 year old son. The more you show up and complain the longer this will take!\" She was telling so loud, Lillian came back out to see if everything is ok. The young boy jumped off the porch to join his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is fine Lillan. Look take jounior back into the house. I have to drive this kid to his house. Can you get me my jeans and keys.\" Roy said, guieding her son to his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sweetie.\" Lillian said handing Roy her requested items. \"Come along RJ.\" She said bringing the child inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RJ?\" Alex asked as he watched his mom pull up her Jean over her boxer briefs.

This is your first time through a doorway in the hall, your first time living someone else's life, your first time seeing an unfamiliar reflection in the mirror... and it's by far the strangest thing you've ever experienced in your life.  The pretty blonde girl in the mirror...that's YOU.   You're HER.  And while you still see yourself as a guy, to everyone else in the world, you look like a girl.  That's a weird, weird thought, and you're not sure you're comfortable with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl sidles up next to you in the mirror.  She's an exact copy of the girl whose life you're currently inhabiting... her long blonde hair is styled a little differently, and there's a small scar above her left eyebrow, but otherwise, the two girls are identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdentical in body, that is.  But in dress, the two girls look very different indeed.  Whereas you're dressed in a flirty and feminine dress, complete with a necklace and bracelets and earrings, and your hair is perfectly coiffed and your face is expertly made up, your twin is dressed much more painly, in a Clash t-shirt and jeans--albeit in a feminine cut--and her hair is much less styled and her makeup is much plainer.  The stereotype about twins is that they always dress and act exactly alike, but these girls seem to have gone to some length to differentiate themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at us,\" the other girl said.  \"We're HOT.\"  She begins striking poses.  You look away from the mirror to the girl standing next to you, and instead of the blonde twin in the mirror, you see the willowy redheaded girl you found wearing your clothing just a few minutes before, dressed in the same Clash t-shirt and jeans.    As she vamps in front of the mirror, her reflection matches her every pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is right.  The two of you are absolutely gorgeous... you're every teenage boy's dream girl.  With your pretty dress and perfect hair, you look like a model from the cover of one of those magazines you always see girls reading.  Your body is amazing, your face breathtaking, your smooth  skin and silky hair and deep blue eyes perfect.  And even with her simpler style, your twin is nearly as beautiful... the very model of a hot rock chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"'  You stop, surprised to see your feminine reflection mouth your words.  \"But why do I have to be a GIRL?  I don't want to be a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stops her posing, a surprised look crossing her face.  \"I thought you knew you were going to be a girl.  I said we were going to be twins, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say, \"but I thought we were going to be fraternal twins.  Like, a boy and a girl.  aylor can be a boy's name.  I have a friend named Taylor.  That's why I picked Taylor's door instead of Michelle's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl studies you for a moment, then her eyes widen.  \"This is your first time, isn't it?  As a girl.  This is the first time you've been through a girl's door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my first time through ANY door,\" you say.  I just found out about the hallway.\"  You think for a moment.  \"Wait... have you been a boy before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs.  \"A few times, sure.  It's kinda fun... seeing how the other half lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back to the bed where you were sitting when you first walked through Taylor's door and flop down,, frowning as you see that her sheets are pink and covered with kittens, a sharp contrast to your \"sister's\" pplain black sheets.  The room seems to be split roughly in half, with Taylor's stuff on one side and Michelle's stuff on the other... and there's a stark difference between the two sides.  Taylor's side--your side--is pink and fluffy, with posters of good-looking men and beautiful women, and a picture of one of those guys from Twilight.  There's a collection of small pictures grouped together on the wall; looking more closely, you see they're pictures of a dance team, with several girls in slinky leotards, Taylor included.  Michelle's side, by contrast, has a guitar leaning against the wall and pictures of rock bands, and a poster from the Lord of the Rings movies.  There's a collection of trophies on her dresser; squinting to get a better look, you see they appear to be for softball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a big closet on your side of the room.  Getting up and walking over to it, you throw open the doors and see that it, too, appears to be divided in half,  There's no mistaking whose side is whose... Taylor's side is frilly and girly, with a lot of dresses and skirts and ots and lots of pastels.  Michelle's side, on the oother hand, has mostly jeans, t-shirts, and tank tops, with juust a couple of more formal dresses mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze,\" you say,\"if we did both have to be girls, how did you end up as the tomboy and me as the girly-girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" the other girl says, \"being a girl isn't so bad.  Trust me,\" she adds with a wry smile, \"I have lots of experience.  You should give it a try... you might have fun.  After all, how many people get the opportunity to experience life as the opposite sex?  Can you really pass up that opportunity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but I don't know HOW to be a girl,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl grins.  \"I can teach you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate.  \"I... I don't even know your name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Amy,\" she says.  \"Only,  I guess I'm Michelle now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, I know,\" she says, smiling.  \"I was your mother for a li8ttle while, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the mirror and stare at your pretty, feminine reflection for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Amy says at last, \"what's it going to be?\"</span></div></div>",

It would give you a great perspective on girls, on how they live and think, and it would help you grow as a person.  You're sure it's probably going to be awkward and embarassing, but you can't pass this chance up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say, giving Amy a shy smile.  \"I'll do it.  I'll try being a girl.  But you will have to teach me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Amy says, leaping to her feet and taking your hands.  \"We'll start right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks you over to the mirror, and you're again struck by the unspeakable strangeness of seeing a girl stare back at you.  You're blushing--blushing hard--and you realize that it makes your reflection even cuter.  Lifting a hand, you brush a few strands of long golden hair out of Taylor's face and study her intently.  Then, as you watch her eyebrows wrinkle into a studious gaze, you break into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Michelle's reflection, at the lookalike standing next to you--identical in face, in body, in height, in weight--you realize you feel a strange kind of kinship with Amy.  It's not like anything you've felt before.  It's different than friendship, different than a crush, and it's strange that you feel this way about someone you've just met.  Maybe it's because you share the secret of the Hallway.  Maybe it's some kind of residual twin bond seeping through from Taylor and Michelle's lives into your subconscious.  Hiding behind identical reflections, posing as sisters, both pretending to be someone you're not, the two of you are somehow the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I don't know where to begin,\" Amy says.  We have to teach you how to walk, how to sit, how to move, how to talk, how to gesture, how to dress, how to put on makeup and walk in heels... there's so much you should know, Alex.  I don't even know if we should start here in our room where I can teach you in private and you can get used to being a girl, or if we should take you out into the real world .  Maybe we should take you to the mall... you can watch other girls to see how they act, and we can cruise stores and I can show you some makeup and clothes.\"  She turns from the mirror to look you in the eyes.  \"What do you think, Alex?\"</span></div></div>",

I don't want to be a girl... not yet, anyway.  Let's go back to the Hallway.  Please.\"  You hesitate and look around the room.  \"Um... how do we do that again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gives you an awkward look.  \"Um... you... can't, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a couple of beats.  \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you can,\" she says, \"but... not yet.  Remember the instructions you got?  We can't go back to the Hallway for twenty-four hours.  I know you don't want to, but... you're going to have to spend the rest of the day as Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit heavily down on Taylor's bed, staring wide-eyed at Amy.  Suddenly your whole body feels heavy.  A whole day as a girl.  You don't want to do this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" Amy says meekly.  \"Alex, are you all right, hon?\"  She waits for you to respond, but you're speechless.  \"Alex,\" she goes on, \"it won't be so bad.  I promise.  Being a girl really isn't that bad.  We'll get you through the day.\"  She gives you a weak smile.  \"You might even find out you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait a second,\" you say, \"I went in my own door earlier and I was able to leave right away.  I was only in there for a few minutes.  Why could I leave my own door but I can't leave Taylor's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shrugs.  \"I guess 'cause it was your own door.  Maybe you can leave your own life whenever you want to.  But trust me, you can't leave Taylor's life yet... I've tried leaving doors before the twenty-four hours is up, and it doesn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit silently a moment longer, your mind racing.  Then, at last, you say, \"What if we switch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"  Amy looks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we switch places,\" you say.  \"You be Taylor and I be Michelle.  I mean, we're twins, right?  Don't identical twins pretend to be each other all the time?  At least I don't have to be such a girly-girl that way.\"  Maybe it's a stretch, but you're desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looks at you for a long moment, then at the mirror.  \"No...\" she says, slowly, thoughtfully.  \"No, I don't think it would work.  I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get a good look at our reflections?\" She points to her eyebrow.  \"I have a scar over my eye.  You don't.  We look a lot alike, but the scar is a dead giveaway.  And besides, our hair is different, and... twins aren't really identical, you know.  There are all sorts of little differences even between identical twins.  We might fool some people, but anyone who knows us well... who knows Michelle and Taylor... they would know something was off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders slump.  \"Well, can I at least wear some of your clothes, then?  You have all those t-shirts and jeans... I could borrow an outfit for the day.  It would be way better than this,\" you say, frowning down at your dress in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shakes her head.  \"No way.  Did you see your side of the room?  Did you see Taylor's wardrobe?  She's super-freaking-girly.  You're going to have a hard enough time convincing people you're really her.  This is your first time... pretending to be someone else is hard work.  And you don't talk like a girl or walk like a girl or move like a girl...  I mean, no one's going to think you're a guy, but people are going to know something's wrong if you don't act like a girl.  We're not going to be able to teach you how to be a girl in a day, but I think you at least need to dress the part.\"  She gives you an akward smile.  \"I know you hate it, but that dress is perfect, hon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and throw yourself back on the bed.  You hate it, but you know she's right.  \"Can I at least hide in our room all day?  I don't want to go out there as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Amy says.  \"I guess so.  I mean, probably.  As long as it's not a school day.  What day of the week is it again?  It's so hard to keep track of the days when you're in the Hallway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to answer her, but before you can get any words out, there's a knock at the door, and a woman's voice calls from the other side.  \"Girls,\" it says...</span></div></div>",

You start to try to fumble for words, but Amy doesn't even miss a beat.  \"Okay, Mom,\" she says, almost without thinking, \"we'll be right there.\"  She gives you an awkward look and mouths, \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy starts to stand, but before she can get up, the door bursts open and two teenage girls spill into the room.  One is a tall brunette in a t-shirt and skirt, one is a short African-American girl in a tank top and jeans, and they're both easily as pretty as you and Mich... as Taylor and... as the twins whose lives you and Amy are currently living.  \"Hey, kids,\" says the girl in the shirt and the skirt, grinning and bouncing energetically, \"we were bored out of our minds and we thought we'd come and see if you could entertain us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Amy scramble to your feet, and you do your best to look casual, natural, and not at all embarassed about wearing a dress.  Shirt-and-skirt leans in and kisses Amy lightly on the cheek, and Amy, quite fluidly, kisses Shirt-and-Skirt on the cheek as well... very European.  Then Shirt-and-Skirt walks over to you and pecks you on the cheek, as though she's known you all your life and you're not a strange boy crossdressing in her friend's clothes... and you catch a whiff of her perfume, and feel the touch of her lips and the warmth of her body, and something stirs in you... and suddenly you're happier than ever that she can't see you as a boy, with all your ill-behaved boy parts.  You just hope Amy isn't paying too much attention to the drape of your dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Shirt-and-Skirt sit down on Amy's bed, and they and Tank-and-Jeans start chattering away.  You watch, amazed how naturally Amy is falling in step with the conversation, even though she almost certainly doesn't understand half of what they're talking about.  You consider jumping in, but you're not sure what to say or how to say it... you feel completely in over your head, hanging out with a group of girls and being expected to act like one yourself.  So instead, you focus on watching and listening, on trying to pick up on their speech patterns and body language and trying to imitate them yourself.  In particular, you pay attention to how Shirt-and-Skirt--whose name is Laurel, yo note--is sitting, her knees close together and tucked up beneath her and her hands folded neatly over her skirt, and you try to imitate her as you sit on your own bed.  After a moment, the girl in jeans, whose name is Carmen, gets up and picks up a purple hat that's hanging from a coatrack, puts it on, and begins primping in the vanity mirror sitting between your side of the room and Amy's.  You watch her, studying the way she walks and the way she primps... but then your gaze shifts back to Laurel.  You find you can't take your eyes off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Laurel turns to you and says, \"Tay, you're awfully quiet.  Something up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you say, fumbling for an explanation, \"I'm... just in a quiet mood today.  Uh, PMS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy raises an eyebrow, but Laurel just grins a devilish grin and says, \"Well, you'd better not be like this tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight?  You consider asking what she means, but before you can say anything, Carmen turns and says, \"I'm bored.  We should go somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like where?\" Amy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurel, who sort of seems to be the leader of your little group, says,</span></div></div>",

You blush at the closeness of her body, but you try to act natural... however much you suddenly wish you were going on this date as Sebastian, not as Laurel's friend and fellow girl.  \"You should have heard him at lunch yesterday,\" Laurel goes on.  \"He couldn't stop talking about how much he was looking forward to tonight, and how great your last date was.  He thinks the world of you.\"  She leans in closer and whispers, \"I think he's falling in love with you.\"  And as her breath tickles your ear, you feel your stomach flutter in sudden glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" she says, giving your shoulders one last squeeze and getting up.  \"My dress isn't going to buy itself.  And maybe we can find you an outfit that will totally knock Jeff's socks off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" you say, with the most authentic smile you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, and so do the other girls.  As your bare feet hit the floor, you realize you need some shoes.  Your eyes scan the room until at last they land on the only pair of shoes lying out... a pair of pink high-heeled shoes with a slender three-inch heel.  You pick them up in disgust, wondering how you can possibly walk in these things, but you flop reluctantly down on the bed to put them on anyway.  Before you can slip them on, though, you hear Amy say, \"Tay, hon, are these what you're looking for?\"  You look her direction and see her standing in front of the closet holding a pair of white ballet flats with a bow on the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you say, trying not to let on to Laurel and Carmen how grateful you actually are.  You walk over and take them from her, mouthing \"Thank you thank you thank you.\"  You slide your feet into the sleek feminine shoes while Amy puts on a pair of canvas sneakers.  The shoes feel strange; they fit completely differently than men's shoes.  At least you won't be staggering around on heels all day, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a dainty handbag from the nightstand while Amy slings a big black purse over her shoulder.  Carmen puts the hat she's been playing with back on the coatrack, and the four of you are ready to go.</span></div></div>",

I have to head out to get a few jobs done but when I get back maybe we could do something fun today?\" She gave you a motherly smile. \"Unless of course you want to do something with your friends in which case I've had this craving for a spa day, you know a little Me Time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I might just hang out with someone today but sleeping does sound nice.

Give Mom a hug before she leaves for the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh how I wish I could' you thought as this imposter pulled you in for a tight motherly hug before finishing with a quick kiss on the cheek. \"Now hurry along, I still have to finish making breakfast, eat, shower, get dressed and clean up a little before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, sure thing Mom\", calling this girl Mom was killing you but the worst part was the kiss. If you couldn\u2019t find a way to get this girl back in her own life and you mother back in hers, you hated to think of having to continue that for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went up to your room, locking your door so that your mother imposter wouldn\u2019t barge in, and fell onto your soft bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour room was just like any other teenage boys but with an excess of books, you were a really big reader. You weren\u2019t a nerd exactly but you always enjoyed a good mystery or adventure book before sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour situation was a little like a story plot and what your story needed was a good old fashioned best friend. You really needed someone to turn to and the only friend you figured would ever believe you, or at least not throw you in an insane asylum if you told the truth, was our best friend Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just had to wait for your 'Mom' to leave before you could get out of here and see your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a while but after reading a few chapters of your favourite book, you finally heard your 'Mom' say \"Alex! I'm leaving now so be good and if you do leave the house just keep me posted and be back by dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Mom!\" That was a classic Mom thing to say but the majority of your brain still thought it was an imposter trying to live your moms life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you heard the door open and close you ran to your bedroom window to watch your fake mom leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing you were looking for was poor driving but to your surprise there was none. The girl in the drivers seat of your moms car pulled out of the drive way expertly and drove off to God knows where. You had thought that since the person living your mothers life was 16 you might be able to prove she was the one to steal your moms life if she couldn\u2019t drive. Sure she might have a learners permit but she wouldn\u2019t be very good. Sadly she proved you wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only waited a few minutes before grabbing your phone, wallet, keys and your magic Hallway key and making your way to Jim's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to Jims wasn\u2019t very far so on the way you tried to gather your thoughts and sort out all the things you believed to be true<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped that Jimmy would be able to help you figure out what you were going to do about your fake mom. The thought of dealing with all of this alone scared you to death so if Jimmy believed you then that would make everything easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tricky part would be making him believe you. Obviously you were going to tell the truth but would you have to prove yourself to him? What if, to prove yourself, you tried to switch lives with one of his sisters using the Hallway and the effects of the Hallway were too much and he didn\u2019t see through the magic. The easiest way would be to bring him back to the cave so he could get his own key from the Hallway itself (you didn\u2019t feel comfortable giving him yours since it was so valuable seeing as you still hadn\u2019t really tried it out yet) and have him try out someone else's life as proof but what if he got reckless and ruined someone's life? Jimmy wasn\u2019t the most responsible person in the world and being able to get away with any prank he could ever pull off might end up being too much temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth there was no telling how Jimmy would react but after years of friendship you thought you trusted him enough to tell him your story without him screwing everything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point in your train of thought, you had arrived at Jimmies house and it was time to see how he would take the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously walked up to the door and knocked four times. It only took a second for Jimmies older sister Sarah to open the door. \"Hey Alex, come to see Jimmy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had a bubbly personality and one of the prettiest faces you had ever seen. She was basically the ultimate girl next door but she was also 23 and completely out of your league. Not to mention she was your best friends sister which is completely off limits\u2026usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, hey there Sarah! Is he in his room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, hasn\u2019t come out all day except for cereal this morning. Probably on the computer or playing video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool\", you said as you passed by Sarah to head up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmies room was very similar to your own except while yours was full of books, Jimmies was full of video games. He was the definition of nerd but with a more mischievous sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey dude! What's up? Haven't seen you much this summer!\" Jimmy said when you walked through the door to his room. He was lying on his bed with a controller in his hands. The TV showed one of his favourite Xbox games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, dude we need to talk. Something's come up and I'm gonna need your full attention for this\", you said trying to get to the point as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, sure what is it?\" he said, pausing the game and directing all his focus on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026I don\u2019t really know how to tell you this lightly so I'm just going to tell you everything.\" You proceeded to tell Jimmy everything that had happened to you so far, not forgetting a single detail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looked at you with a blank expression, his jaw almost touching the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo\u2026what do you think? I am gonna need your help to try and get my mom back somehow and I figured who better to hatch a great plan than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy just looked at you and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If your going to expect me to believe you fully then I'm gonna need some proof!\" Jimmy was visibly excited to get the opportunity to see something amazing, assuming you were telling the truth, which you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that might actually be a problem\" you said. Jimmy began to change his expression from one of excitement to one of disappointment. \"You see, I don't actually know how the Hallway works. I mean the note told me to put the key in any keyhole and I'd end up in the Hallway but I haven't really tried it yet. I just know for sure that someone is in my Mothers life and I really want my Mother back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy could see that you were a little shaken up from everything that you had gone through lately so he decided to make it easier on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you put it in my bathroom keyhole, since my room doesn't have one, and we can see if this bad boy works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't think that's really the problem though\" you said. \"What if you don't believe me after I take someone else's life? You shouldn't be able to tell the difference between me and whoevers life I decide to try out as proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could make a phrase that you would say to me so that I can know its actually you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might work but you have to trust that whoever you think is telling you the phrase is actually me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmies excitement was growing again and you started to think he might explode from all that hyper energy. \"This is gonna be so AWESOME!! Oh! Can I try it out afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya sure but the number one priority has to be getting my Mom back! Don't ever forget that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Alex. I would never forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick bro hug, you told Jimmy to wait on his bed so you could leave and get back to the Hallway. Before you left you told him that whoever said to him \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" would actually be you in their life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you left Jimmies room and closed the bathroom door behind you, you took a moment to slouch back against the door. Jimmies bathroom wasn't the cleanest in the world but you didn't really care right now. All you could think about was the imposter living your moms life. She was probably either finishing up whatever errands she wanted to get done or she was at the spa having her 'me time' in your moms life. You really hoped she wasn't miss treating your moms life. There were so many ways this could all go to hell if this imposter got angry, annoyed or just bored with your moms life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now though you had to give Jimmy his proof so you could get his help. And with that, you turned your attention back to the bathroom door with the keyhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inserted the key, turned it to the right and with a nervous gulp, you opened the door. </span></div></div>",

It looked like a cross between the elegance of a red carpet affair and the comforting feel of a modern day home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a little more relaxed than before. The first time you entered you were close to wetting yourself with fear but now the Hallway gave off a very relaxing vibe and all you felt like doing was wandering through the halls for ages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas you had a job to do! You put on your serious face and headed down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe different doors you passed all looked so interesting that it was actually becoming difficult to remind yourself that you had a mission of utmost importance on your hands.  You knew that whether you liked it or not, you would be spending a lot of time walking these halls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first door which caught your eye was that of a female Olympic gymnast. You definitely had to try that one out later. Another door led to the life of a professional football player and the one beside it was that of his girlfriend. As you kept walking you noticed that probably every person in the world had a door in this hall. One door even belonged to a woman from Greenland!  The amount of fun you could have with all these different lives was unimaginable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took about ten minutes for you to find the doors belonging to the Holden family, Jimmies family. Directly beside them were the doors for all of Jimmies neighbors. Even your door was only a few feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you decided to enter the life of one of Jimmies family members, you really wanted to try something. So you walked over to your mothers door and gave the door a push. Sadly, it didn't budge. Your mothers life must still be at the mercy of that strange girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if you can properly convince Jimmy to help, then you will be that much closer to saving your mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a quick moment to shake all your limbs in order to prepare yourself for a whole new life, and with a deep breath, you walked through a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHICH DOOR DID YOU ENTER?</span></div></div>",

When you opened your eyes, one glance at the clothes you were wearing told you exactly who you now were to everyone else in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had become Jimmies mother! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reasoning for becoming Jimmies mom instead of his gorgeous sister was that Sarah had been wearing a pretty short skirt and tight tank-top which led you to believe that she might be heading out soon. You really didn't want to have to deal with her very feminine outfit or the possibility of being dragged off to hang out with Sarah's friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, even with Jimmies mothers life, you still had to put up with her feminine clothes. At the moment she seemed to have just come back from a run because she was wearing a tight sports bra, which now did nothing for the boobs you did not have, and a pair of running shorts. You can even feel the panties she was wearing which you now possessed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick stretch of all your suddenly sore muscles, you stood up and looked around the living room a little. Jimmies mom had been watching one of those crappy soap opera shows so you quickly turned off the TV to save yourself from the terrible dialogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you walked across the carpet you noticed three things.   One, the soft carpet felt amazing on your bare feet and toes. Two, you were now a little shorter than you used to be which made sense since you were now the height of Jimmies mom. And three, you could remember the run Jimmies mother just ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird but in your head you could clearly make out the memory of you running through forests and down sidewalks only 20 minutes earlier. These were of course not your memories which meant they were Jimmies moms  memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular point made you think a little more. What if you could 'remember' things about the life you were in? That would help explain how the person living your mothers life was able to get past this morning without slipping up. It would also make living other people's lives a lot easier for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that you really wanted to check was what your reflection now looked like in the mirror. You figured that everyone would now see you as Jimmies mom but what if everyone saw your physical male appearance and just thought of you as an adult woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the hallway mirror, to your amazement, stood the reflection of Jimmies mom. \"This is seriously incredible!\" you said to yourself as you felt your own smooth face while watching the reflection of the woman you now were do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that at this point it would be time to go up and say the code phrase to Jimmie but one part of your brain said that right at this moment, you were the person in Jimmies life who had full control over him and with that kind of power, you could have some serious fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou changed your posture to a more straight and mature pose. With a quick fluff of your now long and flowing hair, you made your way to the stairs and to Jimmies room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside his room, you start to think of the memory of 'you' jogging. What if you could access all of Jimmies mothers memories so that you could pull off the perfect act and really get the best of Jimmy? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrated on the memory of the jog Jimmies mother just had, and within seconds, your brain was flooded with images from Tina's (Jimmies mother) life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw images from her wedding, the honeymoon, raising Jimmy alone after Jimmies father left them, Tina's first time meeting you and your family and even memories from before you had been born, like memories from Tina's childhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever but was probably only a couple of seconds, you were ready to screw with your friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOW DO YOU DO IT?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now screwing with your friend wasn't the most important thing you probably could've been doing at that moment but seeing as you had the power to have a little fun you decided to go for it. There wasn't too much of a rush with the 'Save Mom' thing, so you figured it might just be time to take a break from your stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final thought, you assumed your motherly pose and knocked loudly on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JIM HOLDEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR THIS INSTANT!\" You felt a little silly yelling at your friend like you were his mother because to you, you still had your own voice which was far from authoritative but you hoped it sounded a lot more commanding to everyone else in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy opened the door a second later with the expression every teen gets when their mother calls for them; that of exasperation and boredom. \"What mom, I'm busy in here waiting for Alex to come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man, I don't care what your doing, when your mother calls you, you listen!\" The fact that Jimmy had no idea it was you was pretty exhilarating so you kept going. \"I think it's about time you started pulling your weight around here seeing as you are the man of the house now. I didn't raise a slacker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy cocked an eyebrow at you which made you question your acting ability but you hoped none of that doubt showed on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the sudden change of heart mom? You just got back from your run and you choose this as the time to make me the real man of the house? Cant you just take a shower and we can deal with this tomorrow?\" That's the Jimmy you knew, always trying to get out of doing any kind of physical or mental work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Because of the attitude you seem to have developed, I want you to clean the entire house! Starting with my bedroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOOMMMM! That's completely unfair and totally uncalled for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy was about to continue talking but you put out your well manicured hand and he stopped talking immediately. You were having way too much fun for your own good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear any more of this Jim! Why cant you just be a little more like Alex every now and then!\" you hoped to god that little comment wouldn't give you away but luckily Jimmy didn't notice the connecting and surrendered to your will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll clean your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You gave him a cheeky smile and turned on your heel to lead Jimmy to Tina's room where you would sit back and watch him clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly Tina kept her room pretty tidy so there wasn't really that much to clean. But it was still fun to lay sprawled out on the king sized bed and bark orders at Jimmy as he cleaned. It was really a miracle that Jimmy hadn't noticed anything about his mothers apparent decision to punish him and how much joy she seemed to be getting out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jimmy followed the orders of his apparent 'Mother', you took a quick second to comb over your body while he was busy paying you no attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that this altered version of you still had a penis (which you thanked the heavens for, since you didn't really feel like having to deal with a vagina for your first time in another life) but there were still other differences. Your penis for instance was definitely more sensitive compared to how you remembered it feeling. You already noticed your now painted fingernails and toe nails. You took a second to realize your new lack of hair except for the excess you seemed to have acquired on your head. You legs, armpits, chest and crotch were all hairless to your surprise and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething else you noticed was the fact that every piece of clothing in Tina's closet seemed to be reshaped to fit your body type. This Hallway was starting to both amaze and spook you. It had some serious power that could definitely be used for some horrible things if anyone bad got their hands on a key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought brought your mind back to your own situation with the imposter mom. What if the girl in your mothers life was actually someone horribly evil? This imposter could make so many aspects of your life a living hell if she felt in the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little while but you finally decided to let Jimmy off the hook when he was done cleaning the master bedroom. You cleared your head of the dark thoughts about your imposter mom and put a smile on your face, prepared to bring this whole joke with Jimmy to a close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Jim my boy? I think I will take a shower, or maybe a bath! Teaching you how to be the man of the house has really tired me out. But you know what... Revenge is a dish best served cold!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But most importantly, can I try it next???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, don't even worry. You will have plenty of time to try this out. As long as you help me find my mom of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alex your mom is as good as found! But where is my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she's in my life but I have no idea what she's been doing in the bathroom for this long. I mean, she thinks she's me right now so there is no way she blacked out or anything from the shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked to the bathroom where you had used the key to enter the Hallway but when you opened the door, expecting to see Tina wearing your clothes, you found the bathroom empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Tim? Where's my mom?\" Jimmy said, panic beginning to creep into his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude. I have no idea.\" You slumped against the hallway wall grasping for any ideas as to where Tina could possibly have gone. \"She didn't leave the house while I was in her life so the I just assumed that she was in the bathroom. I didn't even think to check.\" You ran your hands through your long, soft hair. \"How long were we cleaning for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only about a half hour. If my mom was in your life, she would have wandered out of the bathroom trying to look for me...so where'd she go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment trying to work out the possibilities in your head. \"I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro if you lost my mom too then I swear to god our friendship is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when it looked like you might have actually lost your best friends mother, possibly forcing yourself to take over her life forever, Tina walked up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Jimmy, Ms Holden,\" Tina was dressed in the clothes you had arrived in and her hair was cut to your old short style. She was holding a messy sandwich in her hands. \"I got hungry after going to the bathroom so I thought I'd make myself some lunch. This is my third sandwich.\" she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mo...I mean Alex! why didn't you come find me?\" Jimmy seemed visibly irritated and you hoped Tina didn't take it the wrong way. She seemed to be living your life perfectly without any knowledge of the life swap. Having a large lunch was something you did on a regular basis because you usually ended up burning off the calories anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude,\" Tina said through a mouth full of sandwich. \"I heard your mom yelling at you about being the man of the house so I thought I'd just step back for a moment while you both talked.\" Staying out of other people's confrontations was also a very you thing to do. \"Oh, sorry Ms Holden. You are right though. Jimmy does need to pick up some slack around your house.\" Kissing up to parents, something else you would have done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. You were convinced. Tina was definitely you for the time being and that made you incredibly excited. \"Oh don't worry about it Alex,\" you said with what you hoped looked like a motherly smile. \"The little spat I had with Jimmy is over now, but I think it's best if you go home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looked at you a little surprised. No doubt he was thinking that you were trying to steal his mothers life for the rest of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm. Ya, ok Ms Holden. I guess I'll be off.\" Tina finished off the last bit of her sandwich and headed back down the stairs. She called back saying \"See you later Jimmy\" before heading out the door back to what used to be your home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you do that for!\" Jimmy wasted no time after the door shut before letting that out. He was obviously upset that you were sill his mother and could easily mess with him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, calm down. I'm not actually trying to steal your moms life or anything.\" you pulled Jimmy into his room and closed the door before continuing. \"I just remembered a part of the rules with the Hallway. There's a minimum limit for how long you need to stay in a persons life before leaving and that's 24 hours.\" Jimmies jaw dropped for the second time today. \"Don't worry though. I'll be out of your moms life first thing tomorrow morning, but until then, we can spend this time planning how to save my moms life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy shook his head, no doubt trying to clear it from all of the weird things that have already happened today. And it wasn't even 1pm. \"Ok. Just give me a break for the rest of the day. I'll help with the planning but I think I'm done with the weird experiences for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on the bed and started adjusting your sports bra. The scary part about living Tina's life was that since you had gone and looked through basically all of her memories, you were now completely comfortable wearing Tina's clothes. This little side affect was probably a good thing for living a woman's life but it just felt wrong since, to you, you were still male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looked at you with an expression which fully displayed his distaste towards what he saw as his own mother possibly playing with her sports bra and boobs. \"Dude, right now you look like my mom to me so please refrain from touching anything that would be deemed a private part of the female anatomy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I don't even see your mothers breasts when I look at my chest. I still somehow see my own physical form, just wearing your mothers clothes. Also I'm basically hairless now except for my head. You'll understand when you try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you even want to do now? I mean this is kind of your personal mission, I'm just the help, so what do you have in mind?\" Jimmy sat back in his desk chair and stared intently at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality you hadn't even thought of how you might go about finding your mother. \"Well, I know that whoever is in the life of my mother wanted to do some errands and have a spa day today. Whatever errands she had planned are probably done now so we could just go to the closest spa and see if we can spot my mom. Then I guess we could tail her until she makes a mistake or leads us to something or somewhere that may give us a hint as to where my real mom might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy put on his thinking face. \"You told me that someone who uses the Hallway can see someone else who uses it even when their assuming someone else's life, so I think I should go out on my own and try to spot your imposter mom while you just sit here and wait, or we could both just hang out here until your imposter mom gets home. Once the imposter gets back we can begin observing her for any slip ups or clues as to who's life your real mom might be living right now.\" Jimmy pauses for a second while a smile creeps onto his face. \"And maybe while we wait, I could have my first go in another life.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The majority of you wanted to send Jimmy out to look for the imposter mom immediately but with only about two hours until she'd have to be back home to start preparing dinner, Jimmies time would probably be wasted with only a short amount of time to search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you and me can just wait here until tomorrow when I can get my life back and we can begin the interrogation.\" you finally said to Jimmy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with that. But in the mean time I think it's my turn with the Hallway!\" Jimmy paused for a second, looking at you curiously. \"So...how exactly do I do that? Do I use your key? Or can I get my own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my key is gone for now until my minimum time is up and I'm pretty sure the rule is one key per person and one person per key so I guess we have to get you your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Jimmy was starting to get really excited now. He kept jumping up and down like a little kid while listing out random names of people he wanted to become. \"Oh! Do you think I could take over the life of one of my hot adult neighbors so we can do grown up things in our new lives? Or maybe I could take over a teacher and change our grades before doing grown up things. Or I could take the life of my aunt who lives downtown and we can do grown up things downtown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at Jimmy. You did understand his excitement but you were also a little worried that he'd be disappointed when he tried it out for himself. Truth be told, you didn't feel any different compared to how you felt before stepping into Tina's life. Other than the added memories and change in clothes, you didn't feel much of a difference. \"I'm getting the sense that you really want to do grown up things. But how about we focus on getting you your key, and then you can decide how you want to use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. So where do we need to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, The cave that I went through to get to the Hallway was on the outskirts of the forest behind the mall.\" You thought about how far the mall was from Jimmies house and took another look at what you were wearing. \"And I guess I'm gonna have to change out of these running clothes if I'm going to drive us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy plastered a ridiculous grin on his face knowing he was about to enter a whole new world of fun! \"All right Mommy! I'm ready when you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up off the bed and lifted your arm up to smell your shaved underarm. \"Oh God dude, your mom reeks right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you expect? She had just gotten back from a run before you highjacked her life. You'll just have to add 'take a shower' to the list of things you'll need to do before we leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prospect of showering in another persons home and changing into someone else's clothes, not to mention a females clothes, wasn't really something you looked forward to but it had to be done. \"How about I go shower and change, then I'll meet you out in the car so we can drive to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty minutes later you were freshly showered and changed. The shower was refreshing but also a little odd. Your skin was incredibly sensitive seeing as you were now as sensitive as Tina was. You also noticed that hair was just starting to grow on your legs and armpits so, with the help of Tina's memories, you properly shaved the for-mentioned areas. That had also been a very different experience. Next had been changing. First off, a look in the mirror reminded you of how exactly you needed to wrap the towel in order to cover the private areas of your body. The next step was changing clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't know what Tina might wear to a quick outing to the mall so, since you knew you wouldn't really be out for very long, you decided on just picking what you thought looked nice. For now, that was a pair of white cut off pants, black ballet flats and a simple black blouse. You also had to change into Tina's underwear so you just quickly picked out a black bra and panties. You felt no desire to sift through Tina's underwear for longer than you had to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter grabbing Tina's purse, you headed out to her car where Jimmy was waiting patiently in the passengers seat. You walked over to his window and asked \"So, how do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, quite a bit like my real mom would dress. Good job. Now hop in the car so we can get on our way. I've been waiting forever for you and I simply don't have the patience today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou looked at him for a second with a bit of a nervous expression. \"Do you mind driving us there? I know I have your moms memories and all... but I don't really feel comfortable driving yet. I barely have a lead era permit of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, whatever gets us there faster\" Jimmy said while sliding into the drivers seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned a little as you got in the passengers side. It was true that you felt nervous about driving to the mall with your person lack of driving experience, but you also wanted to check yourself out a little in the over head mirror. You still had Tina's reflection after all, and you kind of wanted to reap the benefits seeing as you don't actually have her physical features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive didn't actually take very long, probably due to Jimmies eagerness. You didn't really pay much attention to the road as you should have since you were really interested in Tina's face. It occurred to you that you hadn't put on makeup and since you were trying to act like Tina for the time being, it just seemed logical that you look the part to the T. The drive for you was spent doing your makeup and examining Tina's impressive cleavage in the house you chose to wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you parked just outside the forest edge a short distance from the malls back entrance. You both hopped out of the car and you led Jimmy to the cave where all this started. Jimmy seemed to be getting more excited with every step he took towards the cave but you weren't really feeling the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are\" you said gesturing to the cave. \"Ready to give it a go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy looked at you with his trademark grin \"Hell ya dude. Just tell me what I need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just walk in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Jimmy looked a little disappointed with the simplicity but he still marched through the cave with determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Wait!\" Jimmy stopped in his tracks as you called for him. \"I  have an idea. How about when you get through to the Hallway and you pick out a life you want, try to find a phone so you can contact me. Wherever you end up, I'll drive over and meet up with you. Then we can see what we want to do for fun until the time limit is reached tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya that sounds cool! Just try and keep my body safe until I contact you. Whoever ends up in my life will probably want to get home so you'll have to act like my mom until you can ditch him at my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of putting on another act as Tina wasn't very appealing to you but once you got rid of the 'new Jimmy' you could meet the real one for some serious fun. \"Ok. Sounds like a plan. Just do me a favor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick a good life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would have been cute if it weren't so creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy one year anniversary, Kate.
