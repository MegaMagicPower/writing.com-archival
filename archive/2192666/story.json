His cock caught his attention next, as he involuntarily started to piss on the ground. Shiron scratched his head, drooling and giving a dumb grunt, before grabbing his cock, and letting his hand get covered in the warm yellow liquid. He smiled at how warm it was, and lifted his hand up to his snout, and licked it a few times. <br>\r\n\"Yummmm~\" He drooled and pointed his dick at his mouth, lowering his head so he could drink his own delicious piss. His tail wagged as he drank, loving the taste of his dragon urine, though once he stopped, he whined to himself.<br>\r\nShiron walked around a bit, his brain decaying quite quickly. As he walked, his belly groaned, and the Windragon let out a small FRRRT.<br>\r\nHe giggled to himself and sniffed the air. <br>\r\n\"Duhuh! Stinky toot!\" He grunted and ripped another, larger fart and clapped, proud of the stench. Suddenly, he felt his belly rumble loudly. Shiron grunted once more, and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shiron stroked his cock and giggled like a retard as he stunk up the place with his ever growing turd pile. <br>\r\n\"Pooooooppppyyyy!\" He shouted into the air, drooling and shitting. He got on all fours and ripped another massive fart as the last of his load came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaawww, look what he have here~\" A strange voice said from behind Shiron. When he turned around, he saw a big black feathered dragon that looked a lot like Shiron.

His stomach puffed up with a bomb of flauts, growing twice it size. Next were his arms, which became pure fart sausages, which Shiron was unable to move. His throat bulged and bloated as the gas vented itself through, and the ballooning dragon's head rapidly inflated with farts, still not letting a single bit escape. His mouth filled with gas he could taste. It was like a sea of skunks and rotten eggs. Shiron puked...but only puked a massive sea of farts from his stomach and into his mouth. His cheeks bulged and strained, ready for the rest of Shiron to fill so he could blow. His ears and snout ballooned out next, forever filling his senses with the smell and sound of his raunchy farts. His eyes turned green as they quadrupled in size, bulging out cartoonishly. Last thing to go was the mind itself. The farts demolished Shiron's brain, making it decay and rot away, replaced by the windragon's gas.<br>\r\nHis whole body floated a few inches off the ground and turned a light, but sickly fart green, the stench seeping through him and creating a visible cloud of fart musk around him as he floated throughout the forest.<br>\r\n*FRRRRRT*<br>\r\nNow that Shiron was but a mindless fart balloon, the spell wore off.
