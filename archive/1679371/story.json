Your soul stubbornly refuses to elope form its mortal shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the last time, you sit with your eyes closed, the warm sun on your face, speaking the words on the scroll, when something changes. Even though you haven't opened your eyes, you can see your surroundings.

And she was stuck into marrying a boy she didn't even like. Her parents had always been poor farmers who could barely get by feeding seven children. John Jameson on the other hand came from a very well to do family in Stormwind. Unfortunately, John was a complete snob who looked down on anyone with not enough wealth as his family. His only interest in Emma was her looks. She had chestnut brown hair that went down to her shoulders and a face 'blessed by the Light' as her parents said. She was also considerably curvy in all the right areas, having a DD bust and matching thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn took notice to this, and agreed to provide a very generous dowry to Emma's family if he was allowed to marry her. She begged her parents to not go through with it, but this year's crops had proved to be less than fruitful. In order to survive they had no choice but to give away their only daughter. Emma felt like a cow being herded to the slaughter. There she sat, staring out of the window on this beautiful summers day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"I wish something would happen to get me out of this mess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you spun completely out of control through Elwynn Forest like you were in a time warp. Your soul had been severed from your own body and was desperately seeking refuge in some human form. It was unfortunate that the Stonewall's had decided to build so closely to the Abbey, because your soul sped right into their house. As you zipped through the walls like air, you felt a shuddering thud as your spirit connected with something. Everything went dark for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to find yourself on the floor of a poorly decorated farm house. Your head wouldn't stop spinning as you slowly rose to your feet to see where you were. Elwynn Forest was still outside the window, so at least you hadn't teleported across the world when your spirit sundered, which you were thankful for. Suddenly the door behind you opened, a pudgy woman with dirt all over her arms and a handkerchief tying her hair together busted into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened honey!? I heard a loud thud coming from here.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow, trying to figure out what she meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, who are you-\" You clasped your mouth. It wasn't your voice coming out! You noticed a strangely heavy feeling on your chest. You looked down and screamed. \"WHAT IN THE NAME OF THE LIGHT IS THIS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at you were two massive breasts under a white and blue dress. You suddenly noticed your hair was much longer as well! You looked at a nearby mirror and gasped. The reflection showed a beautiful brown haired woman instead of your normal Brother Stevens-like reflection! The Mind Control spell must have accidentally targeted whoever this was instead! The overweight woman shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being silly Emma dear. You must be well rested for your wedding tomorrow. Now wash up for dinner, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the room, leaving you alone to comprehend what she just said. Not only were you in the body of a woman, the woman was meant to get married tomorrow! You suddenly recalled being scheduled to wed a couple the next day as well....Talk about ironic. But you had to do something and fast before you ruined this budding young couple's life together!</span></div></div>",

You quickly sprinted for the road into Northshire. However one of the guards stopped you before you could enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa miss, where you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you several seconds to realize he was talking to you. \"Oh, Uh. I was just going to deliver something to...Brother Stevens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard gave you a funny look. \"It's information for my wedding.\" You answered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sorry miss. We've just been getting an unusually large number of bandits attacks in the Abbey recently. Can't be too careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked the Light that he allowed you to pass.

Thinking quickly, you lifted your old body's arms around your shoulders and hoisted yourself up, as weird as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to lose some weight...\" You joked to yourself as you made your way to the Abbey with your soulless corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the Deputies noticed you and quickly ran over to give you a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright!? What happened?!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know,\" You tried your best to sound like a damsel in distress. \"I just went over to Brother Stevens and he collapsed! I need to take him to Father Lightwell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard nodded and put your body's other arm over his shoulder. Father Lightwell was the head priest of Northshire Abbey. He was a excellent teacher, and a dear friend to you. If anyone would know what to do about this predicament, it would be him. You ascended the stairs with the guard until you reached the Father's study, right below the bell tower. Father Lightwell was reading an old tome when you and the guard barraged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear me! Brother Stevens! What has happened Deputy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This young lady claims to have found Stevens collapsed on the ground in the gardens. We brought him to you, considering you are an expert healer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...set him down on my desk here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your body's legs, while the guard grabbed both arms. Father Lightwell removed the parchment on the table to make room for your body. He gently pushed the hair from your face, and placed both hands on your head. A yellow light radiated from his hands, almost blinding you. When it died done, he had a look of concern on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deputy, please fetch me a means of bringing Brother Stevens to a bed. He will need much rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier nodded and hastily made his way out of the study. Father Lightwell studied you a moment, stroking his gray beard in deep thought. Until at last he spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus. Were you practicing with that dangerous Mind Control spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBusted. You flinched and stammered an answer. \"Y-yes sir. Sorry I thought I could handle it the first time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather Lightwell began to pace around the room. He was making you nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-father, h-how did you know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important Marcus Stevens. What matters is that you ran from this situation without taking responsibility for your actions. If I'm not mistaken, the body you are inhabiting is that of Emma Stonewall. The very Emma Stonewall you were supposed to marry tomorrow! You could have destroyed her relationship with her family because of your actions! Priests are meant to help people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were being scolded by your father. Of course, Father Lightwell was right in every way. You had been a coward, and probably destroyed Emma's life because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightwell sighed.</span></div></div>",

But you just said-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my permission, the wedding will be postponed. I will explain to EVERYONE the situation including Emma's family. In the meantime you will resume your normal priest training such as you are. No complaints Marcus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to question him again but figured you were already in enough trouble. You sighed and bowed to Father Lightwell, continuing down the stairs and back to your quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week was an extremely difficult test of patience. For days, your fellow priests mocked you because of your new female form. In fact the tailor made it a point to create the perfect robe such that no matter how you wore it, it always showed a massive amount of cleavage. Several members of the guard had even made passes at you, one almost even lured you to the vineyard alone. The worst of it, however, was dealing with the father and mother of Emma Stonewall. Both were beyond angry with you for your recklessness and sent ravenous complaints to you every day through either angry letters or going to the Abbey and yelling your ears off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife at the Abbey had become so chaotic that you took trips to the bar in Goldshire whenever you could. You'd spend your entire service earnings to drown your sorrows away in liquor, but nothing ever seemed to keep the local perverted males from hounding you with wolf whistles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, after finishing a round, several men walked into the inn talking with each other. \"Hey did you hear about that...\"</span></div></div>",

He predicted that I'd get incredibly rich yesterday and sure enough! I've inherited my father's entire plantation! I'm set for life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man frowned. \"I don't know. I don't trust folks like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on! It's all in good fun! He's got a tent set up right outside the town. And visiting him is practically free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances, you would have regarded this conversation as the hearsay that it was. But feeling probably the worst you ever felt in a long time, and reasonably drunk, the taunting prospect of knowing what your future held made you curious. This entire week had been just plain awful, and a niggling doubt of uncertainty wrapped at the back of your mind that you might be stuck like this for the rest of your life. You shook your coin bag. Several jingles were heard, meaning that you hadn't yet throw away all your earnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"What have I got to lose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later you found yourself standing outside a large purple tent covered in black runes. It was safe to say that this was the right place and you went right inside. The inside was much different from the colorful outside. A dark and musky smoke filled the small tent. There were shelves carrying odd jars all along the wall. In the center was a knee high table with a large clear ball shaped piece of glass. At the other end of the table sat a hooded man. He had a short gray beard and his eyes under the hood were clear white. As you entered he looked up and spoke in a pausing raspy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings...Marcus Stevens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I have been...expecting you...Sit...\" He motioned to the cushion in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly obliged and sat cross legged. The fortune teller continued to sit there breathing heavily as if he was deep in concentration. You took the opportunity to look around the tent some more. The jars had labels that said all sorts of bizarre things. \"Pygmy Oil\", \"Giant Essence\", or \"True Air\". There were also unlabeled potions placed in delicate wooden stocks. The fortune teller gave a rough cough, startling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologizes...I was deep in a communication...with the other side...I know why you are here...Marcus Stevens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y- you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...You need not worry...I have here a solution...\" He pulled out a small vial from under his robes. \"All you must do...is take one sip...You will be your true self...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the potion from his shaking hands. It was very light and had a bright pink glow. The bubbles in the liquid danced in the light as you stared at them. But you sensed something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's is no catch...Marcus...Just drink the potion...You can call this...free service...\"</span></div></div>",

You put it in your dainty hand and swigged it down; as soon as the ale touched your lips your vision blurred.Unfortunately, your vision quickly came back to you. You quickly looked down, unfortunately, only to see Emma's very feminine body still belonging to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't it work?\" you asked, your voice cracking and sounding even higher than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but it did... you are now your true self\" replied the fortune teller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any different at all\" you replied, confused and slightly worried. The fortune teller was giving off a dark vibe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should <i>you </i>feel any different? You are Marcus.. in the soul, but not the body. But now, the physical Marcus, the real <i>you</i> that the world recognizes has been inhabited with Emma's brainwashed soul to forever believe she is and always has been you, and that <i>he</i> just drank a potion that restored <i>him</i> to his actual body. Thus, Emma's soul has transitioned into a copy of yours... I'm sure he's already off telling every other priest how he single-handedly reversed the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you nearly scream \"You liar! How could you... reverse this treachery!\". You quickly stand, pushing your chair back, and focus your mental power on conjuring the shadows from the depth of your mind in order to attack the Fortune Teller. Yet, for some reason, you literally blank at what to do - you can't remember the first step. You had fulfilled much of your priest training, but now you literally could not remember anything about it. This was completely unnatural and unexplainable, like forgetting something close to you... you felt it at the tip of your tongue but knew not a thing about it. You stood there, arms outstretched, unable to conjure a single spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems you've found the second part of the potion. As Emma's soul was untrained in fending off the shadow, yours unfortunately was... so you'll take longer. But I assure you, all your priestly, professional, and academic knowledge has been given to the <i>real Marcus</i> now. As that has happened, so has the opposite... your soul, mind, and now <i>body </i>have been filled with the knowledge Emma has acquired through her life, which, as she is a poor farm girl, isn't much. Just as she has already fallen to, also soon your emotions will be quite like hers - although likely never exactly parallel. I'm sure the hormones will help that though. Don't worry about your identity however, as your power had transgressed quite well, you will never truly forget who you were... you will just be unable to convince the world seeing as <i>Marcus </i>would say otherwise to you <i>Emma</i>, and you'd be quite unable to prove it with any knowledge on what you're actually saying... It'd simply look like you were mentally harmed from being possessed by Marcus for too long. Or maybe they'd think you'd been dabbling with the fel arts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find you are too lost for words to even respond, you are unable to fight and seem to be at his mercy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I've helped you to find your <i>true self</i>, Emma Stonewall\" says the fortune teller before he dissapears in to a cloud of purplish smoke, leaving you alone in the fortune tellers tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are left still standing, still very female, and mentally crippled compared to what you once knew. You collapse in despair in to the chair you had knocked away behind you, and feel your breasts bounce as you do so. You feel like crying, and wonder if it is part of the potion... but just manage to resist - probably because of the alcohol you had consumed prior that manages to numb your pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" is all you manage to say with your light feminine voice. You don't want to be Emma Stonewall, a woman, a poor and soon to be married woman for the rest of your life. You had already grown quite tired of having to sit down to pee, and had been recently worrying about your period. If you stayed as Emma forever you would have to bare children, have a family! Maybe, you could escape - run away and start a new life? Or, you could pursue Priest, or rather Priestess training again... it would take years to literally relearn all of it again though. Or, you could do both?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that seemes like a better idea then resigning to your fate, but maybe her fate wouldn't be that bad? She was about to be married to a rich noble, and surely he would carry you through life... but you would have to do... err... womanly things for him. You were disgusted at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe in time this could all blow over if you posed as Emma, or you could wait out an opportunity to explain your sitatuion to somebody who would listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to sit anxiously in the chair, and finally, gave in to a single womanly tear that fell down your face. Every part of your body felt so off to what you once knew, and now your mind had been almost erased. You were defenseless in any situation. Weak, and trapped to a horrid fate. You had to do something.</span></div></div>",

You questioned how the mind control spell targeted something on its own, and how you were literally 'ripped' from your body. From what you had read, that was unnatural to the spell. Did something external interfere? You asked this many times... before you completely lost track of time. It could have been minutes, or it could have been hours, but eventually your mind and soul were awakened by a powerful and magical vibration that seemed to creep from within you. It was pushing you somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing with nothing, you saw no risk and followed it. Slowly, the darkness turned to light, and then suddenly you were catapulted back in to reality.</span></div></div>",

You could see color, shape, and depth through this darkness! Slowly, your vision returned. From what you could tell, you were laying on the grassy floor of the Mage District in Stormwind. You laid there for a moment, still grasping the fact that you had <i>human senses </i>again. You were filled with appreciation for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered how you got to Stormwind though, and rolled from your side on to your front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Fel!\" you cursed aloud, but immediately rushed a hand to your lips. A lot of things were off. For one, as you rolled over your chest seemed closer to the ground then it had ever been, and something had squished on your chest which hurt horribly. For second, as you cursed your voice was extremely high pitched and smooth, almost feminine, and you didn't feel the familiar break of a voice crack as you talked. For third, as you brought your hand to your lip, you saw a dainty, soft, and almost beautiful hand with painted red nails. And for fourth, your could have sworn your lips were never this soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all these offbeat sensations, you failed to piece together what had happened, and went in to a state of frenzied confusion. Quickly, you removed your hand from your lips and placed both of them on the ground to lift yourself up; unfortunately it was just as confusing as the other senses, because although you could swaur you felt lighter (Except for something that seemed to be weighing down your chest at an awkward protruding angle), it was FAR more difficult and muscle working than normal to lift your entire body up. You brought your legs up to just about your chest and used them to lift yourself in to a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart had started beating as you quickly moved your head left and right to become better familiarized with your surroundings. A tiny strand of something blonde and light waved infront of your face... what was that? It was hair! Hair attached to your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings started to come piecing together now, and you looked down to verify your <i>senseless </i>fears. Unfortunately, your fears did make sense. Below your neck you can see cleavage, that is very much attached to you! You are wearing a dark purple apprentice robe, that at least covers your legs. Unfortunately, much of your shoulders and cleavage remain visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breasts attached to your body seem a lot bigger to you, but you know they can't be larger then C-cups. You bring your manicured hand to touch one, and instantly bring it away when you feel the touch on both sides. The breats are very much a part of you! From what you could tell, you were a woman - but you quite literally <i>didn't have the balls </i>to verify what was between your legs right now. You could already more then feel an unfamiliar absence as you had stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the - what the fuck is going on!?\" you whisper in a hiss to yourself. Your voice, now that you paid attention to it, was very much a womans. High pitch, light, smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a second away from your fears and nightmare to observe your surroundings again. Below you was a strange statue on the ground. It was a strange two headed monster carved in stone - it looked like a hydra. It was shiny and black, like it had been well preserved despite looking like it was from ancient times. The eye sockets of both sides of  the statue looked like they once held something, but they were empty. Around the statue, and in the eye sockets, were many fragments and shards from what looked to be broken rubies. Were those what was in the eyes? Did they just break? You reach down, rather awkwardly due to your new off-beat sense of balance, and pick up the object. It seemed to have some sense of importance. Maybe it was what you had been sucked in to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had bigger questions to ask right now though. Who were you? How long have you been gone? Where and what has happened to your actual body? How do you reverse this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and worried you decide to start walking towards Stormwinds exist, you wanted to get out of here - and going closer to your bodies last location seemed like the best idea. As you walked you realized just how awkward and completely different your new body was. You also took note to just how late it was outside, and the fact that nobody else was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared the exit to the district you heard voices coming from around the corner. You couldn't make out what they were saying, but you could tell there was at least three men walking your way and they were just around the corner. This late at night, alone, and in an already bad situation you pause for a moment to debate what to do.</span></div></div>",

Nothing to be nervous or scared about. You walked towards them, hips swaying like a lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped their conversation. One of them was a dark iron dwarf and laughed. \"Hot damn boys! We don't even have to go looking for our catch! Get her Zin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even respond, the tall one who appeared to be a high elf of sorts walked over to you with a large club in his hand.

You fell to the ground knocked out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of last night were pieced together in your head like a jigsaw puzzle that was missing a few pieces.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were still piecing together the events of last night, or was it a few nights ago now? You seemed to recall being sucked into an object, then being placed in the body of a woman, and then being attacked... was it all a dream? The blindfold on your eyes seemed to say it wasn't. Everything still felt weird too, you could tell you weren't in your body. So much for a dream, this had became a living nightmare. How many days had it been by now, anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were clearly sitting down against something wooden in a damp area. You felt a swaying, one similar to being on a boat, which you had grown quite familiar with as a child. A shackle was also around your ankle and was extremely tight - you could feel the pain from it having been in place for some time. You reached your unshackled hands up to the back of your head and grabbed the blindfold, feeling your long long and now matted and unkempt hair as you did so, and pulled it off. It didn't do much good for your vision, it was still very dark. You were clearly in a boats bottom-most cellar though. You could see outlines that looked like other living humanoids though, of many different species. Some were moving, others laying down. It was quite clear, from what you knew about Stormwinds recent crime problems, you were all being trafficed. To where, you had no idea, you could only hope that given your new body you weren't being sent to be sold for sexual purposes. The thought made your heart leap in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\" you whisper, shocked by the forced reminder of your light and smooth voice. Your new gender had now become only your second greatest worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't speak!\" hissed somebody, a male, from directly across from you, \"They're outside. You don't wanna know what they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's talking?!\" came the loud voice of a tauren as he opened a door. Light shined in to the room, and you squinted your eyes in a lack of preparation. The tauren stepped in quickly, and cleared most of the chamber, ending up inbetween you and the stranger - who you could now see was a small gnome male. He had pink hair and was in some very unkempt rags, but now that the light had illuminated most of the chamber, you realized everyone was. You included. The tauren eyed you for a second, seemingly surprised that you were awake, then turned to the gnome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard your squeaky voice, midget\" said the bovine \"I don't want to tell you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sir-\" piped the gnome, but it didn't seem to be enough of a plea. The tauren swiftly brought his hoof up to the gnomes head and slammed it against the wood of the ship. You squinted in partial shock and guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're finally awake, been days\" said the tauren as he turned to face you \"Don't get comfortable. But I'll see to it you get some food, you're lucky Hark thinks your a looker. Just know I think you're an ugly human, so you better keep your tramp mouth shut.\" The tauren then swiftly stepped back to the door he came in. Before the door shut, you glimpsed the gnomes state with the last bit of light that leaked in to the room. You were thankful that there was no blood, but the gnome had clearly been knocked out cold. You felt disgusting for causing it, and even more disgusting for being talked to like a female siren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slumped back to the wood, now unable to see anything again, and realized that the body you inhabited was starving! You hadn't noticed the hunger pains until the tauren mentioned food. You had been out a while. That was just another worry! You had to get out of here, get your life back - before it was taken from you in every way possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled on the shackle that was attached to your foot, but it was obvious it wasn't going to break. Not even your priestly magic could do much about that... but you could stand your ground and fight from where you were. Or, you could try the mind control spell again! Maybe, just maybe, you could pull it off and use it to free yourself! You tried to stand, but the shackle restricted it. You would have to do any casting and fighting from near the floor. You felt around, and could tell you had a decent amount of space from any of your 'slave neighbors'. You brushed your legs as you explored your surroundings, and concentrated on ignoring their smoothness and skinniness for now. Your hunger and new body would make everything you were about to do hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly light shone in again; it wasn't the tauren entering either. A night elf male in raggy (But not slave-like) pirate clothing stepped in, carrying a tray of food. He eyed you and started to approach. It was now or never. You focused on conjuring the energy and mana in your mind and transforming it in to shadow energy; you thought about projecting your mind outward and in to the elf with the shadows as the link between you and dominating his mind. The shadow energy coursed through your hands and channeled outward...</span></div></div>",

Like a curtain being opened, the light of the world around you returned. You could see clearer than before. There wasn't a blindfold to cover your eyes. In front of you was a small blond woman, looking completely confused. Next to her was an unconscious gnome. You dropped the tray of food and started feeling through your pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keys...keys...where are the keys?\" You muttered to yourself. Though it wasn't your real body, the last thing you wanted to do was leave that poor girl's body on a pirate ship. You were a priest after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pointed at your 'old body'. \"You, where did you keep the keys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-wha!? Who said that!? Where am I!? And why do I sound so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and answer! Where did you keep the keys for the cell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I kept the keys in my back trouser pocket...I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling around you grasped the metal handle and jammed it into the lock. You ripped off the girl's blindfold, her eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're...me!? And I'm...\" She looked down and almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain 'princess'! You lot!\" You tossed the key to the nearby prisoners after finishing unlocking the girl's shackles. \"Take it and get yourselves out of here. Quick, I don't want that tauren to come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully this swashbuckler had the sense to keep a saber on his person. Before your priestly training you had engaged in some rather...questionable behavior. You weren't a master with swords but it would probably be enough to get you out of any trouble. You needed to escape on a raft or small boat. Hopefully there was a spare on this ship. Before the girl could protest you threw her over your shoulder. This night elf was well built, she weighed next to nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in there!?\" Yelled a voice from behind the door leading to the deck.</span></div></div>",

Before you could even move a step, he was standing and guarding the small staircase out of the holding area. You were the closest of the lot of prisoners to him too; after all, this was your escape to lead. You quickly withdrew the cutlass that the Night Elf had on his belt and raised it ahead of you. Despite the weight of the girls body though, you realized it would be far easier to win this fight without worrying about someone on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used the very arm under the shoulder you carried her on to pick her up - in a rather awkward way - but still managed to throw her to the side with one arm. This body was powerful. She flew into the wood base of the ship and let out a feminine scream. You really did underestimate your new bodies power. She wasn't knocked out, but she was now laying against the wood, clearly incapable of getting up from the shock against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing you fool?\" asked the tauren as he withdrew a large wooden mallet from his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking you out, bovine scum\" you said as you rushed towards him, swinging your sword towards his chest. Apparently, the cow hadn't expected you to actually follow through on your action, and took the hit without a flinch. Blood splattered from his chest and to the ground; it was definitely a nasty wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" he said \"How could you! You'll pay for this, you good for nothing nature lover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine lifted his mallet up and brought it down towards your head. You jumped to the side, evading the hit - but -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... fuck!\" you cursed, noticing the large crack that was knocked in to the wood. It was obvious that water was starting to leak in now, not a lot, but slowly. As the tauren staired in shock at his own actions you realized this was your chance to take him down! Without hesitation, you stabbed your sword towards his neck and sent it cleanly through. A gurgling sound was made as his eyes turned to you, but then he fell limp - pulling your arm down with him. You withdrew your sword from his body... at least that was over. You felt little remorse for the death of one of your kidnappers, especially after he attacked the gnome that had talked to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this battle was over, your attention returned to your environment. Many of the prisoners were still behind you, but some had already left the holding cell and started to make their way to the surface. The gnome you had met earlier was still on the floor unconcious. Water was also starting to slowly leak in, but you had at LEAST an hour to get off the ship at this rate. You could see many moving up the stairs, and many making their way towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just then that you noticed that the girls body who you had recently inhabited was gone! You looked around the dark cellar, and couldn't find her, eve with your new nocturnal vision. It wasn't the biggest of your worriest, but you were starting to feel guilty! You weren't going to leave this ship without her body. You sheathed your weapon and made your way towards the stairs that led out of this fel-hole, having to duck your head to avoid bashing it on the roof as you stepped out. You were a LOT taller now, especially from the female form you had had. Many prisoners were right behind you, and some already ahead. You head up the staircase and then another, coming out an open doorway and in to the sun! All around the ship was water... and all around you were pirates. This was going to be tough.</span></div></div>",

You were in rags, and back in the womans body. The body hurt a lot too, considering how you had thrown it against the ships floor; your back was aching to the point where it was almost hard to stand. <i>How did this happen? </i>You thought in your head... and realized you overlooked the most basic of Mind Control principles! You had to return to your body sometime, and gaining distance between the two bodies only made it sooner.

Oh boy, you had screwed something up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the time to disect your priestly abilities though. You still had to escape!

He was trying to stop you all... that wouldn't blow over well now that he was back in his own body. You could picture the prisoners being taken aback in the battle by the guard who helped them turning against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dammit!\" you said, trying to sound convincing. It was hard to do with such a feminine voice, one which you weren't used to fluctuating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... well, what's going on with the prisoners?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... umm... nothing.

He was a lot bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" you asked, rather scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew what my plans were for her tonight. Why change them? You deserved some punishment for sleeping with that one elf prisoner anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grabbed your waist forcefully and pulled you towards him. You were taken offguard by it and were put even slightly off balance. He then brought his head in to your and kissed you on the lips, holding it forcefully, and placing his tongue in your mouth. You were being kissed by a man! This was so wrong.. so weird! It felt... almost right to. You could swaur your heart was pumping for more reasons then fear, and you felt a moistness between your legs growing. Maybe this wasn't the worst thing that could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! You were about to be, well - <i>raped</i>! You had to get away from this man, before he made you horney as a woman! You knew it would be best not to use mind control again with the dangerous fluctuations in it, but you still had the rest of your arsenal of priest spells. You just had to get his lips off yours so you could send a spell his way.</span></div></div>",

He collapsed on top of you, groaning, you threw him back and he landed on the floor of the ship with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just for good measure.\" You thought. \"Shadow Word: Pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComically, the man switched back and forth between the pain in his stomach and the new pain in his head. Both effects weren't going to last forever though, you had to hurry. Stepping over the writhing body of the black haired man, you peaked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door apparently led to the ship's upper deck, if you had to guess you were currently in the captain's quarters. The sounds of battle and fighting were heard from down below, probably just where you were moments before as the night elf. You suddenly felt really bad for this 'Nolan' character, he'd return to his body only to get killed by the rest of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wasting time though, looking around you tried to find a small boat or dingy that you could hijack and escape on. As luck would have it, there was a decent sized one right next to the door. Tip toeing into action, you headed straight for your escape route before anyone on the lower decks could spot you. You cut the ropes and went down into the sea with a splash, you were free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank the light...\" You whispered, still listening to the shouting and fighting on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome part of you felt you should up there, fighting with the other slaves. It would be the right thing to do, the priestly thing to do. But then you remembered, you weren't in your own body anymore. This body belonged to a young woman, a woman who was probably thinking she'd never be able to live a normal life. You had the responsibility to bring this body back to her, to put her fears to rest and undo what you had done. That was...Of course...Assuming you could even fix this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed to yourself, letting the situation sink in as your dingy slowly floated away from the pirate ship. How were you ever going to get back to Stormwind? You were in the middle of nowhere! Maybe you should have helped the slaves, maybe you could have taken control of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the entire pirate ship exploded in massive fireball that nearly rocked your own small boat over! What the hell had happened!? Did someone light up all the gunpowder on board!? Did the other slaves decide to take out the pirates with them!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBits of flaming debris and wood landed all around you, you covered your head. There was no turning back now. You had to set sail on the high seas with a small little boat, no one knew where you were. Even you didn't know where you were! You could be halfway to Northrend by now for all you knew! As your dingy pulled away from the heated remains of the pirate ship, you could feel a difference in air temperature. Perhaps that was a clue as to where you were. The air was...</span></div></div>",

Both the sun and the air seemed to be conspiring against you. There were two paddles on the side of the boat, and you realized you could attempt to paddle towards land; the problem was, you had no idea where land is. With the petite feminine body and blistering heat, it didn't seem like a good idea to row anywhere, lest you wanted to kill yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at least drifting, albeit slowly, in an oceanic current... <i>maybe, you'll end up alive on land... maybe... you'll find your home... you'll find your body... maybe... you'll reverse this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The boat, consumed by the mysterious fireball was sinking. What had happened? There were people... both pirates, and prisoners, screaming... nobody had seen it coming. All of their explosive cargo had went off at once - but, what had caused such to happen? All that was now visible on the surface were a few seperate pieces of burning wood. Not a body had floated up yet. Everything had sunk with the boat. Including the statute... the deep abyss of the oceans bottom all that await everything.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes. It was night now. Fuck... how could I fall asleep? You motion to sit up, having been laying in the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Holy fel!\" you shout, in an all too high-pitched screech. Your arms, neck, and some of your cleavage were burnt from the sun, however, it wasn't all too serious - but it hurt. Biting your lip lightly, you scout around the boat. In the distance... there was land! You might actually make it out of this alive! Images of food coolness conspired in your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the painful burn, and the still very humid night air, you grabbed the paddles of the boat and started rowing towards the land. Your arms could only move the boat so fast... in fact, your physical strength was pitiful compared to your male self. After just several rows, you realized how slow you were actually going. Coupled with the pain from your burnt arms, this could be a huge problem, with a tiring solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your teeth dig harder in to the bottom of your relatively soft lip, distracting yourself with the self-inflicted pain, as you continue rowing. When you get to shore... everything would be okay.</span></div></div>",

Or maybe it was the humidity that made it feel like your eyeballs were going to melt and drip out of your sockets. Whatever it was, your mind completely blocked out all forms of reason and focused on one goal. Getting to the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeagulls gawked in the air directly above you, the beach must have been getting close. Determined, you paddled harder and faster. Your delicate arms felt like they were about to fall off from the pain. But you couldn't give up, you just had to get close enough to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boat's speed picked up dramatically. You felt the front of the ship slowly rise in the air slightly. Yes! The waves were beginning to carry you to shore! Realizing that paddling was no longer necessary, you grabbed onto the sides of the boat for dear life. You felt the wind whip your hair back as you travel forward under the breach of the wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you could just make out the shore. Brilliant gold flaked sands aligned with palm trees greeted you. It was beautiful. Then again, a rock in the middle of the ocean would be beautiful at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were much closer to the shore now, you weren't quite in range yet. You'd just have to wait for another wave to carry you in and hope the boat didn't flip over. Just as you finished the gruesome thought of your body being torn to shreds by the jagged rocks beneath you, the boat picked up speed again. This was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth, you braced for the hit as your boat literally flew off the water and right for the shore. The last thing you could remember was your head hitting something hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww....\" You woke up saying, the sun was higher in the sky then it had been before. Apparently, you had hit your head and passed out, a large bleeding lump now occupied the brim of your brow. Worse still, your sunburn had not improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaaah!\" You yelled as you slowly got up, it felt like someone was sticking pins and needles through every inch of your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing greeted you but the sounds of waves crashing. Looking around you first noticed your boat, which had been completely smashed to pieces when you landed hard on the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you went over to survey the wreck. It was hard to take every step, but eventually you made it and started sorting out through the torn pieces of wooden. Nothing was salvageable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" You muttered. \"Just freaking perfect...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had no way off wherever you were, there would be no possible way you could swim through those currents and who knows what sort of beats lurked under the waves. You were probably lucky to even get here alive. Speaking of which, where was \"here\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and gasped. Behind you was a gigantic wooden wall containing a miniature city. The sounds of people and rowdiness definitely meant it was inhabited. However, the brief spring of hope was quickly shut down as you noticed the icon on a flag waving around on one of the taller buildings. It was the skull and crossbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More pirates...\" You groaned.</span></div></div>",

Sparks dance and bounce along Dedric's heavily muscled arms. His shirtless torso shines with sweat from the heat of the smithy. As he sharpened his sword, he wondered if there were any local womenfolk sneaking a peek at his handsome physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I rhymed!\" he declared out loud. He then looked around to see if anyone was giving him a funny look for talking to himself. As you, the reader can probably tell, Dedric has some impulse control problems. In his career as a warrior of the realm, this often culminated in seeking every type of possible combat edge he could get. Be that a famous eastern sword trainer, who really just wanted to rob him, or, say, some sort of performance enhancer in some consumable form per say. (foreshadow, foreshadow) Anyhoo, back to the story then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dedric looked about, he thought he overheard voices from outside the smithy. He stopped sharpening his blade, and could immediately make out the voice of some gnome whispering gruffly to someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" coughed the gnome, in a high-pitched tone, \"these things I'm manufacturin' will surely finally give the Alliance armies the boost they need to defeat those dastardly horde!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that he has come across something big, Dedric listens closer, cupping a hand against his ear. Even his short, dark brown hair seemed to twitch with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This new serum will surely boost the performance of the soldiers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other voice, a skeptical old dwarf, \"Then why aren't you talkin to the high council?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's never been tested on humans, dwarfs, gnomes, or anything that was living.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf scoffed loudly, then a sound as if he were drawing smoke from a pipe, \"well, now, we've got to the bottom of that thar issue,\" he pauses, \"now go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome lets out squeaks and squeals of protest, but soon you hear the pitter pat of small feet growing fainter and fainter as the gnome walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After some time of following the prints, Dedric is able to see the small figure wandering out of down, down the road leading to Westfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, excuse me,\" calls Dedric.

The lab, shiny with bits and metal bobs, stands out starkly in the forest clearing where it is situated. Suddenly, the gnome turns around, he squeaks, \"I'm afraid you must pass the time outside, as my lab was not manufacturized to account for organisms of your girth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, what?\" Dedric scratches his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too big to fit in there!\" shouts the gnome, stamping his feet. He turns around, muttering. A few moments later, the entire structure begins to quiver and sputter. Great plumes of smoke rise from an uncountable number of exhaust pipes. The building seems to shift and jump on its foundations. The doorway slowly creaks taller. With an enormous shudder, the building winds down. As the building whirrs softly, the gnome motions Dedric to step in, in a frantic, gnomish fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedric steps in, staring noticeably all around the metallic hovel. There were all sorts of pipes and tubes, vats full of viscous liquid, robots, both powered on and inactive, kitchenware, a sickening amount of shoes, and various bottles of all shapes and sizes. The gnome leads him into yet another room. This room is empty, save and enormous turbine of sorts on the far wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedric feels a tug at his sleeve. He looks down to see the gnome handing him a pair of goggles. He puts them on. The gnome nods seriously and then flips and enormous switch. The machine turns on, rotating slowly at first, but soon it speeds up. The whole room feels as if it will tear itself in half. The machine clicks and sputters, but continues to rotate. Soon, when the noise and vibration seems enough to open a man's skull, the machine stops abruptly. A small dinging sound is heard, and a small clear chamber in the center of the device is filled with a clear liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome, removing his goggles, toddles over to the device, removes the vial, and then holds it out in Dedric's direction. \"Drink,\" states the gnome, plainly. Dedric rubs his linen vest nervously, also taking off his goggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink,\" repeats the gnome in the same exact tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with much hesitation, Dedric impulsively grabs the vial and gulps down its contents in a single motion.

As he scratches, he does not notice his hair falling off since he is too preoccupied with his nausea. Once he begins scratching his legs, he feels how smooth they are, he looks down at himself to find that his entire body, save the top of his head (and elsewhere, wink), is completely hairless and smooth. In shock, he moves one hand up to his face, only to feel that it too is completely smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also feels his jaw becoming less powerful, growing curvier and slimmer. Dedric feels his nose shrink on his face, it curves up slightly at the cusp. He reaches to touch his nose, but his fingers are intercepted by a pair of plump lips. He feels his muscly physique fade away. Finally, Dedric seems to understand what is going on. She feels her abdomen bump out with a few new organs inside. Panicked, he reaches a hand down his pants, but she does not find what she is looking for. \"Oh-- what in the name of Lordaeron!?\" she groans and then shrieks as she hears her voice. Her cloth training pants feel tight on her hips and rear. She doesn't notice nausea any more and she feels her hips with her hands as they continue to grow wider and wider. Her thighs widen with her hips, giving her a nice curvy bottom. It is at this moment that she felt her vest growing tight across her bust. Her breasts had been growing, but they had only just now filled up past where her pectorals had when she was a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedric's jaw drops when she sees her cleavage growing longer and deeper. Something blurs her vision and she brushes it back behind her ear, too focused on her breasts to pay any attention to her growing hair, which now begins to inch down her neck. She grabs her boobs and squeezes them in sheer disbelief. Dedric finds she can't help but moisten her lips as she feels the soft, firm breast tissue filling her hands. The rough linen tickles her nipples as her bosom continues to expand. The top button of her vest pops and her breasts jiggle outward, freed of that small constraint. The shoulder fabric of her vest slips down her slim shoulders, each strap picking a height to rest on her upper arms. Her pants creak as her butt grows round and firm. Just as her breasts seem to near the size of her head, her body ceases growing. Brown hair tickles her bare shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He had participated in a few notable dungeon raids, and even helped a group make an ultimately failed run at the force that kept ressurecting the ancient evils that inhabited these dungeons.  (He knew that this made things difficult for Azeroth, but honestly, he didn't mind it all that much.  It allowed more people to get a chance at glory, and made for interesting tales at taverns.)  But despite all that, Rory didn't have any noteriety.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd honestly?  He preferred it that way.  It allowed him and his pet tiger, whom he named Bruticus, to live on their own without the Alliance pestering him to join their 'righteous crusade against the Horde.'  He didn't believe in fighting people that didn't do anything to him personally, and the Horde hadn't really affected anyone he knew, much less cared about.  So fuck the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCurrently, he was on a solo adventure with Bruticus, investigating a hidden shrine he had heard rumors about.  It was supposed to be a shrine dedicated to a god with bizarre sexual tastes.  It was ridiculous, so he had to check it out, if only for the laughs.  As they approached, Rory began to worry.  There were no monsters, no critters, nothing to stop them from entering the temple through the front door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBruticus growled nervously.  Rory agreed.  Something was very wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey entered the temple, hidden away in a deep cave... and stared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe whole place was a shrine to sex and sexual fetishes.  There were shrines featuring displays of all sorts of fetishes, some Rory could recognize, some he couldn't.  Many of them had small idols, although most were missing.  As they walked deeper into the temple, crossing the threshold, a booming voice started talking, Rory yelping and panic firing at nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"YOU WHO COME SEEKING DESIRE, I NGG'THAREN THE LUSTFUL BID YOU GREETINGS,\" the voice, sounding like a deep female voice, rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRory paled, recognizing the style of name as similar to that of Cth'un and Yogg-Saron.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"INDEED,\" the voice said, reading Rory's thoughts, \"THOSE ARE MY BROTHERS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Eeeeep,\" Rory moaned, having gone out of his way to avoid those quests.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"FEAR NOT,\" Ngg'Tharen said, \"FOR I MEAN AZEROTH NO HARM.  TO THOSE WHO ENTER MY TEMPLE, I OFFER A GIFT: ONE IDOL, AND ONLY ONE.  IT SHALL ALLOW YOU TO INDULGE YOUR GREATEST, MOST PERVERSE DESIRES WITHOUT ANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO YOUR BODY.  THERE ARE NOT MANY LEFT, TO BE SURE, BUT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND THIS PLACE IF THERE WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT APPEALED TO YOU.  TAKE AN IDOL, AND ONLY ONE IDOL.  THEN LEAVE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRory blinked, and looked around as the voice faded.  He felt a sense of calm overtake him, and began to look at the statues.  He knew he had some weird fetishes, and decided to just accept this as the opportunity  Ngg'Tharen presented it to be.  He looked around, his eyes settling on two shrines, one beside the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn one shrine was the image of a man with hundreds of heavily pregnant women around him.  The idol itself looked like a statue of a human woman with a massive pregnant belly and milk-bloated breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe other shrine held an image of a man swallowing a woman whole, while another roasted on a spit.  The man's belly was already bulging out with women he had swallowed, and a woman cut up and served on a platter was on a nearby table.  The idol was of a woman tied up with a spit through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRory's eyes widened.  He had fantasized about both these things, consuming women and knocking them up.  But he could only take one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhich would he take?</span></div></div>",

But the more appealing fantasy to him was the consuming one... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe hesitantly reached out, grabbing the statue of the Carnivore, which turned into a beam of light that merged with both he and Bruticus.  Ngg'Tharen's voice began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"AN EXCELLENT CHOICE,\" it said.  \"NOW ALL THE WOMEN OF AZEROTH, NO MATTER THEIR RACE, ARE PREY FOR YOU AND YOUR COMPANION.  SPINES, HORNS, NORMALLY UNPALATABLE ENERGIES, VIRUSES, NOTHING CAN HARM YOU NOW.  NO MATTER THE SPECIES, YOU CAN SWALLOW THEM WHOLE AND DIGEST THEM.  EVEN FULLY GROWN DRAGONS CAN BE SWALLOWED AND DIGESTED INTO YOUR STOMACH, EVEN THE UNDEAD, EVEN GODDESSES!  FOR THE STATUE OF THE CARNIVORE GRANTS THE HOLDER THE POWER OF THE ALL-CONSUMING!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRory shivered, feeling a strange power taking hold in him.  He grinned as Ngg'Tharen described his new abilities.  He had always wondered what female flesh tasted like, but knew that he could never get a hold of it... until now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe blinked, another thought occurring to him.  \"It'll be a little hard to get at, say, Alexstrasza...  I mean, I'm just a Hunter.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"THE STATUE OF THE CARNIVORE MAKES YOU THE PERFECT HUNTER.  IF YOU DECIDE THEY ARE FOOD, THEN NO FORCE ON EARTH CAN STOP YOU FROM CLAIMING THEM.  YOU CAN EVEN FORCE DRAGONS INTO HUMAN FORM IF YOU DESIRE.  AND SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP ALEXSTRASZA...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRory blinked in confusion.  Ngg'Tharen chuckled, the sound sending chills up his spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"KILL THE WIELDERS OF THE OTHER STATUES TO GAIN THEIR POWER.  YOU WILL KNOW THEM WHEN YOU SEE THEM.  ONE OF THEM IS THE STATUE OF THE SNUFFER, OF THE DEATH FETISHIST.  THE SNUFFER HOLDS THE POWER TO RESSURECT THE DEAD EVEN FROM THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF THEIR BODY.  SUCH AS, SAY, DIGESTION...  SYLVANAS TRIED TO CLAIM IT, BUT I REFUSED TO GIVE IT TO HER, AS IT WASN'T A SEXUAL FETISH FOR HER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRory grinned, understanding.  \"I can get repeat meals, then?  Awesome.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"GO,\" Ngg'Tharen rumbled, \"AND ENJOY.  THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD ARE YOUR FOOD NOW.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRory, extremely pleased as to where this was going, left with Bruticus, planning the first meals for himself and his companion.  He decided to wait until he had found the bearer of the Snuffer first... It'd probably be an Undead, most likely, or someone who worked with them.  Either way, things were going Rory's way now...</span></div></div>",

To the untrained eye, this might give someone the impression that you were a great wizard unraveling the mysteries of world. But a magic wielder would merely laugh at you, for most of the writings were no more than basic spells of the level of a child. It pained you to admit the truth, but the fact was that you were bad at arcane spells. Really bad. Bad enough to be expelled from the Mage Tower while practicing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow and damnation,\" you muttered to yourself as you reread the same \"Baby's first spell\" book for the hundredth time. \"It should be simple enough! I understand the basics! Why can't I get this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fit of frustration, you chucked the scroll across the room, burying your head into your hands to compose yourself. After a few deep breaths to calm yourself down, you stood with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's try this again. Only something simple. Blink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blink spell was one that you could see any mage doing in the Trade District simply because of the mobility it granted them. As the name suggested, it was as if you had blinked and suddenly teleported a few yards in front of you. The truth of the spell was a little more complex, but no more difficult to comprehend than summoning a fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a mage casted Blink, he was essentially converting his body temporarily into light particles. This was a simple enchantment that would literally only last one second, but a second was enough time for light to travel a fair distance. Since the mage wasn't really light particles, the distance traveled wouldn't be nearly as far, but it was enough to escape the crushing stomp of a giant's feet or skip over a small river. Being made of light particles also meant you could travel though anything, or anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn theory, it was quite simple. For you on the other hand...Well, the last time you tried it, you ended up getting stuck in between a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time was going to be different, you could feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your mana flow to your feet, as you read to do, aimed for the far wall, closed your eyes and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>FWWOOOOOM</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything whizzed by you and new sounds greeted your ears. You opened your eyes and discovered that you were now standing outside your apartment on the city streets. The spell had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, no one was around to see your stupid little victory dance. No one yet, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" you said, returning to your focus back to your apartment wall. \"Let's bring this on back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you saw someone approach, but you were too focused with the spell that you paid no attention to them.

They had taken up residence in the nearby pond just outside the palace and mostly kept to themselves, but were generally very friendly. From what you saw, this pandaren looked very young and was one of the redish ones with long tails. She didn't seem to notice you either until you both heard your spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>FWWOOOOOOOM</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same whizzing sensation happened again, only this time you felt yourself collide into something hard. When you opened your eyes again, you were back on the floor of your apartment. The pandaren girl was nowhere in sight, to your relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew,\" you said to yourself, grateful that nothing had gone wrong with the Blink. You wiped the sweat from your brow, only something was off. Your nails were sharper than before, and they cut the tip of your eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch, what the-?\" you said, only now realizing that your voice a touch higher pitched than usual. You glanced down at your hands and, to your horror, saw what had scratched your face. In fact, looking down you saw that your nose was further from your face than it had been a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling for the one mirror in your room, you noticed every thing looked a bit smaller, like you had grown. When you reached your reflection you saw not the scrawny young human male, but a large, beautiful pandaren girl staring right back at you. You reached for your nose, and saw the girl do the same in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no,\" you muttered, touching every single part of your new body to make sure this wasn't a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had gotten so big and fluffy, as you had several new assets dragging you down. You were definitely pudgy, even for a pandaren, with wide hips and a large stomach from generations of beer-drinking. Strangest of all was the fur though. You were a red panda, so you had golden brown fur that covered every single itch of your new body save your paws. You reached around the back and played with your tail slightly before hugging yourself. You felt so warm like this, like you had been transformed into a gigantic teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the mirror, you saw that the only remnants of your human form were the tattered robes your panda body now wore and a few strands of blue hair jutting across your eyes. You reached up to play with the discoloration only to be greeted by a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What have you done with my hair?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped back, startled by the sudden outburst and thinking someone had broken into your apartment. Glancing around revealed only the mountains of books and paper left by your studying. Even the door was still locked shut, the way you had left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well? Say something, you body-thief!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was much more distinct this time and you recognized the accent as pandaren. Though talking to yourself might sound crazy to an onlooker, it was the only thing you could to answer the accusing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hi? Is that all you can say for yourself? Or myself? Or whoever the blight you are?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa. Calm down,\" though her words were angry, her tone sounded panicked as would be expected. \"First off, introductions before we go off accusing people. My name is Jaric, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pandaren voice paused for a moment before answering, no doubt trying to calm down. <i>\"Nashinji. Nashinji Boulderpaw.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Nash,\" you carefully gave her a nickname to try to be friendly. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do you mean? I'm right here.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Right here, standing in this rundown apartment.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were annoyed at that comment about your home, but let it slide for now. \"Can you move at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, my body is moving all on its own. I'm guessing that's your doing? Are you mind controlling me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no priest and you wouldn't be aware of your actions if I was. No, this is something completely different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What then?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored answering her question and instead put your arcane mind to work. The Blink spell had clearly worked as you ended up in your apartment, but Nashinji had wandered in front you as soon as you casted it. She must have gotten caught up in the spell when your body was light particles. This would only mean one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What?\"</i> She was sounding impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we...Fused together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fused!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, from the spell I cast. See, when you walked in front of me, you interrupted the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't care about that!

I don't know how separate two living beings from each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then learn!\"</i> you had done nothing to calm her down. <i>\"Or find someone who knows!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, it was the early evening and most people had stepped out to have dinner with their families. This was good, considering anyone who saw you would have noticed a bumbling panderan female stumbling around and trying not to \"bounce\". There were parts of you that you didn't even know jiggled with all the extra blubber you had on now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stop that,\"</i> she said noticing that you were cupping yourself to prevent the bouncing. <i>\"You're embarrassing me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored her, not wanting to cement the weirdness of the sight by talking to yourself and eventually found yourself at the mage's tower door.

He also had a pair of spectacles which glared white as he looked up at you from his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello young lady,\" he said with a coy smile under his facial hair. \"What brings you to this old conjurer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Torg, it's me. Jaric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm smile and kind look disappeared in an instant, as the true familiar face of your master came into light. \"What did you do this time, boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This time?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored Nash and immediately launched into an explanation of the events that had just happened moments ago. All the while, the master stared at you with the same tired expression though he continued to nod along. By the end of it, he had his head in his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in Azeroth did you manage to fail in the most basic of arcane spells, Jaric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That was a BASIC spell? And you call yourself a mage?\"</i> Nash snarkily commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need any comments from you,\" you growled low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" asked your teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" you replied. \"The pandaren, Nashinji, whose body I'm in is still present in my mind. It really is like we just fused together. Do you have any ideas on how to fix this, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old wizard stroked his beard, making it clear he was still very disappointed in you but giving the matter some serious thought. After a moment of silence, he said. \"I don't have a clue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What!?\"</i> Nash shouted in your head, making your ears twitch. <i>\"You mean I'm stuck like this forever!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, retained a calmer attitude. \"There is no solution to fix this, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are aware, it is simple to separate an inanimate object from a living being because there's no risk of losing something from the object. Ripping apart two living beings from one, however, is a complicated matter. You could end up missing some vital components like organs, or even your soul...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voiced trailed, tempting you to keep silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...However...\"</span></div></div>",

Ironically, it also houses some of the darkest spells in history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what you're saying is the spell to fixing our problem lies in Dalaran?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, or perhaps someone knows of a way to reverse the fusing. Dalaran is home to the greatest wizards in Azeroth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Great, let's go.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ready to agree with Nashinji, but there was the more important question on your mind. \"How do I get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, normally I could teleport you there with no issues. But, due to recent events concerning the Horde, Jaina Proudmoore has banned all magical travel into the city for safety. This means you'll have to physically travel there by boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By boat? Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master had a look of pity in his eyes. \"Why, in Northrend, my boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So, let me get this straight,\"</i> Nash went over the plan with you once again in your head. <i>\"We're going to have to go all the way up north, to the roof of the world, in order to change us back?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it anymore than you do,\" you whispered to yourself as you carried along your bag of books down the dark city streets. \"Northrend is the land of the dead, full of unnatural horrors and bitter cold wind that can pierce to your bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And we're taking a cheap, run-down boat to get to this desolate place?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the best I could afford with my savings, I'm not rich after all. What about you? I don't see you contributing any cash to our predicament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pandaren scuffed in your mind. <i>\"A monk does not need worldly possessions.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we don't get a fancy boat to take us. We're lucky enough as it is to find sailors still willing to go to Northrend. After the War with the Lich King, there has been little need to venture into the land of the dead unless you have a death wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, you heard some genuine concern in Nash's voice. <i>\"Is it really that dangerous there?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only heard stories, but they have all sent shivers down my spine. The land is secure enough that so long as we stay on the roads, we should be fine. But I'm not going to take any chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were referring the pouch you had packed after the meeting with your master. Every spell scroll, weapon, adventuring supply, and survival kit you had acquired as a mage apprentice was jammed into the small backpack now weighing your back (thought countering the new weights on your chest). You had also gathered some warmer clothing for the colder weather, though Nash insisted that with your fur you would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, there you were, prepared to go on your adventure to the frozen north and waddling to the Stormwind docks at midnight where the ship you had hired eagerly awaited you. This was not how you imagined your first trip to the famous Dalaran city to play out, but you couldn't help but feel some excitement at the journey ahead as you stepped aboard the creaky old sailboat. The crew welcomed you and offered a small bedroom below deck, which you gladly accepted. The events of today had tired you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you changed for bed, Nash expressed her annoyance as you eyed your new bear body in the mirror. <i>\"Don't stare at me like that, you pervert.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my body now too, and I'm not happy about this situation either. Just deal with it, we'll be in Dalaran in a couple of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just shut up and go to sleep.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked to yourself, rubbing your fuzzy belly as you slumped into the ragged linen bed. \"As you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you passed out into a restful sleep, no thanks to the big warm body you inhabited. But this boat ride was going to be anything but restful for you...</span></div></div>",

The fall hit you hard in the head and you grasped it in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ow...What are you doing, you idiot?\"</i> ask Nash with a groggy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so if I feel pain, you feel it too. That's weird,\" you mused aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Terrific...,\"</i> she replied. <i>\"Now, will you shut up and listen?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little annoyed at how cranky Nash was first thing in the morning, making a note of that for later days, before turning your attention to the sounds coming above deck. It sounded like shouting and fighting, with swords clanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How safe is this passage you booked us?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safety wasn't exactly an issue at the time, so I have no idea...\" you muttered, struggling to wake up more and collect yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You useless idiot, you boarded us on a boat that was a prime target for pirates!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"pirates\" immediately got up. You jumped to your feet, or paws as it were, and gathered through your things, grabbing the most essential items you could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Remember my staff,\"</i> Nash warned, forcing you to grab it before you headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hold of the ship was a mess with crates in complete disarray, everyone must have been fighting on the top deck to repel the boarders. You slipped around the fallen debris and made your way to the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside was like hell on earth. Fires covered the deck where explosive cannonballs had landed and every sailor was engaged in a sword duel with the rugged looking pirates. You recognized the crimson sails of the pirate ship docked next to your sailboat, the Bloodsail Pirates. You were so busy gapping at the spectacle that you didn't notice a pirate slip behind you, ready to cut you down with his cutlass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Watch out!\"</i> cried Nash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last moment, you jumped to the side, allowing the pirate's sword to get caught in the wooden boards of the deck. Without thinking, you prepared to cast the simplest spell you had mastered to take care of him. Frostbolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou summoned the coldest elements you could think of and melded it into a solid form, before sending it straight into the gullet of the ugly pirate. As he went flying back into the ocean, Nash sounded agape in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What did you do?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frost magic,\" you exclaimed. \"Master said for an apprentice, my skills in it as second to none. It's just arcane spells that confuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Huh, and here I thought you were a flunkie.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took her callous remarks as a compliment, though your spell had attracted the attention of some other pirates who now saw you as a clear threat. Two of them charged at you and you prepared your next spell. Ice Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo spear-like icicles shot from your hands and punctured the first pirate in the chest, causing him to gag up some blood. Unfortunately, the second Lance missed it's mark and the second pirate rammed into you the sail's pole. The attack made your vision blur as you lost feeling with the rest of your body. The pirate raised his cutlass, prepared to deliver the killing blow. But before he could, a staff pounded him across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take care of things now.\" said a voice you only recognized in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait,\"</i> suddenly your voice was back its normal male tone only more echoed. <i>\"Nash, you're controlling the body?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it,\" she said as she took your body and karate chopped the man in the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very surreal event to see your body move on its own, you were still viewing things from within your head it was just another person in control. Nash was extremely graceful in her movements and flowed around the battlefield trying to get into a lifeboat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We're getting out of here?\"</i> you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight,\" she replied. \"I'm not sticking around to get killed. We'll go for the first landmass we see and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trailed as the cannons of the pirate ship aimed at you. They must have stopped your attempt at escape and weren't about to let anyone live to tell the tale of their plundering. Nash could only stand by dumbfounded as the pirates lit the fuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Get in the ocean! Get down!\"</i> you tried to warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late. A fireball of epic proportions sent you flying backwards and splashing into the sea where only floating debris remained of the ship. Your vision blackened and you felt yourself sinking into the cold dark below the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not to be the end. You awoke...</span></div></div>",

It was a good thing too, because as your eyes readjusted to the light they detected movement all around you.

Yes, the costume shop was sounding better and better every second. You tried to remember where it was in the Trade District when you came a cross a large brightly colored sign on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zorgo's Costumes and Disguises.\" you read aloud, \"We have costumes of all shapes and sizes, if you're looking to disguise yourself as a gnome or a dragon!

It's flattened eyeless face was starting to creep you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Chirped Zorgo. \"Here, step into the changing rooms. You can pay once you're satisfied!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Once I'm satisfied, huh?\"</i> You thought to yourself as the gnome led you to one of the changing rooms in the back of the shop. It was small and dainty, dust was everywhere as well much like the rest of the store. Zorgo apparently didn't believe in living clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, questioning why you even bothered to try this. You hated costume, even if there was a bit of magic in this it probably wouldn't be that believable. But you couldn't just walk out now, you became stripping yourself naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit wasn't exactly large, as you had pointed out before. Though you were on the short side yourself, there would be no way you could fit into this thing, it looked like it was meant for a child. There didn't appear to be any entrances either other then the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing...\" You muttered, sticking one foot inside the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, the insides were warm and smooth much like actual skin. You discovered something else as well, the suit stretched like rubber. Effortlessly, you slid your legs inside until they rested comfortably in their appropriate areas of the costume. You wiggled your toes for good measure and looked down, a pair of tiny red toe nail painted toes wiggled back in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like stepping into a sack almost, you pulled the suit further and further up your body. Every corner seemed to rest comfortably on top of your body, you eventually reached the arms. With one hand, you held open the mouth of the suit and stuck the other arm inside, doing the same once the first arm was safely aligned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the head. Putting it on was like wearing a cowl, you grabbed the lower portion of the 'mouth' and pulled the top over your face. Everything went dark slightly as you realigned your eyes with the suit's sockets. The mouth of the suit apparently stuck on top of your own, as it didn't come lose when you released it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back slightly, you got a good look at yourself in the nearby mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" You said. The costume was flawless...You were at a complete lose for words. It really looked like there was a real actual blood elf standing in the changing room, even your eyes had begun to give an eerie greenish glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything to your satisfaction, miss?\" Called out Zorgo with a slightly smug tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Wow...This is incredible...Is this magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the finest, my dear. Are you still interested in purchasing it?\"</span></div></div>",

I've never met someone very attracted to my costumes except you, my young lady.\" He then continued, \"Now if you'd just wait in that booth, I'll be back very soon with your orders.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly strode in your new blood elf body. It's very similar to your old body, with a difference in the pointed ears and greenish glow that emanated from the eye sockets also a bit taller frame. However as you moved around, it was apparent that your new body is definitely more agile than your old one. You moved around the booth, which luckily didn't have too much visitors as most of the city's population would rather flock to the circus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your purple apprentice robe back and walked to the counter, where apparently had been laden out with various crumpled suits by Zorgo. Some you can recognize as human, tauren, dwarf and gnome. \"Ah, I see you've taken a liking to that suit, but please take it off when you are inside the city.\" Zorgo advised you as he brought back a couple more suits from his stock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I saw an orc walking outside your store some time ago.\" you ask Zorgo. He just sighed, \"Orc aren't exactly famous for their stealth or wit, so no orc would ever get into this kingdom and much less one walking without fear during the day. Blood elves however, are different, especially their rangers. You aren't exactly bright are you?\" He finished with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed by your question, you trudged back to the booth. \"Now, to release the suit you need to use a bit of magic, but I guess it'll be easy for you.\" Zorgo called out. He then asked you to memorize an incantation. \"To take it off, you must yank your hair hard and say the incantation, no need to be aloud, but must be audible to yourself.\" You did as you were told and found the suit was again a separate object from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was afternoon that finally your orders were completed. You saw the rays of sun setting from the glass window of the store. Aside from occasional oddballs peering from the front window, no one else entered the store. \"I guess common people do not appreciate my genius work, it might be the last time I will join a fair here.\" Zorgo sighed again. As you moved to the counter, he gleamed, \"So in here are the full package of every race in Azeroth, from each gender too!\" He then gave a chuckle as he handed you a bag stuffed full of skin-like suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid the amount, and the sound of cash register ringed in the store. \"Now allow me to present you with this, the latest work of Zorgo the Genius!\" he boastfully self-proclaimed himself. You just looked at him quizzically as he brandished two sets of suits, however, these suits doesn't have any hair or any shape at all, save for an almost recognizable humanoid appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later you found yourself outside the store, Zorgo had explained how the suits would work, including the new ones and his address as well! Not that you're going to go there in any moment. It seemed to be near a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with a bag full of suits, you walked back into your manor...</span></div></div>",

The gnome disappeared to the back of the store returning with what looked like a brown furry blanket. He unraveled it on the ground like a carpet to show it to you. Sure enough, the mass of fur had hooves, a tail, and horns just like a tauren would. But the thing looked ridiculously big, there was no way you would be able to make a convincing tauren in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say my girl?

Now, I'll let you try it on in the back. There should be a changing booth there. Here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe folded and handed the suit to you. You followed his instructions and went to the back of the shop. The booth was more like three boards stuck together with a curtain nailed to the front, but it was better than nothing. You began to unfold the costume and found it's face. You stared into the empty eye sockets and laughed. It looked like someone skinned a tauren and used it as a costume. But it was so warm too, it was like the skin was a living entity. You rolled your eyes at the thought of what Zorgo said. \"That is part of the magic of a Zorgo product!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I can't sense anything magical about this thing. He definitely just skinned a poor tauren and is selling it as a costume.\" you told yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't help but feel an urge inside you to try and wear it. Maybe it was the same feeling of amazement and wonder you felt when you first learned about magic and mages as a child. You wanted to believe that this would work deep down, and unfortunately it was enough to make you sigh and say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll try it on...but if I'm not convinced, I'm leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a zipper in the back of the costume which was already opened. The inside of the suit was soft and even warmer than the outside. You took off your clothing and placed it in a neat pile to the side, but not before making sure the costume vendor wasn't sneaking a peak at you through the badly formed booth. You took one step into the suit and felt the fur of the outfit rub softly against your legs. Your foot eventually hit the hoof below, which felt somewhat like a piece of hard wood. You then but your other leg in and repeated the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Not bad.\" you said, looking at yourself through the broken mirror in the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to stand on your toes to fill the legs out though which wasn't too difficult. You pulled the costume up to your waist which surprised was quite snug. The tail on the costume hung down from your butt. You giggled as you reached over and played with it some. You looked in the mirror. It was odd but, you could have sworn that this booth was bigger. Sure it wasn't huge to begin with but it seemed just a little smaller now. You shrugged and continued putting on the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to put your arms in the suit next. You decided to do both at the same time. The baggy arms of the costume gave a lot of room for you to maneuver your own arms in. Since Tauren had only three fingers you had to squeeze your index/middle and ring/pinky fingers together to fit them in the slots. But it was strangely comfortable. You looked at your hand and made a fist. It looked just like a tauren's now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the mask. Taurens had a very hunched over back making it a little odd to fit your head into the suit. You had to crane your neck out to reach the mask. You rested your chin within the suit's snout and you could at last see out of the eye holes. You looked in the mirror to adjust the mouth so it would not look so scrunched up. You almost looked like a real live tauren in the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should zip it up then.\" You felt down your back for the metal zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it closed you felt the air in the suit get warmer due to lack of ventilation. With a final \"ZIP!\", the gaping hole in the suit was all closed up and you could admire the costume in the mirror. You had to admit, the suit was very convincing as you twirled in front of your reflection. You could even see the snout of the mask in front of your face. And the fur made everything so nice and toasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad...I think I'll buy this...\" you said as you tugged the hair slightly, which hurt, \"Owww...Wait...Why does it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touched the suit's nose. But you could feel it. You pulled the suit's tail but you felt a sharp pain above your butt. When you opened your mouth, the suit did so too. The old gnome was right. The suit WAS magic. You were a tauren female. Panicking, you felt around the back and to your relief felt the metal zipper still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright in there? You're being awfully quiet, my girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Yea...Everything is...just...fine. Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exited the booth and saw Zorgo grinning from ear to ear. \"I told you it was magic, my girl. Well, what do you think? Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now towered over the small gnome, everything seemed so much smaller from a tauren's height. Even your body shape had shifted into the form of the tauren suit. You felt strong...powerful...and at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes....I think I do...How much did you say it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, tell you what. Since I think that costume suits you so well, I'll let you have it for free. I'll even throw in some tauren sized clothes for you. We can't have you walking around naked can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and realized that you were standing around exposed. You tried to cover yourself up but Zorgo just laughed.</span></div></div>",

Compared to Tia, you were walking like you had been drinking for several hours. She even paused several times and gave you funny looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay there new friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...Yea. Just the heat. I feel a little woozy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not from around here are you? That's natural for your first time here! Just keep your head forward and walk straight ahead. It's as easy as one, two- Oooops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to stifle your laugh as Tia tripped over her feet and landed face first in the dirt. As she lifted her head up she let out of a hacking cough you noticed a small wooden staff caught between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?!\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh...Yea. I just tripped over this weird wooden pole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed it to you. Most of the staff was withered wood, but there were slight incantations along the base. At the head sat a fearsome bird with its wings outstretched. It was the only piece of the rod that was colored and it glittered gold in the sunlight as you held it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a staff...Probably very old by the looks of it.\" You began to rant about it to Tia. \"I'd say it came from the era of the Highborn. Judging by it's condition though it was just dropped here recently, else it would have dried out from the sun and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Tia interrupted with a lost yet curious look. \"You see to know an awful lot about artifacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forgot that tauren culture did it's best to avoid magic. You had to think of an excuse. \"Oh yes...I spent time with the blood elves in Silvermoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that makes sense. What should we do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Probably nothing though. It's ancient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your human form, the staff would have gone up to your chest. However, as a giant tauren it was only as tall as your waist. You were even able to hold it in one hand with ease. Absentmindedly, you flicked it in the direction of Tia. A light blue bolt of energy blasted from the mouth of the bird right into her stomach. She gave a loud 'OMPH' and fell backwards right onto her butt, but otherwise seemed unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! Are you alright?!\" You asked as you ran over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Yea I'm fine. That was fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel okay? There are such things as cursed artifacts, we need to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai began to take it seriously now. She got to feet. \"Now that you mention it...A little lighter for some reason. Isn't that odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed something poking out of the stomach area of Tai's metal armor. It was her white fur. It looked almost like she had developed a bit of a pot belly. She noticed your staring, and looked down as well and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before your eyes, it slowly began to push its way out of Tia's armor. Leather scarps snapped under the budding pressure. Her entire lower chest-piece fell to the ground with a clunk, exposing a soft furry belly. Tai poked it in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels so...soft. And light too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and shook her hips, causing her ballooned tummy to wobble around. How she could handle such a situation so aloofly was beyond you. If your stomach had suddenly blown up you'd be freaking out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia I don't think you should be fooling around like that. Do you feel any different anywhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke her attention with her stomach and thought. \"Hmm, well...\"</span></div></div>",

Hopefully no one would notice it, even if they got to the Crossroads. At least Tia seemed to be enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks likes all it did was blow up your stomach. I'll look into the staff's power when we get to the Crossroads so we can change you back. Now...which way do we go from here?\" You wrapped the staff in a blanket and tucked it into your pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That way,\" She pointed west. \"And I kind of like this. It's so cool! You gotta try this when we get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just rolled your eyes. Never before had you met such a bubbly person in your entire life. You hoped that not all tauren were like this, considering Tia was your first encounter with a real one. If they were all were like her, you'd probably lose your mind in less than a month from the constant excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way. What's your name again? I feel sort of silly traveling like this without even knowing my companions name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding the staff, you had already forgotten you hadn't even come up with a name for yourself! You tried your best to remember some well known tauren names from books you read. \"Um...uh...Sar....Sara. Yea, Sara Runetotem. That's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked the light that you had found such a gullible companion. \"Ah, well it's a pleasure to be traveling with you Sara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the Crossroads took another hour. When you finally arrived, you felt both relieved and frightened beyond belief. It was a literal crossroads of all manner of Horde. Each and everyone of them probably had the power to rip your spine out and floss their teeth with it. Orcs, trolls, and even other tauren all gave glares to you and your partner as you went towards the inn. Thankfully, none of them had yet noticed Tia's girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this place the greatest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea...very cheery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went towards the tallest building in the camp, where you rented two beds for the night. Even though it was a mere hole in the wall with linen bedsheets, it was a pleasant sight compared to the desert and the rough seas you had endured for the past few days. You went to sleep instantly without even taking off your traveling equipment. The next day...</span></div></div>",

Despite having slept till nearly noon, you were cranky beyond all belief. You were so used to the wonderfully comfy beds at the mage quarters that sleeping on hard rock with raggedly sheets made you feel like a trogg. Looking around for Tia, you spotted her conversing with several Horde members. She still had her giant gut yet she gleefully chatted away with a female orc and male troll, both of whom looked completely bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed you approach. \"Oh Sara! Hi! Guys this is my new friend, Sara Runetotem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troll grunted a hello, the orc was a bit more chatty though. \"You seem rather weak for a warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm a spellcaster...like a druid.\" You answered shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc didn't seem too impressed though. \"No offense to you, but those who casts spells tend to be cowards. To fight at close range. To see the whites of your enemies eyes...That is true honor. I hate mages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...Uh, Tia we need to get going. We need to see the- uh- shaman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure Sara. Bye guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to practically drag her away from the table. The troll and the orc seemed rather glad you came to take Tia away, and they began to talk to each other. You walked outside with Tia and made sure you were out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Tia finally asked. \"Why do we need to see the shaman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot. I just made that up. What in the world are you doing talking to people like that?!\" You pointed to her stomach. \"What if we get caught?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Oh come on. I think it's cool. Besides no one noticed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted herself on the tummy. You sighed. \"Look, maybe we should see the head shaman. I can't make heads or tails about this staff. Who would that shaman be? I've never been here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that would be Sergra! Everyone thinks she's mean, but she's usually nice to me though. Come on I'll introduce you to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed you by the hand before you could react and dragged you through the rain. She was taking you to a large watch tower on the hill in the camp. Up the rickety ramps she carried you until she almost threw you in the face of a stern looking orc woman inside the hut at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc was busy cleaning a massive battle axe with oil. \"Who are you?\" She growled with a hint of anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia leaned into the small room with a grin. \"Heya Sergra! This is my new friend Sara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia? Hmm, you've...grown...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, we actually came to talk to you about that! I saved Sara from some raptor and then we found this weird stick and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou butted in. \"M-maybe I should explain. H-how do you do Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached your hand out but Sergra returned your greeting with a glare. \"Please make it quick. I do not have all day ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um y-yes...W-well we were headed through the Barrens and Tia h-happened to trip over this s-staff, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held out the rod and unwrapped it from the blanket. Sergra's angry eyes shifted to that of a surprised look. Gently, she grabbed it out of your hands. She lifted it up and examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please be careful with that,\" You said. \"I was fooling around with it last time and Tia ended up like that.\" You pointed to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I've seen this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you have? Where!? Is there a way to return Tia to normal again?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Sara, I like being like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet both of you.\" Sergra stood up and went outside. She pointed to the coast in the far East. \"Out on the Barren's coast is a fellow shaman encamped who studies water. She made the cure for when this staff had made an appearance in the Crossroads the last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a shifty blood elf character came through here a month ago and caused havoc with that staff. It took four squadrons of guards just to remove him from the encampment. Most of his victims ended up worse than Tia here. Why he would drop his main weapon of chaos is beyond me. It matters not though. I'll trust this with you, but do not test me. If you decide to pull a few pranks like he did...your hide will be my new cloak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"Y-yes, understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can head to the shore on some of the remaining kodos we have stabled here. Just mention to the keeper that I sent you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! More traveling! I'll meet you there Sara!\" Tia jumped off the tower and landed gracefully in the mud below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does she get the energy...\" You muttered under your breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to leave but Sergra grabbed you by the robe. \"Why are you traveling with Tia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I don't know. I met her in the desert and she helped me out, I guess. Plus I need to make things right considering I used the staff on her and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't judge her because of the way she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergra sighed. \"Listen, I knew Tia since she was a toddler. She had two wonderful parents, whom I was good friends with, and a house not far from here. But it didn't last. Her parents were killed when the Alliance raided from the north. She was left alone for all those years, not a single friend at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel guilty that she was orphaned by Alliance. \"You never once thought that she was a little odd? The way she acts so aloof and happy go lucky?\" Asked Sergra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I thought she acted a little strange at first but she's been nice...so I don't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since you were introduced to her, Sergra grinned. \"She's like a little sister to me. I was really frightened there for a moment when she came in here with that giant stomach. I thought she was pregnant...Please, promise you'll watch over her on this trip for me. We can call it even for the free kodo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back and nodded. Sergra shooed you away after that, and you went to meet Tia at the stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though you wished they had warned you in class how badly they stunk. Your gray kodo smelt like it had been rifling through the garbage. Tia gave her brown skinned one a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't they great?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly the word I would use. They certainly look...sturdy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kodo handler helped both of you onto the beasts. Tia had some difficult because of her stomach, but eventually she sat comfortably in the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay ladies,\" Said the keeper. \"Hang on tight. If you let go, there's a good chance it will be the last thing you ever do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask why, he smacked your kodo on the rump and it took off like a bullet. You nearly fell off from the speed of the monster. Tia's kodo was not far behind you. While you screamed in dumbfounded terror, Tia was laughing like a maniac. The two kodo ran down the road, kicking up clouds of dust thick enough to gag anyone passing through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a nearby hill, just outside of the Crossroads stood a cloaked figure. From under his hood pointed ears jutted out on his head. Because of the rain and darkness, most of his features were shadowed save for giant white grin stretched across his face. He watched the clouds of dust created by your kodo disappear in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an interesting pair...I can't wait to thank them for recovering my staff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to a giant purple bird with a saddle on it's back. He hopped comfortably into it, and charged down the hill down towards the trail you were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had finally stopped screaming. Partially it was because you were getting used to the speed of the kodo. But mostly because even opening your mouth a crack would cause a mouthful of sand to take up residence in your gaping piehole. Tia was still laughing like crazy, probably used to riding on kodo. Meanwhile you felt like you were going to be sick. Your kodo passed by hills of sand and trees like they were nothing. Between the blinding rain and ripping wind, you could not open the map and make sure you were heading in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia! How are we supposed to know we're going to the right place!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here already!\" She yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden stop and you went flying off your kodo. You braced yourself to hit hard dirt ground but instead landed in salty water. Gasping for air, you swam to the surface. Tia laughed, but gave you a hand to pull you to the shore. The kodo had stopped at a jutting piece of land at the edge of the sea. There was a large tent flaying in the winds near the shoreline. A warm glow resonated from within. Someone was home at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia threw a towel over your shoulders. \"This is the Tidus Stair! Come on, let's go met the shaman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soaked from horn to hoof, so you were of course looking forward to a warm fireplace. Inside the tent were two other tauren women, each dressed in bones and leather straps. They seemed primitive in every sense of the word. Expecting a cold greeting, you were surprised when they smiled at you and instead offered a warm welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings fellow tauren sisters. What brings you to our camp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou introduced yourselves and explained your situation. When showing them the staff you had found, they fondled it curiously before handing it back to you. The two women were called Mahren Skyseer and Islen Waterseer and were shaman that were very interested in it's properties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Spoke Islen. \"You need me to give you the cure for Tia's growth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please, if it's not any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all. In fact you may call it a reward for finding that trouble-making elf's staff. Just a moment, I'll go speak to the water spirits to get you the potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIslen got up and went outside to the sea. You took a sip of the herbal tea they had offered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be cautious from now on, both of you.\" Spoke the other tauren, Mahren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Do you think he's a dangerous man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had the battle hardened troops of the Crossroads in an uproar for an entire week with the mischief he created. He may only be a prankster, but he could be very powerful if he created something like this. All I'll say is if you ever encounter him in your travels, don't try to fight him. Just run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll be fine! Right Sara!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a weak yes. The last thing you needed on this dangerous spying assignment was an even more dangerous convict chasing you. Eventually Islen returned with several vials of blue liquid. She offered one to Tia and told her to only take a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to Sara...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia, we are not going to Orgrimmar with you like that. Now come on. We need to get to Razor Hill before nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned and took a small sip. Instantly, her belly began to rumble and shrink like it was losing air. In a matter of seconds Tia was back to normal, much to her disapproval. She sighed and poked her stomach where it had been a giant balloon just moments ago. You thanked the shaman for the cure and packed the potions next to the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tia,\" You said, stepping out into the rain. \"Where do we go for Razor Hill from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just north of here and across the river!\" She hopped on her kodo. \"Come on! Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

By the time you both crossed the bridge into Durotar, it was past dinner time and a symphony of stomach growls muted the stomping of the kodo. You grabbed the reins of your riding beast and pulled hard to make it stop. Thankfully it obeyed your command, and Tia stopped her mount as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way we're going to get to Razor Hill tonight Tia. Let's set up camp here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had brought tents and campfire equipment, in no time a well made camp was created on the side of the road. You collapsed on the ground as your stomach rumbled. Food had not been in your belly since the you left the boat to the Barrens. You hadn't eaten in days. Tia seemed to also be hungry as she looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving, want to get some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought food??\" You asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! What did you think we've been riding on this whole time?\" She pointed to her kodo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't be serious. \"Eat our mounts? Didn't say it was cute mere hours ago?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, but we're hungry now. And I don't think we can catch anything edible at this time of night.\" She grinned and held up an axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later you found yourself chewing on the giant leg bone of Tia's former mount. While you were content with just one leg, Tia had scarfed down the rest of the kodo before you could even finish it. She was already nearly asleep, patting her belly happily. Kodo tasted a lot like cow, only more rich. Still you couldn't help but feel that it was wrong to eat her mount. It was like eating someone's pet cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can finish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! I'll have it if you don't want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you possibly eat that much? You're going to make yourself sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"You wouldn't last a week in the Barrens. I can tell that much. You need to be prepared to do whatever it takes to survive including-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since you had met Tia, she had a serious look on her face. She stared behind you and looked like a dog would when it sensed someone coming in the distance. You turned around and caught a glimpse of a figure walking towards you in the darkness. When he finally came into light you nearly gasped. It was a blood elf, he had glowing green eyes and long yellow hair. There was a distinct blond goatee on his chin just below a massive grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening ladies,\" He spoke. \"I believe you have something of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, you cast the first spell that came to your mind. \"FIREBLAST!\" A bolt of fire launched at the elf's face. However, he was able to put his hand up to block it saving his face from the attack but badly burning his hand. Tia had already grabbed her bow and arrow, and fired a shot right at him. With a simple wave of his injured hand, the wooden arrow burst into flames before it even reached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now ladies, let's not get violent-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frost Nova!\" You yelled. A chilling wave of ice launched forward at the grinning elf, wrapping itself around his legs and preventing him from moving. You began to call forth more flames and aimed right for where he would be standing. \"Flamestrike!\" Cracks of red hot fire formed beneath the ground of ice. The grin on the elf's face finally disappeared when bursts of flame magic seeped out from the frost and swarmed around him. You were nearly out of mana at this point, so you prayed that it would be enough to stop him. Your heart sank when the flames cleared and the elf stood encased in a giant block of ice. He then let loose a giant wave of magic which allowed him to break free from your frost spell. You had to escape. There was only one thing that you had left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia! Run! Polym-\" You began to yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arcane Blast!\" He pointed at you and fired a bolt of purple energy right at your face. That was the last thing you remembered before hitting the ground.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last time you had felt like this was when you downed five pints of Thunderbrew as part of a bet. Your head was throbbing as you struggled to remember what had happened. You were inside your tent, it was still dark out but at least the rain had stopped. The sound of a suave male voice coming from outside your tent immediately made you jump up, as you recalled your fight with the blood elf before becoming unconscious. You torn open the tent flap and saw Tia conversing which the elf. She was shaking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tia Whitehide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you, my name is Joric Brightsky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently you had slept through something. \"Tia! What the hell is going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Sara! This is Joric. Joric, this is Sara Runetotem, the friend traveling with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia I don't care about that! He attacked us! Why are you even talking to him!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoric cleared his throat. \"Forgive me for interrupting my tauren friend, but it was you that cast the first spell when I calmly approached you. I only struck back in self defense. Speaking of which, how's your head? I tried to hold back as best as I could so I wouldn't harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt around your forehead and grabbed a linen bandage. Had he put that on? \"Um..yea...I feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You took me by surprise there. I would not have expected a tauren to know anything about mage spells.\" He showed his left hand, which was burned and covered in a heavy bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Tia? He's a nice person.\" Which was true, you supposed. If he was really dangerous, you both would have probably been dead by now. He sat down next to the glowing campfire and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that introductions are out of the way. Would you be so kind as to return my latest piece of artwork?\" He motioned to your backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pack opened by itself. Out flew the staff wrapped in the blanket. It unraveled itself and gently landed it your hands. You decided to ask a few questions before handing it over. \"Artwork? You call this cursed item art!? And why should I return it to you!? You were the one who caused havoc in the Crossroads for days right? Who's to say you won't do it again if I return it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one ever understands my art...,\" He muttered. \"Listen, it has been a passion of mine to create ways to make people...bigger. I suppose you can call it perverse, most do, but I enjoy doing it. That staff was the newest and greatest method for doing so I had ever invented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared into your eyes with his soft emerald ones. \"What happened at the Crossroads was an accident. I was just experimenting with the staff and it went completely out of control. I was lucky to escape from there with my life as a matter of fact...Look, all I'm asking is you give me the staff and we go our separate ways. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why should we hand this over? I still don't trust you. We can just report you to the authorities.\" You glared at the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely chuckled. \"Because if you do...Perhaps I might let slip a few details concerning your own identities. You wouldn't like that, would you? Sarah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. Impossible! There was no way he could have known about you really being a human! Tia gave you a concerned look and asked. \"What does he mean Sara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf laughed again and said. \"Oh it's nothing you should worry about Tia, now come. You're heading to Orgrimmar yes? I can show you a quicker route as payment for-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA steel tipped arrow pierced right through Joric's right shoulder.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A female orc calmly walked over to the fallen elf, another arrow was strung and aimed right for his head. Something about her seemed familiar to you...She was the orc girl that Tia was talking to at the inn at the Crossroads! She came in striking distance of Jaric and the pulled out two large axes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again Tia, I'm glad I decided to follow you two. I thought something was suspicious about that swollen stomach of hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia was completely confused. \"You!? But wait! I know what Joric did was bad, but he didn't mean to do it right Joric? It was an accident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc scuffed. \"I don't care about what happened at the Crossroads.\" She kicked Joric in the ribs. \"All I care about is getting revenge for my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swing her axe down at his head, but he quickly but up a barrier of mana. You knew how draining such a spell was, it would not last long even if he was a skilled mage. Joric used the same spell he did on you and set the orc woman flying back. However, she was able to stand right back up. Giving a fearsome battle cry, she charged right at him. Joric turned to you and yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The staff! Give me the staff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had little time to think about it and quickly tossed him the wooden rod. He caught it and firmly aimed it at the orc warrior. The same light blue blast shot from the bird's mouth, only this time it was much stronger and lasted longer. Once again, the orc was throw back. She landed in the dust and slowly got up before realizing what was about to happen to her. She reached out at Joric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...You bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off though, as she grasped her metal tunic in pain. You correctly guessed that her stomach was growing underneath her armor. That wasn't all though. Everywhere was growing on her. You watched with interest as her reasonably sized bosom began to inch forward in cup size. Her hips swelled outward slightly, making her equipment look unbearably tight on her. This of course restricted her movements and she couldn't run over to have Joric stop the process. It looked like someone had given her armor several sizes too small. Tia took this time to help Joric to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joric...Did you really do that to her sister?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoric stared coldly at the ground. \"I needed someone to test it on. She volunteered...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery second filled the orc up with a massive amount of air. Her clothes groaned under the stress and pressure. You also noticed that she had become considerably taller. Spots of green skin were visible through the cracks of the ripping armor. It looked like she was hiding a kodo in her shirt. Her toes now poked out from her chain boots. She had long given up trying to attack Joric and was busy prying open her extremely tight armor. Eventually she succeeded and her contained body swelled outwards with a flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how big will she get?\" You asked Joric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dusted himself off and admired his handy work. \"Just enough so she'll float away and won't be a bother to us anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers now resembled overcooked sausages and her cheeks puffed with air. \"Will she be okay like this? I mean she could be floating for days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoric chuckled as the orc girl tried desperately to cover her exposed self. \"She could indeed. But the landing is completely safe. And the air provides you with all the nutrients you'll need while in the sky. You'll just be starving when you land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains Tia eating an entire kodo...\" You thought to yourself. The orc's head was inflated as well as the rest of her body. She towered over the three of you like a blimp. However, she still maintained a distinct feminine shape. She had curves beyond belief, but she just looked like an overinflated orc balloon. Even a balloony shine radiated on her skin. There was a change of expression in the girl's face from anger to fear, she looked down at her ballooned toes. You wonder what was wrong, but then you noticed that her feet were several inches off the ground. The twenty foot tall orc balloon was beginning to float away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you for this!\" Cried the angry girl, though the threat was somewhat dismissed by her squeaky voice. \"This is why I hate mages! When I get back you're dead at first sight! You hear me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will.\" Laughed Joric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc was rising faster now, floating over the heads of you. She sailed away into the night sky, stomach first, uttering every curse word imaginable at the laughing elf. Soon she was a green speck in the starry overhead. Joric clapped his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's that. To Orgrimmar, right ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Joric was greeted by replies from both of you at once. \"Why did you do that to her?!-That was cool Joric!-I don't trust you with that staff!-Can you do that to me?!-Something like that should be illegal!-Please?! Pretty please!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe covered his ears. \"Ladies, ladies...please one at a time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen elf!\" You jabbed a finger in his face. \"You even point that thing at me and I'm breaking it in half!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. Tia, how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like a blast! Can you please try that on me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" He smirked. \"At least someone appreciates my art. But let's not discuss this now Tia. Let's focus at the task on hand. You ladies both have a mount, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, but Tia's stomach growled. \"We kinda...Had to eat mine...\" She laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. \"Well that's no good. We'd be able to make it to Orgrimmar before daybreak if we ride...But now it might take much longer...And neither of you can fit on my bird. Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began pacing the ground in thought, staff still in hand. Looking down at it, a grin suddenly grew across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news Tia. You may get to try the staff out much sooner than I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was slowly peaking over the horizon as a purple hawkstrider and a gray kodo carrying you and Joric jumped from rock to rock. There was a long rope tied to your kodo's harness which trailed all the way up to the sky, like you were carrying a balloon. Joric looked back at you and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay there cow-girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so wrong on so many levels...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lighten up. Just be thankful it doesn't take two days to get there. Besides, Tia seems to be enjoying herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes and looked up in the sky. The rope led to a huge blimp-like white furred tauren girl, and tied itself around her tail. Tia was at a much bigger size than the orc girl, and flew through the air like bird. A giant balloon bird. Like the orc, she still had a feminine shape but was just huge all over. She had her arms outstretched and was laughing uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked between her giant breasts and called down to you. \"Hey Sara! You gotta try this!\"</span></div></div>",

He was a bit creepy when discussing his 'art', but at the same time he wasn't thrill crazy like Tia. Nevertheless, you tried to keep the topics of conversations on magic and spells, which he shared a deep interest in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was quite surprised to see a tauren of all things casting mage spells! But then of course, you aren't really a tauren are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thankful that Tia was high enough so that she wouldn't hear this. \"How do you know me? The real me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoric just grinned. \"I have my ways. Don't worry though, I have no interest in serving the Horde. Nor do I have any interest in ratting you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he provided you with a small comfort. It felt good getting that secret off your chest. Even if the person you were revealing it too was an elf who had odd tastes. Joric pointed ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look. Orgrimmar, the orc warrior city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the rising run was a large orange canyon. At the entrance stood a formidable wall of white solid rock, complete with logs as support and giant watchtowers on both sides. The only door was a small opening at the base of the wall. Even in distance, the metal of the gates and chains gleamed. You heard the sounds of a loud horn, followed by gruff shouting coming from over the canyon. Inside lay the largest population of Horde in all Azeroth. The thought of entering such a place gave you shivers. Still, you couldn't help but be impressed by the magnificence of its appearance. Tia probably had the best view out of the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" She called out from above. \"I can see Orgrimmar from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on Tia! We're going to get you down now! Joric, there's a spell to undo this. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Certainly, one moment. Let me get the reagents for it.\" He reached into his pack. Suddenly, his face went pale. \"Uh oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What uh oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed the back of his head and laughed slightly. \"It seems...I am out of Blowrock dust....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? Is that bad?\" You asked with ever growing concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Without it we'd have to wait for Tia to lose air. That could take weeks. I can't undo the spell without it. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you were hearing. \"Weeks?! W-what about the potions we got from those shaman! Won't those work?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they would...But you sort of crushed them when I knocked you out during our fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took every ounce of your mage training to not panic, and not punch Joric in the face. \"Okay...okay....And where would we GET Blowrock dust?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I usually purchase it from a vendor in Orgrimmar. However, he's left for Thunderbluff the entire week.\" He started to laugh nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just poke a hole in her or something?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be ridiculous. She'd explode and then where would we be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any BETTER suggestions?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact I do. There is a large quantity of the stuff underneath Orgrimmar itself, within an underground cave called Ragefire Chasm. Of course, the cave is now a lair for a bunch of cultists. Meaning acquiring the dust will be slightly...difficult...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Tia, who was freely floating in and the air and completely unaware of the situation, you sighed. How did you always get into these situations?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only for Tia's sake though! You need to promise to never use that thing again unless you have a sure fire way to get here back to normal!

I'll let our floating friend know the plan then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being early in the morning, Orgrimmar was bustling with activity. You had never seen such a sight before. Hunters proudly hung their freshly caught prey to sell for food. Loud auctions were heard on the street from the nearby auction house. There were even Horde sitting on the roofs of buildings, communing with each other and taking in the morning air. Every building was decorated with lovely spikes and barbs. The whole city looked like it was ready for war. Crowds of heavily armed orcs and trolls stomped passed you as Joric motioned you to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay close to me. This is an even rougher place than the Crossroads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to tell you twice, for at that very moment a badly beaten tauren male was tossed out of a nearby bar. He pleaded with you to help him but you ignored him and stepped over his bruised body. Much to your relief, Joric was leading you to a sect in the canyon covered with giant drapes from above. This provided some well needed shade from the sun, but you didn't dare stop to rest. Foul looking humanoid creatures lingered in the shadows of buildings, eying you as you passed by. They were undead, part of the Forsaken that joined the Horde after the Third War.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoric led you down the row of shadowy buildings and into the very center of the city. It was a large crevice filled with tents. A strange purple light shone from the braziers littered around the hole. At the edge of the canyon was a large cave entrance. Inside you spotted cracks of lava, a sweltering wave of heat rushed at you. It was safe to say this was the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoric smiled as he wiped his brow. \"Well this is it. Be on your guard. There's no telling what we'll find in there.\"</span></div></div>",

It would be awhile before classes would end, so it was just you alone in an empty room with an odd costume. You were completely bored at this point so you picked up the costume to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well...,\" You said to yourself. \"I mean, who's going to know right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took off your robes and tossed them aside. The dwarf suit was just as stretchy as when Zorgo gave it to you. Of course there was no zipper on it so you had to enter through the mouth, which felt a little like you were being eaten by the costume. The suit stretched to your own proportions, you looked in the mirror and saw a comically tall dwarf staring right back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got to hand it to Zorgo,\" You muttered. \"He makes a pretty damn convincing outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in you felt weird though. A tingling of sorts that spread throughout your body. You felt off balance as you reached out to your bed to support yourself, grabbing it much sooner than you would normally have. You looked around and noticed that everything was steadily growing around you. At first you thought that you might have accidentally casted some sort of spell but you were instantly proved wrong when you felt your body begin to reshape itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you decreased in height, every part of your body began to shrink with it except your thighs and breasts.

You felt like you were drifting into a deep sleep and you could hardly keep your eyes open. Something was attacking your sub conscious, and you felt a sort of second presence inside of you.

It just so happens that during my travels I came across a wee gnome magician. He claimed to have discovered a map leading to lost treasures in some nearby ruins so being foolishly greedy I decided to help him in his quest. Sure enough, there was treasure in those old ruins. But the cur double crossed me and cast a curse on me, changing me into a wearable costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gears in your head were being to turn. \"You mean...that Zorgo guy was-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct lass, he was the magician I met long ago. I've been traveling the world with him all this time. He's devilishly clever and has been casting the curse on others to turn them into costumes like myself for profit and a good laugh. He's pure evil, he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then...why do you not have him fix this now that you're back to normal! Together you and I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have absolutely no desire to get myself cursed by that gnome again lass. I was with him for 100 years, I know what he's capable of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's all the more reason why we can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga put her hand to her chin in thought. Eventually...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though the humans and Horde are not battling as fiercely as before, but they are still trying to get the upper hand of each other. Humans now fortified their castle walls with Light magic structure and energy which purifies the undead, and sending their soul to the heavens, thus preventing resurrection of undead by the Horde's necromancers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, just as luck has it, you, s the most cunning of demons despite just being a few centuries old, you are assigned to penetrate the defenses of the Alliance, spy upon them and if probable, tip the condition to the Horde's advantage. It's a hard mission. No undead ever approach the settlements since the Light structure is built, let alone to know what is happening inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought upon this for a while, investigated the outskirts of the castle, then thought up of a perfect plan. The Light structure, although dangerous to undead, but will only weaken a demon like you. You waited. Waited for the day, when it is the time where merchants and circus would flock into the city. The defenses will be very low and the carriages will travel into the city at a higher pace. Thus resulting in a very loose checks from the mages and guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had come. Turning invisible, you waited by the main road towards the castle and waited. Lot's of merchant pass by. From the grocer, to the relics, even the Dark Moon Fair. You were tempted to just possess the member of the circus, but realized that you could be found. So, you keep looking, until the Zorgo's Costumes and Disguises caravan passes by. \"This could be it\" you thought. There would be some oddball wanting to fulfill their deepest desire. So, you possesses a suit at random, passed the checks and the rest is history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the changing room, you quickly took off the dwarven suit. Why wear a suit that is likely to be suspected when you are already wearing a \"suit\" that will never be suspected? Taking off the dwarven suit, you could feel that you're gaining height. You closed your eyes and waited. Examining your new physical vessel reflected in the mirror in front of you, you see a naked female human and a beautiful one too. \"Heh\", you thought \"I could use this\". You have seen a lot of human female before in the war, so you presume that this one is a mage. A glance around the room and spotting a purple robe further proves your intuition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You begin to redress yourself, well your new body, and notice the very large coin purse \"you\" have been carrying around. \"She must be part of one of the royal houses in stormwind\" you thought.

This process actually fuses you with the host and becomes your base form losing your old demon body as both bodies become one; the best part of it all is that you still retain your demonic powers while preventing anyone from tracking you.

The pain in the back, the feebleness and the mortal feel. But this new body is different, seems so young, so full of potential and so full of... mana. You thought of keeping this body after the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly your rushed outside, the blond hair getting into your view, but you liked it. \"Ah, sorry, seems I don't really like it\" you said to Zorgo, \"I'll take that one\" you continued while pointing your new body's carefully well cared index finger to an item behind Zorgo. \"You have a fine eye my lady\", Zorgo grinned a maniac grin,\" No doubt you'll have fun impersonating your friends.\" The item is just like any other suit, except that it doesn't have a form yet, although seemingly like a human form with zipper attached at the back of it. \"This is my favourite, this can copy any race under the heaven and it's reusable, bad thing is, this suit can only store 1 form. If you want to copy another person, you need to crumple it and spread it out again, like this, see\". Zorgo lectured you while doing what he said. Crumpling the suit into a ball and spreading it out open to its humanlike form again. \"Just for 10 pieces of gold\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand over the money from the purse that Sarah kept in her pocket and stroll out from the store. The suit, carefully folded and tucked between your cleavage, under the magician's apprentice cloth Sarah is wearing. You walk towards the bustling town hall without anyone noticing you, perhaps they are too taken in the euphoria of the coming of the circus that they failed to notice a demon walking in the midst of them, inside the body of an attractive mage apprentice. \"Too easy, almost too easy. Except for these high platformed shoes (a.k.a high heels)\", you thought, stumbling occasionally but always regained balance and before long after, become an expert at walking and swaying your new hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe I have something I invented for that. Hang on a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why you always hated gnomes. As brilliant as their minds may be, they came up with the most idiotic contraptions ever devised. You recalled fighting one once only for it to pull out a gun that immediately exploded in its face when it tried to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no...Tinks. I think it's passing away now. Sorry for not recognizing you there. What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a look of disappointment on her face for you declining her 'medicine' but said. \"Don't you remember me telling you this morning?

I'll see you tonight, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. A public meeting with the Alliance racial leaders would be absolutely perfect! You could spy on them and see what they were up to.

She kicked and screamed, making it difficult for you to pull a needed hair out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah!? What are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeezed hard and began to drain her life force. Sadly, there was never much life in a gnome, tiny as they were. Eventually nothing remained of her besides her clothing and dust. There was a demonic grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry 'Tinks'. But I must attend this meeting of Alliance leaders.\" You stared at a single pink hair you had plucked from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inserted the hair into the mouth of the blank suit. It twisted and turned, forming an exact copy of Tinks. You began to take off your human form's clothing. \"Sarah's\" body was certainly a pleasure to behold, and you resisted the urge to explore yourself when you had removed the entire outfit. You turned to the task at hand and held up the gnome costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tiny beyond belief, but having spent weeks traveling with Zorgo you knew very well that it would stretch out when you wore it. You stepped into the mouth and firmly put both feet inside. It was an unfamiliar feeling, wearing a skin while already wearing a skin. Your human form felt like you were wearing a light robe. It covered you but it was roomy and comfortable. Being in the gnome skin felt cramped and tight. Like you were a wolf in sheep's clothing, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou donned the suit with ease. Glancing at your reflection in a nearby window, you looked like Tinks if she suddenly had a growth spurt. A slight tingle let you know that the magic was about to begin. The world grew around you ever so slightly. You felt lighter and smaller by the second. It had the same feeling of being stepped on and going down an elevator. A deep sinking feeling that rumbled into your core. At last, the shrinking halted and you readjusted yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shall we Tinks?\" You said to your reflection. </span></div></div>",

Upon closer inspection, you see elf ears sticking out, perhaps a high elf? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rogue weakens and starts to become lifeless, you take this chance to grab her hair, since this rogue is this powerful, you decide to grab more than one measly hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red clothes drops down along with the body's dust. Putting the batch of girl on the red clothing's hood. You start taking off Tink's skin where it felt really weird as your body starts to become human size as you slowly take off. With Tink's suit in your hand, you start crumbling it without a single thought and there it is resetting. Looking forward to the new suit, you grab a piece of hair from the hood and place it inside the now empty suit, and it twisted into a form of a female Blood Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Female Blood Elf in Stormwind?\" you thought out loud, but before any further thoughts, you decide to wear the suit first. As you slowly step inside the mouth of the suit, it was like wearing a full body costume as your human body's size was very similar to that of this elf. It actually felt quite comfortable as you wiggle in to the last bits, and you become slightly shorter than that of your human form. You look at a nearby glass, seeing your new green eyes, and blonde hair flowing from a slight breeze. You quickly put your new outfit and put the rest of the hair into your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start thinking once again, \"Why is a Blood Elf at such a place?\" You stand there with your arms crossed, even crossing your arm on a female body is different before going back to your train of thought.

Once inside, you stripped out of your usual robes to your underwear and donned the rather heavy costume. You fitted in through the back of the suit where there was a zipper. It was a tight fit and you had to hold in your stomach to squeeze inside. But when it was done, you could see a gnome with bizarre proportions staring back at you in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is actually pretty neat,\" you said, doing expressions to your reflection. The suit was doing an excellent job of mimicking your face's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done?\" asked Zorgo as you exited the changing stall wearing your robes to cover yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit, this is pretty impressive. But no one is going to by that I'm a gnome,\" you raised an eyebrow to the shopkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my dear, you're only halfway done! Just Turn the knob on the back of your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiddling around the rather realistic hair, you found the same dial that Zorgo had cranked earlier to grow the suit. The moment you turned it down, you could feel the suit come to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening?\" you asked, as your whole body twinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnomish engineering!\" chirped the suit-maker. \"Right now, your body is being compressed down to the normal size of a typical gnome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bones cracked as your height dipped. You were starting to shrink! Zorgo began to look larger before your eyes as your robes slipped off your dwindling form. You had to grab on the nearby table just to stand upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking was coming in waves. Every breath you had caused you to lose another inch in height. After a painful five minute process, you had lost over a foot in height. The gears in the suit continued to grind as it felt like your insides were going to explode. It was only when you stopped resisting that the shrinking process went more smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Zorgo actually stood taller over you. You had shrunk all the way down to three feet! He clasped his hands together and gestured to a nearby mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for a suit? You can't even tell its a disguise, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed at your reflection and saw only a black haired gnome with cute buns and standing in the remains of a robe too large for her. She looked quite scared and confused she felt all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How is something like this possible? I feel compressed in the actual suit, but if that was true all my bones would be broken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the secret of my suits, my dear,\" replied Zorgo with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know,\" you admitted. The suit was a perfect replica of a gnome and if it involved no magic, there could be no better disguise. Illusions simply couldn't compare. \"Can you explain please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm,\" the old gnome thought for a moment. \"I suppose I'd be willing to share some details.

Gawking at the sheer scope of the selection. There were boxes upon boxes of different outfits from every corner of Azeroth. From tauren primal dresses to pandaren formal wear. Most looked to belong to women too and all were strangely your own size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, isn't it?\" asked Zorgo. \"Notice how the magic keeps them around the target person's size? Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome grabbed a nearby overalls and you watched as they magically shrunk down to match his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of enchantment did you put on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very complicated one. It hides the original aspects of the clothes in favor of the wearer's. However, the enchantment will not last forever. Over time, as you wear the clothes, they will revert back to their original shape. And you with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, perhaps a demonstration is in order. Why not put on something that catches your eye and you will see what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eyed the gnome with caution, but he had a genuine interest in showing you what his wares could do. And you were genuinely curious at this point. I was rare for even the normal tailors to have something in your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. Please, try them on for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you turned your attention to the boxes of clothes, trying to find something that matched your tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that did catch your eye was a cute outfit in the style of the great Ironforge noble's dresses. It had brass buttons and a long flowing gown that would not hide your features in the slightest. Dwarven women were proud of their large breasts, after all.</span></div></div>",

She could also tell she was in a bed... but she felt - funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Marcus, I see you're awake\" said an old man who walked over to Sarah's bedside. Sarah had no idea where he had come from, and stared at him only to realize that he was staring at her. He expected her to respond to Marcus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...?\" asked Sarah, confused. But immediately she noticed something different - her voice was coarse and heavy. It sounded deep, like a mans voice... no, it was a mans voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were out some time Marcus, none of the priests could figure out what happened to you. We gave you some rest and some prayer, but we still saw no improvement after many hours... we were growing worried! Either way, it's great to see you awake!\" said the strange old man. The man was waring a white priest robe, and seemed to be in his late 70's at least. He was bald, but had a well-kept gray beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just staired at him, she was really confused. After noticing her own voice, being called the name Marcus, and realizing she was not in Stormwind anymore she started to take note of her body without moving. It definitely felt different... it was lacking weight on the chest. Her chest was flat, and even muscular. Her arms even felt bigger, but they were under the bed covers. What scared her the most though was that she sensed something attached to her and very much flesh inbetween her legs. She didn't exactly move it or feel anything on it, but she could tell it was there. She was a man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus, are you okay?\" asked the old man as he looked towards Sarah with concern on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah broke eye contact for a moment, but quickly returned to meet the mans gaze, she had to say something!

Currently, she had a job to take out some of the unsavory Defias Brotherhood gang members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered around the forested region, until she came upon some Defias members congregating around a waterfall. Sarah was confident she could take them, she was after all the most talented mage in her class. She opened combat with a Frostbolt, injuring one Defias rogue upon impact, he wasn't dead, but at least slowed down from the chilling effect. His two friends nearby sprung instantly, rushing at Sarah, she countered by casting a Frost Nova, trapping them in place, giving Sarah extra time to get another spell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Sarah hadn't considered was the possibility for more than three gang members, six more emerged from the shadows; all ready to kill and rob Sarah. Sarah, for her part, did about as well as could be hoped for, she burst off Arcane Explosion, after Arcane Explosion, injuring and even killing some of the Defias. Unfortunately for Sarah, her mana was depleting quickly, so she resorted to pull out her staff to deal out melee damage. The five remaining rogues were Sarah's physical superiors, they disarmed Sarah's staff from her hands leaving her defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was panicking, unsure what she could do against these odds, just then she remember her enchanted potion she got, perhaps the extra burst of strength could even this fight. She quickly downed her yellow elixir, not leaving a drop left. Sarah felt a crackle of energy within her. She felt her muscles tensing, bulging and growing stronger. Now she could take on these thugs unarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut new found strength wasn't the only thing she was feeling. She saw her perspective from the ground begin to rise; her robes began straining and growing tighter around her waist and shoulders. She was growing taller in addition to being stronger. \"It's some kinda spell, finish her off boys.\" the leader told his cronies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt confident in her strength, \"Alright this is exactly the kind of situation I prepared for\". She held her guard up and dodged their knife shanks, she countered back with a right-hook, knocking one of the men out cold. All during the fight, her body was continuing to stretch upwards, growing taller, the seems of her robe were tearing at the places that were just feeling tight. By the time the seventh man was defeated, Sarah was feeling a warmth in her chest, her burgeoning breasts were fighting against her bra, and her bra as sorely losing, but her robe was still covering that area... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sarah knocked out the eighth man, her top completely gave away. The last rogue was stunned in place, too distracted looking at Sarah's enormous naked fun bags. With the last enemy paralyzed in her captivity, Sarah finished the man off with one swift punch to the temple. Sarah looked down at her shredded clothes, \"Ughhh, now I've got to get this repaired. That potion did what I wanted it to, but not these side effects...\" Sarah had grown to an extremely tall 7'6\", her breasts had grown to absolutely huge T-cups. \"Well at least the potion is temporary.\"</span></div></div>",

Before neither he, nor Sarah could react, a sword came out of shrubbery, stabbing the rogue in the back. Sarah jumped up this time, prepared with a few spells to defend herself. What stopped her was a familiar voice: \"Sarah? Sarah Runetouch is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah recognized that voice as being Meleyna, her Night Elf friend. \"Sarah it is you!

It gave me tauren growth hormones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you put tauren parts in your potions Sarah?\" Meleyna inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted a more potent elixir of strength, but I didn't think about any unintended side-effects. Now I gotta confront that shopkeeper about undoing this.\" Sarah turned around, heading back to Stormwind while taking long strides, her naked breasts and thick ass bobbing up and down as she walked. \"Oh and Meleyna, do you have anything I could cover up with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO, YOU ENCHANTED MY POTION EARLIER TODAY,\" Sarah knocked on the front door of the shop, a purple cloth was hiding her cleavage, but couldn't mask the overall size of her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes?\" James replied back from inside, he opened the door, seeing the mini giantess on his doorstep. \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your potion that's what! Now what are you going to do to help me?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, come inside I'll explain what I can.\" Sarah had to duck her head underneath the door frame in order to enter, now she knew how the Night Elves and Draenei felt living in Stormwind. \"I did indeed enchant you potion with tauren essence, the tauren essence is what made you grow so tall, as well has your..ahem.. busty appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already knew that,\" Sarah was getting impatient. \"so what are you going to do about it? Elixirs rarely last longer than an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the thing about an enchanted potion is that, while yes an elixir lasts and hour, and your did, just that the enchantment persists permanently.\" James explained to the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean my body is permanently stuck to only producing tauren hormones?\" \"I'm afraid so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you going to give me for screwing up my life?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you a free enchantment of your choosing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh blow it out your ass!\" Sarah stormed out of his shop, angry and confused about what she's going to do next.

It also happens to be the one I need help building, so are you in?\" Kelly eagerly offered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly is a Lacto-tractor?

I'm gonna use it to feed the hungry of the world.\" Kelly happily answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's better than just wondering depressed, and you said you'd pay me right?\" Sarah was feeling a little more agreeable. \"Definitely, come this way to my workshop just out of town.\" Kelly led Sarah over to her workshop, just northwest of Stormwind's gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Kelly's lab, a large circular slab lay, with some plastic tubing and cylindrical glass leaning on the wall. As it turned out, the Lacto-tractor was nearly finished. Kelly was just having issues laying the heavy glass container in place and the top on that. Sarah did it in a matter of minutes, and was ready to be paid for her work. \"Here you are, but do you want to stay a few minutes more for a test run?\" Kelly asked her. \"Umm, sure I guess I have nothing better to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly brought over a cow she had waiting outside, attached the large plastic hose to its udders and turned the machine on. The cow was milked in record time, its milk was drained and then pooled in the large glass cylinder container. \"See? Easy as that!\" the gnome was pretty satisfied with her work. Seeing all of that rich, creamy milk, reminded Sarah of her own full breasts aching for release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kelly, can that machine work on human breasts as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not, but I don't know of any human woman that could possibly have breasts large enough to connect to these hoses\" Kelly said that with her eyes closed, upon opening them, \"Ohhhhh...you mean your breasts. If you want to try, be my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah strapped two hoses, one to each breast, Kelly let the machine rip and it began pumping, and pumping, and pumping. It went on for nearly thirty minutes, the entire tank was completely filled with Sarah's milk. Both women were surprised by how much milk was really in Sarah's chest, as he breasts only deflated a little, but far more milk came out than the volume of her breasts could physically hold. Another side-effect of the elixir Sarah wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was looking at the entire milk filled tank, \"Well, what are going to do with all of this?\" \"Throw it out I guess, who wants to buy human breast milk?\" Then both looked at the front of the room as the door swung open. \"Nobody touch that milk!\" it was Meleyna again, she must have followed Sarah here. \"I'll be the judge if people want this creamy, delicious, white nectar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meleyna, what are you doing?\" Sarah said, her arms on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll drink this milk and determine if it would be good to sell, plus I'm reaaaaalllly hungry and this just looks too delicious to pass up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine whatever, is this alright with you Kelly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, better someone drinks it, rather than just pouring it on the grass like I was planning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock yourself out Meleyna\" Sarah told her friend, stepping aside to let her at the Lacto-tractor. Meleyna placed one of the tubes in her mouth, then gave a thumbs up, signaling to Kelly to start the reverse pump. Meleyna drank, and drank. She drank with much fortitude, and without much restraint. The milk itself was the sweetest and best tasting drink the elf had ever had in her entire life. Gallon, after gallon past through her lips, filling her belly out and eventually bursting through her clothes. In all honesty, Meleyna was hungry for Sarah's milk the first time she saw her lactate in the forest, and now she could fill her stomach with every last drop she could desire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was filling up like a balloon, specifically a water balloon, except with delicious, decadent, sloshing milk. The purple stomach filled her lap up, then surpassed that, growing to the length of her legs, then surpassed that. Her belly was the size of her entire body, then surpassed even that. Meleyna's belly ended up at a size that was two-and-a-half the size of her entire 7'1\" body. When she had finally finished drinking the entire tank worth, Meleyna could only \"-URP-\".  Meleyna was very satisfied with her meal, and her stomach was stretched beyond full. \"Oh Sarah you have the best milk of anyone on the planet!\" Meleyna proudly informed her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm thanks Meleyna. It's so nice to hear that from you,\" she said half-sarcastically. \"Kelly I may need to make permanent use of your Lacto-tractor, is that alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey whatever floats your boat, and if your friend Meleyna is right, maybe we can make some money off your milk.\" Kelly giggled at her own answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's all the same to you two, I'm gonna get some shut eye here and digest my milky tummy,\" the bloated Night Elf announced her intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Meleyna after drinking all that milk?</span></div></div>",

Sarah had an uneasy time falling asleep, however. Her bed was not built for a tall person of her frame, so getting her legs on the bed was challenge enough, the bed frame collapsed under Sarah's weight. \"UUUUUUGGGGGHHHH\" she groaned when the bed's legs gave out, and the mattress fell to the floor with a loud thump. Sarah was ready for her life to find some order again. Once she did fall asleep, Sarah received a good twelve hour rest, something she was marginally thankful for in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes cracked open from the late morning sun shining through the window. She was planning on staying in bed all day, until an annoyingly cheerful knock on her door drew her from her comfortable spot. She knew that particular knock; it was Meleyna. Sarah crept slowly to the door, not eager to open it. On the other side was the Night Elf, smiling with extra glee than usual, but today she looked different from last night. The giant milk-filled belly had digested completely, leaving Meleyna with her normal trim abdomen, well suited for a warrior of her line of work. But that wasn't all, yesterday Sarah was taller than the elf after her transformation. Today, she was once again having to look up to meet the Elf's glowing eyes. She must have been 8 and half feet tall! Meleyna's chest got more than a little upgrade, her breasts were full-blown beach balls, even larger than Sarah's T-cups. Her ass had also ballooned out, her pants had utterly failed at concealing the escaping cheeks, being only able to cover half, with the upper parts being visible for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My you're looking certainly...healthy...\" Sarah stammered, a bit shocked at her friend's new appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you noticed, huh? You're milk did all this Sarah! There's something special about it, we should sell it to women as a health and beauty product. Who wouldn't want to be tall, busty, and muscular?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muscular? You don't look like your body is bulging with muscle.\" Sarah said skeptical of Meleyna's claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not ripped or huge, but definitely toned. Look at these abs,\" Meleyna lifted her shirt, surely enough,there were well sculpted abdominal muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already had those, you're a warrior after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me on that part, but I'm telling you, people will want your milk, we just need to extract more and bottle it! Kelly is already on board she's getting the bottles right now. We can make a mint!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't argue with all of it, if her milk had these properties, it could certainly become a hot product that could make all three of them extremely wealthy. \"Alright, I'll do it, if gives these hormone imbalanced milkers a purpose, and a lot of gold in my purse, what could I stand to lose?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Meleyna grabbed Sarah to close hug, smashing her hefty chest right into Sarah's face, knocking her a little senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the workshop, Sarah's bosom was relieved of another 500 gallons of milk, the white liquid was sucked in the Lacto-tractor's tank, then Kelly pumped it into milk jars on an automated conveyor belt. \"We still need a name for our product, I was thinking Kelly's Lacto-tractor Chalk Drink,\" Kelly said to her business partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh huh, the sounds ok...I was thinking along the lines of: Meleyna's Miracle Mammary Juice.\" Meleyna interjected her own idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of your ideas are just awful, and besides, it's my milk, I should get to name it. Let's call it for what we're selling it as: a beauty enhancer. So how about: Sarah's Rich Beauty Cream?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response was a resounding, \"Mehhhhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine, we can think of a name later.\"</span></div></div>",

She had scoured the shop dozens of times before, as Mr. Cordell kindly pointed out. Though a few meager trinkets sparked her interest, nothing ever truly seemed to grab her. And the only new thing was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sign.\" She said, pointing at the overhead advertisement behind the counter. \"Enchanting the self? What's that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Cordell sighed and continued buffing his counter top, beginning to speak like he had explained it one hundred times already to her. \"That's just some new thing. Apparently there's some word about enchantments done on the self by tauren. You know, like body art. Supposedly they grant the afflicted boosts in strength, knowledge, or what have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know, no one's been crazy enough to try it. It's a Horde thing after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual voice in her head that would have started to yell '<i>This is a bad idea!</i>' about now was being ignored. Sarah was bored, classes had become the same dull routine. Even the once magnificent luster of Stormwind had lost much of its charm. Nothing seemed to sate her boredom. She needed something new, something exciting, something possibly dangerous. Curious, she pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it exactly? I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of like a tattoo, but instead of ink they use grind up ores of magical properties. You make the decal in a certain shape, the artist imprints the design on you, and away you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you do the tattoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I have a gal in the back from Ratchet who does it. Real cheap too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing out of that sentence sounded safe, but for some reason she was even more intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I might be interested...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Cordell seemed almost taken aback. \"What? Did you lose a bet or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Just...It sounds unique is all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...Unique. Well, not exactly my choice of words but I suppose it's your decision kid. Shall I show you the designs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded her head. Cordell sighed and reached underneath the counter. He pulled up on the counter top a big black dusty tome. Flipping open the pages, Sarah could tell that this was an ancient text written in a language she couldn't quite understand. Elfish perhaps? Eventually Cordell flipped to a page with several designs of them. They looked like fancy body art pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they do?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. That's why no one's been too keen on trying to get one. It's all a big mystery, the only thing I have to go on is the shape of the art.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bit her thumb and flipped through the pages. They truly were beauty works of art, the way the lines seemed to dance around on the page. She browsed for several minutes eventually coming across one design that really caught her eye.

Delicate, curving lines reach up and down the shape, forming circlets, interlocking and branching out beautifully. <br>\r\n\"I'll take this one,\" she says, slightly hesitant with uncertainty.<br>\r\n\"Excellent, my dear,\" replies Cordell, rubbing his hands together with unhidden anticipation. Sarah begins to wonder if there is something about this tattoo which Cordell is not telling her. \"Now,\" he continues, picking up the design booklet, \"this tattoo is meant to be displayed across the backside of one's hips,\" he seems to notice Sarah's incredulous expression, \"Oh not to worry, dear, privacy is a virtue I honor highly,\" he looks around, \"I'll get my assistant to apply the tattoo --- Gretta!? oh Gretta!\"<br>\r\nA shuffling noise comes from behind a doorway in back of the shop. The door opens quickly to reveal a heavyset, youthful dwarfish woman. Cordell turns to her, \"ah yes, this one,\" he says pointing to the page Sarah had turned to. The young dwarf raises an eyebrow, and then nods. She motions toward Sarah and saunters back into the room from which she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, biting her lip from curiosity, follows slowly. Once she enters, Gretta shuts the door softly, \"a'roit, ye'll need tah flip up yer robe er take it off,\" with an alarmed look on her face, Sarah replies, \"what?\" <br>\r\n\"Well I cannae inscribe yer back without bein' able to see it now can I?\" the dwarf girl's husky voice makes the accent even harder to understand. <br>\r\nSarah leans back and forth uneasily, \"um, well...sure,\" she bends over, beginning to raise up her robe. She raises the robe above her hips, revealing hairless, well shaped legs and a firm rear covered in a simple woman's undergarment.<br>\r\nThe dwarf girl snorts, \"well a'roity now,\" Sarah hears the dwarf gathering the ingredients, \"good now, I'll begin the enchantin',\" immediately, Sarah feels the magic dust being infused across her lower back. Sarah gasps slightly, the magic dust behaves strange, first being hot, then icy cold a moment later. After a moment of this, the dwarf says, \"very good, yer done now.\" <br>\r\nSarah lets the robe fall, noting that the fabric seems to cling more around her hips and rear, the robe only reaching to her ankles. Sarah gives no thought to this, feeling a bit guilty now for skipping class, and wishing to return to the mage school. As she turns around to leave, she feels her breasts swing out wider and heavier than normal, looking down, Sarah sees that substantially more cleavage is showing through the top of the robe than had that morning. As she stares, transfixed on her larger assets, she notices that her breasts are continuing to swell heavier. As well, she can feel the rear of her robe being stretched tighter and tighter as her hips widen and her buttocks expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow hourglassy does she get?</span></div></div>",

Just as her robe seemed about to rip down the middle of her rear, she felt the transformation wearing off. She stumbled forward, trying to get accustomed to balancing with her now enlarged assets. As Gretta, looking rather bored, opened the door and Sarah stepped out into the store once more, Cordell's jaw drops halfway to the floor. He quickly recovers an appropriate decorum, \"A-anything else, m-my dear?\" His voice shook with the tremendous effort it took him to maintain his gaze on her face. Sarah, finding herself almost pleased, in an arrogant way, with the attention she was receiving decided to try her luck on another rune. <br>\r\n\"I'd like to see the tattoo book again please,\" she cooed, twirling one of the loose locks of hair that fell casually over her pretty face.<br>\r\nCordell fumbled around for a second, his eyes still trained on her face, until he finally produced the book. He must have intended to say something, but only faint gasps and whispers were emitted from his lips. The dwarf girl shook her head gruffly, adjusting her belt to be more comfortable around her thick midsection.<br>\r\n\"If only a man would look at me like that,\" Gretta thought to herself.<br>\r\n Feeling very confident in her own judgment, Sarah carelessly picks a rune that would make her several inches taller. Cordell shows the dwarf, and Sarah tiptoes back into the room. Gretta was getting angry at how lucky this girl was with the runes she chose, though the dwarf's stony demeanor did not show it. As she was fashioning the rune, an idea came into her head. This human girl was way too arrogant, even by dwarf standards, Gretta decided she would apply an extra tattoo that would be sure to put this pretty princess in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of tattoo does the dwarf use on Sarah?</span></div></div>",

She gasped as the tattoo was magically applied around her firm belly button. This tattoo felt different somehow. It made her feel full at first, as if she had just eaten a very large meal, but soon the fullness was replaced by a deep hunger. She opened her eyes and yelped. Sarah's belly was already protruding outward several inches more than it did before. The dwarf grinned menacingly at Sarah. It did not take long for Sarah to figure out what the envious dwarf had done. <br>\r\n\"I'm--I'm getting fatter!?\" shrieked Sarah, her body continuing to fatten and plump. She pressed her hands on her soft, now jiggly, belly trying in vain to stop its growth. Her breasts swelled heavier and heavier even than they had from the effects of the first tattoo. Quickly, and continuing to shriek, Sarah grabbed her purple robe and flung it on her body as best she could, considering.

As she ran, she felt her body becoming more and more of a burden, especially her belly and bosom. With every heavy stride, her torso seemed to extend forward a couple more inches. She could feel blubbery inner thighs as she continued to run, her buttocks widening as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so longer, she was forced to slow down because of how fat she was becoming.

She could feel the tattoo warm around her belly button, where firm abdominal muscles were once visible there was now only an increasingly thick layer of meaty flesh. The waist sash of the robe became untied and the ends fell limp as Sarah's body continued to demand more and more space. The rune glowed softly, almost knowingly, encircling her deep belly button with rotund, bulbous symbols. Tears began to run silently down her chubby cheeks, punctuated only every so often by a quiet, helpless sniffle. She had no immediate reason to freak out, there was no one in the forest to judge her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah attempted to retie the sash, \"No, no come on--fit!\" she tugged hard at the purple fabric, only to hear it begin to rip. Tears formed down the back and sides of her once well-fitting garment. Fatty hips emerged through the gaps on the sides while her back puffed out of the tear in the back like rising dough. Sarah gave up hope, letting the smooth fabric slide down her inflating body into a tattered heap on the ground behind her. Though her underwear still managed to stay intact, it barely served its purpose. Her cloth brazier which fit her perfectly that morning was now only a pitiful and fruitless attempt to conserve her decency. As for her panties, though they did not need to hide her womanhood, as her large belly was doing a perfect job already, they did not however conceal even the slightest bit of her plump rump. The undergarment had been reduced to nothing more than a band of cloth, stretched taught over Sarah's fattening behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, being a human girl, had always given special attention to her looks. She was never \"the-fat-kid\" growing up, not because she ate little, but rather that she maintained healthy eating and exercising habits. Once more, very few people in Azeroth are overweight, in a world full of stress and turmoil it is a challenge not to get a good amount of daily activity. Those young and able-bodied are usually either put to work producing essential and commercial resources or sent to training to hone their combat or magical capabilities. That said, it was feasibly more of a challenge for those chosen to become mages as mage training is much more mental than physical. There were some young mages, known to Sarah, to be on the husky side, but none were even close to how large she was at this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah held her underbelly in her hands, feeling grow larger and heavier with each breath she took. \"I'm as fat as a Winter Veil pig,\" she sobbed. Luckily for her, as she already had an 'enhanced' body, her bosom and rear had not fallen behind her stomach in its fattening quest. The glow of the belly tattoo slowly faded until the tattoo was not more than an attractive marking on her distended gut. Sarah's lip quivered and all at once she sat down, causing many nearby twigs and leaves to jump from the earth, and began to weep into her hands. Suddenly, Sarah heard a rustle in the flora to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who's there?\" she asks, her level of fear rising.</span></div></div>",

A shock of pain, a blur of fur and the smell of raw meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oow!\" shrieks Sarah, clutching her underarm where the creature clawed her. The feeling of cold forest air on her nipples shocked her. \"You bloody perverted beast!\" she yelled, reddening and cupping her enormous endowment in her hands.

She had to fold her plump arms around her bosom to keep her breasts from bouncing and jiggling every which way. The distance between trees decreased further and further. She could feel her blubber being nicked more and more by the branches, twigs and thorny bushes that seemed so abundant in this forest. She did not stop, even when she felt her panties snag on a thorn and tear clean off her jiggling body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled on the side of a dirt road, and flew headlong into the dry earth. Her eyes flit around her for an instant, and then they close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she wake up?</span></div></div>",

Sarah's height inched up until the young mage stood at a slightly taller length than usual, making her seem even more mature with her added 'enhancements'. She stopped to look at a nearby mirror at her reflection, the girl's vanity knew no bounds. But that was what Gretta was counting on. She knew what one tattoo in particular did, one she had committed to memory. If this girl asked for one more tattoo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did like my nose...\" Sarah muttered. \"Is there any tattoo that can do something about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo. Sarah went and reached for the tattoo design book but Gretta cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, hon. I know just the tattoo that can fix that right up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was take aback by the dwarf woman's sudden enthusiasm. \"You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a'course. I did understand some of the tattoos after all. I wouldn't have been hired if I didn't, now would I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah huffed. \"Then why make me waste so much time looking for the other ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Gretta fought back a scowl so she wouldn't give herself away. \"Apologizes mistress. Now, let's not waste anymore of yer time then. Let's step into my workshop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one needs to be placed on a tad more...private area...I don't think you'd be appreciating Master Cordell gawking at yer assets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed slightly while Cordell tried to stop his explosive nosebleed. \"Y-yes, let's get on with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Gretta lead Sarah into Gretta's work area. There was the smell of sot and iron lingering in the air, many books and scrolls lay all over the tables. Gretta cleared off the largest table and placed down the tattoo book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip down, lass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hesitated but quietly obeyed. It was somewhat of a relief to break free of the much too tight robes as she fidgeted around the room in her small undergarments before laying down stomach up on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, this won't take long at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah yelped slightly as a tingly feeling pricked her in her chest, just along her massive cleavage. The stingy hot sensation faded into an ice cold touch again. The dwarf woman seemed to be taking her time with this one. After what seemed like forever, Gretta put her needle down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done.\" She smirked. \"Enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah jumped to her feet and looked down at her chest. The design was a very peculiar shape. It was blood red and looked somewhat like a woman, only much more squatter and condensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is the right one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, the effects should start any moment now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, before Sarah could reply back a tingling feeling went down her spine. She began to look herself over to spot any changes occurring. Little did she know, her tramp stamp from behind was slowly fading into her skin, an added effect that Gretta decided to include with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Asked Sarah with a sense of rising concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just what you brought upon yourself, lass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah angrily turned to face the dwarf when she suddenly noticed that she wasn't looking down at Gretta as much as she had been a few seconds ago. That's when it hit her. She was shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me, you freaking midget!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretta just replied with a hearty laugh. Sarah's world was growing larger around her, she felt like she was getting crushed by an unseen hand from above her. Oddly enough her figure wasn't shrinking with her, it was staying the same size giving her an almost stout appearance just like the woman on the tattoo. Her body fat plumped up all the right areas, including her stomach. Sarah suddenly realized what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer making me into a dwarf, you bitch!\" She shouted in a hoarse accent, much to her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretta continued to laugh as the girl neared her own height. \"Well done, they do train mages well don't they? Anyway call this a price for yer vanity 'human'. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sarah could react, Gretta reached into her pocket and threw a handful of dust in her face. Sarah coughed slightly and felt herself become increasingly drowsy as she desperately tried to make a grab for Gretta. She blacked out just before she came in reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up...</span></div></div>",

It didn't fit her new body very well.   It was so long that the ends dragged on the ground, and the belt barely fit around her new, thicker waist.  For the first time in her life, she had to decide whether to knot it over or under a healthy gut, and finally decided on over, where her large bust help keep it in place.  At least she still had that, even if it was now much more proportionate to the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was satisfied that her robes weren't going to fly open, she flung the door open and fixed James with a stare.  \"You!

I want to be able to see my toes again!  Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that early,\" James said, wringing his hands apologetically.  \"Gretta's the only one who knows how, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--and she's off visiting her mother is Kalimdor for the next two weeks.   She took the vacation in an awful hurry, come to think of it.

Years of pickpocketing dirty magazines and chew toys, of opening lockboxes only to find a few coppers and some old leaves, of sneaking through crumbling catacombs, wading through vile swamps, and searing her fair skin to a crisp under the desert sun.  All in pursuit of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she'd found it.  A treasure trove for the ages -- enough to keep her in luxury for a lifetime.   Her vault in the Ironforge bank overflowed with it.  Gold coins stacked to the ceiling.  Bushels of sparkling jewels.  Bolts of priceless cloth.  She'd almost gotten it semi-sort-of-legally, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting one of the ruby-filled urns into the vault, she caught a glimpse of herself in the polished golden surface.  She looked <i>good.</i>  Flame-red hair tied back in a braid, eyes the color of honey, and a <i>fantastic</i> build.   While other dwarves stuffed themselves with sausage and guzzled down mug after mug of beer, she'd abstained, keeping herself slender and stealthy.

Two-Bits was banking on the fact that Lil Lizz might have something to help \"grease the wheels.\" of his current project. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you once Two-Bits, if I caught you setting foot in my shop after the last time, I'd paint the walls with your head.\" Lil Lizz yelled in a high pitched voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on, can I really be blamed if your love potion, which was extremely effective and at a more than accommodating price I might add, would stir up such feelings for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And exactly what part of that potion was responsible for you stealing and fencing my alembic and my inventory of herbs after you wore me out in bed?\" Lil Lizz cocked the hammer of her shotgun as she began to squeeze the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait hold on, what if I told you I have a tidy sum of gold for your services!\" Mike yelped in a last ditch effort to save his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's a start.\" Lizz said as she lowered the gun. \"Start talking pretty boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad we can at least be sensible about this!\" Two-Bits sighed in relief as he relaxed his posture. \"You remember Slicer Slam, pretty young dwarf girl who I used to run with back in Stormwind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I used to make designer poisons for her whenever she found some interesting herbs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got me a little wager with her. This is her first Brewfest since she gave up the life of adventure and thieving, and she seems to think she's incapable of gaining on the dwarven diet. I aim to prove her wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going to cheat like a horny goblin?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course! I just need something to unleash the <i>proper dwarf i</i>n her, if you get my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLil Lizz thought for a second before it hit her. \"I got what ya need right here Two-Bits.\" Lizz shuffled to the back of her store, throwing open a gigantic dresser filled with numerous vials, all bubbling in different bright flourscent colors. \"This one right here should do it.\" The vial Lizz pulled out was a bright neon green, the concoction bubbled furiously in the contents of it's glass shell. The label simply read \"Hog Fattener.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subtlety was never your strong suit was it Lizz?\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For nearly a week, Two-Bits had been stuffing her with carb-laden treats until she couldn't hold another crumb and pouring beer down her throat until she brimmed with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could swear that she was getting fatter, too.  She couldn't understand how she was putting it on so <i>quickly</i>, but she was sure it was true.  Her arms felt -- softer.  Fleshier.  Her face looked a little bit rounder in the mirror.   Some of that was probably due to plain old bloating, but she had to admit that not all of it was.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nI need to exercise</i>, she thought, but just the thought of moving gave her cramps. <i>Ugh, this bet was a terrible idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a good thing I've got a backup plan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself being shaken out of a beer-soaked slumber by her midnight appointment, a goblin leatherworker named Tix Hidepilfer who was known to follow adventurers around and skin the beasts they killed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Slicer!  There better be a good reason you called me all the way into Ironforge,\" he grumbled.  \"Any of those guards seen me, I'd be short a head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're already short a couple feet,\" Sam smiled.   \"I wasn't worried.  Your discretion is the reason I called you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your recent good fortune is the reason I answered.\"  His face split in a money-hungry grin.  \"Planning on adding a few upgrades to your gear?  A nice anti-grav belt maybe, or maybe a flame tosser, or -- I know!  A pair of knocker-mounted chest bazookas!  All yours, for the right price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothin' like that,\" Sam said, waving him away.   \"I just need it... altered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Altered how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let out, okay?\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-<i>ho</i>,\" Tix chuckled.  \"I thought I noticed something different about you.  So, the old Slicer is letting herself go, eh?   Thinking of changing your name to Thunderbuns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and if you call me that again, you'll have to get out of Ironforge naked and wearing your ears as a moustache.   Can you do it or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, sugar bulges.  I can do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because there's a complication.  It's currently being kept in a secure vault owned by a friend of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  And may I ask why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because apparently Two-Bits doesn't trust me not to cheat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!  The nerve of some fellas, huh?\"   Tix smiled.  \"So how much you want me to let this out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much.  It can't be baggy, or he'll get wise.  Just... an inch or two on the thighs, maybe three on the waist, and a little more room in the cups.  Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.  One plus-size casing for a dwarven sausage coming up.   Now, where exactly is this vault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Tix found himself sliding down a Goblin Retractable Semi-Explosive Microcable into the back room of Lil Lizz's shop.   <i>Ah</i>, he said, spotting the vault.   He would have to work quickly.  Judging by the still-steaming mug of coffee sitting on the workbench, Lil Lizz hadn't been gone long; she could be back at any moment.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrowed as he saw the half-empty vial of green liquid sitting askew in the rack, with a receipt taped to it.   <i>Lil Lizz, I.O.U. 2gp for: 10cc Hog Fattener.  Signed, Two-Bits</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Either our human friend has taken up farming on the side</i>, Tix thought, <i>or he's playing this just as dirty as Sam is.  Well, ain't this a fun little friendly wager?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard tiny footsteps just outside the door.  Lizz was coming back!</span></div></div>",

Someone's gotta supply that cow with a new wardrobe after all, right?</i> the pitter patter of Lizz's oncoming footsteps snapped Tix back to reality though, he needed a distraction and quick. Tix glanced at the vial of Hog Fattener once more and suddenly a toothy grin erupted across his face as he dumped the entire vial into Lil Lizz' s mug of coffee. <i>Now for a little vanishing act</i>, Tix twisted a lever on his belt and suddenly disappeared from sight right as Lizz walked back into her workshop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bleh, it suddenly smells like...sweaty sleazy entrepreneurship in here.\" Lil Lizz said aloud, barely stifling her gag reflex. Tix gritted his teeth in response. Lizz lifted up the mug of coffee, letting the aroma of Mulgore Roast fill her nostrils in attempt to drown out the unknown smell. \"Least the coffee is still good.\" she said before taking a prolonged sip. For a short period Lizz continued to brew in her workshop, working to fill Two-Bits weekly order for Hog Fattener. It didn't seem like he any plans to slow down his cheating streak and in fact looked like he was planning to ramp it up even further. Tix stuck to the shadows, waiting for another opportunity to crack Lizz' safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Lizz's eyes shot open as a shot of adrenaline suddenly piped up in her tiny body. Lizz's miniature frame meant that it wasn't long before her own formula of Hog Fattener suddenly left her completely famished. \"Oh wow oh wow, gotta eat gotta get something to eat.\" Lizz said frantically as she scurried out the door, desperate to find anything to cram into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bingo</i>. Tix quickly got to work on the vault, pulling out a goblin multitool for the job. Tix flipped past the lockpick tool and pulled out his trusty portable nitrogen bomb. <i>Feh subtlety</i>, Tix thought to himself as he detonated the charge, a tremendous explosion ringing out through Lizz' shop, thankfully Lizz was too distracted stuffing her face with a carton full of banana cookies in the room above to pay the boom any mind. The vault fell off its hinges hitting the ground with a loud thud. Inside sat Slicer Sam's leather armor, curiously unharmed by the nitrous blast. Tix retrieved the armor and quickly got to work letting out the seams. The job finished, Tix adjusted his patented The Invisible Hand's Invisibilty belt attachment and slipped out the front door, Lizz still too preoccupied with clearing out her entire pantry to pay his entrance and exist any mind. </span></div></div>",

The crowds had thinned, though the remaining individuals making them up had done quite the opposite -- including one little pink-haired gnome who was less little every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's your -- munch -- target doing?\" Lil' Lizz said, taking a big bite out of a sausage-and-butter sandwich.  \"Remember, no refunds if you don't win.  Hog fattener is only<i> guaranteed</i> for use on hogs, pigs, boars, and assorted porcine outliers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no worries, no worries!\" Two-Bits laughed.  \"Your little potion has been working like a charm.  She must have put on twenty pounds since this business started.  All it takes is a drop here and there in her brew when she's not looking and her appetite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at Lil' Lizz, who was just finishing off the sandwich and licking her lips free of crumbs.  She'd been enjoying her food lately, and it showed.  The girl was -- well -- <i>rounding out </i>all over quite deliciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... her appetite does the rest -- say, Lizz, you haven't been inhaling that stuff while you work, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, do you think I'm stupid?\" she snorted.  \"I wear a mask when I'm brewing dangerous stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way you're packing it away, I'd check for leaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, can't a girl enjoy herself for once?  It's Brewfest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo-Bits smiled.  The little gnome was going to <i>enjoy herself</i> right out of her grease-stained overalls if she kept this up.   Not that he minded; Lil' Lizz could stand to be a little cuddlier.   And next to a plump dwarven lass, there was nothing better in the bedroom than a nice gnomish butterball.  Afterwards, they made <i>wonderful</i> pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, meanwhile, was getting rather tired of beer and sausage and cheese.  She'd been stuffing herself with it until she was purple in the face for almost two weeks now, after all, and every time she felt the laces of her Brewfest dress bind uncomfortably tight across her chest and back, it only reminded her how fat she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, pinching the creamy inner tube of pudge around her middle, which the dress was having a harder and harder time hiding.  <i> Ugh, I'm gross</i>, she thought to herself miserably.   It was a good thing she was good at sneaking; actually walking around in full view in public like this and she would have died of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nJust two more days, she thought resolutely,</i> taking a bite out of a large wheel of gouda.  <i>Two more days, and this is over -- and I'm going to run and jump and do sit-ups until I lose every ounce of this blubber!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless she lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she lost -- oh, it was horrible to think about -- if she lost, Two-Bits would hold her to it!  He would force-feed her buckets of candy during Hallow's End, cram her with flocks of turkey during Pilgrim's Bounty, and finally, if there was any part of her body remaining that hadn't been fattened to his generous standards, he would spend all of Winter's Veil finishing her off with fruitcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered.  The autumn wind suddenly felt as cold as winter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A dwarven mage was a rare thing, especially in their capital city Ironforge. While most dwarfs were interested in treasure hunting or dragon slaying, their mages preferred a quieter life from behind the scenes. Some would manipulate matters in court, using their spells to gather influence and their intellect to impress nobles. Others, however, weren't so ambitious with their gifts in magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were one such dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name was Zelda Bagshot. You had been born to a couple of hunters who had spent most of their lives living in the winter wilderness of Dun Morogh, only deciding to settle down in Ironforge after they had you. They opened up a tavern and you grew up living in the bar-room, listening to the stories of adventures and hearing about the world. But, most importantly, you grew up on ale. You were practically nursed on the stuff and by the time you were sixteen, you could drink four men under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was, in part, thanks to your magical gift you discovered on your own at an early age. When you turned ten, you discovered that you could move things with your mind and cast simple spells. However, instead of telling your parents so you could get a proper training, you kept your gift quiet and learned about controlling your powers on your own. They called dwarves like you hedge mages, but people had a different name for your now that you had turned twenty one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wench!\" called one of the adventurers who had visited your parent's pub. \"Bring me more ale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready an adult and you hadn't stepped out of your parent's home yet. But this never bothered you, as you enjoyed the stink of bar and the sounds of a pub. For your age, you were also incredibly beautiful and thin by dwarf standards. You didn't have the curves that most dwarven women were famous for, looking so much like a typical human save for your short stature. Most noticeable was your long fiery hair done up in two braids behind your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment, hun,\" you said to your clearly tipsy customer. \"You still haven't paid for your first few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ragged human looked cross with you now. \"Don't give me any lip and fill my mug, stupid wench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew better than to lose your temper with a drunk, and this was exactly the sort of man you had been looking for. \"Fine, tell you what. I'll give you all the free ale you want, but you need to beat me in a drinking contest. If you lose, you need to put down twice what you owe for the drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah,\" the man pulled out two gold coins and slammed them on the table. \"You're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and quickly brought out a handful of drinks, allowing the both of you to get to work. By the third sip of beer, you had gathered the attention of everyone in the tavern as they watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour opponent kept on drinking, never once realizing that you had been transferring a large portion of each of your cups into his own tankard with magic. By your tenth glass, he was already struggling to even sit up straight. In a couple of more chugs, he was out cold on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked at your success, barely even feeling tipsy from the few drinks you did have and snatched up the coins. \"Thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the patrons returned to their own drinks as you left your sleeping victim at the table with a half-fill tankard still stuck in his hand. But in the shadows of the tavern was a pair of eyes looking at you. They belonged to...</span></div></div>",

But every time you shot a glance in his direction, you saw him looking away from you even though you knew he was still watching. Eventually, you put away the gold you had won from your gambling in a cabinet and confronted the staring panda-man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked a few times and spoke in his people's typical accent. \"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been staring at me since I drank that loudmouth under the table. Don't think I haven't noticed. What's your deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pandaren seemed surprised but then calmly smiled. He looked like many of his kin, with black and white fur on a pudgy body with gigantic potbelly. However, his fur was very faded and grey, to suggest that he was an older gentleman. Most oddly of all though was the giant scar along his eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm sorry, good maiden. I was simply pondering how you did that magic trick before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a pang of annoyance. \"What trick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now. I know magic when I see it. You fooled that poor gentlemen into believing that he had drunk the same amount as you, but in reality you kept refilling his cup with your own liquor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff from your nose, you shot your nastiest scowl at him. \"You can't prove anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" replied the pandaren as he adjusted himself in his seat. \"But I don't think the other patrons will trust your shop after they hear some rumors of the matron cheating them out of their coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never took kindly to threats, but in the back of your mind you knew that those rumors would eventually cause your parents some trouble. \"Alright then, I'll play your game. What do I have to do to keep you quiet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pandaren smiled. \"Well, I can see you're a aspiring young mage. I'm curious as to why someone with your talents is busy serving drinks in a small tavern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to pay rent while I live with my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lovely lady your age living with her parents? Do you not dream of adventure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to all back the stories you heard from travelers and shrugged them off. \"It's not for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You have the potential to be a great wizard, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not interested,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm,\" the great pandaren stroked his chin. \"Well, nevertheless, to keep me quiet you'll have to beat me in one of your drinking games. And this time, no cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" you reached over for another chair and table to put in front of the pandaren. \"I'll just have to get some ale and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, that won't be necessary. We'll be using <i>my</i> ale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as he reached around the leather pouch next to his hip and produced a fat jug with a paw symbol on it in red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe narrowed your eyes, having never tried pandaren ale before, but calmly replied. \"You're on.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Excellent,\" replied the old pandaren as he poured both you and him a cup of the ale. \"Now, the rules are going to be quite simple. This will be a race to see who can down twenty shots the fastest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty? Easy enough,\" you smirked as you raised the cup to your nose to get a sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you jolted your face away from the liquid. Your nostrils were suddenly on fire from smelling the stuff. Whatever was inside the cup had a burning and foul scent to it. The pandaren noticed the discordance on your face and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should warn you, this ale is very strong. Even for pandaren standards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells like vinegar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to chuckle, the pandaren swirled the cup around in his hand. \"Are you chickening out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowled at him and braced yourself for the first shot. \"Never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes, you tilted your head back and downed the drink. It tasted almost as bad as it smelled, but when you opened your eyes, you saw that the pandaren was already pouring himself another glass. You quickly followed suit to match the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your second glass, you began to feel odd but you passed it off simply as a reaction from drinking such strong liquor. You were more focused on catching up to the pandaren, who was on his fourth drink, to notice but the second glass had brought with it some...changes to you. Specifically with your ears which had migrated their way to the top of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued the drinking game, the more changes your body took. In fact, after each shot, a different part of your body morphed into something different. The second shot transformed your nose black and snout-like, similar to a bear's. The third caused your teeth to grow sharp. The fourth sprouted a stubby tail directly above your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter how quickly you downed the glasses, the pandaren was always one step ahead of you. You were so focused on the competition that you didn't even notice the changes done to your body by the ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pandaren finished his eighth, he sighed. \"Shall I slow down for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly chugged your sixth shot, causing several spots of brown fur to sprout from your hands. \"Don't gloat, this isn't over yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the drinking game went on, the changes grew even more wild to the point where it was almost ridiculous that you didn't notice them. But you couldn't help it, something about the ale and the competition made blind to everything else around you. It was a good thing that you both had started this contest in the dark corner of the bar or people might have stared at your transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seventh drink caused your hands to shape into large paws. The eighth did the same to your feet and sharp claws began to poke their way out of your leather boots. The ninth caused your nose and mouth to push out more like a snout.The tenth gave you more teeth and extended both your claws and tail further out. Once you got into the double digits, though, things got more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of the alcohol were starting to hit you, making you feel lightheaded. This helped you get distracted by the effects of the eleventh drink which made you grow several inches taller and wider. You were never a pudgy dwarf, so the extra weight caused your normally loose blouse and skirt to suddenly feel a little tighter. Drinks twelve and thirteen furthered this growth as your girls puffed up from their non-existent AA's to BB, then CC. In addition, your thighs were now straining your skirt by the seams and you had now gained a foot in new height, causing the bar around you to look a lot smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt drink fourteen, the pandaren stopped and said. \"Maybe we should stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you hiccuped. \"I'm going to catch up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen caused another growth spurt but also made more fur grow from your arms and legs, taking on the same chestnut color as your hair. By drink sixteen you no longer looked like a dwarf woman but a young, if short, pandaren girl. Seventeen, you had caught up to the male pandaren and were finishing growing fur. Eighteen caused your head to reshape itself into a bear-like appearance and your vision became darker. You were beginning to black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNineteen, your tail had finished growing and you looked exactly like a red panda pandaren, even passing the six foot height mark and still growing.

She was an alchemist herself, who spent much of her time with her head in old books searching for recipes. Physically she was a good foot smaller than you and was much less fit for fighting or hunting, so she contributed to the tribes through her talent with potions. She always had a few new strength or health potions for you to use on your journeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ascended on the elevator into the trade part of town, you had a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Grenda can take a look at this for me.\" you said to yourself while taking another look at the vial, \"She would be able to see if Goldenpot was lying or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to Grenda's shop near the auctioneers. She was busy sweeping the ground with a broom, trying to make her store look presentable.

Grenda motioned you into her tent to have a seat with some tea. You followed her and caught up on the local news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're moving the Horde forces to Northrend? Perhaps I should enlist.\", you said, taking a sip of the herbal tea, \" By the way Grenda, I happened to stop by a vendor on the way here who had a strange potion that I purchased. Since it was your area of expertise, I thought you should take a look at it considering the merchant was an untrustworthy goblin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always run into the strangest people Shala.\" she replied as you handed her the bubbling container. \"Did he say what he thought it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a shrinking potion of all things. Do you have any idea if he was lying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the vial, before opening it to sniff the liquid. She shook her head and said. \"There's no way to know the effects unless you drink it. It's not poisonous though, so that's always a plus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrena handed you the vial back after putting the cap on.

You raised your eyebrows and gave her a concerned look until she noticed that you were trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Oh, sorry Shela. No, I think you should be the one to do it. You bought it after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. Grenda wasn't one to pull tricks, especially on one of her friends. So you shrugged your shoulders and opened the cap of the bottle. A little sip of it wouldn't hurt you, right? You brought the vial to your mouth and drank in a spoonful of the fizzing liquid. It tasted like bananas almost. Maybe a bit more stronger. You brought the potion down and stood up to see if there were any effects. You waited for any slight change, but nothing happened for a whole minute. You smirked at Grenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he was a liar after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt something. It was like the contents in you stomach were traveling throughout your body. It wasn't painful, it was just tingly. Almost like butterflies were crawling in your fur. Grenda stared at you with raised eyebrows and eyes fill of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just feel really weird,\" You replied. \"Bubbly...Like the potion. It's probably nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another feeling traveled within you. It was like a small tremor or a wave that moved in your body like a ripple in a pond of water. Suddenly Grenda seemed a little less shorter than you. That wasn't all, your clothes were a tad looser but only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just shrunk about an inch,\" Grenda replied with a smile as she stood up to compare height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. While you normally towered over her, it seemed like she had grown a thumb's length in height. But in reality the potion had made you shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, looks like we were wrong,\" You said, pulling with your now looser pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremor feeling returned again. This time you saw the changes in height lose. Your eye sight jolted down and your clothes grew ever looser. While the last one had been a mere inch, this change was twice that. You now stood under 7 feet, having lost three inches of your height! You looked at Grenda with panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrinking even more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, when I looked at the potion I realized that it was quite potent,\" She answered with a mischievous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say \"What?!\", but another quake-like feeling rumbled throughout your body. Your form shriveled down in height much worse this time. It had been four inches! You were 7 inches smaller than when you walked in the hut! Your pants had fallen off your waist, but thankfully your tail had caught them. Grenda was looking bigger and bigger by the moment. It wouldn't be long before she passed you in height! You were starting to get scared and you pulled up your pants to cover your exposed lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If my calculations are correct,\" Said Grenda. \"You should lose eight inches next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grenda...W-why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled playfully. \"I'm just tired of you boasting about your height Shela. It gets tiring after awhile hearing how 'great' and 'powerful' you are while hunting. Maybe this little change will help you have some humbleness in your attitude from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out for her to stop this but the dreaded rumbling feeling in your gut returned again. Down you went, losing eight inches in height. Suddenly, you weren't looking down at Grenda. You were looking up!</span></div></div>",

Losing it slowly like this while watching the world grow around you was paralyzingly frightening. You shivered as you huddled in your growing clothes for comfort. Your pants were already on the floor, and your shirt was covering your body like a small dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grenda...P-please stop this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Shela, you know there's nothing I can do now.

Everything was so surreal now, you felt like you were going to throw up. But you realized that the sick feeling in your stomach was really another quake feeling. You braced yourself to lose sixteen inches this time. This would bring you to down to under five feet! You dropped like the elevators in Thunderbluff. You eyesight lowered from Grenda's face to her chest and mid section. Your shirt could now completely cover you like a blanket. In an odd sort of way, you felt like a child again. Grenda seemed to think this as well, she squealed in delight and patted you on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww,\" She said with an obnoxiously cute voice. \"Aren't you just the most precious little thing ever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this isn't funny Grenda! What if I s-shrink away into nothing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry silly, you didn't drink nearly enough potion for that. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if it started to slow down now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to give a nasty retort but you felt the feeling in your belly yet again. Closing your eyes, you expected to drop thirty two inches this time. When you opened them, you discovered that while you had shrunk again it was a much smaller amount.

It's going back down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...,\" You crossed your arms. \"That's REAL comforting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process continued, you lost four inches the next time. Then two again. And finally one inch. Words could not express how relieved you were to be done with this nightmare. Little did you know, the nightmare was just beginning. Being now barely three feet in height, Grenda loomed over you like a giant. Without warning, she scooped you up with both arms like you were a baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What in the name of the Earthmother are you doing Grenda!\" You screamed as you flailed in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just so cute like this Shela!

Remember?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrenda had lost all calm and coolness, going into a full blown panic. Somehow you felt satisfied. She had this coming. The once gigantic female shape that was your friend was slowly reaching your own size. She was only a good foot taller than you now. You stood there, with a grin and arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so funny when it happens to you, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor girl was near tears at this point, she was eye to eye with you now. \"L-look in my potion cabinet!

There were still no signs of it slowing down either. Her expression of terror neatly mirrored your own when you had gone through with the same shrinking process. She practically was swimming in her own clothing at this point. You had to resist the temptation to pick her up, like she did you. Down she went...Two feet...One foot eight.....One foot four....And finally, she stopped at the one foot marker. She looked so tiny to you. You were three times her height now after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped over Grenda, who cowered into her clothing for comfort. \"Now what shall we do with you?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could now tower over any gnome as you unlocked the door to your store and slammed it shut behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coast was clear and you could finish the change in peace. Your tail had gotten much longer and your felt at the top of your head as small bumps began to form. Your hair had also changed color from from a lime green to a dark blue. Sitting down, you pulled off your boots as, sure enough, your toenails had gotten darker and your toes were beginning to fuse together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be so cool.\", you said to yourself, as you grew another inch upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was some unexpected pain that hit you deep in your stomach, like a swift kick in the groin. Concerned, you lifted up your pants and saw that your \"nuts\" had been sucked into your body! You could feel them expanding inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this?\", you said in a much higher voice,\"I'm becoming a FEMALE draenei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour horns were sprouting out and down your head, rather than up to the top of you skull like a male draenei's normally would, confirming your change in gender. Oh well, at least your experiment had worked and this could be even more interesting. Your felt your torso lengthen while all your gnome body fat shifted down and spread out across your butt. Your limbs were stretching out as well, becoming more dainty and feminine. You felt your skin, it was soft and smoother than you could ever hope it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair was growing out of your head now, producing long straight and gorgeous hair. Your eyesight increased in shades, you guessed that they were becoming bright blue draenei eyes now. Little hard dots were appearing on your forehead, leading up to your new horns. You had to stand on tippy toes now as the hooves of your feet were flattening to balance yourself. Every part of your body was becoming slimmer and more sexy. Your once chubby belly had flattened while your rumphad expanded and thrust your hips backwards. You had grown to over 6 feet by now as the tiny shop began to feel cramped. Your tail was fully grown with a thick golden ring going around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done now...\", you said in a very clear female draenei voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tingle in your pants made you look down as saw your manhood slowly shrink into your groin. Parallel to it's shrinking, breasts ballooned out to give yourself even more curves. When it was totally gone, only your new womanhood remained as a scar. You had completely changed into a draenei woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could walk around in your new form, a knock came at the door. </span></div></div>",

Her transformation was coming along as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sally, your color is coming in! Have a look in the mirror.\" You grabbed a nearby mirror from one of the piles of junk around your workshop and immediately shown it to her face. She giggled in delight at the very noticeable changes happening to her face. You saw her facial features becoming sharper and more elven in appearance. What amused Sally the most was the faint glow emerging in her eyes, a faint silvery sheen was coming, common in many night elves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all so strange, but weirdly fun!\" Sally said, inspecting her glimmering eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was pretty weird for me too,\" looking down at your breasts, then around at your tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's height meanwhile continued inching up and up. Her clothes were straining to contain her lengthening legs and torso. You helped her out of the offending garments by cutting the arm and leg sleeves, giving her body the freedom to grow up and outward. The purple coloration was spreading across her entire face now, as the discoloration spread to Sally's scalp her hair became affected as well. Sally's formerly bright pink hair was changing into an gorgeous deep blue hue. Her pigtails became undone as long, heavy, luxurious locks of blue hair descended down her head and backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally continued growing upwards, she was quickly meeting you in height at a little over seven feet tall, towering over the vast majority of humans, which is certainly exciting for a pair of gnomes such as yourselves. You could see the purple skin spreading to the lower regions of her body, engulfing her arms, belly, and was currently creeping down her legs at a steady pace. Sally looked back into the mirror and grinned, loving how luminescent her glowing eyes were becoming. Her eyebrows by this point have extended a few inches into the air, and were still growing. Her knife ears having finally settled at a permanent length of about a foot long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph!\" Suddenly Sally felt a tightness in her chest. Her new breasts were coming through, and the were heavily constrained by the remains of the shirt she was wearing. You helped her slip out of the ruins of shirt, revealing a large, and bountiful handful of very soft breasts, each around the size of Sally's head. Not to be outdone by her breasts, Sally's behind began to explode in all directions immediately after. Her butt grew outward, providing a bouncy and thick level of padding to display for the amusement of those behind her. By now Sally's clothes have become entirely shredded leaving the former gnome completely in the nude in you shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that was... cool,\" she said, examining the full changes to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you knew you always had a crush on Sally, you had to admit now she was becoming stunning beautiful. While all elves are considered to be extremely beyond beautiful and attractive, Sally made for an especially ravishing one. If you had a penis at the moment, you knew you'd be pitching a tent right about now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Glen?....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glen.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" was all you could stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were kind of zoning out there for a second. I was asking if you might have any extra clothes I cover myself up with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" you ran to the back to fetch a white crop top shirt and black pants she could wear. Sally gladly put the clothing on, you staring at her as she slipped into the light clothing. The clothes, in your opinion, left the perfect amount to the imagination. To you, Sally was the perfect girl, be she a gnome, a night elf, or anything on Azeroth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Glen... why don't we fool around a little?\" Sally asked seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh fool around?\" you choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fool around.\" Sally said as invitingly as possible.</span></div></div>",

You stepped inside and Sally activated the machine from where she stood. The process happened much like before, nothing happening immediately. A short time later you feel a tingling sensation below your knees. Your shin bones were shifting back forward, similar to your old gnome legs, but much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally handed you the same mirror from before, you could see your face changing as well. Your horns were receding back into your skull, while your face was taking on distinctly masculine features. While your luminescent, glowing blue eyes lost no intensity, their color shifted to a golden amber hue, not uncommon among night elves. As your face continued to change, your skin and hair were not unaffected either. The blue draenei skin gave way for purple, not unlike Sally's, if perhaps a shade lighter than her's. The dark blue hair began to shift to a green color, but not like your old lime green gnome hair, this was a more natural green, akin dark grass that could be found on a forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hips straightened out as the expansive draenei butt shrank away, to a lean night elf one. The hooves on your feet softened, becoming flesh and bone once more, then five bits separating out on each foot, becoming toes which you flexed as feeling returned to the lost appendages. You grew a few inches taller, bringing your eyes above Sally's head. You looked behind you, and saw the blue tail retract into your back, while it felt weird when your tail grew out from your backside, it felt even weirder when traveled back up your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles in your arms began to bulk up significantly, you could feel the strength flooding into your body. The large breasts on your chest receded back into the skin, replaced by hard pecs. Your abs came out to be very toned and cut. You saw Sally looking at your body with what appeared to be lust, she couldn't take her eyes off your increasingly sexy body. You knew this was the right decision to get Sally to be your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, you could feel a shifting in your loins. The vagina you once sported had sealed up, and you felt a poking sensation where a penis was emerging from your lower pelvis accompanied by two testicles. Your new manhood was far larger in proportion than your old gnomish one, for that you were secretly thankful for, but Sally was the one who might benefit the most from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glen you are so hot! I can't wait to ravish that hot bod of yours! Of course now we can show off our gorgeous bodies to all of my friends when we go on double-dates together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Date...?\" was all you could muster, too love-struck with the idea that you finally got together with the girl of your dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally grabbed your hand and quickly led you out the door, to where, you didn't know.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed the machine had worked yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sally, it's working. Your nose is changing. Here look in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the mirror in your shop and brought it in front of her. She giggled in delight as she poked the mass of brown. Her nostrils began to flare upward like a snout. More and more, a cow's nose was replacing her gnome one. Sally felt something sift through her hair and gently felt around her forehead. You saw two tiny forming horns appearing, both black in color. Her already large gnome ears began to lengthen and expand out from her skull, like a cow's. The horns were already a good inch long now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so strange.\" said Sally as she rubbed her budding horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, it was pretty weird when it happened to me too. You're growing fur now, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall chestnut colored hairs were sprouting out from her nose and quickly began to cover her face. That wasn't all. Her face was being pushed out, looking more like a snout now. Sally took these new changes with much enthusiasm and she felt all around her head. You noticed a sudden look of surprise fill her face and she looked down at her butt. You spotted a slight bulge in the back of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my tails growing.\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped her rip a hole in her pants to allow the new bushy cow tail to waggle around freely. The brown fur was covering most of her upper body now. Sally held out her arms and watched two of her fingers morph together to form a three fingered tauren hand before the fur swept over them. Her fingernails darkened into a blackish color. Her horns were probably a good six inches long now and her snout was completed, making her look like a tiny tauren from the waist up. Well...besides the pink mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me get my shoes off Glen?\" she asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and she sat down on your chair, accidentally sitting on her tail before moving it to the side. You grabbed the end of her boot and pulled with all your might. Her new grown hooves snagged the opening, making it uncomfortable for her. Eventually you got both boots off and breathed out in relief before tossing them aside. The fur was working it's way down her legs now. You noticed that her thighs and shins were reshaping themselves. Her upper leg moved forward while her knee buckled under it and pushed her lower leg back. The fur finally covered her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm a gnome sized tauren it seems.\" she stood and laughed, \"Is this as far as it goes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, you're growing now. Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's body was exploding out in all directions. Her neck craned forward giving the impression that she was hunching over. Her arms and legs lengthened to huge proportions, even longer than your draenei form's limbs. Best of all her curves were enhanced. As her shirt and pants snapped under the strain of her growth, you caught a glimpse of an impressive sized bosom and rear. Eventually she towered over you by almost a good foot. The chestnut colored tauren girl with a pink mane stood over her old gnome clothes, covering herself up as best as she could with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...that was just...awesome.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.\" you said and handed her a blanket to cover herself with. \"What do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and thought for a moment.</span></div></div>",

You can call it payment for letting me use the machine. Only on one condition though...You have to wear what I picked out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned. That probably meant she was going to pick something embarrassing for you. But still it would be better than the few shreds of clothing you had on now, whatever it was. Grabbing another blanket for yourself so you wouldn't be exposing yourself in public, you followed Sally to the Trade Distract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so odd the walk there. You practically tripped over your hooves when walking over the stone pathways several times, but at least you had gotten used to walking. Your new height wasn't exactly helping with this process though. You were so used to seeing things closer to the ground that you nearly hit your head on a torch once. Sally seemed to be taking in her new form with ease, it was almost like she had been planning for this for ages. The stares she got from people however made you wonder if you were going to get the guards called on you. A tauren walking around in the middle of Stormwind was just grounds for trouble. But Sally didn't seem to be bothered by it which made you relax a bit. It seemed like forever until you reached the tailor shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" said the shopkeeper, taken aback by having a giant tauren walk into his store, \"What...can I do you...ladies for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that would fit Sally was a large leather garb that still was barely able to cover her. Most of her stomach and legs were exposed and it took nearly an hour to help her get the stuff on. With few options to focus on for herself, she instead turned all her attention to your own wardrobe much to your dismay. She picked up a soft pink warp that left much of your cleavage exposed. For your pants, she picked out a neatly tied pair of cloth leggings that went up to your shins. Since you both had hooves, shoes were of no concern which you were thankful for. Sally paid the tailor and you both started to return back to your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun wasn't it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself...\" you mumbled as you tried to cover up your breasts as best as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned back to your shop, after receiving several whistles from men on the street, you discovered that...</span></div></div>",

Frantically you tried to pick them up, Sally helped as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone robbed me!\" you said at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now. And here I thought you decided in a new taste of redecorating. Did anything important get stolen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around. The cash box had been smashed into, but you only had a few pieces of copper in there. The robbers apparently didn't discover your cache of inventions which you had hidden under the floorboards. There were a few missing tools from the wall, mostly the expensive ones. But you could always make more. There was a big empty spot in the corner of the room though, right where you had put the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! They took the Transformogofier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" Sally replied blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The device that transformed us!\" you yelled at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. There's no need to freak out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to freak out??! Don't you understand?! We're stuck like this until we find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I thought you liked being like this. I like being a big tauren for once. I can beat the sprockets out of anyone that calls me short again.\" she grinned trying to cheer you up, \"Besides...I kinda like you this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal circumstances you would have been blushing madly at her comment. But this was serious. You needed to find this device if you ever wanted to be normal again. You pleaded with Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sally...We need to find this or we could be in big trouble here. In the wrong hands who knows what they could do with something like this. If you help, I promise you can stay the way you are. Just let me be able to return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, not wanting to go running all over Stormwind. \"Fine...I'll help you.

Plenty of shops had been broken into and robbed of all goods while the owners were out. They were two male rogues that made a small base by the moonwell in the Park District, pawning the items they nicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those thieves! Sally! I think I know who did it! You remember hearing about that night elf pair running amok through the city? I'll bet they did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to run off to the Park but Sally yanked on your collar to hold you back. \"Where do you think you're going little man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! I need to get them before they sell it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you going to do? Scold at them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think there's a better way?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"Glen...Let me give you a little lesson on being 'ladylike'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you walked towards the moonwell with Sally tailing you from behind. In the distance you spotted two night elf males, garbed in black and sitting at the edge of what appeared to be a large pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how much we got for it...\" Said one to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, who'd thought the pipsqueak could invent something that would be worth so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't seem to notice you yet. You remembered what Sally had said and made the most seductive pose you could. There had never been a time before where you had been more embarrassed then you were now. You cleared your throat and said in a forced sexual voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there boys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were anything other than a draenei, it would have sounded pathetic. Thankfully draenei women had a strange gift of making anything they said sound sexy with that accent of theirs. Both elves turned their attention to you, mouths agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh..h-hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were suddenly grateful for the outfit Sally picked out for you. You leaned over, showing off your cleavage to them. \"I'm looking for something...Would you kind gentlemen happen to know where I could find a large gnomish device? It has a large platform and dish. Like a transporter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-u-umm, w-we sold it,\" Said the elf on the right as he eyed your exposed bosom. \"S-some guy wanted to b-buy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" You felt so awkward, but you reached up and gently grabbed his face. \"And can you tell me who you sold it to? Pretty please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was about to roll on the ground with laughter. \"Great sockets Glen! I didn't know you were that good an actor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. \"Y-yea...Well thanks for your tips...I never want to do that again though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure,\" She said, wiping a tear from her eye. \"Who did they say they sold it to?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They gave me an address.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good right? I mean, we can just go there and explain our situation and we'll get it back. I'm sure he's a reasonable guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, you both found yourself on a large farm south of Goldshire. As you hopped the fence, you nearly landed in a pile of dung. There weren't many crops on the farmland, but judging by the smell and sounds the man had dozens of animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells like a zoo here!\" Said Sally as she held her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yea...We're on a farm...Come on, the sooner we get the Transformogifier back the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started moving forward but almost ran right into a giant cow. Sally caught you before you landed on the ground though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Glen. Don't go running into one of my cousins now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was odd about the cow though. You couldn't put your finger on it, but it seemed more intelligent looking than most cows. It looked at you with sad brown eyes. Sally tapped you on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You asked, turning away from the cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...Are pigs supposed to be blue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a fat blue sow, as it waddled across the field. It's eyes were a single shade of blue, which glowed. You began to have a very uneasy feeling about the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't like this...\" Said Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry.\" You tried to cheer her up. \"It's probably some sort of hybrid or something. I'll get anything this farmer's an inventor like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a hybrid....yea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you eventually tore yourselves away from staring at the many strange animals on the farm and made it to the door of the small farmhouse. You knocked and a small human with a straw hat answered the door. He had a piece of straw in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello there!\" He answered. \"It isn't too often I get guests out here! What can I do you ladies for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, h-hello sir.\" You replied. \"Sorry to bother you, but we're here about something you may have bought from a pair of elves. I'm the inventor of it you see, and they stole it from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmer thought for a moment. \"Oh you're talking about the machine-a-magiger I bought from Zep and Lenil?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure do! It's in the back. I'd be happy to give it back to you. But first, why don't you both come in and stay for a bit. I'm about to have dinner and having a few visitors would really spruce up the mood. Besides it's almost night anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and noticed that the sky had become black without you even noticing it. Bandits and thieves would be roaming the forest at this time of night. Sally seemed to understand as well, and the farmer welcomed you into his home. Inside was a large brightly lit dinning table. Roasted pork and vegetables of every kind littered the table. There were also three plates set up. It was almost like the farmer had been expecting company...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Farmer Oddwall! Most folks call me Oddball for some reason, ain't that weird? Well enough about me, let's dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly you hadn't eaten anything since breakfast, so you felt famished. You stuffed yourself silly with pork and veggies. Sally on the other hand ate only a small amount of lettuce. You leaned over to whisper to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay? You're not eating anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea...Just don't feel like eating anything else but lettuce...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you thought to yourself \"More food for me\". Oddly enough 'Oddball' didn't seem to be eating anything either. After dinner, he offered you both lodging in a bedroom. The day had been so tiring, so you were both asleep in an instant. The next day you woke up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully it wasn't a dangerous explosion, just the sort that made a mess of everything as it did with the gnome's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome girl removed the goggles from her eyes, black ashes outlined where they had been covering her freckled face. For a gnome, she was considered pretty cute but also pretty short standing just below three feet tall. Her outfit consisted of an over sized red robe and a brown belt with little glass bottle attached to it filled with different potions. Her hair was done up in a ponytail so that it wouldn't get in the way of her work, which was not going well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome's name was Val Flintsocket. But everyone called her \"Sparkie\" due to her peppy personality and constant mayhem she caused from her experiments. You see, Val had a dream to become a druid. It was an odd sort of goal, especially considering she was a gnome. But she had a strange affinity for nature around her; she studied herbs and medicine, she loved animals, and she even read every history book she could find on the subject of druids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, many of her kinsmen made fun of her and secluded her. She spent most of her time hiding away in a small house far in the wilderness of Dun Morogh trying to find some way to tap in the natural energies of druids. So far, her experiments proved to be fruitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" she yelled to herself, startling her pet snow rabbit 'Snowflake'. \"This is absolutely pointless! What am I doing wrong!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed a book opened and sat on the ground pouting. \"Three hints of Peacebloom...A pinch of Giant's Whiskers...I added all of this! Why doesn't it work!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, she chucked the book in the direction of Snowflake's cage. Both the book and the cage with the rabbit inside went toppling down to the floor with a thud. Val looked horror struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh! Snowflake, I'm sorry!\" she said, taking the rabbit out of the cage and hugging it gently. \"I lost my temper there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared outside for a minute. The snow was really howling out there, a storm had come up and she was so engrossed with her work that she didn't even notice it. Setting Snowflake down, Val grabbed her coat and she to the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you go anywhere. I just need some fresh air is all. Being cooped up in here all day is making me go a little crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she set off into the blizzard. The wind sharply cut the air and it was probably below freezing outside, but Val couldn't feel it. Her mind was too muddled by the formula for gaining druidic powers to notice anything. She was so close, she could feel it. But every time she got just a little bit closer the opportunity seemed to just vanish and she'd miss her chance. It was driving her insane. If only she could find someone who was a master of druids, someone who could understand how to acquire their powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stepped over a small hill, her big eyes noticed something lying in the snow.

One of the kaldorei!\" she cried, trying to dig even more frantically now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was a night elf doing so far away from Teldrassil remained a mystery to the gnome. Sure, some had been known to visit in Ironforge but the dwarf city was so far away from where Val lived that she practically lived in another province. She didn't have too much time to fuss about the details though, the color was quickly fading from the night elf's body. Judging by the outfit he was wearing, or what little there was of it, he was probably freezing to death. He wasn't doing much besides shivering and moaning as Val pulled him out with a mighty heave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a feat for the tiny gnome to haul the much larger night elf all the way back to her house but somehow she managed. Perhaps it was her determination to finally speak with a night elf to achieve her lifelong goal that drove her to such desperate actions. When she finally lunged the freezing elf into her home, she gently sat him down on her much too small couch and covered him in mountains of blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when she fed the elf a small vial of liquid which was a Warming Elixir she had created did the night elf open his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank....Y-You...\" he managed to get out before blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange night elf spent the next week knocked out in Val's small home. She was sure to provide him with different potions to restore his health and gave him warmth and comfort from the howling blizzard that had not subsided outside. Her research with finding a way to gain druid powers was put completely on hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf finally awoke on the seventh day. He seemed confused as to where he was at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal explained to him how she had been taking a walk to clear her mind and found him half frozen to death under a pile of snow just a short ways from her house. This only seemed to add to his confusion even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, where am I exactly? Winterspring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winterspring? Of course not, you're a long way from home. You're in the land of the dwarves, Dun Morogh.\" replied Val.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...Then I haven't a clue how I got here then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you at least remember your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Tork...Tork Silverwind. A druid of the Cenerion Circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal squealed with joy, causing Tork to furrow his brow somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Is something funny?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not at all! I'm just excited is all! You have no idea how long I've been waiting to meet a druid like you! I'm Val Flintsocket, but everyone calls me Sparkie!\" she said, roughly shaking the elf's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, pleased to meet you...I think. I'm curious as to why a gnome has so much interest in a druid like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've kind of...\" she blushed, most people laughed at her when she told them her goal in life. \"I've always wanted to be a druid like the night elves of old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tork didn't laugh and instead gave her a serious look. \"Truly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've always been close to nature and stuff. In fact I lived out here just to get away from all the commotion of the city, trying to find a way to tap into the power of nature. Nothing's worked so far...I guess you can say I'm kind of pathetic...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf smirked. \"Not at all. Many of our young aspire to become druids but lack the initial talent. With hard work though, they always pull through if they're dedicated enough though. I'm just surprised that one of the mortal races would have an interest in the spirits of nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal's hopes began to rise. \"Do you...Do you think you could make me into a druid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTork gave a warm smile. \"It's completely possible.\"</span></div></div>",

Essentially it is the holy ground for us druids, you'll find no more sacred place of nature. It would serve as an ideal training ground for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes as if envisioning the place in his mind. \"Enchanting glowing green fog, trees that have grown so high that you can't even see the sky, and the great city of Nighthaven right on the beautiful Lake Elune'ara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds delightful!\" chimed Val.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I could spend an afternoon explaining the wondrous qualities of Moonglade. But it would be much easier to take you there, would it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we!? Oh...But that's all the way in Kalimdor though, right? It'll take us weeks to get there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. I am rested well enough and ready to return. Let us go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night elf raised a palm in the air as if to grasp something. After a few seconds of focusing, he seemed to have grasped something in the air and was pulling on it. An eerie blue light began to emanate from the center of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take my free hand, Flintsocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome quietly obeyed and felt herself being yanked forward as if someone was squeezing her through a very tight hole. Time and space seemed to warp past her as she was sent flying forward. The last thing she remembered was landing on something hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...still she shows some promise...I will inspect her when she awakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal groaned slightly and rose from a bed which she had somehow landed in. That's when she realized that she was no longer in the cold comfort of her gnomish home but somewhere far more foreign and nature based.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed she was in was mostly made of leaves and bark, but was still oddly comfortable and warm. The room she was in appeared to be some sort of hollowed out stump. She didn't have time to observe all of her surroundings as a tall robed figure appeared in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Flintsocket, to Moonglade. You have my thanks for saving my pupil from certain death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnome blushed. \"It was no trouble at all...Though I wasn't expecting him to take me to Moonglade in thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night elf laughed, Val saw that he had a large white beard suggesting an old. \"Indeed, young Tork knows how to quickly get around the world. It was why we chose him for his mission. Anyway, I understand you came here to learn. An odd request, especially coming from the younger races.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, well...I'm determined to study the ways of druidism. If you'd be willing to teach me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, well your first mistake is thinking that being a druid is something you can learn out of a book. It's as much a way of life as it is spells and enchantments. In fact, you'd be right to say it's almost a religion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless...\" Val said firmly, stepping out of bed to make herself seem determined. \"I'd like to be taught, for I'm more than willing to listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old night elf laughed heartily. \"Impressive will. Very well, since you've granted us a favor I see it fit as to honor your request. But first you must choose which path you would start on by which being you'd like to learn from...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which being?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, the great spirits of the Bear and Cat, respectively. You will choose whom you wish to learn from first and then we will see if you have the gift.\"</span></div></div>",

It came of no surprise to anyone when you silver eyes shifted to the same golden glow off powerful druids. Immediately, you were sent to train by one of the last druids not asleep in the Emerald Dream for training. You were a tender of nature and a lover of growing things. Your name is Freia Swiftwind, a druid of the kaldorei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wore a very natural vestment of leaves and bark from the finest of trees in Ashenvale. A long skirt of orange leaves covered your legs. A headband made of vines kept your long blue hair out of your eyes. Azure markings covered your beautiful purple face, which depicted the sign of a druid. You were a force of nature and beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another day of protecting the forests of Ashenvale. During the third war your old master had fallen in battle on Mount Hyjal, leaving you to further your training on your own. Between the war and defending the forests from the violent orcs of the southern Durotar, you had learned much in the ways of combat. Spells that had once been used to grow plants and heal wounds were transformed into means of crushing enemies and cutting flesh.

Any living thing near the water was gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling perplexed by this wondrous display of nature, you slowly approached the gushing waters knocking away the tall grass as it tickled your arms. Even the bugs flying around were the size of your head as you ducked narrowly missing one that whizzed by. You reached the marble stone of the fountain and peered over the ledge. The waters were a deep light blue color, bits of magic sparkled in the air all around it. You spotted a small golden plate at the top of the marble which you read out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fountain of Growth. By Elune! What an amazing discovery.

You were beginning to feel slightly lighter on your feet than you had been before. Wasting no more time, you quickly undid your leather strap to free your compressed stomach.

It wasn't extremely significant, more like you had decided to pig out for all of Brewfest and earned a little pudge as a result. Only this wasn't fat that was covering your body, it was too light and didn't cause any sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween several deep breathes, you felt a slight tickle resonate within your stomach. It rose up from the breath in, but didn't return to its original size on the breath out. You were still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fel...I must hurry then.\" You threw yourself on top of Hushdawn with a surprisingly less amount of weight than you expected.

It was more than a little uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last series of jumps, Hushdawn leapt from a precipice, bounded from branch to branch, and landed gracefully in the middle of Astranaar.

She grabbed you in one of her trademark bear hugs and squeezed.  Normally, you didn't mind her hands-on attitude, but the pressure made you feel unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said, \"look at you!  I haven't seen you in weeks.  You look -- uh --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked you up and down, and you could almost see the realization popping into her head.  <i>Wow, Freia's getting fat.</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--h-healthy!\" she hastily finished, snapping her eyes back to your face when she realized she was staring at your midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" you said, running the fingers of one hand over the slightly convex curve of your belly, \"this is what I need to ask you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, well, just get some exercise and cut down on sweets a little and you'll be fine.

No!</i> you thought in sudden, horrified realization, but it was already too late.  You felt another large dollop of air passing down into your middle, filling you even fuller.  The laces on your leather vest grew tighter, straining to hold you in, and the seams of your riding chaps creaked ominously.   Elen's jaw dropped as your waistline grew an inch and a half in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need your help,\" you squeaked, trying to talk without talking in any more air.  \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElen shook her head.  \"I'd like to help you, but--\"</span></div></div>",

Thanks to that potion, and learning how to control your breathing, your growth has slowed.  In fact, you only really grow at night, probably thanks to unconsciously taking extra-large breathes.  Still, in a week's journey, you've probably taken in another two or three gallons of air, leaving you too bloated for most of your wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been cold enough for the last few days that you were able to put on heavy winter gear, which is a good thing.  Not only does it conceal your condition, it weighs you down a bit.  It's kept the other passengers on the Icebreaker from asking uncomfortable questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElen approachs from behind, putting a hand on your shoulder.   \"Doing okay, Freia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there!\" Elen chirps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost to Valgarde,\" you correct, \"but then we've got to go overland, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that's true,\" Elen admits.  \"But that's no big deal.  Just a little stroll in the snow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish you shared her optimism.  If her information is correct, the gnome you're looking for, an expert in what Elen calls 'bio-atmospheric internal recirculation', lives in a cramped research outpost bolted  onto a sheer ice wall deep in Icecrown glacier.  That's hardly what you'd call a stroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the worst part is, you're pretty sure Elen's supplies of the potion are drying up.  She hasn't said anything, but the last two doses have been a little skimpy.   If you were to run out, here... The thought makes you shudder even more than the frigid metal railing pressing into your swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so consumed with worries that you pay little attention as the Icebreaker navigates the narrow fjord and pulls into Valgarde's protected bay.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" Elen asks.  \"Boy, I could kill for something other than ship's rations.  All this <i>meat</i>.\"  She makes a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.  Feeling so full all the time, you've barely been able to stomach food, only forcing yourself to eat enough to stay alive and in fighting form.   \"You go ahead.   I'll try to find us passage to Icecrown.\"</span></div></div>",

It bounced off one of the moss-covered Stranglethorn trees, nearly brained her on the way back, and smacked into the straw training dummy. Oola's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThe first time I hit that stupid thing all day, and it's by mistake!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOola had sent spears into trees, into the ground, into the river, into distant huts, into a zeppelin which was passing overhead, and several times into her own feet -- if she were anything but a quick-healing troll, she would have crippled herself five times over. She'd even managed to send spears into previously thrown spears which were stuck in odd spots where she couldn't recover them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sad thing was, she wasn't even the worst shot in the tribe. Whoever'd named them the Wildspear probably hadn't meant it as a compliment. She'd really thought that with enough practice, she'd be able to achieve basic competence, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in some troll tribes, the daughters of the chieftain are pampered and waited upon hand and foot, filled with food and drowned in drink until they're nothing but balls of blubber, the better to show off the chieftain's wealth. In other tribes, the chieftains' daughters are great warriors in their own right, trained in the arts of fighting and hunting, and sculpted into musclebound Amazons who can cleave a dwarf in two with a single stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wildspear tribe wasn't like either of those. Oola was no soft princess or chiseled champion. She was just a skinny teenager. In fact, she was such a beanpole that, more than once, her loincloth had slipped off her lack-of-hips in the middle of an important ceremony, causing her blue skin to turn purple with embarrassment as she accidentally mooned the elders. Pimply skin and tusks that hadn't come in straight only added to the gawk factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to do something, and soon. The tribe wasn't strong enough to survive on its own, and if she distinguish herself, she'd end up married off to the son of some equally tiny and desperate tribe. The Noseroot, maybe, or the Slobbertusk, or even (shudder) the Bloodfarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo -- she would make a name for herself or die trying. She picked up the rock (it had served her better than the spear, anyway) and walked into the forest, resolve she would only come back when she deserved to. It wasn't long before she came to a crossroads on the jungle path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne branch led downwards, towards the eastern shore. Jaguero Isle wasn't more than a quick swim away. It was rumored that immense apes wandered through the fruit-laden forests of the island, ripe for the hunting. Perhaps if she returned with a trophy, she would prove herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother branch let north into the mountains. There, in the misty high reaches, lived the Stumblefist Ogres, clumsy brutes who were as pathetic among ogrekind as the Wildspear were among trolls. Still, one had to start somewhere, and slaughtering a few ogres was definitely a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third branch headed south, towards Booty Bay. All kinds of strange things, from lands so far off she could barely imagine how long it would take to walk there, could be found in that mysterious place. Maybe one of those clever little green creatures which swarmed all over that wooden honeycomb could solve her problem.</span></div></div>",

This one's layout isn't quite how you remember it, and each of the buttons have different text. \"Upload? I don't remember seeing that...\" A rather high resolution avatar stands in the center, \"But I must admit, these looks better than the screenshots!\" You look through all your options until you're satisfied...</span></div></div>",

Pick a Race and gender and step into a huge adventure. Choose what happens to the character; end in death or success. End up normal or \"changed\" somewhat. There are very few rules in this interactive. Any fetish is allowed so long as it ties into the story. Meaning please do not shrink the character then have inflate for some reason without properly explaining it. Be sure to keep it in the Warcraft universe. Other then that, have fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add on! I'm very lenient on what goes on in the story! Your ideas keep the story fresh and alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Cataclysm is out you might be wondering what world the story is based on...Personally I'm going to continue writing in the old world (I quit WoW before Cata came out) but you can write whenever you want. Just keep it interesting and logical, as far as I'm concerned there's no right or wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to mail me with questions or ideas.</td>",
