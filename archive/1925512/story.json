But once in a generation, they breed men worthy of entire sections of history textbooks, men who are the subject of debate and controversy, men for the ages, who will be remembered by every genereation that will come as long as history is recorded. When the Terran Colonial Republic broke up in A.D 3478, it splintered into three empires: The Confederation of Border Colonies, the Parliment of Core Worlds, and the Republic of Median Worlds. These worlds constantly found themselves at conflict, occasionally the Lasgun had to talk for them. But dispite politics, borders, and cultures, one thing traversed them all: The Mercantile Bureau of Colonial Resources, the megacorporation that had, as is the expression, fingers in every pie. Mining installations in the borders, Offices in the Median Worlds, Headquarters in the Core Worlds. It was the one thing remaining from the splitup of the Terran Colonial Republic.

It was a bustling city world, with brief patches of forest. He was a politician's son, born to Gir Helmschiled, his father, and Anna Helmschiled, his mother. His father was a muscular man, his mother was a more rotund woman who always wore a secretarial skirt and workshirt. Gorrask wasn't the type for politicking in the capitol so as soon as he graduated from his university, the Political Science University of Roggask, He moved to a world not far from the capitol, a habitational world named Hormant, in the Grishtall system, and ran up the political ladder.
