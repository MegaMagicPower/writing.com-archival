The wind was still, as if the world held its breath. The stars above were like spots of fire, brilliant and beyond counting. The glimmer of the southern lights shifted through the cool colors of blues, purples, and greens, shading the face of the woman before, except she wasn\u2019t really in front of you so much as towering above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was immense, the moon hovering just over her shoulder, casting a shadow upon you. You barely came up to the tops of her bare feet, which oddly enough refused to break through the s now. You looked down and noticed that you too were standing upon the snow. Craning your neck, you gazed pasted the flowing silk dress the figure wore and gazed intently upon her face, her white hair draped around her shoulders. However, she didn\u2019t seem to sense your presence, instead looking somewhere behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is done. The one who you sought to erase hath been erased.\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was cold as ice, her eyes changing to match the lights above. Looking behind you, you noticed more giants standing in the snow. They were clothed in furs, standing up to their knees in the snow. All heads were bowed in difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you great spirit.\u201d An old woman spoke, standing at the head of the group. You recognized her as the head priest of the southern water tribe. Her weathered voice shivered with emotion. The spirit continued speaking, ignoring the wise woman\u2019s thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom this day forth, a name hath been expunged from the world. However, none shall mark its passing. Though the marks of their actions shall yet remain, none shall remember that fateful being whose existence you hath undone. But, though your request I hath granted, be forewarned. Grave repercussions are yet to unfold.\u201d As the white haired spirit finished delivering her words, she vanished. In her place, empty air and smooth snow remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water tribesmen huddled in the dark found themselves suddenly alone, the cold tearing at them despite their furs. Strangely, you realized that you weren\u2019t cold. After a moment more of standing in the cold, the tribesmen all turned, presumably heading for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained where you were, your mind a haze of broken memories. Where were you? How did you get here? What were you doing in this place? These questions and many more flashed through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a question came to mind, and panic clutched at your chest. What was your name? No answer was forthcoming, so you set to searching your broken memory for any shred of your past. You found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you could remember how to navigate by the stars and a thousand other useful skills with perfect clarity, when you tried to remember even a minute before you had found yourself staring up at the spirit, your mind went blank. It was if everything before that moment had simply been erased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought flashed through your mind, and a glimmer of hope flashed through your mind. You knew how to fire bend, though you couldn\u2019t remember ever having been taught. You struck a horse stance, breathing deeply and exhaling slowly. Then, with all the effort available to you, you threw a punch, your red armor jingling as willed a fire ball into existence. Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t work.\u201d The cold, raspy whisper of the water spirit sounded from behind, startling you. Quickly, you whipped around, only to be confronted by a towering, white figure. She was sitting on the snow, her pale legs crossed and covered by her silken gown. Above, pale pink lips pursed together as if preparing for further speech and pale blue irises the color of ice stared down at you. A thousand threatened to bubble up all at once, but the spirit held up a finger to forestall you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you have many questions little one, but now is neither the place nor the time. However, do not fear, for I shall explain all things in good time.\u201d As she spoke, she lowered her hand, placing it upon the snow before you. You were only a little more than half the length of her middle finger. You paused a moment to consider before climbing up into her palm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting upon the cool flesh of the water spirit\u2019s palm, you found yourself oddly comfortable. The air around you should have been freezing, enough to kill a full sized adult in minutes without the proper protection. You weren\u2019t wearing the right protection, and you weren\u2019t full sized. Fire bending could be used to fight off the chill, but you couldn\u2019t fire bend anymore. You wondered why you weren\u2019t already dead. As the water spirit carried you across the flat expanse of the tundra around you, you asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is due to my power.\u201d Her voice was still the otherworldly rasp that it had been before, but it had somehow softened. A sad smile graced her pale cheeks as she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmaller objects freeze so much faster than larger ones. Had I left you unattended, you would have frozen solid in less than a minute.I'm also the one allowing you to stand upon the snow, rather than letting your armor drag you beneath. Their some of the few mercies I can offer you. \u201d You considered her words for a moment, before phrasing your next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to me? How did I end up this way?\u201d The spirits face grew sad at your question and long moments dragged by in silence. For a moment, you feared she might refuse to answer you, but eventually her lips parted, remorse threading through her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curse. One of the most powerful nonlethal curses a spirit can put upon a human. It erases you from the memory of the world, making it as if you had never existed in the eyes of man. Everything you have wrought is left untouched, a letter you may have written, a man you may have killed, but no one remembers who caused such actions. They look upon your signature, but remember not who wrote it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but you are reduced to insignificance. Perhaps it was meant as some form of mercy, to grant you life when death would have meant for a more thorough curse. Perhaps it was some form of torment, to realize that you were nothing and be forced to waste away as such. Who knows? The creator of the curse has long since been missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words shook you, leaving you feeling empty. Everything you had ever been, everything you had ever done, all of it had been taken from you. What was left? Your next question was bitter upon your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you were a threat, dead or alive.\u201d Outrage swept through you. How could you be a threat to anyone? But then, knowledge of the war between the fire nation and the rest of the world came to the fore of your mind. You couldn\u2019t remember seeing any part of it yourself, but you knew what horrors had been wrought in the name of conquest. The water spirit continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were once a fearsome leader amongst the fire nation, loyal and fierce. So, when rumors of a water bender amongst the southern water tribe, so long after the last had been thought to have been killed, you were sent. No one doubted your resolve. If water benders still walked amongst the south, you would find them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour orders were to eradicate all water benders in the South Pole, and you followed them religiously, until one day you succeeded. You found the water bender living in plain sight, hidden by their tribesmen. When you tried to apprehend them, the tribesmen rose up to stop you. You decided that the water tribe needed to be taught a lesson for defying the fire nation so earnestly, and that you would return in force. You were on your way back to your ship when you were ambushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour crew, your ship, and all trace of your visit were sunk off shore; however there was still the issue of your disappearance. You were well known as a capable and loyal captain with many friends amongst high ranking officials, and though other captain\u2019s disappearances might be overlooked, yours would not. An investigation would be sent. The tribe\u2019s treachery would be discovered. They needed you not only to disappear, but to have never existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the head priestess sought me out, pleading with me to aid her people. She didn\u2019t need to ask long, for I had watched over the southern water tribe for a great deal of time. I consider them my children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her of the curse, though it pained me to do so. Altering the very nature of the world in such a way, it\u2019s an abomination. However, it was necessary. They brought you to me, and I used my power. You remember the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutrage thrummed through your tiny being. War was one thing, but spirit magic was another. In war, you lived and died by your own strength. Your controlled your own fate. However, spirit magic robbed a mortal of such things. Those filthy southern savages had dealt you a fate far worse than death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, you fumed, sitting upon the spirit\u2019s hand as she walked across the snow. Where your final destination was and what waited you there were unimportant, only your anger mattered. You didn\u2019t know where the motivation for your anger came from, your memory of such teachings had been erased, but the lessons learned were firmly ingrained in your mind. It was all you had left of your past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the spirit stopped. Broken from your thoughts, you looked around, seeking some sort of identifying mark. Shocked, you realized that it had become morning already. When had that happened? Ahead, ice met ocean, and you realized that you were upon an ice sheet, floating over the open ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is where we part ways.\u201d The spirit was staring at you intently, her icy eyes showing no emotion. You looked around, noticing the complete absence of either shelter or resources. You were doubting your ability to survive in such a place as the spirit laid you upon the ground, your red armor clattering as she sat you upon the snow.</span></div></div>",

The area she had chosen to leave you was little better than a death sentence. There was no shelter, no fresh water, and absolutely no source of food. You shouted up at her, seeking to convince her not to abandon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! If you leave me here, I\u2019ll die.\u201d You voice punched through the utter silence. Icy eyes stared down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorry not, for someone shall be by shortly to pick you up, though they know it not. In fact, it is the very person who benefitted most from the erasing of your existence. If any are due the responsibility of your care, it is she.\u201d The spirit paused for a moment to allow you to take in her words before giving a small tut of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, your attire may complicate matters.\u201d The white haired figure waved her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly looked down at your red and black firebender armor where it clung to your form. Though the cause of your feelings had been forgotten, the familiar feel of steel yet inspired a sense of pride and familiarity deep within your soul. You couldn\u2019t remember anything you had experienced while wearing this armor, but judging by your attachment to it, you probably owned molded steel your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the metal around you began to fade, becoming wispy as it peeled away in smoky tendrils. You cried out in anguish, one more piece of your past life being stolen from you before your very eyes. You tried to clutch the tendrils as they snaked away, but you were helpless. It was like trying to catch smoke. Soon enough, you found yourself kneeling in the snow, naked and empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this hurts, but it is for the best. Your past life is lost to you now, and a fresh start is required to forge ahead.\u201d Her voice came from above, but your gaze was focused upon the snow between your naked knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the loss of the armor, you had nothing left of you old life. You were a blank slate, empty and devoid of meaning. Why couldn\u2019t you have just been killed? You kneeled naked in the snow for a long time before, with a start, you realized you were starting to feel cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head snapped upwards, seeking where the spirit had only moments ago stood, but finding only air. You were alone, the spirit had abandoned you. You looked down once more and noticed that the snow beneath you was slightly depressed. Even her magic was starting to abandon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the cold to penetrate your miniscule form. You were only two inches tall, give or take, and two inches of naked flesh did very little to retain body heat. It wasn\u2019t the full cold of the South Pole, else you wouldn\u2019t have lasted ten seconds, but the magic protecting you from its bite was steadily waning. Things were becoming grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the magic which had kept you from breaking through the snow, it was also starting to dissipate. At your light weight, the snow acted more like ice, breaking and fracturing in segments around your feet. You didn\u2019t sink into its white surface, but instead found yourself barefoot upon a sharp surface. It would only be a matter of time before some rogue shard cut you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood where you had been deposited, the wind began to pick up. It added to your chill, finally causing you to shiver. You felt foolish, standing in the cold to wait on someone you weren\u2019t even sure would come, but you had little other choice. A particularly violent gust came, tossing you face first onto the hard snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stiffly climbed back to your feet, you realized that you needed shelter. The winds were violent, and by now the chill was starting to dull your senses. If you were going to survive long enough to be discovered, you would need to escape the wind. You began to head off in search of shelter, the ice stinging your bare feet as you walked.</span></div></div>",

The wind was picking up, adding to your distress as you gradually began to grow numb. The soles of your feet were already unfeeling, and without feeling on the bottom of your feet you footing was an unsure thing. You were growing weak, and feared you might be unable to recover from any spill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, the ocean wouldn\u2019t have been the first location you searched for shelter, the ice surrounding the water tended to be wet and slick, but things were different for someone of your size. Out on the tundra, the wind would have scoured the surface flat for miles around, affording no shelter within walking distance. At the edges of the ice plates, the ice tended to crack and push against itself. Small fragments of ice were often pushed onto larger ones by the press. One such structure could offer you salvation, if you could get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the matter of your would be savior. If you were going to be discovered, it was far more likely that you would be discovered near the ocean. People canoed frequently in the South Pole, meaning that every ice edge represented a potential landing zone. The chances of being discovered while wandering within the tundra were slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked on for a minute or so, gradually growing colder, before the edge of the ice sheet finally resolved itself. Off in the distance, a wavering band of blue wavered over the white horizon. The smell of salt wafted through the air. Irregular shapes could be seen protruding into the field of blue. Even from this distance, jagged mounds of ice could be seen breaking the horizon. Shelter wouldn\u2019t be difficult to find amongst those icy outcroppings, but a long walk yet awaited you. Miserable from the cold, you bowed your head and continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a further five minutes, you were freezing. All feeling had receded in your arms and legs and your world was little more than cold and the thump of one step after another. You were facing down, watching your feet in cold misery, when the world around you suddenly grew dark. Looking up, a mound of ice several times your own height towered over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice before you obscured the sunlight, along with what little warmth it offered. An aura of cold was radiating from the large hunk of ice, and its surface gleamed, but as you risked a touch, you discovered the mass was dry. The waters must have been calm recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind suddenly picked up, and a wracking cough was forced from you. You bent double, needles pricking your lungs as you wheezed and sputtered. When you were finally finished, a fire had set in your lungs, alerting you to the stress that such violent outbursts would warrant. You needed to get out of the wind at the very least, or else even if you were discovered, you would simply die of a cough anyways.</span></div></div>",

Your feet no longer ached whenever you stepped upon them, but that didn\u2019t seem like a good thing at the moment. Looking down, you saw that they were coated in snow, the sharp crystals sticking to your nearly frozen flesh. If you didn\u2019t warm them up soon, you would probably lose a foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rounded the ice and the warming sun once more shone upon you. For a moment, you even felt warm. However, you knew it was only a relative warmth. With every moment which passed, you could feel the magic which kept you from freezing slowly weakening. You realized that you would die of cold long before the magic completely faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was for the best? You couldn\u2019t remember your past, nor could you remember your motivations, but instinctively you knew that the past you would have rather died than become some insignificant spec. However, the new you wasn\u2019t so prideful. Despite the horror which filled you at the thought of a life dependant on others for survival, your will to survive was strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the half way mark upon your trek around the ice mound, a sudden shape appeared. It was some sort of brown leather pouch, its top sealed tight with a sinew cord. It was set off some distance from the ice mound, meaning that if you did use it for shelter the ice wouldn\u2019t immediately rob you of any accumulated heat. With sudden elation, you realized that you might actually survive long enough to be rescued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith newfound enthusiasm, you bounded across the snow, eager to reach the newfound insulation. Your bare feet smacked loudly as they broke through the hard frozen snow and the wind whistled against your bare flesh, but it didn\u2019t matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally reached the leather pouch, you were in for another pleasant surprise. It was warm. You couldn\u2019t remember anything ever having felt so good, and then laughed at the thought. You couldn\u2019t remember anything beyond an hour ago. A new thought entered your head and your laughter grew in intensity. The bag was warm. Someone had been holding it not long ago. You were saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith half frozen limbs, you climbed onto the sack, knocking it onto its side despite being nearly twice your height. You shuffled onto the warm leather, eager to tear at the draw strings, to climb into its warm embrace. The heat soaked into you, despite the brief time which you had spent upon the leather surface. The soft jangle of equipment could be heard as you shuffled your way towards the knot at the top of the bag.</span></div></div>",

It was neat knot, coiling around the opening to seal it tight. You feared that the knot was far too tight for your nearly frozen hands to open, and soon enough your fears were gratified. You grasped the nearest coil and tugged at it, and a feeling of dread filled you as the knot refused to budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next minute, you tried to work your fingers in between the strips of sinew in order to pry the knot loose. Your efforts returned feeling to your hands, filling them with a throbbing, prickly pain. At one point, you even tried to bite through the bindings, but your efforts only left you with a sore jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the fading magic of the spirit protected you from the full bite of the southern cold, the bag enjoyed no such protection. The heat of the bag had faded after a dozen or so seconds, even as you had continued to work at the knot. Even now, the leather was stiffening beneath you. You couldn\u2019t have missed the bags owner by more than a minute, judging by how quickly the leather was losing its heat. Unfortunately you weren\u2019t sure whether or not you would survive long enough to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour progress slowed once more as the protective magic continued to fade. The momentary heat of the bag had only served to remind you of how cold you were, leaving you even more miserable than before. You could feel your hands growing numb, and with dread you realized that you didn\u2019t have the strength to undo the knot. You were stuck outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, you curled into a ball upon the cold surface of the leather beneath you. However, instead of gathering heat and insulating you as you had hoped, the leather remained cold. It was then that you realized your mistake. At your size, the surrounding cold was more than enough to overwhelm what little heat you could form, despite the insulation. The bag wouldn\u2019t save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was one bit of good that came from all of your efforts. Between the ice chunk and the depression in the bag within which you lay, the wind was mostly obscured. Not only that, but the leather beneath you was soft. Well, soft was a relative term when most feeling had left your body and a load of unknown tools lay hidden within the bag, but it was better than lying on the hard, frozen snow. Too tired to contemplate the thought of rising, you remained where you were, hoping to be discovered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world around you was beginning to fade as you lay upon the cold leather of the pouch. Your hands, your feet, your face, everything was lost to you within the void of numbness. Your eyelids felt heavy, and a deep drowsiness threatened to claim you. Above, the wind swirled past, setting snowflakes to dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this how it would end? Were you to simply die in the cold, not a soul to morn for the lonely, forgotten commander? A deep sadness began to claim you at such morbid thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeath was supposed to be the ending; the final chapter in the story of someone\u2019s life. However, what awaited you wasn\u2019t a conclusion, but non existence. All of your triumphs, all of your failures, the things you\u2019d loved and lost, all of it was gone. Your story was one that would never be written, never remembered. You yourself would be incapable of bringing your life\u2019s tale with you to the afterlife. The thought was saddening. What were you without your memories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. What was a man without his father\u2019s teachings? What was a woman without her mother\u2019s love? Everything which had shaped you, built you, and molded you throughout your life had simply ceased to exist. You were a blank slate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that really such a bad thing, all things considered? You were about to die after all. If you had been washed clean of everything which had made you great, you had also been washed clean of all your misdeeds. You couldn\u2019t remember what kind of person you had been, but a fresh start might have been nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, but that was just wishful thinking. Even now, you could feel your eyelids slipping slowly downward. Each blink brought your eyes closer closing forever. Any previous anger or outrage at your predicament was cooling, even as your body continued to cool. What you felt now was tired disappointment at the last flickering of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you found yourself staring up at the sky. Something had stirred you from your thoughts, halting your descent towards eternal sleep. Your eyelids hung heavily as you struggled to turn your head, seeking out what disturbance had caught your attention. It was only by the barest of margins that you managed to turn your head, catching sight of the beautiful young girl walking along the shore. She looked like an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun seemed to shine down upon her, making the white ring of fur around her blue leather hood seem a blazing halo. The rest of her coat and pants were blue as well, trimmed with white fur and complimented by leather boots, but this wasn\u2019t what caught your attention. No, it was her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright, blue disks the color of the sky glistened against a backdrop of pale, brown skin. A gentle nose sloped delicately above a half cocked smile. Her bangs were bound in twin braids which arced outward to fall behind her ears. A flash of light gleamed from somewhere beneath her chin, and you took note of the choker bound tightly around her slender neck, an amulet of some sort affixed at the nape. A light humming filled the air. The rest of her head was obscured beneath her hood, but somehow the girl seemed to exude an aura of gentleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sight you saw was that of the young girl's cheerful smile before you slipped into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katara walked towards the shore off in the distance, she couldn\u2019t help but hum. Today was a beautiful day. The sun was shining, the skies were clear, and only a light breeze blew. Best of all, Katara had caught up with all of her chores, leaving her an entire day to do as she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had chosen to practice her water bending, unskilled though it was. She was a waterbender, the last in the southern pole, which meant that she had no one else to teach her. She often felt alone, amongst people who couldn\u2019t understand what it was to be a bender, but that didn\u2019t matter when she was training alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It had been a relatively short walk from the village to the icy plot where she had finally chosen to practice. It was close enough that she wouldn\u2019t require the use of a canoe, yet far enough that she wouldn\u2019t disturb others. The snow was packed flat and hard in that area, allowing for relatively steady footing. Not only that, but the ice deposits from the spring crush had formed an ace barrier, giving succor from the wind which blew off of the ice plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Katara had really felt she needed this free time. Something had been bothering her since the other day, though she didn\u2019t know what, leaving her feeling angry and fearful, but for the life of her she couldn\u2019t remember what it had been. Eventually, she had chalked it up to mere restlessness. After a good night\u2019s sleep and waking to the prospect of a free day, Katara had nearly forgotten her earlier discomfort, almost as if by magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, spending the day away the village had left her without a few niceties. First of all, Katara had packed a breakfast of salted jerky in her pack, preferring not to waste the precious little free time she had. She had chewed the jerky on her way, and had even done an hour\u2019s practice before the salt had kicked in, filling her bladder to bursting. Denied the use of the village\u2019s facilities and fearful of passersby, Katara had been forced to relieve herself further away from the shore. Thus, did Katara find herself walking home, having relieved herself in the relative privacy of the abandoned plains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was yet young as Katara met the shore, turning to follow it back from her morning release. Her leather clothes and boots were snug and warm, rendering the chill of the southern pole mute. She felt so alive this morning, as if a great burden had been lifted as she slept. After a minute or so of walking, she spotted the place she\u2019d chosen to practice, her throat still buzzing with a happy tune.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Katara walked into the clearing where she had been training, she was already contemplating what she would practice next. She had a moderate talent for manipulating water, though she would need a lot more practice before it became useful, but she had yet to learn the basics of bending snow or ice. Perhaps she should spend the next hour or so trying to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the fledgling bender got close enough to see her pouch clearly, the smile slipped from her face. Her pouch was on its side, unlike how she had left it. Something or someone had tampered with her belongings. A surge of worry shot through Katara as she rushed towards her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag\u2019s contents weren\u2019t irreplaceable, unlike her mother\u2019s necklace, but they were important none the less; a fire starting kit, an emergency line and hook, and everything else she needed should trouble arise out on the open ice. They were important objects which any southern tribesmen would be loath to go without, even this close to their village. If something had happened to her stuff\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she drew nearer, it became apparent that the sack\u2019s bindings remained drawn tight. What\u2019s more, something had been placed upon the indented leather. About a dozen feet from her bag, she slowed to a walk, more curious now than alarmed. Well, this was odd. Upon reaching her toppled bag, Katara dropped to one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Strangely enough, what appeared to be a small doll rested upon her pack. It was a mere two inches long and was surprisingly stark naked. Looking closer, Katara realized that an insane amount of detail had been put into this doll as it was anatomically correct. Perhaps one of the local village children was playing some prank on her? However, the children wouldn\u2019t be allowed to wonder so far without adult supervision. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the Katara brought her gloved hand downward, seeking to pick the doll up for a closer inspection. However, the young waterbender\u2019s heart almost stopped when, just as she was about to pick up the strange object, it twitched. Katara fell over backwards in her surprise, tripping over her feet to fall flat on her butt in the snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarily, Katara collected herself and crept slowly towards her bag once more. What in the world was happening? It couldn\u2019t actually be a person could it? However, as Katara crept closer, the prone form remained still, leaving her unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Katara was wary. What if this were some spirit come to play tricks on her like in the children\u2019s stories? What if this was some other worldly creature come to take advantage? However, after a dozen or so seconds with no further movement from the strange figure, she decided against it. If it were really some spirit come to trick her into disaster, it would have done something by now, rather than just laying there. It had to be one of the village children playing a prank on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite the girl's surety that no actual magic was at play, she still feared to approach the doll. There was still something off, something she couldn't explain. She had been sure that the figure had moved of its own accord. After long moments of waiting, Katara\u2019s curiosity got the better of her. The cool air stung her hand as she slipped if from her cozy glove, and she gently pressed her bare hand forward to touch the figure upon her pouch. A touch of warmth licked her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of shock struck the young water tribeswoman before she finally collected herself. How could this be? Upon closer inspection, she realized the body before her wasn\u2019t nearly as warm as she had first thought. In fact, it was only a little warmer than the surrounding leather, which was itself little only a warmer than the snow. If this was in fact a living person, they weren\u2019t far off from freezing to death.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katara had a moment of astonishment as the magnitude of her situation hit her. The figure before her wasn\u2019t a doll, but a living breathing whatever it was. She still couldn\u2019t bring herself to believe that a human could end up that small, no matter what magic was at play, but the heat alone was enough to prove it alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought suddenly came unbidden into Katara\u2019s head. They were freezing to death! Sure, it wasn\u2019t nearly as fast as expected, but even in the few seconds that she had held her fingers against the prone form, she had noticed a drop in temperature. Another person\u2019s fate, human or not, rested solely in her hands. If left to their own devices, they would surely freeze and die. The responsibility which the fourteen year old girl now found resting upon her shoulders nearly paralyzed her with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara was a gentle soul. She had great empathy for others, seeking to spare them hurt whenever possible. The thought that someone might live or die because of her actions, that she could potentially be responsible for their tragic end filled her with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Katara didn\u2019t have time to worry. Instead, she jumped to action; biting her other glove to pull it off before gently scooping the miniature person up off of the pouch. She cupped her hands around the cooling form, heedless that she was now caressing the bare flesh of another person, in an attempt to warm them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a few minutes with her hands exposed, Katara realized her efforts were in vain. Instead of warming her charge, her hands began to cool. She tried breathing into her cupped palms, but it only slowed the heat loss. The warmth of her hands wasn\u2019t nearly enough to stave off the chill of the south, even on such a relatively warm day as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, it dawned upon Katara; she needed to try something else. The unconscious person currently cupped in her hands needed a greater hear source if they were going to survive. They needed a fire, dry blankets, and everything else which she didn\u2019t have. However, there was one place Katara could keep them. It was certainly warm, though the thought of placing a miniature person there made Katara blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara shook her head, dispelling the embarrassed hesitance which had been about to wash over her. This was another\u2019s life she was talking about. There was no room for modesty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hesitantly, Katara brought one of her hands up to the neck of her coat, hooking her finger and pulling it outward. Carefully, she held the tiny figure in her other hand, pressing it against her stomach in an attempt to keep them warm. However, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to move. Never in her life would the young bender have even considered what she was about to do unless another\u2019s life had depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this tiny person\u2019s life did depend on Katara finding him warmth. It was already apparent that hands alone weren\u2019t enough to keep something warm in the South Pole, and without warmth it was equally apparent that the little form curled within her hand would die. Her pockets were worse, and besides herself there wasn\u2019t another heat source within thirty minutes walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many ways in which Katara could warm the unconscious person, and every one of them made her blush. She could have use her armpit for heat, but she was fearful of smothering the unconscious charge. There was also the option of popping the frigid form in her mouth for warmth, but the thought of so much naked flesh against her tongue made her gasp. Then there was her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Katara was moderately well endowed for her age, her budding breasts having developed into sizable mounds. Though sensitive, the flesh was soft, warm, and capable of surrounding something as small as the limp form resting within her palm. Once more, the though alone was enough to make Katara blush, but when confronted with the alternatives, it seemed the safest bet. All other places were simply unthinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, that particular location posed its own problems. The peoples of the southern water tribe didn\u2019t use underwear. Instead, they crafted their clothing so that it was fur lined on both the inside and the outside. The fur offered much insulation, but not support; certainly not a place to store her tiny ward. However, Katara had that part figured out already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if she could only bring herself to take the first step. Taking a breath, Katara lifted her hand away from her belly, bring it upward towards the opening of her hood before lowering it down towards her cleavage. Without stopping to think, Katara dropped the hand holding her hood open, pressing her forearm just beneath her breasts. She gently placed the tiny person between her mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, a jolt of cold shot through the sensitive flesh, bringing a gasp from Katara. She felt her nipples harden as the cold form chilled her breasts. Blood flooded her face, pounding through her cheeks as she blushed even harder. Goose prickles flooded her skin and a tingle ran up her spine, and she found herself suddenly short of breath. She had gotten snot in her coat before, but it had never had an impact on her like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young tribeswoman was acutely aware of the foreign object lodged between her breasts as she crouched low to collect her gloves, careful not to release the pressure of her forearm beneath her chest as she slipped them on and set off towards the village.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you floated in the void between unconsciousness and death, you dreamed. You dreamed of the spirit who had placed the curse on you. She told you that you were safe now, that the cold would not claim you. You dreamed of a young girl hovering over you, her hands embracing you with warmth which soon faded. You dreamed you were engulfed in darkness and suddenly plunged into a soothing inferno, but that was impossible. There was no such place in the harsh South Pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you continued to claw your way out of unconsciousness, the feeling didn\u2019t fade. If anything, it grew stronger. Slowly, the feeling of a soft, furry surface beneath you came into focus along with the sense of bobbing up and down. A muffled, rhythmic thud could be heard pounding somewhere close by. Groggily you opened your eyes, only to discover darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you? The last thing you could remember was lying on a leather sack, your eyesight growing dim. Now, a sweltering heat enveloped you. Your hand strayed beneath you where tangled fur wrapped around your legs and nethers, but that wasn\u2019t where the heat was coming from. No, it was the silky smooth surface against which your back rested that filled you with heat; so hot when compared to your still chilled body that you feared being burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously you put out your hand, feeling the heated walls which now surrounded you. It was like stroking felt; the supple surface indenting beneath your gentle touch. You continued your probing, eventually drawing yourself to a crawl and investigating your surroundings. It soon became apparent that the tender walls around you formed a triangle, enclosing you in their warm embrace and leading you to question how you had arrived here in the first place, wherever here was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you probed at the curious walls around you, you couldn\u2019t help but feel that they were familiar. The texture, heat, and the way the gently pounding had increased in tempo during your explorations, it all seemed organic to you. Curious, you pushed into a corner, testing whether or not the walls would give. A high pitched yelp pierced the air above you, nearly deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Katara could do to remember to breathe as she put one foot in front of the other. She was no longer worried about her little charge; The gentle probing going on between her breasts had alerted her to her charge\u2019s good health, much to the embarrassment of Katara. Only adding to Katara\u2019s distress, she found her heartbeat quickening and the blood rushing to places other than her face. She couldn\u2019t actually be enjoying the stimulation, could she? She bit her lip at the thought, dismissing the thought as ridiculous while fearing otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only half a mile from the village, yet the distance seemed endless at the thought of enduring the ticklish sensation between her breasts the whole way. However, she was hesitant to bring her charge out into the naked chill of the southern air once more. She could still sense a deep chill radiating from her passenger. What if bringing them out caused a relapse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. She couldn\u2019t in good conscience do that. She had, after all, just gone through all this anguish to rescue the freezing figure. Besides, it\u2019s not as if she were enjoying\u2026 there was a sudden pressure between her mounds as the figure within tried to force its way between her breasts, bare flesh pushing against bare flesh, and a surprised yelp burst from Katara\u2019s lips. Katara suddenly stopped walking, struggling to stand up straight as her body threatened to hunch over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was wrong with me!?\u201d Katara thought angrily to herself. \u201cHere I am, enjoying the struggles of someone I\u2019m meant to be saving.\u201d The sudden admission of enjoyment caught Katara off guard. No! She didn\u2019t mean it. But it was too late; she\u2019d already admitted it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Katara was caught between shame, embarrassment, and arousal. The only boy her age in the village was her brother, she\u2019d never had to deal with this sort of thing before. She was so confused. However, as she felt her passenger begin to move once more, Katara became sure of one thing. She knew she had to put a stop to his struggles. Resolute, Katara raised her hand to her hood, pulling the bottom part open and bringing her mouth down so as to whisper into her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe still. I\u2019ll get you somewhere safe soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara wasn\u2019t sure if there was a response, but the figure stopped the probing, deciding instead to sit and lean against her sternum. With a sigh of relief, Katara resumed her journey home.</span></div></div>",

Last night\u2019s sleep had been terrible, as had all the nights before, but you had gotten used to it by now. Inky blackness surrounded you, robbing you of your sight, but this too you had grown used to. The air spelled of smoke and felt pleasantly warm, a stark contrast to cold which had wracked your body upon being first captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stretched and stepped off of the woolen rag which served as your bed, warm wood met your feet. Dinner shouldn\u2019t be too far away now. It was one of the few things you still had to look forward to since your capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on time, footsteps resounded somewhere outside of your prison. The anticipation made your mouth water. One good thing about the nature of your predicament was that food was overabundant. Pieces of sausage as large as a watermelon, enough cheese to make a pillow out of, an endless amount of bread. It was no replacement for the freedom you had once enjoyed, but it softened the loss somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps were growing louder. You covered your eyes in anticipation of what was to come next. Suddenly, with a rustle of cloth, light flooded your wooden box. It took a moment for your eyes to adjust, but when they finally did you looked upward in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering above you was a familiar face. Shoulder length black hair parted to frame a brutish face. Upon prominent brow were mounted angular eyebrows which arced at the end. A flat nose and a permanent frown shone from the face of Xin Fu, ringmaster of the Earth Rumble; an upcoming earthbending sport which involved knocking others outside of an arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face filled your entire field of vision, massive and intimidating. Even after more than a month of being three inches tall, you still weren\u2019t used to how massive others were. It never failed to frighten you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you were anxious for dinner and perhaps the opportunity to wash your doll\u2019s clothes. They were the only pair you had and they reeked with body odor. However, looking up at Xin Fu, you noticed an apparent lack of food. Even more startling, you noticed his expression was even sourer than you had seen it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn\u2019t always been so small. Not even three months ago you would have been able to look people in the eye without craning your neck. Your life had been a simple and happy one. That had all been taken from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who had taken it all away had been the guardian spirit of the forest surrounding your village. Your ancestors had worshiped it regularly for hundreds of years and it, in turn, had granted your village peace, prosperity, and protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, a forest fire raged through the forest. It felled tree and woodland creature alike in its ferocious rampage, leaving naught but blackened earth for several miles. The village, thankfully, remained undamaged, but it was discovered that someone in the village had started the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guardian spirit demanded the perpetrator be sent forth to atone for his crime, however the villagers were at a loss as to who would commit such a heinous act. In the end, they had decided to throw the blame upon yourself, a family less loner who took care of the village elder. Whether the spirit was feeling especially cruel or benevolent is a matter of perspective, but in the end I stood no more than three inches tall and the village was spared the wrath of their deity. What's worse, the spirit stole my name; striking it from both my own memory and that of everyone who ever knew me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when you returned alive, shrunken, shivering and naked the villagers had deemed you bad luck and doomed to bring misfortune upon their village. Unanimously, they decided to sell you to a wandering merchant as a freak and make a quick profit off of your misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than two months later you arrived in the earth city of Gaoling, where you were won in a bet by Xin Fu. Since then, he had been looking for ways to incorporate you into his earth rumble competition and to make a quick buck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the look on Xin Fu\u2019s face, you had little doubt all that was about to come to an end. How and why mattered little; what little semblance of stability you had was about to be stripped from you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your prize,\u201d Xin growled. His voice rumbled through your tiny form, making your teeth chatter and forcing you to cover your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d a soft, feminine voice retorted. You couldn\u2019t see their face, but from the bossiness and bluntness in their tone you judged them to be no proper lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a one of a kind treasure, just as promised. I you don\u2019t believe me, take a look for yourself.\u201d There was a hint of malicious humor in his voice as he spoke. Only silence greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your winnings and get out. I\u2019ll see you again when next you compete.\u201d And with that, Xin Fu covered your box with cloth once more, casting you into darkness. Roughly, the box was lifted and you went tumbling into a corner. Your woolen mat slid with you, tangling itself upon you and leaving you to struggle free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were moving. The soft sway of your new owner\u2019s steps slid you back and forth in your corner. The world grew cold and you figured you were outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall bodies weren\u2019t as good at maintaining a temperature as larger ones, so you dug deeply into the woolen cloth and shivered, hoping that you would arrive wherever you were going soon. You did no look forward to whatever fate awaited you, but at least it would be warmer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shivering had finally stopped, but you were far from warm. The soft swaying of your prison had even gone so far as to lull you into a half doze, but ultimately you found you were too anxious to truly sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swaying suddenly slowed, waking you to full awareness. Listening carefully, you picked up the sound of a door slowly creaking open. Soft footsteps and creaking wood broke the silence, but otherwise everything was still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden warmth slapped you, welcome to your frigid form. You tore off your cover, now seeming cold when compared to the air. The swaying had stopped, but the cautious footsteps continued even softer than before. Your new owner did not want to be discovered, wherever she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, when you were about to fall asleep once more, everything changed. A relieved sigh floated through the air and you were jolted as your box was sat upon some surface to rest. The grind of wood on wood signaled the opening of drawers, followed shortly by the wisp of clothes being changed. You sat there, anticipation mounting, as you awaited your first meeting with whoever had carried you to this foreign place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of footsteps, bold and no longer cautious, signaled the approach of your mysterious captor. You struggled to stand, wanting every millimeter you could muster, and took a deep breath as the cloth covering your box was removed and soft moonlight flooded into your box.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When your eyes finally adjusted, the face which greeted you wasn\u2019t what you were expecting. You had heard the light, feminine voice and known that the face you would see would be female, but the youth of your new captor took you by surprise. Not only that, but judging by the gruff style of speech you had heard earlier, you would have guessed them to be a rough neck. The face which looked down upon your fragile form was gently born. Smooth skin and high features suggested an aristocratic background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to catch your attention was the nose. It was a surprisingly delicate thing, gently sloped with a rounded tip. It added to the youthful appearance of the young girl before you. Long, smooth bangs obscured most of her face, parting to frame her face with rogue strands falling along her nose. The raven black hair sought to complement her snowy complexion, making you think of a snowflake; fragile and elegant. A hair band held a large bun in place at the back of her head. Tiny ears peeked out from between silky locks. A sleek, elegant neckprotruded from the collar of a white, sleeveless night gown. Pale lips pouted out in curiosity and thin eyebrows were arched curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that you noticed her eyes. They were glassy orbs of the palest green. A childish wonder shone brightly within their depths; like that found when opening a mystery. However, they weren\u2019t focused upon your person. Instead, they remained unfocused, staring in the general direction of your container. Xin Fu\u2019s earlier words rang through your thoughts and realized with pity that this child was blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what I got this time.\u201d The voice was pensive and excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, the girl set her palm flat against the side of the box, bringing her other hand around to flick its sides. A light tapping filled the room for a couple minutes. The girls face showed confusion. You wondered what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always have trouble with wood,\u201d she clucked softly to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tempted to call out to her, to let her know of your presence, but something on the young girls face gave you the impression that she was enjoying the act of discovering her prize. You didn\u2019t have the heart to rob a blind girl of her enjoyment, so instead you sat there quietly and waited for her to discover your nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t sense any sharp points and it didn\u2019t smell like iron. It\u2019s probably safe to just stick my hand inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalm upward, her hand sank down to the wood beside you. Gently, it slid towards you, moving to scoop you up. You had only been picked up a few times before, so you weren\u2019t so keen about the idea. However, before you could shout and spoil her surprise, the hand had already scooped you up. You let out a small squeak, terrified of the thought of being dropped. Clutching her thumb for dear life, you huddled there silently, too terrified to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the hand had raised a couple of inches, it almost did drop you. You felt the pit of your stomach sink as a sudden jerk rippled along her arm.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alive!\u201d the young girl squeaked.  Quickly, she regained her composure and brought her other hand over the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, she lowered her fingers to brush along your body. First, she slid along your head, ruffling your hair and pushing gently upon your neck. Gradually, she made her way downward along your back, pausing once more when she touched the clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression was growing more and more incredulous. No wonder. She couldn\u2019t have imagined that she would be getting a shrunken person in whatever deal she had struck. As she brushed along your ribs and legs, a ticklish sensation rippled through you. You giggled lightly, growing louder as she continued her probing, until you were nearly to tears and losing your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d The blind girl whispered in wonder. Her eyes shone brilliantly; two bright lights amongst a field of snow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You doubted she could even hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Hello.\u201d Apparently the child had exceptional hearing, as she seemed to understand you just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, she did not take into account the difference in size or your proximity to her mouth. You quickly had to cover your ears, lest her seemingly booming voice drive you deaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so loud please,\u201d you whimpered. In your short time of being shrunk, you had come to realize most people took for granted the fact that you were small and tended to treat you as normal in many fashions. Temperature impacted you greater, so when people left you too close or far away from a heat source you suffered, your metabolism was faster to compensate for higher needs (though your overall calorie intake had lessened considerably), and when people spoke, the vibration ripped through your body, shaking you to your core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Her voice was a whisper now. \u201cThe name\u2019s Toph. I suppose you\u2019re the one of a kind treasure I won. Do you have a name??\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t actually. It was stolen from me by a spirit.\u201d The memory still pained you. Losing you height had been one thing, but losing your identity had somehow brought you down to something less than human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on to explain about the forest fire and how the villagers had offered you up as a scapegoat to take the spirits wrath. The telling left you saddened and tired. Looking up, you saw your own feelings reflected in Toph\u2019s expression. Since being shrunk, you had never had the opportunity to talk to another person, and it felt nice to share your story with another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 I have no identity, no power, and no freedom. Those merchants who owned me before didn\u2019t even consider me human.\u201d You finish statements were ones of frustration, but they seemed to strike a chord within Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how you feel. People see me, blind and small, and think I can\u2019t take care of myself. Maids wait on me hand and foot, lest a injure myself. My parents refuse me any amount of freedom, lest I get lost or frightened. They don\u2019t even acknowledge my existence when they\u2019re out of the house. Hardly anybody even knows I exist. I feel like a doll; kept at home locked away. At least you\u2019re allowed to dress yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDress myself?\u201d you retorted. Now that you had someone to complain to, you weren\u2019t like to pass up the opportunity. \u201cDo you see any clothes nearby my size? I\u2019m lucky to even have the clothes I\u2019m wearing now. It doesn\u2019t take you an hour to walk to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not even allowed to go to the bathroom by myself lest the poor blind girl get lost in her own house. A maid has to accompany me everywhere I go. I never get a moment alone. What about you? Surely giant servings of food can\u2019t be all that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is when Xin\u2019s grubby fingers have been rubbed all over them before handing them to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both looked at one another for a time; an overly pampered blind girl and a shrunken, nameless nobody. And then the most amazing thing happened. We laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer laugh echoed through you, but you didn\u2019t care. Painful though it might be, it felt good. You hadn\u2019t laughed since you had been cursed, it was a welcome relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, your laughter finally subsided. A smile lit Toph\u2019s pale face, and to your surprise your own as well. Perhaps you weren\u2019t tall, perhaps you didn\u2019t have a name, but until a few moments ago you hadn\u2019t had a friend in the world. Not all change is bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at us, comparing how bad our lives are.\u201d Toph\u2019s voice rang with a hint of stifled giggles. \u201cAt least we\u2019re not alone anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s always that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if you lack a name, what should I call you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the question some thought, ultimately deciding it didn\u2019t matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, call me what you will. It doesn\u2019t make a difference to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTiny will do then for the time being,\u201d Toph\u2019s voice was warm. She wasn't alone anymore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shared the story of being passed from one merchant to another, she shared stories about dreams that she would never fulfill. Both of you shared stories of loneliness, yet all of the stories were told light heartedly because you both knew you were no longer alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never talked this long with anyone,\u201d Toph said at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even with your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever! To them I\u2019m a burden and a shame. The care for me out of responsibility, not love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. All parents love their children. It\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d Memories of your own mother drifted through you mind. The thought that you would never get to see her again nearly choked you. You may have a friend at last, but there are some things that cannot be replaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph sensed your sadness; she was really good at reading people despite her blindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were your parents like?\u201d she asked after a short pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sensitive subject. You hadn\u2019t seen them in so long that their faces were blurry in your memories. However, before you could begin talking about them Toph suddenly grew tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to hid you. Someone\u2019s coming.\u201d Toph\u2019s voice ripped through you once more, though this time it was little more than a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to hide me somewhere warm. I can\u2019t maintain my body heat well enough to survive a whole night alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you go back in the box?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Xin kept it next to a brazier at night to keep me warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you survive when you were on the road with that merchant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe kept me in a sack and slept with me in his sleeping bag.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph had a worried look upon her face. You could tell you didn\u2019t have much time. Quickly, she stuffed your box under the bed and pulled the blankets open. Careful not to drop you, she shuffled into bed and settled into a comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale moonlight winked out of sight as Toph brought the hand which held you beneath the covers, plunging your world into darkness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you surged beneath the covers, you were lost. Darkness engulfed you small form, terrifying you despite the large hand which supported you. You were surging downward, cloth brushing past your face, when you very suddenly found you decent halted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand which had been clutching you relinquished its grip, sending you sprawling upon the feather mattress. A wall of flesh pushed you from one side, forcing you against another. You found yourself trapped between bicep and ribs, and struggled for more room. With your hand, you felt a patch of flesh which offered less pressure, and gingerly pressed forward, deeper into the crevice. Toph was giggling from your struggles, she was terribly ticklish, when a maid slowly pushed through the door, lantern held aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph could no longer sense the maid through her feet, she was lying atop the mattress, but that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t aware of the maid. The maid\u2019s footsteps were thunderous to Toph\u2019s enhanced hearing and her breathing was heavy. The candle flooded the room with the smell of smoke, yet despite that Toph could still make out the smell of soap and daisy\u2019s. This woman was her personal maid, the one who attended her night and day. Her room was down the hall from Toph\u2019s, and though the blind girl had been careful to be quiet, she apparently hadn\u2019t been quiet enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you settled deeper into Toph\u2019s sleeveless armpit, she giggled once more. Thinking quickly, she passed it off as a whine and sat up, keeping her arm tucked tight so as to keep you from falling. She sat up straight and looked in her maid\u2019s direction, doing her best to ignore your struggles and praying that you\u2019d hold still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally managed to push forward, into a little pocket of open space, the smell hit you. An overpowering mixture of body odor and sweat slapped you in the face, making you gag. The smell was no surprise, it was an armpit after all, but its pungency took you aback. It shouldn\u2019t have surprised you so much, you were surrounded by armpit after all. You heard Toph let out a small whine. This couldn\u2019t be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world was turned upside down as you felt a rising motion. The pressure on your still trapped legs tripled as the girl squeezed her arm against her side. You desperately pried them loose, forcing the entirety of your body into Toph\u2019s armpit. You had to lay in the fetal position; there simply wasn\u2019t enough room for anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounced around in your fleshy hide away, bumping against smooth flesh coated in a thin layer of sweat. You jostled and smacked against you surroundings, but it was a snug fit. Thankfully, there wasn\u2019t much room for you to be thrown. You felt Toph stop moving and presumed Toph was sitting upright. You had a moment to lament that the smell would never leave you once you were free before the rumble of voices took your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToph, are you awake? I heard noise and I came to check on you,\u201d the maid\u2019s voice would have been sweet, had it not been muffled by the press of flesh all around you.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I woke you. I was only having a bad dream.\u201d Toph\u2019s voice, by comparison, boomed through you. Her body was acting as a conductor, carrying the sound of her voice to you in crystal clear intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019m here now. Do you want to tell me about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph shook her head, not wanting to speak lest the tightness of her voice betray the secret nestled in her armpit. She wanted the maid gone, but to order her to do so would raise suspicion. She had to play the helpless blind child act, though she despised it with all of her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything I can get you; water or warm milk perhaps? No? How about a story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph hated her maid. She didn\u2019t hate her as a person, she was only doing her job. No, she hated her because she represented what her parents thought of her. Weak, blind, helpless; her parents sought to coddle her like a fragile china vase. She longed to show them what she could do, to show off her earth bending and her independence, but to do so would be to risk both the little freedom she had and her new found friend. Toph swallowed her rage and kept up her act. She had done so many times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the young earth bender\u2019s armpit, things were getting hot. You weren\u2019t sure whether it was the natural heat building up, your added presence stimulating some response, or the stressful situation which Toph now faced, but the rancid pit which you found yourself stuck in resembled nothing more than an oven. At least, an oven coated in sweat and slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was choking you. At first you had begun to grow used to it, tolerating the smell with little difficulty, but as the conversation had drug on sweat began to coat your curled form. The stuff was rank and salty, and it coated every inch of your body. The soft skin, smooth and silky before, now squished whenever you moved against it. The whole ordeal was making you nauseous. You prayed the maid would just leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Toph, I can see that you\u2019re tired. I\u2019ll just leave you be for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid turned to leave, reaching for the doorknob to close it behind her. However, as Toph began to relax and let out a sigh of relief, the maid once more poked her head in to check on her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I go, do you need me to guide you to the restroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph had a second to feel frustrated before the maid mentioned the bathroom. However, once the word was said, the young bender realized that she did indeed need to use the bathroom; quite badly in fact. A cramp tore through her belly, an agonizing streak of lightning laced through her stomach, causing her to double over and scrunch up her face. When was the last time she had relieved herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph looked towards the maid for all the good it would do her. Atop her goose down bed, she was truly blind. She could neither tell how dark it was, nor whether the maid could have seen her reaction. The last thing she needed was a pushy maid forcing her to make a bathroom trip with her little visitor tucked away under her arm.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Toph tried to shoo the maid away, insisting that it was only a belly ache, but the maid wasn\u2019t fooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody makes a face like that over their stomach,\u201d clucked the older woman. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about bothering little old me neither. It\u2019s my job to take care of you after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Toph braced herself for the walk ahead. It wouldn\u2019t have been difficult to keep you hidden normally, but her belly was cramping. Her arm was already burning from the effort of keeping it so tightly pressed against her body. This would not be a pleasant walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the maid helped her out of bed, Toph was careful to ensure that it was her free arm by which the maid grasped her and shuffled out of bed. The maid helped the young girl to her doorway, each step uncomfortable in the extreme. Toph could feel sweat running freely from her closed armpit and worried for her companion for a moment before being coaxed to take another, awkward step. The ticklish sensation from her armpit told her he was probably in at least as much discomfort as she was. Toph sincerely hoped that her friend would be OK.</span></div></div>",

The smell had been overpowering, and the flesh around you had been penetrating you with a sickly body heat, but the movement was disorienting beyond belief. Though the hall of flesh had seemed snug at first, you now realized that it allowed just enough room for free movement. With every step, your miniscule form tossed and turned, unable to grasp the purchase required steady yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph, on the other hand, was fighting not to laugh. As you slid and rolled beneath her arm you stimulated her, causing a ticklish sensation. Being blind, her sense of touch had long ago grown more acute, only adding to her distress. Between that and the cramps tearing at her belly, Toph was struggling to maintain her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a minute or two of both her torment and yours, relief came into sight, so to speak. Toph knew where she was, she was just down the hall from the kitchens, which meant that just around the corner would be an restroom to relieve herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there Toph,\u201d the maid murmured, echoing her thoughts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All else, including her tiny passenger, were forgotten as she barged through the door, her maid waiting discretely on the other side of the door. Before the small girl even reached the chamber pot, she had already hiked her nightgown high. Without anything resembling the grace of a noble born lady, Toph planted her butt upon the cold, wooden seat which supported her above the pot. Absentmindedly, she noted that the pot had been cleaned before nightfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toph barged through the door, the movement\u2019s which jostled you became much more violent. You were disoriented, tossing and turning within the blind girl\u2019s damp pits, leaving you unable to tell up from down. A quick turn suddenly whipped you against one side of her pit, though only for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long would this confinement last? How much would you have to endure? The thoughts raced through your mind as the pit dropped out of your stomach. Was she sitting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was quickly answered as the pressure holding Toph\u2019s arm pressed against her side momentarily relaxed. The flesh beneath you parted, and feet shot through the gap. Your body followed a moment later as you plummeted towards a hard, iron landing. However, you were not to die this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the initial fall had taken you by surprise, you recovered almost immediately. You clutched at the cloth of Toph\u2019s nightgown as it raced by, hoping to stop your downward decent. However, the slickness of sweat and slime upon your hands weakened your grip. You caught a hold of the silky fabric twice and lost it twice before you felt yourself finally grip the fabric tightly enough to bring your decent to a stop, the remainder of the cloth only just brushing your chest before it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the luck which saved your life, it was your own body which failed you. Your hand had been jerked severely by the sudden stop, sending a jolt of pain through your body. It had robbed you of the precious moment which would have allowed you to grasp with your other hand, damning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the breath surged out of you, you felt your grip release. Terror gripped you as you flung your other arm upward, just missing the edge. Your back met the side of the pot, turning you as you slid down the iron slope. Your slide turned to a roll at the bottom, spinning and disorienting you. When you finally regained your senses, you found yourself lying face up on the bottom of the chamber pot. Though no light touched you, as it was night and Toph had no need of a candle, you could see nothing. Still, you imagined that you could just make out the curves of Toph\u2019s thighs and butt overhead, a valley of darkness held between them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toph was only just relaxing when she remembered the tiny person under her arm. A blush shot through her face at the thought of having her friend, a person she had first met less than six hours prior, stuck in the bathroom with her as she did her business. It was mortifying. Thankfully, his struggles within her pit had stopped, but she knew they were there. She should probably take him out and give him a bit of fresh air, but she didn\u2019t want him looking at her as she relieved herself; it would make it impossible to relax. She decided that she would just have to wait until after she was done to check up on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, within the black pot, your head was spinning. Between the initial impact with the side of the pot and the spinning involved in rolling down the side, it was hard to tell left from right. Surprisingly, you hadn\u2019t made a sound during your fall, due either to the thick iron absorbing the blow or the air rushing from your lungs in surprise as you first began to fall. Regardless, you had to stand up and tell Toph where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flopped onto your stomach, pressing your hands firmly against the ground as you slowly hoisted yourself up. Shaky legs supported your wobbling mass as you managed to stand upright. The effort left you nauseous, leaving you bent over and heaving. It was in this position that the first splashes hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm liquid didn\u2019t hit you directly. Instead, it curved towards what you assumed was the front of the pot. The musky reek of ammonia struck you, raising your nausea to new heights and causing you to retch. Tiny droplets splattered away to land upon you, soaking the rags which you counted as clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening, this can\u2019t be happening,\u201d you thought to yourself in horror. You needed to grasp your breath and shout an alarm, anything to stop the foamy torrent which now lapped at your ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took another few seconds for you to gather enough breath to shout, by which time the urine was lapping at your knees. The slight current from the still falling torrent threatened to topple you while the penetrating warmth left you feeling vile and sick. However, when you opened your mouth to shout for help, a deafening roar called out from above; a wet, sputtering accompanied by a foul breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had thought that your nose had stopped working before, but you had been wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph blushed as she broke wind, praying that the tiny man within her armpit couldn\u2019t hear the trickle of her pee or the sputtering of her farts. It was a futile prayer she knew, and for that her face was rosy pink. Her embarrassment was greater than anything she had ever felt before. If it had been someone she didn\u2019t care about, she probably wouldn\u2019t have given a thought to subjecting them to the darker functions of her body, so long as her parents never found out of course. However, this was someone she had befriended and who had befriended her. It was different somehow. That difference only deepened the red of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burbling groan rumbled though the small, blind girl\u2019s gut, signaling the approach of the slimy behemoth which had been growing deep inside her over the past hours. Its approach sent cold shivers down the young noble\u2019s spine. She wasn\u2019t looking forward to this, but it was necessary. All she could hope for is that it would end soon so she could rush back to her room and pretend she hadn\u2019t just taken a crap with her newest friend riding shotgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blast of wind had caught you at a bad time. You had just shouted, though you doubted it had been heard, and went to take another breath when the foul stink reached you. It was a damp stench, groping deeply into your mouth and lungs while clutching at you. You could taste and smell it as it surged to fill you. It clung to you like a damp cloth, coating you in a cloak from which there was no escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapsed, falling sideways into the noxious urine. Thankfully, the stream had stopped and the current had lessened, but still it rose to about mid thigh. For a moment, you head plunged beneath its musky surface, replacing the foul stench for one far more acrid. You surfaced reeking, coughing, and sputtering and had only just regained your footing when the first one came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast dropped down from the darkness above, its long, blunted head charging downward. In the darkness, you sensed an uneven roundness to it, giving it a bulbous sense to it. Had the scent of urine not been so choking, you doubtlessly would have been first alerted by its pungent, fecal odor. As things stood, it dropped down unannounced, catching you nearly by surprise as it splashed down directly next to your tiny form. The resulting splash flung you to the far side of the pot, far from danger yet still reeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pinching off the first of her pungent embarrassments, Toph found it easier to push out more. The damage had already been done. She had released her foul cargo in the presence of her newest acquaintance. Now, she just wanted to get it over with as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more slimy snakes slither out from deep within the young bender\u2019s bowels to lazily coil beneath her. However, despite her embarrassment, she truly felt relieved. She had been stressed of late and hadn\u2019t been able to relieve herself for a few days. It was only ill fortune that she had to drag her friend along to witness her relief. However, it wasn\u2019t like they wouldn\u2019t forgive her. Everyone experiences a little incontinence every once in a while. The words buoyed Toph as she cleansed herself and stood to leave. The thought of raising her armpit to allow her silent witness a better look at her handiwork still seemed unappealing however, so Toph decided to leave them where they were for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horror of your situation could only be hinted at through thought or word. Though you hadn\u2019t been near the center of the chamber pot, the horrid cargo which had been dropped had splashed you so violently with urine that you had nearly drowned. The stench which you had only grasped at earlier was now a choking monstrosity which fought to smother you. Little bits of solid waste had bombarded you, sticking to you and weighing you down towards a yellow death. Flavors and smells penetrated you, inescapable in their intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat which permeated your small form was perhaps the worst of it all. Your current, lesser mass left you vulnerable to temperature changes, amplifying the impact of the residual body heat. Where otherwise heat would have been welcome to your temperature sensitive body, it now acted instead to sap your strength. You needed to get her attention, but you would be better heard from the center of the pot. However, there was always the chance that a log might come crashing down, crushing you into the iron floor, but you had to try. You felt yourself staggering as you slogged your way towards the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToph!\u201d you yelled, your voice a hoarse croak as you called to your savior. You doubted she heard your puny voice, you yourself could scarcely hear it after all, buy you had to keep trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToph! Help me. Please.\u201d You voice seemed to gain strength the more you yelled. Why she hadn\u2019t noticed your absence so far was beyond you, but it didn\u2019t matter. You needed to be saved after all and she was the only one who could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hopes began to rise as you heard the wooden seat above groan with the shifting of weight. She had heard. Finally, you would be saved. However, you sigh of relief was short lived. A wad of soiled paper crashed into your face, pushing you into the steaming mass beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled free of the tangling mass just in time to catch the light footsteps of the small girl slipping out of the doorway. Heavier footsteps could be heard joining her on her way back to her room. Your salvation was leaving you behind to a cruel fate. The pot would eventually cool, and your body would be left wet and chill with nothing but cold iron to embrace you. Would you drown? Would you climb upon the solid waste to freeze to death instead? Or, spirits forbid, would you burrow into the muck to seek some remnant warmth at the core of the mounds of feces in some desperate, futile attempt to survive long enough to be tossed into a cesspit? The thoughts of your imminent doom caused you to unconsciously swallow, which you immediately regretted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toph was hurried along the halls by her maid, she couldn\u2019t help but think about the small person within her armpit. They had been silent and still for far too long and it was starting to worry her. Were they judging her? Were they angry? Had something happened to them? Worry plagued her as she finally reached her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to fetch you some water? How about I tuck you into bed?\u201d the maid\u2019s kindness was grating and Toph was nearly at her limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough! I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ll tuck myself into bed. Goodnight.\u201d And with that, the blind girl slammed the door in the older woman\u2019s face. Toph made her way over to her bed, crawling beneath the covers while making enough noise to satisfy her attendant. She settled in and waited for the maid to leave, listening intently as she obligingly shuffled off, muttering about poor manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the maid was finally out of earshot, Toph loosened her arm and opened her armpit to the cool night air. What was the matter with her friend? She had to know. However, where she had been expecting a plop from the drop of a small form rolling free of a cramped space, silence greeted her. Tenderly, she brushed her fingers along her cramping pit, but only sweat greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that her tiny friend was judging her. It wasn\u2019t that they were angry. It was something far worse. They weren\u2019t there. The lonely girl wracked her brain for where her only friend had gotten to and came to one horrifying conclusion.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smells and tastes had long sense faded into the background, becoming just one more torment in a menagerie of horrors. The iron pot and its contents had begun to cool already, leaving you wet and shivering. At first, you had been determined to simply sit and wait for Toph to find you, but with life threatening cold and exhaustion settling in, that course of action seemed less and less wise. At present, it was all you could do to keep your head above water. However, the stinking masses in the center of the bowl seemed to maintain their heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the heat from the edge where you stood, beaconing to you. They offered warmth, solid footing, and most importantly time in which Toph could come to rescue you. It might have been cold induced delirium or the exhaustion which drove you to your next course of action, but the alternative would certainly have been death. With those thoughts firmly in mind, you waded forward through the thigh deep urine once more in search of a lifeline to carry you through your peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the half submerged load and tiredly extended your hand outwards, the familiar slimy texture of shit met your hand. The wet surface was bulbous and rounded, just as you remembered from your momentary run in before. The thought of what you were about to do caused your already empty stomach to heave. However, as you touched the greasy surface, heat permeated your hand. With a tired resignation, you clambered onto the top of the filth for warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the presence of a heat source and a solid surface upon which to rest, your tormented body finally gave out. Consciousness slipped from your grasp and the world faded from your awareness. You aren\u2019t sure how long you slept or what you dreamt about, but it didn\u2019t matter. To you, nothing mattered but the brief respite from reality.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The surface beneath you was a cold lump of filth, now sucking what precious heat remained to you. Your body was numb and your senses were dull. It was the dead of night, so stark darkness greeted you when you finally managed to muster the strength to open your eyes. It was the end. You could feel your body starting its final decline into death. No more options remained to you except to close your eyes and go back to sleep. However, the question remained, why had you woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t really say that you cared what had awakened you from your final slumber, but a niggling curiosity at the back of your mind tickled at you incessantly. It tormented you, making you feel itchy all over, pushing you to stir. There was something important you were missing, something which you really ought to notice. With a surge of sensation, sound returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you? Please answer me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sob choked voice shook you with its proximity; the source would be directly above you. Your mind struggled to make sense of what was happening. Were you dreaming? Were you dead? The cogs began to whir as your brain shook of its lethargy. Toph had come to rescue you. She hadn\u2019t left you to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly, you forced air from your throat, straining to make a sound. However, nothing came out. The building ammonia fumes had robbed you of your voice. Not even so much as a squeak escaped you. Your salvation had arrived and you were powerless to alert her to your presence. You were about to give into despair when a thought struck you, a desperate thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph waited anxiously above the chamber pot, the scent of her own waste nearly gagging her, and hoping that she wasn\u2019t too late. She crouched over the wooden seat which ringed the rim; her hands placed upon the edges of the cast iron so as to better pick up any vibrations. She had been calling for nearly fifteen minutes now and still there had been no response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he hadn\u2019t fallen into the black iron pot? Maybe he was somewhere else entirely. However, the girl knew it was only wishful thinking. She would have felt him land through her feet had he dropped anywhere along the hall and she was sure he wasn\u2019t in her room. This was the only place he could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she hadn\u2019t been so preoccupied with being embarrassed she might have noticed her tiny friend\u2019s absence. She could have found him before any harm had come to him. The possabilities ran through her head. He might have died immediately upon landing. He could have drowned in her pee. He might have been crushed by her solid waste or buried and suffocated. Toph did her best to silence her sobs, but failed miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you? Please answer me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoss choked her words. They were the same words she had been muttering into her chamber pot for the past fifteen minutes with no response. If only she could see, she could have brought a candle with her and found her friend immediately. Toph felt helpless, reduced to holding her hands against the side of the pot and hoping for some signal. She couldn\u2019t even fish around blindly, lest she knock him under the surface of the acrid liquid beneath and drown him should he be incapacitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single tear dropped from Toph\u2019s cheek to splash in the urine. A soft ripple passed along its surface, easily visible to Toph through her hands. This was the final resting place of her first and only friend. She had killed him. The thought would stick with her always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo great was Toph\u2019s grief that she almost missed it. The final struggle of someone too tired to yell. The last grasp at hope for someone without any alternative. A single splash reverberated through the edges of the pot, and it wasn\u2019t a tear this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph\u2019s hand shot out; slowing near the surface and gingerly fishing for her prize. It didn\u2019t take long before she found them. With the tiny form grasped between her fingers, she lifted them high above what had nearly been their tomb into the palm of her other hand. The stench of waste followed them, but it didn\u2019t matter to the desperate girl. She enfolded the small form within her hands, pulling them close to her body to offer extra warmth. When the pounding of her own heart slowed, Toph could just barely make out another heartbeat. Her friend was alive; unconscious but alive. The tears that fell this time were from relief rather than grief.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world around you was one of darkness and close space. Four wooden walls enclosed your world, granting you a mere arm\u2019s length of space. Not a sliver of light penetrated your pine prison as you sat uncomfortably upon the wooden floor; your knees tucked tightly into your chest as you fought the nausea raging through your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the damned swaying. Back and forth your cage rocked, as if hung from a pendulum. You squeezed your knees tightly, fighting off the urge to retch as you listened to the soft, tapping noise which seemed to coincide ever so neatly with the motion of your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had awoken what felt like an eternity ago to find yourself in the hated, swaying prison, but it was far more likely to have been a mere hour. Upon regaining consciousness, a headache had greeted you, your head light and airy. Dully, you had tried to wrack your brain for any memory of where you were or how you had gotten here, but you drew a blank. In fact, you had realized that you couldn\u2019t remember much about the previous day save the fire lord\u2019s ascension to phoenix king and the announcement of a new fire lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it really been yesterday? Given the current state of your memory, you couldn\u2019t be sure how long you had lain unconscious, but for some reason you were sure that it had only been one day. Some memories started to resurface, and you vaguely remembered someone important approaching you. However, who it had been eluded you. Instead, you just felt a deep thread of terror at the thought of that person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden boom resounded through your container as the bottom struck something solid. You covered your ears, your nausea almost overcoming you as the sudden noise split your skull. The sudden noise had startled you, alone in the dark, but more pressingly it had aggravated you headache. A sudden thought surged to the forefront of your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I got on the wrong side of someone important? What if I were being hauled away for punishment?\u201d As panic started to grow within you, the wooden roof suddenly lifted away and light flooded your chamber, blinding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next minute huddled in a ball, waiting for your eyes to adjust to the ambient light now flooding your box. It wasn\u2019t that the light was especially bright, it was the light of a low burning fire, but having grown so accustomed to the dark it still left you blinded. However, as time passed the world around you began to come into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was the room. Given the limited view from the hole in the top of your chamber you couldn\u2019t see much of it, but even half blinded it was easily the largest room you had ever seen. The roof hung more than a hundred feet over head, stretching endlessly without support or pillar until it met a wall. And the wall itself, It was a massive thing with a single decoration. A banner baring the fire nation symbol stretching as far as the gap above you allowed you to perceive. Somewhere out of sight a bonfire of immense size must be burning, for the room was lit from corner to corner by fire light. The room\u2019s immense size was a thing of wonder, reminding you of exactly how small a thing you were in the eyes of the fire nation. It was at this banner that you gazed until your eyesight was fully restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe view must be magnificent from where you\u2019re standing.\u201d The voice came as a low whisper, yet it was as loud as someone shouting. Its tone was cool, and the words slithered as they reached your ears. A chill ran up your spine and you nearly jumped out of your skin in your haste to stand up and turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sea of shadow filled your vision at you gazed at the shadowed form before you. A black cloth dropped down from a crimson sash, outlined by gold with a sea of red to either side. To either side, red pillars flanked your box, rising upwards in a cascade of the finest silk. You followed these pillars upwards, passed ornate frill and upwards towards the chest piece; a black piece of cloth lined with gold which fanned downwards into a point at the sternum and upwards to form pointed shoulder pads. The fire nation insignia was emblazoned upon it. Resting at its apex was a red and golden collar, but it was what sprouted from that collar which took your full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck was a thing of beauty. Sleek and slender, its porcelain surface sprouted from the rich red collar. Following its slender curve a chin soon appeared, small and delicate, soon followed by a pair of ruby red lips. A flash of white peeked through their supple passage, and you realized that they were parted in a smirk. Two smooth, pale cheeks flanked a elegant nose, and you followed the subtle curve upwards until you reached those eyes. Those cold, cold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you took in the rest of the figure before you. Sharp eyebrows angled away, one raised in a wry gesture of amusement. Her jet black hair was pulled back in a neat bun, a sheet of obsidian flowing down her neck and framing her face. However, it was her eyes which kept drawing you back, icy portals that somehow oozed smug amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you suddenly realized you perspective. You were staring up at the figure before you. Not up as one might look at someone standing on a balcony above you, but up as someone would look at a mountain. She was colossal. You felt your knees trembling as the sheer impossibility of the situation sank in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to be dreaming, there was simply no other explanation. You brought your hand up in a harsh slap, trying to knock some sense back into yourself. However, as the ringing in your ears slowly faded the giant figure before you didn\u2019t fade. You weren\u2019t dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gazed up at the figure towering above, you realized that you weren\u2019t just shaking from shock of seeing a giantess. No, it was the way she looked at you, her hands planted to either side of your box as leaned over your insignificant existence. She exuded an aura of power, of authority which threatened to choke you. You legs finally lost strength, and you found yourself sitting upon the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, do you remember why you\u2019re here?\u201d the cold whisper washed over you once more, filling you with dread. You were filled with the urge to yell that you didn\u2019t remember anything, to get away, to escape the giant figure, but an itch started at the back of your mind. The itch grew stronger until it soon took hold of you. Suddenly, the previous day\u2019s events came rushing back to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were standing guard in the royal palace, an insignificant post guarding an old cellar, when she came. Azula, her arms clasped behind her back as she boldly strolled down the hallway. She approached you alone, wearing the magnificent crimson robes, her hair bound in a bun. So caught off guard were you at the sudden approach with by the next fire lord that you nearly fell as you rushed to kneel. Even in this lowly bit of the palace, you had heard the news of her ascension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had barely been an hour since the phoenix king Ozai had ascended, leaving his daughter the title of fire lord and yet here she was. Something was up. Shouldn\u2019t the next fire lord be off preparing for her ceremony, not wandering around in the bowels of the palace? However, it wasn\u2019t your place to question. You remained kneeling, patiently waiting for princess Azula to pass. However, instead of walking past, she stopped; turning towards you as you knelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise.\u201d That one word carried such power, such authority. It was as if an invisible hand reached into your core and squeezed, forcing you to obey. You rose to your feet in a surprisingly steady motion, her command lending you confidence. You were spellbound as you stood up to your full height, your back straight and proud as you looked to your liege for commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you stood there awaiting the command of the fire lord to be, the intimidating figure before you said nothing. Instead, she simply stared at you, eyeing your face as if you were some prized goat to be auctioned off. Her eyes chilled you. You had no doubt that as she looked at you; she wasn\u2019t measuring a guard at his post, but instead was checking the quality of a tool; seeing whether or not you fit her need. To her, you were not a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thoughts robbed you of your previous resolved, bringing out the nervous boy within you once more. You were only sixteen, having received this post at the pleading of your father, a lowly official of no import. You were a nobody. Why was the next fire lord so interested in you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do.\u201d Her voice was cold and emotionless. A chill ran down your spine and you realized you were trembling. Azula was several inches shorter than you, two years younger than you, and probably fifty pounds lighter than you, but it didn\u2019t matter. One look in her eyes filled you with an instinctual terror, like a mouse staring at a lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2026My Lord?\u201d Your voice trembled and broke. It was as pathetic a sight as you could ever imagine and it only made you feel more exposed. However, Azula only smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only my brother were so timid. It would make things so much easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for more information, but Azula made no move to answer. Instead she only stared at you further, a sinister smile playing across her face. With a shock, you realized she was enjoying your discomfort. However, after a while she spoke once more, her voice a low rasp as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you know, I am to become the fire lord three days from now as Sozin\u2019s Comet lights the sky. That leaves me two days to myself, for meditation usually but I have no need for such a thing. Instead, I\u2019d like to spend the time with some\u2026 old friends of mine.\u201d She let a pause hang in the air, almost daring you to break the silence. However, when you remained silent she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, these dear friends of mine have done me a\u2026 disservice recently. A betrayal if you will. I was furious at the time, but now I\u2019ve realized that they hold a very special place in my heart and I would be loathed to lose their companionship. In fact, the fault for their betrayal lies with myself really. I didn\u2019t spend enough time reinforcing our relationship, reminding them of exactly what they were to me. Now, I\u2019m seeking a way to reconcile our differences, and so that\u2019s where you come in.\u201d Her gaze narrowed, her golden eyes burning with a predatory light as they focused intently upon you. You tried your best to shrivel away, to draw into yourself and hide from the world, but her eyes pierced you. There was nowhere to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, our little disagreement was centered around a boy; my brother, whom you\u2019ve no doubt heard plenty about.  So, I wanted to surprise them by bringing Zuko with me to share the news of my rise to fire lord. However, little Zuzu is nowhere to be found and I have so little time to look for him. So, I asked around to see if anyone knew of someone who could take his place, a stand in if you will. The guards told me of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the right height, you have the right build, your hairs in about the same style, and your voices even sound similar. Heck, you were even born in the same month. The only real difference is the scar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, panic struck you. A scar! Oh spirits, she was going to burn you. Your whole body shook with a fear you just couldn\u2019t control. You wanted to run, to hide, to scream, to cry, but you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to move. Azula brought her hand up slowly, gently placing her right palm over your left eye. Slowly, she leaned inwards until her lips were beside your right ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already made some arrangements to help you look a bit more like my brother. You will help me, won\u2019t you?\u201d Her words came as a barely audible whisper; low, sinister, and almost seductive. You knew the question was only a formality. A barely perceptible nod of your head was all it took and you found yourself being rushed away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Less than an hour later, you found yourself standing outside of a side gate to the palace, cloaked and hooded as you waited on a carriage to arrive. Azula had harped on the importance of secrecy, that her true destination had to be kept secret along with your own involvement. As things stood, the official story was that she was seeking the solitude of a nearby cottage in order to meditate on her upcoming ascension to fire lord. The truth was far less admirable. After the carriage pulled up and everyone boarded, Azula finally filled you in on her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour real destination was the Boiling Rock, a high security Fire Nation prison surrounded by a boiling lake. Azula had been unable to secure a full size zeppelin this close to the invasion, but she had still managed to get a hold of one of the smaller, prototype zeppelins. The plan was to meet up with the zeppelin crew on the mountain overlooking the cottage sometime after midnight, abandoning their small entourage in order travel quicker. By zeppelin, you would reach the Boiling Rock in a little over six hours, but there was one last thing to take care of before you left; your disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this part which worried you most of all. According to Azula, there was a medium of some kind which lived within the woods not too far away. She had sent a messenger to the \u201cspirit whisperer,\u201d as she preferred to call herself, in order to arrange for a disguise good enough to fool both prince Zuko\u2019s girlfriend Mai and her friend Ty Lee that you were in fact Zuko.  At this you expressed your doubts, there were many charlatans who claimed to have spirits, but upon speaking Azula had merely silenced you with a look. You spent the rest of the ride in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight had fallen by the time you arrived at your destination, a small dirt path which meandered into dense woods. Azula immediately dismounted, motioning for the escort to wait as you moved to follow her. You eyed the shadowed pathway, feeling worried at the prospect of entering such a place without the protection of armored firebenders. However, a glance at Azula\u2019s impatient face half lit by the moonlight quelled such thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay close and keep silent.\u201d Azula\u2019s voice stood out against the dead silence of the night as you left the carriage behind and entered the woods before you. An eerie mood hung in the air as you followed your lord into the woods, wisps of fog nipping at your ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was a scant crescent hanging in the sky, offering little light. However, it was enough to cast shadows through to where it broke through the canopy above, making imagined beasts suddenly rear up only to sink back into the ground a moment later. The hair on the back of your neck stood on end as you fought the urge to run. Suddenly, you jumped as a fire blazed up ahead; banishing much of the darkness and causing the shadow beasts to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula stood before you, as calm and serene as if she were in the brightest hall. The hellish firelight cast a played across her face and setting her eyes afire, making her look for all the world a demon in the night. You had a moment to wonder whether the shadows were retreating from her light, or whether they were fleeing from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a cleared throat rent the air, and suddenly you realized what she intended. You felt foolish.  Here you were, a trained Fire Nation guard afraid of a little darkness. Quickly, you used your own bending abilities, igniting a flame within your hand and further banishing the haunting shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula turned around once more and strode off, leaving you to follow without a word. Despite your lights, the forest seemed to hover; thick, leafed branches looming menacingly as if about to snatch you from the ground. However, you felt oddly safe with Azula by your side. If there truly were demons lurking in the darkness, they were nothing when compared to Azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking in the fire lit darkness for fifteen minute, Azula suddenly halted. Caught off guard, you nearly ran into her as you struggled to stop.At first you couldn\u2019t tell why she had stopped, for the firelight had robbed you of all night vision. However, after a moment the reason became apparent. Something was out there, lurking in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome out where I can see you.\u201d Azula\u2019s cold voice seemed to hold an edge to it, like the sound a knife makes as it\u2019s pulled from its sheathe, yet no response came. Annoyed, Azula suddenly lifted the arm in which her flame rested, filling the night sky with a pillar of ghostly blue flame nearly twenty feet tall. It burned straight through the branches above, setting the canopy ablaze and raining charred bits of wood upon the two of you. Though the sudden light still left you blinking, your own flames had robbed you of night vision, sparing you much of the blinding effect. As you looked out at the dense forest around you, you saw nothing. Perhaps you had only imagined the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey said I would know you by your blue flames.\u201d The voice was a cold rasp, like dry bones rubbing together. It was almost otherworldly, and if possible filled you with even more fear than Azula did. However, no matter how hard you looked you couldn\u2019t find the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so you know me. Come out.\u201d It was apparent that Azula was running thin on patience. Her voice was wound tight, as if she wanted nothing more than to burn the entire forest down. Instead, she lowered her flame once more. It returned to the docile flame it had been before, however it remained blue as opposed to the brilliant orange it had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an old woman seemed to materialize from behind a tree. Her long, white hair seemed brittle at straw and barely any flesh seemed to cling to her bones. She was wrinkled and hunched, yet her eyes blazed with an ageless light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Azula\u2019s answer was curt. Looking closer, you even saw a bead of sweat fall down her cheek. Could she be\u2026 frightened!? No. It was impossible. However, the more you looked, the more you became sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt the urge to run like never before. Azula was afraid! What had you gotten yourself into? You realized suddenly that no one knew where you were, that if you were to disappear right now, no one would know a thing about it. You struggled to run, to flee, to get away as fast as you could, but you found you couldn\u2019t move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA protective charm, to fight off half the curse.\u201d It was the crone again, yet somehow she was directly in front of you, lifting a necklace over your head. She was so close that you could smell her breath, a dense wave of moist garlic and rot. Fear strangled you, threatening to choke the air from your lungs as the fire in your frozen hand went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes were spent breathing rapidly, unable to move. Otherworldly creatures flew overhead and monsters danced amongst the fog. The old crone sang and chanted and mumbled words you couldn\u2019t understand. Azula stood off to the side, watching intently as the witch did her work, her eyes gleaming with morbid fascination. Eventually searing pain overcame your body, breaking whatever spell had held you as a scream tore from your lungs. Darkness closed around your vision as the ground rushed upwards to meet you and you knew no more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow, do you remember why you\u2019re here?\u201d Azula\u2019s cool whisper glided over you once more, snapping you back to the present. What was happening? The witch was supposed to have made you look like Prince Zuko, not shrink you. Mildly panicked, you called out to the towering figure above, momentarily forgetting you fear of Azula as you demanded answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked!\u201d The almost childlike twinkle in Azula\u2019s eyes had magnified as your words had reached her, only serving to unsettle you further, and with growing apprehension you realized that she no longer gazed at you as she might a tool, but rather with predatory desire. Somehow, it was infinitely more unnerving than being considered insignificant. Hesitantly, you called out once more, stopping as a grin split the pale visage above..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be wondering what\u2019s going on? Well, you know how I said the witch was going to make you look more like my brother? Well, that wasn\u2019t the whole truth. You see, if I were to drag Zuko in, bound, gagged, and helpless, Mai and Ty Lee would, of course, be distraught. However, that\u2019s not good enough; at least not for what I want. I want them to see my brother, the person for whom they betrayed me, reduced to something\u2026 less than human.\u201d Azula paused for a moment, letting her words sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranted, I would have rather had little Zuzu here to play with instead of you. In fact, I was originally going to wait until he was captured before carrying out my revenge, but father unexpectedly abdicated his throne to me. Not an unwanted change, mind you, but it forced me to move my plans up none the less. In two days I will become the next fire lord and I\u2019ll no longer have the time to play with my dear brother. The responsibilities of being fire lord and aiding in the war effort will devour all my time, robbing me of my chance at revenge for some time to come. However, having someone who looks just like him is the next best thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were unconscious, I had the witch put another charm on you. It\u2019s a simple illusion, using what those present know of Zuko to craft the charm. It masks your appearance, facial expressions, voice, and even changes what you say. Why, for a moment I almost forgot you really weren\u2019t my brother, what with your petty defiance. So proud. So naive. Just like little Zuzu.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind went blank for a moment as the implications ran through your mind. Less than human, Azula considered you less than human at this size. She had been talking about Prince Zuko at the time, so surly she couldn\u2019t have meant you. However, the calculating eyes above you said otherwise. No, you had to stay hopeful. This was your chance to rise in rank, by winning the favor of the next fire lord. Crushing doubts clung to you like cobwebs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula had intended to shrink her brother in order to reduce him to something less than human, and had instead settled for you. Were you less than human in her eyes? Judging by her earlier regard for you, it might be an improvement if she considered you so. Humans were mere tools in her eyes, to be used and discarded, but the desire in her eyes\u2026 Was that truly better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, the implication that she had almost forgotten you weren\u2019t her brother was unsettling. It might have been a mere jest, but Azula\u2019s hatred for her brother was wildly known. She had even laughed as her father burned Prince Zuko\u2019s face. The thought that Azula might forget who you were, even for a moment, filled you with mortal fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called out to the titaness above you, voicing your concerns on the matter despite, no because of your fear of her. It was one thing to impersonate Prince Zuko at full size, but being shrunken was another thing. You were completely dependent on Azula for your well being, a prospect no sane creature would find comforting. Not only that, but thinking further, nobody but the witch even knew you were shrunken. If you were to just disappear\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to voice your worries, you quickly realized you were in over your head. You had agreed to help Azula because the alternative, displeasing the next fire lord and losing any chance of political advancement, had left you feeling as if you had no choice in the matter. However, seeing the peril you were in at the moment, such things seemed insignificant. Swallowing, you called out to Azula, announcing that you would no longer be participating in her revenge. Her response came as a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was more the lack of a response that surprised you. It was as if your words didn\u2019t reach her ears. That same predatory grin remained splayed across her face, refusing to even twitch at your open defiance. You had expected outrage or anger, but none of that showed. If anything, she seemed even more excited than before. Looking into her eyes, you noticed a gleam there, something you had neither noticed nor considered before. Was that\u2026 madness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not very bright are you? I told you, the charm changes what you say. When you speak, I hear my weakling little brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood froze in your veins at her words. No, this wasn\u2019t right. You didn\u2019t want to participate in Azula\u2019s petty revenge anymore. It wasn\u2019t worth it. How could you trust someone who hadn\u2019t even treated you as a person at full size to take care of you in your current condition? How could you trust someone who couldn\u2019t even hear your words?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair gripped you and your legs gave out, dropping you onto the hard wood floor of your box. The world around you seemed distant as you contemplated your current condition. You suddenly found yourself hunched over, dry heaving onto the floor. Could things get any worse? A sudden, thunderous rap rang through the room about you and Azula\u2019s face quickly drew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Azula tore her gaze from you, lifting her head and gazing towards the door as she spoke. Irritation flooded her voice, causing the guard on the other side of the door to pause before continuing hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at the boiling rock my lord. The airship will be landing shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent. Have the prisoners prepared as per my instructions upon our arrival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her attention back to you, Azula drew closer once more, though not as uncomfortably near as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThough it doesn\u2019t matter what you say, be sure to struggle and speak often enough to keep those traitors worried. Do that, and your reward will be great upon our return to the capital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint hope glimmered within your chest, but even at Azula\u2019s promises of rewards to come, it failed to take root. The same dread still weighed heavy upon your mind, bringing yet more unsettling questions about things to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the next twenty minutes, your life was once more reduced to little more than darkness as Azula slid the lid to your prison home once more, sealing off all light. Without warning, your feet suddenly lost contact with the ground beneath you, the sudden and unexpected movement of Azula lifting your box throwing you sideways into the wall. A soft grunt escaped you as you struck the hard wood, and you quickly slid down to lie flat against the cold floor so as not to be tossed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin your wooden box, the world seemed to undulate all around you. Azula wasn\u2019t being especially careful while carrying your container, and so it wobbled with her every movement, forcing you to fight off dizziness. With every step, the floor fought to throw you, first rising a short distance before suddenly plummeting, causing your heart to jump in time with your captor\u2019s steps. The rattle of armored guards assaulted you from all around, escorting their next ruler deeper within the Boiling Rock. Thankfully, after what seemed like an eternity, the shaking finally stopped, allowing you the opportunity to regain your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me.\u201d The ring of command in Azula\u2019s voice was unmistakable, and the guards didn\u2019t hesitate in obeying, judging by the rattling of their armor. However, it soon became apparent that not everyone had left, as without sensing any movement from the one holding your box, the sound of jingling keys reached your ears. Shortly after, there was the sound of grating metal and the scurrying of softly clad feet. A maid perhaps? However, the nauseating gyrations of Azula\u2019s movement soon returned, interrupting your idle thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave the box on the table. Then leave me.\u201d Silence hung in the air for a moment, could the maids be hesitating? However, something suddenly sent them flurrying to obey, and all at once the scurry of movement could be heard, along with the sound of a wooden box being placed upon a steel table. Undoubtedly it was one of Azula\u2019s hard looks that had startled the maids to action. However, what was this about another wooden box? The sound of the heavy metal door swinging shut sent an ominous shiver down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seemed like an eternity, nothing happened, but despite that the air seemed to intensify. There was a sense of dread which permeated the atmosphere, almost as if in expectation of an execution. Gradually, the stillness ground at your nerves, like a guillotine poised just above your head. Your mind began to wonder, once more made aware of your helpless state as you waited on another to make in other void.  What was Azula waiting for? The silence dragged on, and the darkness around you began to draw closer. Unseen wall pressed in on you, smothering you, threatening to crush you. You struggled for breath, and suddenly found yourself unable to breath. Cold sweat poured from you as claustrophobia began to overwhelm you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, blessedly, your prison began to shift once more, your stomach rising into your throat at your sudden decent. It felt as if you would fall endlessly, the ground never seeming to reach you as you box descended, until the deafening thump of wood on metal reverberated through you. The shuffling of cloth and the light tap of softly clad feet were lost to you as your ears continued to ring. However, despite the difficulty with which sound reached you, Azula\u2019s malicious, cold voice still found its way into your awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello girls.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHello girls.\u201d The pure malice which colored Azula\u2019s voice nearly choked you. Before, the thoughts of revenge had left the fire princess joyous, almost giddy at the thoughts of everything which she would subject her \u201cfriends\u201d to in the wake of their betrayal. However, when faced with the object of her hatred, not even the most vicious of revenge could stay her anger. Within your box, you were suddenly glad to be out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause during which only silence could be heard. Anxious, you found yourself holding your breath. The very thumping of your heart seemed so loud in that silence, threatening to break the fragile quiet all about you. Willing it to be still, you waited, willing the silence to be broken while simultaneously fearing that is would be. After a minute or so, Azula resumed speaking once more, her tone now cold and icy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have little enough patience, so I will make this short. My father has ascended to become the phoenix king, leaving the throne empty. By tomorrow, I will have become the newest fire lord. I will have control over law and punishment within the fire nation, including your fates.\u201d Azula\u2019s thinly veiled threats hung in the air for a moment, only adding to the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I become fire lord, my free time will become limited. I will not be able to visit you as I am today. So, I will give you one chance, though you by no means deserve it. Beg for forgiveness and swear to serve me until the day that your traitorous bones are buried and I\u2019ll set you free once the conquest is finished.\u201d Despite Azula\u2019s best efforts, her anger could not be fully contained, coloring her voice once more. It had only been a few days since Mai and Ty Lee had betrayed Azula at the boiling rock, and the news had not yet become public knowledge,  so you did not know who it was that could inspire such hatred from the fire princess. Confused, and disturbed, the following pause hung heavily upon your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll also have control over the fate of my brother.\u201d Azula\u2019s voice seemed to remind you of nothing more than a snake slithering through the grass. It was quiet, cold, calculating, and malicious. It astounded you that anyone could bear her attention without breaking into sobs, let alone refrain from responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of someone spitting broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shocked stillness filled the room, and from within your prison your stomach dropped. Could what you are hearing truly be going on? Could anyone truly be brave enough to spit in the Azula\u2019s face? No, you must be mishearing things. The darkness of the box was causing your imagination to run wild. Stunned, you waited, having forgotten your fears at the sheer impossibility of what you thought you were hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long while before Azula deigned to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s your answer.\u201d Azula\u2019s voice was a mixture of disbelief, shock\u2026 and was that laughter? No, that couldn\u2019t be laughter. It seemed twisted somehow, wrong. A gasp could be heard from somewhere nearby, the first sign of any other person save your captor occupying the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, almost delicately, fingers gently probed at the lid to your box. Terror once more clutched at you as you realized that Azula was planning opening your prison, preparing to take you out. Your mind raced, gleaning from Azula\u2019s words that whoever it was she held captive valued prince Zuko very highly and connecting that with the fact that you now wore his face. You could feel tears starting to form in your eyes at the implications, and you found yourself driven into the furthest of the box by sheer panic. Tenderly, almost lovingly, the lid to your box was removed, allowing soft firelight to once more reach you. Suddenly, it became very apparent what had caused the other captive to gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula\u2019s face, with its pale skin and ruby lips, was a twisted visage of unrecognizable emotions. Her eyes were wide and wild, the pupils dilated as they fixated upon you. Those pale, beautiful lips were twisted in some sick combination of a smirk and a snarl. Her eyebrows were drawn in an almost confused manner, as if Azula herself was unable to comprehend her own emotions. Shrouded in shadow, it was a face of madness that stared down at you, seeming almost hungry as Azula focused on the morsel before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, those slender fingers of hers made their way into the box, lurching stiffly towards your tiny form. You curled into the smallest ball possible, trying desperately to push yourself into the corner and away from her clutches. Her finger tip wedged itself between yourself and the wall, pushing you free with barely any effort. The tears which had begun to cloud your eyes began to fall as you struggled in her sickeningly gentle grip, trying desperately to break free.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the reverent care with which Azula seemed to carry you, your worries only grew. Normally, when someone carried anything with such care, it was because the object in question was valuable to them. However, based on the few interactions you had had with Azula, you knew that to her, nothing had an innate value. Not even human lives. No, Azula only valued things according to their usefulness, and judging by the tender way in which she lifted from your box, it was apparent she felt you were very useful. In combination with the mad expression on her face and her expressed intention for revenge, that almost reverent grip seemed more like a bear trap, waiting to be sprung. However, it wasn\u2019t until you were drawn fully from your container and Azula had rotated around to expose you to her captives that you realized the true gravity of your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were rotated around, you took in your surroundings. The room was a plain affair, with a single torch on the wall to the side. The walls were of plain, unadorned stone, and near the front of the room was a clean, windowless, iron door. Within that room, a steel table had been dragged in, and upon it rested two boxes and a bag. It was then that you noticed the other side of the room, walled off as it were by vertical iron bars, and the captives that lay within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite only having witnessed them from afar within the palace, the two captives were easily recognizable. On the left, sitting upon the floor, sat the once cheerful Ty Lee, now seeming considerably grimmer. Though the brown rags she now wore were far less revealing than her usual, expensive clothing, her career as an experienced acrobat was still apparent. Her body was tight and lean, the calves and forearms showing smooth flesh and well turned muscles where they were exposed. Her brown shirt seemed to be a few sizes too big, her small breasts and slim belly failing to fill out the shirt even a fraction. Her tangled brown hair seemed dirty, and what little you could see of her down cast face reaffirmed your suspicion. The scent of unwashed flesh mixed with the smell of soot from the torch nearby, adding an unclean feel to the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person standing in the center of the floor seemed to be in no better condition. Though not as lean or muscular as Ty Lee, Mai was rather slender as well. She too wore the same brown clothing, though she seemed to flesh them out far more. However, whereas Ty Lee seemed to be content to passively sit in the corner, Mai stood defiantly in the center, her black hair wildly framing her intense, auburn gaze. That gaze turned first to confusion, and then disbelieving shock as it rested upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind began to race at the implications of such a circumstance. Azula\u2019s two greatest supporters and enforces lay in prison, under charges of betrayal and treason. What had happened between the three? Running over Azula\u2019s words once more, another question rushed to the forefront of your mind. What did Zuko have to do with this? Suddenly, it came to you, and the reason for which Azula suddenly treated you as if you were a treasure became apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula\u2019s two closest friends, if she\u2019d ever had any, had betrayed her. Azula wanted revenge. Mai was dating Zuko. You looked like Zuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you fought like crazy to break from Azula\u2019s grasp, screaming and struggling as if possessed. You didn\u2019t care that you were being held at what seemed an insane height, or that breaking free would likely end in your death. None of it mattered in light of the possibility of being tormented as a means of revenge against those who had been almost sisters to the fire princess, and then betrayed. What\u2019s more, Azula seemed to have taken the blow unexpectedly hard, perhaps even having a lapse in sanity as a result. What she was capable enough without any personal motivations was the stuff of nightmares. Unhinged as she was and driven by loathing and hatred, even dropping to your death seemed more desirable than being left to her whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpirited as always, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Azula\u2019s expression glowed dully with some sort of mad light, not quite fully out of control, but clearly unstable. However, there was somehow also a dejected tone to her voice, likely at her recent betrayal. One might have even called her fragile, had they never met her before. Her smile, twisted and cold as it had been before, seemed immeasurably more unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZuko!\u201d Forgetting her silence, Mai threw herself against the bars in a mad effort to snatch her perceived lover from Azula\u2019s lightly clasped hands, only to have Azula pull her hands just out of her reach. Between gaps in your captors fingers, you could see Ty Lee jump to attention, looking about in apparent confusion, seeking the source of her friend\u2019s desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Mai\u2019s disbelief echoes in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve known me for years Mai. Did you really think anything was beyond my capability?\u201d Azula\u2019s voice was almost a groan, tainted by an incomprehensible mixture of emotions, but mostly coming across as mockingly chastising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelease him!\u201d Ty Lee\u2019s confused inquiries could barely be heard beneath Mai\u2019s demand, the young chi blocker having yet to catch onto the situation. A dark glint flashed in Azula\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the hand beneath you tilted sideways, and you felt yourself begin to plummet. Despite your earlier struggles for exactly this outcome, survival instinct forced you to scramble for any hold, trying desperately to arrest your fall. Your flailing hands found nothing. However, barely a fraction of a second after having been released, a crushing pressure clamped down upon your left calf, eliciting a shriek of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Had Azula not forbidden any guards from standing outside the cell, even the most experienced warden would have felt ill at the desperate horror in Mai\u2019s voice. An expression of nausea flashed across Ty Lee\u2019s face as realization stuck her, causing her to place a hand upon her belly and haunch over as if she were going to be ill. Looking up, you noticed your leg caught painfully between Azula\u2019s thumb and middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be more careful what you say.\u201d A bitter chuckle rumbled from Azula\u2019s throat. Ty Lee\u2019s retches only accented your despair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tears dribbled freely down Mai\u2019s cheeks as her wide, desperate gaze remained locked upon your dangling form, following your struggles with desperate alarm. Despite the poor lighting, white knuckles stood out within the darkness where Mai\u2019s hands clenched the bars of her cell fiercely. Had she the opportunity, there was little doubt she would have leapt upon Azula, regardless of her deadly fire bending. Unfortunately, reality offered her no such chance, and she remained helpless as she watched her former lord torment her lover. Weakly, the young noble\u2019s knees gave out and she slid downward towards the floor, her iron grip holding her upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept your terms.\u201d The words were so quiet and fragile, that even dangling a few feet from the defeated woman, you could hardly hear them. Though your leg was growing numb from where Azula held you by it, you had calmed down since your initial drop, allowing the broken woman before you to claim your full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere before, Mai had seemed defiant, she now seemed fragile and vulnerable. Crumpled on the floor as she was, you still didn\u2019t miss the way her body trembled, like a leaf in a breeze. Her once vibrant, pale skin now seemed sallow and devoid of life. Her eyes were like deep wells, her very soul open to you as she continued to stare up at your miserable form. For one brief, insane moment, you couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous of Zuko for having the love of such a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. So, now that I\u2019ve shown you the whip, you want the honey? After you spat in my face, you now seek forgiveness? I offered you friendship, and the chance to return to my side. I actually showed weakness, in seeking your return when I should have sought your traitorous heads. You actually think that after rejecting so generous an offer, I would actually allow you to just accept my terms?\u201d Azula began in cold tone, almost sad sounding. However, as she spoke, her voice began to rise higher, growing tighter and louder as her anger built. To punctuate her statement, a fireball erupted in her free hand, filling the room with its brilliant blue glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should burn him to ash.\u201d Azula brought the flame closer to you, and you quickly struggled to try to get away from it. You suddenly found the air around you chokingly hot, and sweat jumped from your pores, soaking your clothing. You screamed and kicked, trying to fight off the encroaching heat, but you were having trouble breathing as your tiny body rapidly began to heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Mai\u2019s scream was half choked by sobs as she continued to plead with Azula, begging that she spare her lover. Ty Lee, still on her hands and knees, merely turned her head upwards to gaze at the scene, shaking in shock as she merely looked on, helpless. Azula let the flame burn on for a couple seconds before quenching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hung suspended, you were grateful for the reprieve from the flame. It was strange, how fast the heat had penetrated your body, making you feel as if you were going to roast alive. Perhaps it was a side effect of being so small, that the heat had less body to warm up before you would be burnt crispy. That thought, combined with the blood rushing to your head, was starting to make you nauseous. The world around you seemed to be spinning slightly, and you suddenly found yourself feeling cold. Hoarsely, you cried out to Azula, pleading with her to relinquish your numbing leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprising, the high peeping of your voice seemed to catch her attention, as the fire princess sharply spun her head to face you. Almost as if she could understand you, Azula settled you onto the palm which had just moment ago held the fireball, filling you with both apprehension and relief. However, as she relinquished your leg and blood flow returned to it once more, new pain flashed through you. Within your captor\u2019s harsh grip, the circulation had been cut off, and now that it had been returned, agony raced up your leg. Trying to sooth your pain, you rubbed at your leg, rolling around in an effort to give vent to the discomfort which gripped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you. Your love for him has made you weak, and cowardly.\u201d Facing Mai once more, Azula sneered at the broken noble, as if at something unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut tell me, do you really want me to spare my dear brother? Do you really want to leave him in my care for who knows how long, in this state, to be used and abused as I see fit? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if I simply burned him right now and got it over with quickly?\u201d The sickened silence which followed spoke volumes. Mai was caught, with her lover trapped between death and torment, and she powerless to save him. She knew Azula and the twisted way her mind worked. Azula wanted an answer, wanted Mai to choose how Zuko should meet his fate, and Mai could not give her one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes of silence passed, during which your leg once more regained feeling other than the blazes of agony which had ravaged it. Thankfully, it was alright, if badly bruised at the ankle. However, it was the least of the worries as your fate hung in the balance. This hadn\u2019t been in Azula\u2019s deal, but then again, you weren\u2019t surprised by the way your captor treated you anymore. Azula valued a person by their usefulness, and your usefulness was as leverage against those who had betrayed her. Regardless if she saw you as more valuable alive or dead, you doubted you\u2019d ever be restored to your former size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Surprisingly, it was Ty Lee who spoke up, her weak voice breaking the tense silence which hung in the air. Both Azula and Mai turned to face the girl, her slender limbs shaking as she staggered to a stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have come all this way to simply play head games. That\u2019s too simple for you.  You have something else in store. Something we\u2019d have to do to ourselves in order to save Zuko\u2026 Name it.\u201d After Ty Lee spoke, there was a shocked moment of silence before a cat-like smile split Azula\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you learned something of me during our long years of friendship. Yes, I have a third option.\u201d You could tell Azula was growing excited by the beat of her pulse beneath you. However, no outward signs showed. Subtly, you noticed a deep intake of breath, before the fire princess released it all in one silent huff. Though she would have certainly preferred it had the girls simply accepted her first offer, Azula was a planner if nothing else. In the wake of her anger, she was anticipating this next part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel about a game?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Before, her love\u2019s demise had seemed a sure thing, but now? It was never a good idea to show hope around Azula, as she had a knack for crushing it, but somehow Mai couldn\u2019t help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple game really, and very easy for you to win, depending on whether or not you truly love my brother. You do love my brother, don\u2019t you?\u201d A dangerous grin played across Azula\u2019s face as she spoke, sending a shiver down all three of her captive\u2019s spines. However, as soon as Azula had offered a chance for Zuko to be spared, Mai had known that she was trapped. Whatever game the next fire lord wanted to play, she\u2019d play. The still kneeling noble gave a wordless nod at her tormentor\u2019s question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you love him enough to die for him?\u201d Azula\u2019s questions continued, her intense eyes focusing upon Mai with an unnatural sharpness. It was almost as if she were staring into the young girl\u2019s soul, watching for hesitation or weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Mai answered without hesitation, looking determinedly ahead at Azula. Whatever game she wanted to play, Mai intended to win. She had no choice. Not if she wanted to save Zuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you kill for him?\u201d This question caught Mai off guard. She\u2019d expected to have to sacrifice something in exchange for Zuko\u2019s life, so this line of questioning seemed peculiar. Mai had been part of Azula\u2019s entourage, had fought with her in combat, and had killed at Azula\u2019s command on a number of occasions. Why then would ask a question to which she already had the answer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Mai\u2019s answer was unsure. Something was wrong, though she didn\u2019t know what. Azula was leading them towards something, though she couldn\u2019t guess what was going through her demented captors mind. Suddenly, Azula turned towards Ty Lee, who had finally regained her composure enough to stand just behind Mai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about you? You were willing to betray me on behalf of Mai\u2019s love. Would you be willing to kill for it?\u201d Azula\u2019s voice dropped to a low growl, and from your place upon her hand, you could actually feel an eager shake beginning to move through her hand. Your apprehension was mounting as the conversation continued to progress, with all this talk of killing and dying. You didn\u2019t like the direction Azula was steering this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Ty Lee\u2019s answer was curt and swift, her determination apparent as she evenly met Azula\u2019s gaze. Looking at her now, you wouldn\u2019t have guessed that this girl had been fighting her stomach mere moments ago. Though Ty Lee had always seemed soft to you when you\u2019d viewed her from afar, it was apparent now that she was made of tougher stuff when her friends were concerned. A pang of jealously shot through you at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how many lives do you think Zuko\u2019s is worth?\u201d The confusion on the girl\u2019s faces only grew as Azula\u2019s questions grew less and less predictable, along with their misgivings. Azula had a way of planning ahead of her enemies, but the girls had been with her for a while now. They should\u2019ve at least be able to get an idea of where her plans might lead. However, at the moment, Ty Lee and Mai were completely in the dark, and that truly terrified them. Azula paused, as if waiting for an answer, before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll have my answer soon enough.\u201d The world suddenly swirled as Azula turned once more to face the table, the hand in which you rested gently whipping around with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only time you had gotten the chance to look at the table had been when Azula had first pulled you out, and you had been a terrified mess then. Who were you kidding; you were still a terrified mess. However, you could only be terrified out of your mind for so long before fear lost its potency. Though you still felt utter horror at your circumstances, your feelings no longer hampered you judgment so much, and you were beginning to regain some sense of composure. At the moment, you were able to take in your surroundings, seeing what you had missed before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you had noted before, three objects rested upon the plain table which adorned the cell. The first, and most familiar of the objects, was the wooden box in which you had been carried, plain and unadorned. On the far end rested a cloth bag of some sort, from which odd protrusions could be seen pressing against its interior. However, it was the third object which suddenly held your attention. A small, unopened box rested between the afore mentioned objects, forebodingly similar to your own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The room seemed to have fallen deathly silent as the captives suddenly became aware of the second box upon the table, and everything it might suggest. Gently, Azula reached out towards the box, savoring the moment as she rested her hand lightly upon the lid. Taking a deep breath, she gently slid the top off, the dull sound of wood scraping against wood seeming unnaturally loud in the tiny room. As the dull torchlight illuminated the interior of the box, five figures came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarning bells went off within your head as you realized with sinking surety that you recognized these people, though you\u2019d never seen them before. They were all young, of that you were sure, and to varying degrees given their ranges in height. Of the two boys, one was significantly younger than the other, perhaps twelve or thirteen, with a short buzz of black hair. The other seemed to be a few years older, at perhaps fifteen or sixteen, with a disheveled long black hair and dark skin which suggested southern origins. He looked to be water tribe, though which one you could not tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on towards the women, the youth of these captives became even more apparent. The first to catch you attention was a young girl, who couldn\u2019t have been any older than eleven by you judgment. Her black hair was a disheveled mop which had likely been held back in a bun of some sort, and her pale skin and thin physique suggested nobility, though you couldn\u2019t be sure by the amount of dirt which clung to her. To her side, a taller girl stood offering support, her long black hair trailing past her shoulders and her dark skin suggesting southern origins as well. She looked vaguely similar to the elder boy, and you thought that they might be related, though you couldn\u2019t be sure. Off to the side, standing to the side of the oldest male, stood another woman, her short brown hair hanging in a tangled mess upon her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their disheveled appearances and their prisoner garb, something seemed dreadfully familiar about the prisoners arranged defensively within the box. Two siblings from the water tribe, a small girl of noble birth, and a young boy. It sounded too familiar. Thoughts whirled within your head until the answer finally came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossible. This couldn\u2019t really be\u2026 them. Could it? No! Had the avatar actually been caught, the fire lord would have paraded his corpse around for all to see. You would have surely heard about such an occurrence. No! This had to be a trick, a lie. Zuko was a part of the Avatar\u2019s group. Had he been caught, you wouldn\u2019t be in your present plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hag! The answer rushed to you all at once, filling you with dread. The hag had been able to transform you in a matter of an hour. Could she not have done the same to others? Looking closer, you took in the forms below you once more, noticing small discrepancies. Every face was set in firm defiance, and any who dared look upon Azula did so with a glare. However, though their expressions looked fierce, the enchantment placed upon them did nothing to disguise the way they shook or hide their tears. A jolt of horror shot through you as you realized they were even more terrified than yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dread only grew as you realized that they were likely random prisoners Azula had picked to serve her purpose. Judging by their age, they were likely petty thieves or war prisoners. What else could youths such as these have done? Surely, they could not have done anything bad enough to deserve death as tools for Azula\u2019s revenge. Likely just as confused as frightened, their disposable nature having almost assured that Azula had opted not to give them the light explanation she had afforded you.  After all, she didn\u2019t care how they acted, so long as you didn\u2019t do anything to make the girls suspicious of your identity. As if undeserved death hadn\u2019t been enough, the captives had been rendered powerless to express their own terror and grief, instead being forced to wear these twisted visages of false ferocity. Idly, you wondered if your face was just as fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula grabbed the box by its edge, and the world once more swayed as she turned to face the captives once more, the boxes contents plain for all to see. Disbelief once more colored the girl\u2019s expressions as they took in the sight, overlooking the small discrepancies in their shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive lives, to be executed as I choose, as proof of your undying loyalty to me and your regret at your betrayal. In exchange, I will see to it that my brother is taken care of, and upon conquering the other nations you will be released to serve me once more, with Zuko as my hostage. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.\u201d Azula almost seemed impatient as she spoke, as if her words were a mere formality spoken before the main event. Well, they were, after all. At least, judging by Mai and Ty Lee\u2019s faces, they were. Never before had you seen such resignation and such helplessness conveyed through a look as when the girls glances at one another, having just torn their gaze from the box and its contents. So much raw emotion was conveyed by that momentary meeting of eyes. Despite your own peril, your heart went out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept your offer.\u201d Mai\u2019s voice quivered as she spoke. Ty Lee\u2019s voice soon echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA wise decision. However, my trust in your word is a little thin at the moment. So, if you go back on your word, not only will you never see daylight again, but whatever execution method you fail to carry out I\u2019ll instead inflict upon Zuko. Myself.\u201d A chill shot down your spine as she spoke, and the girls paled in response. A long, deadly silence hung in the air for a moment as everyone took in Azula\u2019s meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, shall we begin?\u201d Azula\u2019s face tightened into a soul shriveling grin, the lights of madness from before once more dancing within her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Deliberately, Azula returned the box full of prisoners back to the table, turning her back upon Mai and Ty Lee in the process. She seemed almost relaxed as she gazed down at her soon to be victims, taking in their pitiful forms. The tension in the air continued to build as Azula took her time, selecting who would live and who would die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, you wished this moment would both end already and never pass. On the one hand, you felt you were going to puke, knowing that Azula was playing with you all. There wasn't a doubt in your mind that Azula was purposefully dragging out this moment, just to allow everyone else to squirm. For the victims below, her decision would either postpone their execution or hasten it. For the noblewomen in their cell, it would decide whose life they would be forced to take in what was sure to be both a gruesome and intimate manner. For yourself, it was a reminder of your worth to Azula, and what she might do to you were you to lose your value. At that moment, the suspense of it all seemed far worse than death. You just wanted it to be over already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on the other hand, once this moment passed, someone would die. Not only that, but if the execution was too gruesome for Mai and Ty Lee to carry out, it would be your head on the chopping block. You feared what dark executions Azula had planned more than death itself, and would have given anything to escape the situation, to have refused the fire princesses request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the moment couldn't continue forever. Having come to a decision, or more realistically decided that the tension had built up enough, Azula's free hand descended upon the frightened forms below. Despite your vantage point upon her free palm, the back of her hand obscured your view momentarily as her nimble fingers went to work, gently plucking some doomed soul like a cherry. As her hand retracted, the struggling form of the avatar came into view. Azula turned to face the girls once more, her prize visible even in the dim torch light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think it only fitting that the leader goes first. Wouldn't you agree?' Azula's eyebrows were arched up, almost as if inviting the girls to argue. However, the girls' fighting spirit had already been doused. As Azula approached the bars to their cell, they meekly awaited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hold out your hands.' At Azula's command, it was Mai who moved forward. Her once finely manicured hands now showed signs of dirt and neglect as they slid between the bars. They trembled slightly as the avatar, or the poor soul who wore his face, was deposited within their grasp.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was enjoying every second of Mai\u2019s and Ty Lee\u2019s anxiety, practically reveling in it, perhaps a bit too much. In what might have been impatience, the soon-to-be fire lord cut her teasing short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou were my attendants, my comrades, and together we crushed countless enemies beneath our heels. However, it seems that you forgot your place when you betrayed me for my brother. Prove your loyalty now. Place the avatar upon the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShaking, Mai somberly obeyed, placing the \u201cavatar\u201d upon the floor of her cell. However, the frightened figure fought to cling to her hand, clearly afraid of what was to come. Seeing his fright, you were suddenly reminded of your own reason for being selected for Zuko\u2019s double. You were not only of similar build to the traitor prince, but of nearly the same age. How old was the avatar, twelve? Seeing the trembling figure on the ground below, you had little doubt the he shared such a similarity to the one he was impersonating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRemind the avatar of his place. Trap him beneath your foot.\u201d A predatory fierceness was like iron in Azula\u2019s voice, adding a new edge to her demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer uncertainty redoubled, Mai slowly placed her foot upon the avatar, nearly recoiling at the sensation of squirming beneath her sole. Clasping the bars to her cell for support, she couldn\u2019t help but cringe as the hair on the back of her neck bristled at the alien sensation. She could feel the figure struggling to break free, but knew better than to let him, lest Azula take out her ire on Zuko. So, despite her urges not to, Mai struggled to hold the avatar beneath her foot, revolted at the ticklish flailing going on beneath her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe experience was far more horrifying from your perspective. Below, a reaffirmation of everything you had feared up till now was taking place. It could just as easily be you down there, struggling beneath Azula\u2019s sole. You would be just as helpless; awaiting the moment she dropped her weight upon you and ended your existence. You were powerless, and you life no longer rested within your own hand, just like the \u201cavatar\u2019s\u201d life was beyond his own control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor entirely too long, Azula refrained from giving the death sentence, choosing simply to watch and enjoy Mai\u2019s discomfort. She was almost enthralled by the sight, and with a startling realization, she realized that the sense of empowerment she had received when she had been appointed the next in line to become fire lord almost paled in comparison to this. There was just something so visceral about the dread which hung in the air, the complete control she had over all these fools. It was the growing dampness between her legs that finally startled her from her trance, taking even Azula by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnough. Crush him.\u201d Azula\u2019s voice held the unmistakable weight of absolute control. The coldness with which she sentenced this stranger to death was all the sharper for it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In exchange, I will see to it that my brother is taken care of, and upon conquering the other nations you will be released to serve me once more, with Zuko as my hostage. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.\u201d A jolt of panic shot through Taro\u2019s body, and he could sense similar reactions from the four others trapped within the box. Taro was a boy of thirteen, born and raised in a small village in the eastern earth kingdoms. He was an only child, fun loving and cheery, even in the face of the fire nation incursion. His parents, however, were rebels. With the help of their coconspirators, they had worked to undermine the fire nation authority not only within their village, but in the surrounding countryside. When their involvement in the resistance had been finally uncovered, the fire nation had chosen to take Taro as a hostage in order to coerce his parents into turning over the remaining members of their rebel movement. That had been three years ago, three long years of imprisonment. By now his parents had been executed, though that hadn\u2019t stopped Taro from latching onto the tiny ray of hope the fire nation officer had offered him a couple of days earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to see your parents again?\u201d Though the officer had seemed gruff, he had spoken gently to Taro, showing him kindness he hadn\u2019t experienced in years. Despite his mistrust, Taro had agreed to the man\u2019s terms almost immediately, seeing little alternative other than continuing to rot in his cell. Of course, he hadn\u2019t expected the witch, nor had he been privy to either Azula\u2019s plan or even her involvement. The fire nation officer had only told Taro that he\u2019d be participating in a ritual, acting as the voice through which summoned spirits could speak. Though a terrifying prospect, anything was better than rotting in his cell and the thought of reuniting with his parents once more was just too alluring. However, following the ritual and the discovery of his new size, the boy had immediately regretted his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn\u2019t been the only one to be betrayed either. Though Taro had spent the first few hours following the ritual isolated, he would soon be put in a box with four other shrunken individuals, all of whom were in the same state of confusion as himself. Taro would discover that, though he appeared normal to himself, the others saw him as a different person entirely, with short black hair and strange, arrow shaped markings. Similarly the others had appeared to him differently from how they described themselves. Over the course of the next day, they would share their individual stories of betrayal, feeding one another\u2019s hatred towards the fire nation. It wouldn\u2019t be until they were brought to the boiling rock and overheard Azula\u2019s explanation that realization would dawn upon Taro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically, Taro cast about, trying desperately to figure out which of them resembled the avatar, which of them was going to die. However, he had spent the past three years in prison, cut off from the outside world. He hadn\u2019t even known that there was a new avatar until the fire princess had mentioned him, let alone how they looked. Terrified, Taro prayed to the spirits that it wasn\u2019t he who wore the Avatar\u2019s face. Most of Azula\u2019s words passed over Taro, his raw fear obscuring their meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Taro became aware of his surroundings once more as Azula moved, carrying the box and all of its contents back to the table. The boy was thrown from his feet, tumbling to the ground painfully along with the rest of the captives. Recovering, Taro gazed upwards, taking in the sight of Azula gazing down at him. Her eyes were icy cold as they glanced over the captives, calculating, weighing each and every one of them. However, there was also a blazing fire behind those amber portals, a swirling vortex of rage which threatened to spill outward at any moment. Taro shivered at the sight, and realized that he couldn\u2019t stop. One of them was going to die. Taro didn\u2019t want to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Azula finally smirked, her ruby red lips twitching in a cruel parody of a smile, signaling that she had reached a decision. Slowly, so painfully slowly, her hand descended. Like death itself, it crept closer, the embodiment of doom for all those beneath it. With an awful realization, Taro noticed that it was heading straight towards him. He screamed, throwing himself away from the approaching digits, desperately wishing to escape. He barely made it a few steps before he was swept up, the surprisingly soft hand of the fire princess encircling his struggling form easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears ran down Taro\u2019s cheeks as he let out a desperate scream, his high pitch voice pitiful to even his own ears. He struggled, kicking and fighting against the hand that held him, until the sensation of rapidly moving upward overtook him. Instinctual panic at falling overtook the boy, and he shifted from fighting Azula to clinging to her for safety. The world spun in a blur as Azula turned to face her captives once more, presenting Taro to the nobles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it only fitting that the leader goes first. Wouldn't you agree?\u201d Taro trembled as he clung to Azula\u2019s thumb, gazing up in horror. Through watery eyes, he took in Azula\u2019s smug grin. Her eyes were focused on her ex-allies, enjoying their looks of disgust and helplessness. She didn\u2019t even spare a glance for Taro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold out your hands.\u201d Taro watched as Mai meekly stepped forward, offering a far warmer and gentler visage when compared to Azula, despite her ratty clothing and unkempt exterior. Still, Taro knew her to be his executioner, unwilling though she may be. The boy struggled vainly to cling to the fire princesses hand as she upended her palm over Mai\u2019s, dumping him roughly within her grasp. Without much pause, Azula continued forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were my attendants, my comrades, and together we crushed countless enemies beneath our heels. However, it seems that you forgot your place when you betrayed me for my brother. Prove your loyalty now. Place the avatar upon the ground.\u201d After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Mai obeyed, her hand carrying Taro downward. The boy\u2019s stomach dropped at the sight of the approaching floor and the sensation of falling, his terror mounting. He wept harder as he struggled to wrap his arms around Mai\u2019s thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this.\u201d Taro wailed at the top of his lungs, hoping against hope that giant figure would take pity on him. However, she might not have even heard him, for all the reaction she showed to his pleas. As her hand reached the stone floor, Mai gently shook her wrist, dislodging Taro and flinging him on the floor. The boy only had a moment to take in the surprising warmth of the stone before Azula gave her next command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind the avatar of his place. Trap him beneath your foot.\u201d With agonizing slowness, Mai complied, lifting her foot and bringing it above the frightened boy. Taro watched, transfixed, as the low fire light was eclipsed by the captive\u2019s sole, the shadow of her foot consuming the boy. In a state of hyper-awareness, Taro took in a sea of details as his death approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite its recent neglect, Mai\u2019s foot was that of a noble\u2019s and had been well kept. Her toenails were neatly trimmed, their edges unbroken and polished. The spaces between her toes were clean and free of debris. The only real sign that this noble woman had spent some time in a cell at all was the dark collection of dirt which seemed imbedded into the folds of her sole, a cluttering of black upon a sea of pale white. All too suddenly, the appendage was upon Taro, smothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the skin beneath Mai\u2019s foot had been well kept until recently, she had never been one of the dainty nobles who stayed at home and studied art. No, her life had been spent by Azula\u2019s side, fighting and killing in the heat of battle. Calloused flesh bored into Taro as Mai struggled to halt his escape attempts, occasionally applying too much pressure and knocking the wind from him. The faint aroma of sweat bombarded Taro as he struggled against Mai\u2019s foot, no longer caring that he had no real escape, his instinctual drive to live lending him power. It was all futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes drug by, Taro actually managed to make a bit of progress, his top half escaping from the cloistered hell and managing to grab a fresh breath of air from between Mai\u2019s toes. However, it was only a momentary reprieve as the digits seized, tightly clamping Taro by the neck. Taro just managed to catch a last glimpse of fire light before he was pulled back into the darkness. From beneath Mai\u2019s foot, he could just make out Azula\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough. Crush him.\u201d Taro let out a sob, his struggles redoubling.</span></div></div>",

This was an execution of someone who couldn't even fight back, in a manner far more intimate than normal. Mai hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I said, crush him! Or have you decided to give up on your beloved?\" Azula's hand clamped down around you as she spoke, forcing the air from your lungs.

With a sudden surge of fore, Mai bore down, finishing the captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA resounding crack filled the room, reverberant against the sensitive flesh of Mai's foot. She was able to feel the exact moment when the prisoner's body collapsed under her weight, when the \"avatar's\" ribs compressed and his life ended. The warm splash of blood that flowed out from beneath Mai's foot glowed crimson in the firelight, signaling to the world the wretched deed the noblewoman had just committed. A wretched gag forced its way from Mai's throat, and in a moment she found herself doubled over in the corner, vomiting into the chamber pot. Azula's hands relinquished their death grip, allowing blessed air to reach your lungs once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Next time you'll do as I say without hesitation or I won't let you off so easily.\" There was a hint of amusement among the raw menace in the princess's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'll be back in an hour. Prepare yourself.\" Your world seemed to spin as Azula turned in place, grabbing the box of shrunken prisoners before heading out of the cell. You were able to catch a glimpse of Mai sobbing on the ground, a shaken Ty Lee comforting her, before Azula turned the corner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then as you store at the sun for a second, a flash had blinded you, then you found yourself facing a pebble the size of a small rock..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, after panicking for a few seconds, you were slightly relieved you shrunk with your trunks. Then almost fainting at the realization you really became small, you immediately needed help. The tiny towel you had was on the rocky ground, you threw ot over your shoulder &amp; started walking down this huge path..<br>\r\nAfter what felt like several hours of walking you stopped and had to catch your breath, able to see many vacationers down at the beach. Judging from the height of grass &amp; them, you were just over two inches, not great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...! <br>\r\nGiant rumbles, you couldn't react to a few guys sprinting competitively down the path. The wind <i>launched</i> you, and holding onto the towel for dear life, you were being lifted into the air quite high! <br>\r\nVision blurring as you twisted and turned, you felt relief &amp; fear as the beach looked close, you could land somewhere hazardous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you couldn't hold on anymore, your grip failing and sending you flying like a comet somewhere..

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your nerves were on edge as you peeked out of your mouse hole to look down both sides of the hall, listening intently. Things in the air temple had been extremely busy as of late, and at a mere two inches tall that meant danger for you.  However, as you listened for any signs of passage silence greeted you, disconcerting given that only a moment ago you would have sworn someone had been walking past your hideout. You drew your head back inside, remembering the day that you had been shrunk as you prepared to move to a new, more useful hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness and fog had hampered you vision that night, leaving the man walking in front of you nothing more than a ghostly figure. The soft padding of your footsteps was the only thing which had dared break the silence of the new moon, a soft crunching of leaves in the dark. You had been following him for more than an hour, but hadn\u2019t dared to speak lest you break the silence. The world around you had seemed unearthly as the torchlight played across the shifting shapes, hinting at things moving within. Truth be told, you had been afraid at every little sound the two of you had made, lest some unseen entity take note and seek you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another dark figure had swollen up from the darkness, blocking your path. However, your leader didn\u2019t falter. Instead, he had drawn closer, and as the torchlight struck the shadow it had resolved itself into the shape of an old crone, her figure hunched and crooked. Cold blue eyes met yours before she shifted her gaze to your cloaked leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this the one?\u201d asked the crone; her voice had been like cracking ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Amon, your trusted leader had responded. His voice had been a reassuring break from the silence before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spirits have accepted your price. They have agreed to transform your associate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod had been Amon\u2019s only acknowledgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had followed remained ingrained in your mind to this day: the ritual, the spirits, the cackling crone, Amon\u2019s cool gaze. A charm had been forced upon you during the ritual in order to \"protect you\" from some of its nastier side effects, whatever those were. As the ritual had drawn to a conclusion, you had felt yourself slip into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that you had awoken you had found yourself considerably smaller, clutched in another soldier\u2019s hand and on your way to the air temple to spy on your leader\u2019s enemies. A mere  week later, you found yourself where you stood now, hiding in a mouse hole and preparing to travel to some other destination in the hopes of learning more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy you had to carry change hideouts in broad daylight rather than the dark, well it was simple really. To travel during the night you would be required to use a light. Unfortunately, such a light source would act as a beacon to anyone who happened to pass you in the night, guaranteeing that you would be captured. So, you found your only option to be traveling by day. Fortunately, no one ever seemed to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou double checked your pack to make sure that everything was secure. Some supplies, a radio, and various other equipment were the only things keeping you alive and you couldn\u2019t afford to damage anything as you traveled. Sensing the time to leave was nearing, you took a deep breath, cast another glance outside to make sure the hallway was still clear, and boldly stepped out into the hallway.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You set out at a cautious pace, alert to any sign or sound which might herald someone\u2019s approach. Your nerves were on edge, you breaths came in sort gasps. Not since you had first arrived at the air temple had you been so exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had initially arrived at the air temple, you had felt lost. The world was so vast! You had never felt so insignificant before in your life. Your escort hadn\u2019t even been able to carry you all the way to the building, lest he be sighted. So, you it had been left to you to ensure your own survival from day one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing about being so small is that the world feels a lot more open. Previously tight corridors suddenly became immense caverns. The smallest hole was a chasm. Instinct had screamed  for you to hide, to get out of sight of anything larger than yourself. Shortly after climbing your way into the air temple, you had been grateful for the little mouse hole. However, it hadn\u2019t taken long to realize that your current circumstances couldn\u2019t last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, from your vantage point you could monitor who entered and left the air temple, but the same could be achieved by watching the docks. Tidbits of information might be overhear every once in a while, but no one spoke of anything important in a hallway. Not only was there nothing to be gained by waiting in such a place, but the large amount of activity in this hallway made it an extremely dangerous place for a two inch tall spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been terrified at the prospect of leaving you safe haven. Nightmares of wide open spaces and cruel titans towering above had haunted your sleep days before you had finally worked up the courage to depart. However, the radio within your pack was a constant reminder of your duty. Nothing save death would stop you from finding vital information for your cause. You were an equalist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA corner was fast approaching, its stark end potentially concealing any number of dangers. Fearfully, you approached the edge of the wall, peaking around the corner. An empty hallway met your gaze. This was good. With a little luck you might just reach your destination without any close calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly less tense about being in the open, you set off down the hallway at a brisker pace. Nothing stirred ad all was quiet. The temple seemed deserted. A sudden jolt of panic shot through you. Where was everyone? Had you missed some critical piece of information? You increased your pace, eager to find your next hideout. <br>\r\nYou reached another corner and slowed once more in order to peak around. Another empty hall greeted you. At this rate you\u2019d be able to find a new hiding place in no time. A small sigh of relief pushed its way between your lips as you considered you luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019cha doin?\u201d a high pitched voice whispered from behind. At your size it seemed a deafening rasp. Your heart nearly jumped out of your chest you were so startled. You whipped around as fast as you could and nearly fell over backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind began to register what you were looking at, you alarm only grew and grew. A giant pair of lips filled your vision, parted slightly so as to expose a flash of white. Pale flesh encircled the red lips, seeming to be carved of marble. A gust of air blew down on you from above, prompting you to look upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo caverns filled your gaze, lined with hair and mucus.  Even as you watched, another gust of wind erupted from the twin caverns, ruffling the hairs and nearly bowling you over.  The realization dawned upon you that you were looking up someone\u2019s nose. Beyond, two steely disks focused on you. Wonder blazed within their depths. Brown hair framed the face of the young girl, two yellow buns barely visible atop her head. Her hands were beneath her chin, supporting her head as she lay on the floor. A yellow collar bellowed outwards, allowing a glimpse down her baggy, red shirt. Little else could be seen of the giant child before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, hello,\u201d you voice sounded unsure, even to yourself. After a moment, you  was unsure if she had even heard you. You decided to repeat yourself once more, sounding far more confident than you were. This time the girl responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi. I\u2019m Ikki. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you out here? Is that a bag? What\u2019s in the bag? Can I see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki\u2019s questions rained down one after another. You tried to answer a few of them, but it was like whispering in a typhoon. After a minute, you simply toned her out, instead concentrating on how you might escape the situation.<br>\r\nAfter a minute, silence snapped you from your thoughts. Ikki had finally stopped talking and was currently staring at you expectantly. She was just sitting there, her face inches from you, staring at you with innocent wonderment. Her face was tilted, reminding you of a curious puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been following me?\u201d you finally managed to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you left that mouse hole,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d you asked, concerned by how long she had been able to follow you unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed you peeking out a couple days ago. I\u2019ve been checking up on you ever since.\u201d Looks like you were a bit late moveing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCuriosity of course! It\u2019s not every day you get to meet a tiny person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused to think for a moment. The girl was just curious; she didn\u2019t suspect you were a spy. To her you were just something to ogle for a bit before she got bored. If you played your cards right, it was very likely you would be able to get out of this situation without an issue. Even if the girl told someone about your presence, no one would believe her. All you had to do is get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what would you like to know?\u201d You thought it might be best to satisfy her curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn obvious question. However, you thought it best not to divulge any potentially important information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a curse. I angered the local mountain spirit back in my home town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your home town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. You weren\u2019t the best at making up things on the fly. You had to keep your story as simple as possible lest you stumble upon your own lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a small village in the eastern earth kingdom. It\u2019s not someplace you would have heard of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was accidentally packaged in a crate of cabbage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you seek help when you arrived here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last question sounded a bit too probing. It\u2019s true that if you were here by accident you would probably be seeking help. You had to be careful lest you tip her off to your true purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s awfully hard when nobody bothers to look down. I thought it better to wait for an opportunity rather than risk being stepped upon.\u201d You looked down at that last bit, feigning uncertainty in an attempt to gain her sympathy. However, when you looked back up, her face remained unchanged. She just kept staring at you with those big, curious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bad liar.\u201d Her statement was delivered flatly. It was as if she were stating the weather or saying the time of day, and yet it stabbed you in the chest with its direct accuracy. You recovered quickly, trying your best to play off your pause as hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m lying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you would have asked for help by now if you truly didn\u2019t want to be here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. This little brat was sharp. That also made her dangerous. You had to get away from her before she decided to take you to someone in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine then, don\u2019t believe me. I\u2019ll just go ask someone else for help.\u201d You turned to walk away but an arm came crashing down in front of you, encircling you and cutting off all hopes of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one more question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly turned back, looking up into eyes now shining with a predatory intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does your backpack have the equalist insignia on it?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Those silvery eyes bore into you, amusement blazing within their silvery depths. Pale lips moved, but no sound reached your ears. You were in shock you knew, and your perception of the world around momentarily slipped as you realized the enormity of your situation and horror gripped you. Here you were, trapped like a rat by a brat who knew you to be an enemy.  Realization dawned on you that your body had broken out in a cold sweat. Ikki\u2019s lips moved again, and this time you managed to catch her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I think I was wrong. I don\u2019t think that will be the last question.\u201d Her words twisted your stomach. Your greatest fears cemented firmly in place. She wasn\u2019t going to let you leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze cast around, looking for an escape but finding none. Where Ikki\u2019s arm didn\u2019t block your path the hallway way wall did. With surety you knew you couldn\u2019t possibly scale her arm and be off before she snatched you up. However, you noticed a small gap between her body and the elbow of the arm which yet supported her head. Maybe, if you could only just slip past\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl must have sensed your intentions because her hand quickly dropped away from her chin, snatching you up and smothering all hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t want you escaping would we?\u201d Her voice was playful, like a cat with a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mission was a failure. You had been captured, your presence within the air temple had been revealed, and by a seven year old girl no less. Shame might have overwhelmed you at having failed so spectacularly if sadness didn\u2019t have such a death grip on your heart. You had failed your cause, your peers, and everyone whom the equalist movement sought to help. Your miniscule form hung limply within Ikki\u2019s grasp. There was no point resisting anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Ikki stood. At your size the motion reduced the world to blurry streaks, leaving your head spinning when she was fully upright. Ikki\u2019s hand was warm, the skin smooth and uncalloused. Her grip was gentle, her hand curving around you to keep you from falling. It was tilted backwards so that you more lay than sat in her hand. He thumb lightly pressed against your chest, securing you lest you fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step the young girl took your legs swayed back and forth. Between the rocking motion and the way her hand cradled you were reminded of a child be soothed by its mother, and after a minute or so of walking you did indeed start to feel slightly better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like the movement itself was lost. Sure, you might have turned up some vital information to make victory swifter in its coming, but you could have just as easily been killed. The movement would succeed, it was a just movement after all and highly supported by the people. The only thing that you really felt galled about is that you hadn\u2019t had the chance to contribute, and had instead become a waste of precious resources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while voice became audible, far off but growing closer. Tenzin\u2019s deep baritone stood out, but other voices were apparent. As Ikki carried you closer, the second voice resolved itself to be female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConcentrate Korra,\u201d Tenzin instructed, his voice soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much I concentrate!  It just doesn\u2019t click. Air bending\u2019s supposed to be about surrendering yourself but I just don\u2019t think I have it in me to surrender. \u201d The avatar\u2019s voice was deep for a woman\u2019s. Now that you could identify its owner you noticed it had a very distinct hum about it, rich with laughter and life despite its aggravated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Korra, don\u2019t be discouraged. You\u2019ll learn eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was apparent that Tenzin and Korra\u2019s voices were coming from the fork on the left. As Ikki drew closer the voices grew louder, filling you with dread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d you thought darkly; \u201cthe great and mighty equalist spy, caught by a little girl.\u201d \u201cWell, maybe not so great given your current size,\u201d you amended. However, surprise shot through you as Ikki unexpectedly took the right fork, heading away from the voices. Your mind was abuzz with all the new possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ember of hope sparked within your heart as the possibility of escape once more seemed possible. The chances of escape were far greater while in the care of child, as opposed to that of her father. Every second out of Tenzin\u2019s clutches meant another chance to escape. All you needed to do was wait and watch for the moment to make your move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki continued for a while, bringing you to a part of the temple you which would have taken a week at your size to reach on foot. Looking into one of the rooms to the side, beds and personal belongings were clearly visible. From the d\u00e9cor, you guessed that these were the resident sleeping quarters, as opposed to the guest sleeping quarters. Was Ikki taking you to her room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIkki!\u201d a voice called out. The voice sounded young and feminine, but not so young as your captor. Ikki whipped around, shifting the hand you in behind her back. In her anxiety, her hand gripped you harder than before, forcing the wind from you but otherwise leaving you unharmed. Such a childish tactic wouldn\u2019t fool anyone. All hopes of escape were beginning to turn to ash at the prospect of being discovered by Asami, who would surely turn you over to Tenzin herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you hiding something,\u201d Asami\u2019s voice cooed playfully, lightly teasing the young girl. Judging by her tone, she didn\u2019t suspect it was anything too troublesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of anger flashed at the thought of young woman. Despite Asami\u2019s father being a major backer of the equalist movement, she did not share the same views. No, she chose to deal with benders and their ilk. When she had finally discovered her father\u2019s loyalties, instead of supporting him as a good true daughter should have she instead had sided with the avatar and her bender friends, saving them and betraying her own blood. The prospect of being captured wasn\u2019t one which set well with you, but the thought of being turned over to Tenzin by the traitorous bitch nearly made you ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Ikki was worried about her captive being discovered. She wasn\u2019t experienced with lying, and running away would be too conspicuous. She had to think of something quickly, some way to hide her prisoner without raising suspicion. Suddenly, a thought struck her. It was risky and chances were that her little captive wouldn\u2019t appreciate it, but it seemed like the simplest way to keep her prisoner a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking any further, Ikki made her move. In one smooth motion, she pulled her hand from behind her, brought it upwards towards her lips, and pressed your struggling form against her mouth. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seething with anger and helplessness, you hung limply in Ikki\u2019s hand. That traitor Asami would find you, you thought; it was only a matter of time. Ikki was a bright child, but she was still only a child. Asami had cornered the girl without even realizing. Ikki\u2019s hand tightened painfully around you as she fretter over what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly, you wondered what would be done to you once Tenzen discovered your trespass. Would Tenzen keep you? Would the metal benders want you? Would the avatar use some trick to make you talk? The last filled you with fear. With the avatar\u2019s connection to the spirit world there was no telling what may or may not happen. Inertia suddenly forced you against Ikki\u2019s palm and dizziness suddenly overtook you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisoriented, you cast about to try to make sense of your circumstance. The world was streaking by at an alarming rate as you felt the hand beneath you rising and twisting. Ikki\u2019s hand was moving quickly, quicker even than when Asami had first surprised her. The centrifugal force of her arm twisting tore at you, causing your neck to flop back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment you had lost track of your relation to the world amongst the rapid twists and turns. However, your sense of location was restored momentarily as two giant lips appeared, tightly compressed in a worried line. You immediately recognized them as Ikki\u2019s and had a moment to gasp aloud before they snapped open and you were forced towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moments before you were to be thrust into that waiting gap, terror took hold. You spread your arms and legs, making yourself as large as possible in your attempts to avoid being eaten. You struck Ikki\u2019s lips, soft as only a child\u2019s lips could be, and held fast. You were no snack. You would not be eaten by some petulant child afraid of getting caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt of worry shot through Ikki as you struggled against her lips. If she didn\u2019t hide the equalist soon, Asami would discover the wriggling form against her lips. Panicking, Ikki tried for a second more to push her captive into her mouth, but the wild struggling made it impossible. Switching tactics, the airbender sealed her lips around the struggling spy, attempting to suck him inside instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terror coursing through your veins only intensified as Ikki\u2019s lips clamped down upon you. Ikki\u2019s slender lips worked at your stomach and back as a powerful suction pulled at you, trying with all of their might to force you into her waiting maw. However, she couldn\u2019t for a seal, so the suction was wasted. Her hand pressed against your feet, but you refused to be eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaliva dribbled onto your upper half, coating your face and choking you. As you gasped for breath, the warm liquid forced its way into your mouth, sending you into a coughing fit. Ikki must\u2019ve brushed her teeth recently because a minty scent hung about the damp cavern, although amidst your terror that you took no note. Strain burned at your arms and legs were protesting when Ikki\u2019s lips finally formed a perfect seal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the suction finally began to claim, your limbs were forced together. Ikki\u2019s toothy maw greedily slurped you up and her lips closed behind your booted feet. You flew face first into her closed pallet, your face rubbing against the slimy surface. Ikki\u2019s tongue, a mass of muscle, promptly worked you into her cheek, tucking you behind a row of teeth. Her molars clicked together, trapping you and nearly crushing a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the journey into Ikki\u2019s mouth had seemed to take ages, in reality it had been a mere seconds. From being held behind the young girl\u2019s back to being pressed against her lips, it might have taken a second. Your struggles had added a second more, but hadn\u2019t actually been able to halt your progress. Shortly after being forced into Ikki\u2019s cheek, your world tilted forward as Ikki cast her head downward, an expression of guilt on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d her voice was garbled from holding you captive. However, from your seat within her mouth the words seemed thunderous, forcing you to cover your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was a little hungry,\u201d the young girl continued \u201cso I snuck into the kitchen to grab a snack. I was going to eat something healthy, but those tarts looked so yummy. Please don\u2019t tell my mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStony teeth pressed against your knees and the top of your head as you remained in the fetal position, shielding your ears. Saliva soaked your clothes, you hair, your skin. It clung to your face, invading every nook of your body and even your mouth. Ikki\u2019s cheek was tight, forcing you against her fleshy gums and pearly whites with a force which rendered movement unthinkable. When Ikki was done speaking, she probed at you with her tongue, its slimy tip probing curiously at you thigh, your stomach, your neck, and the side of your face. Despite the present circumstances, she couldn\u2019t help but sate her curiosity. An unnerved chill ran down your spine as it trailed the curve of your lower back, making you feel like the treat she claimed you to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami looked searchingly into Ikki\u2019s downcast face for a long moment. One hand was propped on her hip and the other played absentmindedly with her chin. A stern look shown from her face, but even as Ikki watched she could see a smile fighting its way to the surface, giving lie to Asami\u2019s cool demeanor. After a few further seconds of trying and failing to maintain her act, she instead smiled, releasing an amused huff before casually walking up to Ikki and ruffling her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t,\u201d Asami said, her amusement coloring her voice. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t scarf down your food so hurriedly. You looked as if you were nearly going to choke.\u201d Asami let out a small chuckle and patted Ikki on the head once more. Ikki tilted her head upwards, managing to smile without revealing her hidden captive before bolting away. </span></div></div>",

Not moments ago you would have rejoiced in having avoided the traitor\u2019s attention, knowing that your chances of escape were far greater with Ikki. However, that had been before the girl had crammed you into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently, terror wrecked your every thought. Although you no longer feared being swallowed, that didn\u2019t mean you were safe. An errant bite or toss of the head could injure you or crush a limb, and even as she ran off from Asami her tongue continued to violate your person, probing every inch of your body in the most unnerving way. You were completely at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness greeted your eyes as Ikki kept her lips sealed, lest someone unexpectedly glimpse her prize. The steady sound of breathing rasped away, a soft cadence amongst the sound of wet flesh. Gurgling burbled somewhere near the back of her throat and a burp pushed its way into her mouth, filling the wet chamber with a foul odor. You struggled not to gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The dampness, the confined space, deadly molars resting beside your head, it was all too much. You cried out, beating against her molars as the gentle sway of Ikki\u2019s steps rocked you back and forth. You were in another person\u2019s mouth. At any moment Ikki had the power to crush your fragile body, ending your life in a spatter of gore. The thoughts were too much as you struggled to break free from your confinement, bracing your booted feet against her cheek and your back against her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the discomfort it caused the girl was too much for in a moment she opened her teeth, spilling you onto her tongue. You hadn\u2019t actually been expecting to force your way free, so the sudden impact took you by surprise, robbing you of breath. Despite the pitch darkness, you were familiar enough with a mouth to know where everything was. Her teeth ringed your curled form, trapping you. Behind you, you knew a muscled pit waited, ready to gobble you up. However, on the other side of her teeth you knew freedom awaited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath you, the tongue heaved violently, trapping you against her teeth and eliciting a crack from within your pack. After a moment, the tongue resumed it investigations, its wet surface first brushing against your face and covering it with saliva. After a minute Ikki apparently grew bored as she instead began to trail the curve of your neck downward until she reached your shirt. This she toyed with vigorously, tearing at its edges and nearly disrobing you before finally moving on to your backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching your pack, a single strapped thing draped diagonally across your back, the mighty pink appendage drew back quickly. However, instead of elation filling you at finally being left alone, dread clutched at you instead. Something was off. Suddenly the tongue stabbed at your shoulder, roughly groping at your pack strap in an attempt to rob you of it. She dearly wanted this pack away from you. Thinking back, you remembered the cracking noise from earlier. Could something have broken within your pack and started to leak? An especially rough tug ripped the strap all the way down to your wrist despite your resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the reality of having all your worldly possessions stripped from you finally sank in, outrage replaced your fear. Your gear, your food, the special clothes you needed to remain insulated, all of it rested within that pack. You couldn\u2019t lose that pack; it was all you had in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStubbornly, you forced the strap back around your shoulder, firmly crossing your arms to seal it in place. The straining muscle responded by redoubling its efforts, slapping you and pulling fiercely.  The slimy tongue speared at you, trying to wedge itself between the strap and you, but you would not submit. This pack was irreplaceable. If the girl wanted it out of her mouth she was going to have to spit you out with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden snap could be felt along your shoulder. Horrified, you realized that the strap to your pack had torn. Instinctively you reached out with your hand, grasping the side of the bag desperately in an attempt to keep hold of it. Simultaneously, the tongue snapped outward, hooking the bag and dragging it away from you. You chased after your lost bag, tumbling forward towards Ikki\u2019s gullet and heedless of the potential danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki walked towards her room, contemplating her passenger. How could a person become so small? Was it magic? The spirits? Initially, she had intended to take the tiny spy to her father, but the more she had thought on the matter, the less likely it had seemed she would get the answers she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she turned over her little captive, it was very likely her father would simply leave it to the metal benders to deal with. The equalist would be swept away to the republic city prison where even if the answers to her questions were discovered it would be highly unlikely she would ever hear them. Ikki couldn\u2019t stomach the thought of a mystery such as this remaining unanswered. She would get her answers before she handed the spy off to her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsentmindedly, Ikki released a small burp. Having anything in her mouth always made her mouth water, no matter the nature of the object. The equalist was no exception. Ikki had been forced to swallow frequently to keep from drooling or drowning her passenger, so she couldn\u2019t help releasing a small belch. However, the spy wasn\u2019t so understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after releasing her belch, the tiny person within Ikki\u2019s mouth began to ballistic. They thrashed and shouted, a bizarre feeling in and of itself. However, the protests didn\u2019t stop there. Momentarily, the equalist managed pressed against Ikki\u2019s cheek and teeth, forming a wedge of uncomfortable pressure against the tender flesh of the young girl\u2019s cheek. If it hadn\u2019t been for that uncomfortable stretching of her cheek, Ikki thought the stimuli interesting. Instead, the young airbender was forced to lower her jaw, separating her teeth enough for her prisoner to shoot onto her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her jaw creaked open, Ikki was careful not to open her lips, lest her prisoner slip outside of her mouth. Having alleviated her discomfort, Ikki gently closed her jaw once more, careful not to accidentally injure her passenger. A few moments moment passed and the prisoner began to stir once more. The stimuli was enough to ignite the young girl\u2019s curiosity once more, a feeling Ikki rarely went a day without feeling, yet it seemed to come far more readily where the shrunken person was concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki was curious about many things, but at present it was the equalist\u2019s reactions which intrigued her most. She had decided that her mouth probably afforded the most discreet means by which to transport her charge, and it should\u2019ve been obvious by now that Ikki had no intention of hurting her little charge, yet struggles still emanated from within her mouth. I bit of frustration mixed with the young girl\u2019s curiosity as used her tongue to force the captive against her teeth, as far away from her throat as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ikki pressed the spy against her front teeth, she couldn\u2019t help but investigate her captive. Gently, she began to scout the different features of her passenger, starting with the face and making her way downward. The poor thing was shivering in fear, but that didn\u2019t deter Ikki. She pressed on, tugging at their shirt and taking in its bizarre texture. However, even as she teased the shirt a foul flavor was beginning to suffuse her mouth. Her tongue shifted around to the equalist\u2019s back, quickly identifying the backpack as the source of the horrid taste. Fighting down the urge to gag, Ikki quickly decided that the bag had to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl didn\u2019t hesitate, immediately aiming for a miniature shoulder in order to work the bag free. The flavor was growing stronger as tainted saliva swept passed the bag, carrying with it the horrid flavor originating from within. The strap was very nearly free of her captive\u2019s arm when the spy suddenly struggled, resituating the strap and firmly clamping down upon it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki paid little attention as she walked, instead focusing on wrestling the bag free. Sure, she could have simply spit the captive out and saved herself the trouble, but the childish part of her took the equalist\u2019s struggles as a challenge, and Ikki loathed losing challenges. Ikki continued to work at the pack, seeking some advantage to pry it loose, but the spy wouldn\u2019t budge. At this point it was all Ikki could do not to choke, the taste was so intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ikki approached the turn leading to her family\u2019s rooms, she felt a snap in her mouth. Elation filled her as she realized the strap had broken. She wouldn\u2019t lose this chance. Quickly, Ikki used her tongue to snatch at the bag, pulling it away from its owner as fast as possible. However, as fast as Ikki\u2019s tongue could react, the equalist was apparently faster, grabbing the side of the bag and stubbornly chasing after it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spy could be felt moving towards Ikki\u2019s throat, felt latching onto the pack with legs and arms, and a pang of worry shot through her. What if she accidentally swallowed her passenger? The thought scared the young airbender, and she realized that her pride was definitely not worth the life of some stranger. Ikki resolved that she would immediately stop and spit out both the spy and backpack, despite how close she was to her room. Ikki was beginning to slow as she rounded the corner when a sprinting Meelo surprised her, crashing headlong into her and sending them both sprawling to the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though you knew you were getting dangerously close to Ikki\u2019s gullet, stubbornness had taken you. You paid the danger little heed. Ikki\u2019s greedy tongue fought against you, switching between pulling at the bag and pushing you away. A burning sensation had begun to suffuse you arm, the strain of maintaining your grip taking its toll. At that moment, the bag was everything to you. It held not only everything you needed to survive at your size, but your radio, the only means by which you had to contact Amon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a hand full of people were aware of your current mission, but amongst them only Amon knew how to contact the old crone who had shrunk you. Without your radio, you would be unable to contact Amon. Without Amon, you would be unable to reach the crone. Without the crone, you would be stuck at your current size forever. To you, the bag meant much more than a life of eternal insignificance. Even if it meant your life, you would not relinquish your pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, without the pack firmly situated upon your back, it soon became apparent that Ikki\u2019s tongue was an unstoppable force for someone of your size. The bottom of her mouth was slick and wet, denying your hands and knees purchase. You couldn\u2019t pull the pack free of Ikki\u2019s tongue, not in her own mouth. The realization only hardened your resolve, and you quickly switched tactics. In a desperate attempt to reclaim your bag, you hurled yourself upon its linen surface, abandoning the idea of overpowering the muscle and instead clinging to the pack with your entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted, you cast a look back longingly at the entrance, wishing for the first time that you had refused this mission. The darkness, the dampness, the sounds of wet flesh, and the constant probing of that accursed tongue had worn away your spirit. Sure, you were a loyal equalist, but there was a limit as to what a person is expected to do for their cause. The whole shrinking idea had been a terrible mistake, and you felt that you were the one forced to reap the consequences. Suddenly, your world shifted violently, and you had a moment to wonder what fresh hell awaited you before the feeling of falling suddenly filled you with terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolently, your body smashed into the roof of Ikki\u2019s mouth, knocking the breath from you. Ikki\u2019s head whipped around violently, and you slammed into gums and teeth with a wild violence. Your body rag dolled, a limp bag of bone left to the mercy of the forces assailing it. Consciousness began to fade as the blows took their toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash had maybe taken a second in total to unfold, but by the end, consciousness was beginning to leave you. Only mildly aware of your surroundings, you felt spit pooled around your prone form. Een as you looked on, the world around continued to grow darker. Your last conscious thoughts were to wonder what was pulling on your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo\u2019s sudden appearance had caught Ikki off guard as she had rounded the corner. Unable to stop himself, Meelo had immediately plowed into Ikki\u2019s gut, forcing her to haunch over before being flung backwards onto her butt. Her head had whipped back as she had fallen further, eventually finding herself on her back and wondering how she had gotten there, her eyes gazing upwards towards the ceiling. Absentmindedly, she swallowed the saliva pooled at the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world was spinning as Ikki slowly started to regain her senses. She took a moment to collect herself, dully aware of Meelo doing the same. Eventually she managed to prop herself up using an arm, raising the other to her head to feel her temple as she leveled an angry glare at her younger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeelo, what on earth are you running for?\u201d Ikki gasped her words. They came out garbled and slurred. Ikki felt as if she had a lump in her throat and swallowed, clearing her throat in an attempt to steady her voice. However, even as Ikki was struggling to remain upright, Meelo was already bouncing back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsami said she\u2019s going into the city. I wanna go too!\u201d The absurdity of his statement only made Ikki angry. Meelo would never be allowed to go with Asami, he was far too wild. He had begged Tenzen to allow him to go with him into the city on many occasions, but the answer had always been the same. Hearing him give that as the reason for careening headlong into her gut only made Ikki angrier. However, before she could give Meelo a tongue lashing her brother darted off once more, leaving Ikki angry and feeling ill. Ikki smacked her lips and a familiar, foul taste became apparent, and suddenly Ikki realized that her spy was no longer held within her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorry gnawed at Ikki as she cast her gaze about. Where was the spy? Had they escaped? A flash of guilt and horror flashed with her next thoughts. Were they injured? Were they dead? Ikki suddenly felt even sicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ikki continued to search for her missing charge as other possabilities started to form in her mind. What if Meelo had somehow stolen the spry amidst the chaos? Would Meelo hand him over to dad? How much trouble would she get into for having not only kept the equalist to satisfy her curiosity but mistreated him by hiding him within her mouth?  Ikki was so upset it felt as if her stomach was doing back flips. Guilt and fear of the potential consequences warred within the girl as she released a small burp, distinctly tasting of vomit. She felt as if she were going to be ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of searching fruitlessly, Ikki began to suspect the spy wasn\u2019t nearby. Although that wasn\u2019t a good thing, it also wasn\u2019t entirely bad either. Whatever had happened to the little equalist probably hadn\u2019t killed them outright; otherwise there would be a body nearby. An injured person might hobble away, but a dead person couldn\u2019t. A bit of Ikki\u2019s guilt began to subside as the realized she probably hadn\u2019t killed her tiny charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, nausea still clawed at Ikki despite her relief. The girl\u2019s stomach refused to settle. She needed to calm herself before she continued her search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she had practiced during meditation, Ikki bowed her head and concentrated on breathing. Ikki\u2019s body grew calm, her mind relaxed. She found herself in a tranquil state of mind, absent of guilt, hope, or fear. However, her stomach remained upset. A horrifying thought struck Ikki and tears filled here eyes at the possibility. Terrified to test whether or not her suspicion was correct, Ikki placed her hand against her stomach, praying that she was simply being paranoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki\u2019s hand settled against her belly, just below her navel. Nervously she waited, but thankfully nothing stirred. A small sigh of relief huffed its way between Ikki\u2019s lips, only to turn into a startled yelp as a small form inside of her stomach pushed weakly against her hand. The tears which had been pooling within her eyes suddenly rushed down her cheeks as the true horror of what had happened finally began to hit her. She had found her prisoner.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a groan and a pounding headache, consciousness began to slowly return. The dull rumble of voices could be heard, but your muddled mind could make no sense of what was said. Your head throbbed, your body ached, and your nose burned. A cloying heat tore at you, penetrating you to your core. Familiar darkness greeted your eyes as you reflexively opened them. At your next breath, the stench of vomit stung your nose and left you dizzy. The smell was so powerful that you couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Ikki had puked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the world had happened? One moment you had been clinging tightly to your pack, the next you had been bouncing around the inside of Ikki\u2019s mouth. Even now you could feel bruises forming all over your body. Cautiously, you stretched you limbs, testing them as much as you could in the tight confines allowed you. Thankfully nothing seemed broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay there a moment, you realized that Ikki was moving again. However, her movements felt weird. Instead of the gentle bobbing motion you had become accustomed to during your ride in Ikki\u2019s mouth, a wobbling motion greeted you. This was odd. Loud, guttural groans could be heard intermittently, the sounds seeming to come from every direction at once. Gently, you probed outwards with your hand, trying to gauge where exactly in Ikki\u2019s mouth you currently lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hands probed outward, a familiar sensation greeted your hand. You linen pack lay just within arm\u2019s reach. You released a sigh of relief at the prospect. Continuing your investigations, you placed your hand against the wall against which you leaned. An unfamiliar surface greeted your palm, smooth and slimy with a distinct curve to it. You didn\u2019t recognize which part of the mouth it may be so you decided to probe around until you found a tooth or something else familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for you to scout the confines of your prison. The same slimy, smooth flesh surrounded you on all sides with the exception of above and below. There, two fleshy mounds puckered outwards. The horrifying realization struck you that you were no longer in Ikki\u2019s mouth as another groan erupted from all around you. A rude sound unexpectedly rumbled from above only to be followed a second later by the muddled sound of a belch. Another moment later the muscular walls around you started to press slowly inwards and you knew where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindless panic took you then, sending you into a frenzy. You pushed and struggled, fighting off the muscular muscles of Ikki\u2019s stomach. More groans emitted and you continued to fight, all the while the sway of Ikki\u2019s movements continued to rock your putrid prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst your struggles you realized that the air was growing thin. Your head was beginning to feel light and you could feel the beginnings of exhaustion. The walls around you were starting to secrete liquids, a trickle for now but in time you didn\u2019t doubt you\u2019d be soaked by the stuff. The acrid smell of acid was slowly growing stronger and you feared it wouldn\u2019t be long now before the pain began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgling sound could be heard below as the orifice beneath you sputtered a little. The walls were still pressing inward, grinding against you and pressing your bag painfully against your leg, but it wasn\u2019t too much for you to fend off. However, you were growing weak. Little enough air remained for you to breathe, and you were burning it all away with your vain struggles. Suddenly, a new pressure forced its way against you, this time from a single direction. You kicked out at the offending wall and a surprised yelp seemed to reverberate from above. Shortly thereafter the pressure receded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least the brat knew of your predicament, you thought with a grim satisfaction. As the air around you had lost its oxygen your limbs had lost their strength, gradually giving way until they were now pinned against your side. Your feet were forced together and our body was forced to curl up into the fetal position. A few air pockets remained, but the others had been forced either upwards to be burped out or downwards to pass through the digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wouldn\u2019t be long now before you passed out. The stomach around you continued to contract, the pressure squeezing your ribs and making it difficult to expand your lungs. The air that remained to you wasn\u2019t exactly fresh either, now more carbon dioxide and acid fumes than oxygen by now. A slow itch had begun to consume your body and you could feel liquid sloshing against your boots. Dark spots were dancing across your vision as you sat within the stomach. If Ikki was going to save you she\u2019d have to do it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat within Ikki\u2019s stomach, you could sense her movement. She was panicked, running somewhere as fast as she could. However, as a minute passed your vision began to go dim. A saddening realization struck you that Ikki probably didn\u2019t know what to do. She had a person lodges in her stomach and was probably too scared to puke. As unconsciousness began to claim you, you felt a bit of pity for the poor girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d never be able to forgive herself, especially at such a tender age. However, before you fully fell into unconsciousness a rude noise erupted from above, followed shortly by a gust of fresh air. It was enough to rouse you. As the itching started to grow more intense, you wondered whether consciousness was such a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been perhaps a minute since Ikki had found her captive\u2019s location and there was now a distinct lack of struggles from within her gut. Although she had at first attempted to puke on the spot, she had found herself far too stressed. She had immediately changed tactics, heading towards the bathroom. She needed composure, but most importantly she needed water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now as she finally reached the washroom she realized she\u2019d overlooked an important question. Was there air in stomachs? The already panicked girl began to cry as her fragile composure began to crumble. \u201cThey\u2019re going to suffocate,\u201d Ikki cried in despair. Fat teardrops began to fall down her face once more at the thought of accidentally killing the spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst Ikki\u2019s tears, a thought suddenly took root. It was a simple thought, one which she should have thought of long before, but her addled wits hadn\u2019t allowed.  She could swallow air. If she did, the spy might last long enough for her to make herself puke. As she entered the bathroom and closed the door behind her she never paused, simply gulping air as she moved towards the water basin and turned the water on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany more puffs of air had followed the first, shortly filling up the stomach and affording you more room. You used what little strength you had remaining to force your body upright, staying away from the slimy walls and their acidic secretions. Ikki was no longer moving as much, so you assumed she had reached wherever she had intended to go. The pool of acid at the bottom of the stomach had risen considerably, forcing you rise into a crouch as opposed to sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but see the irony in the situation, despite the painful burns which now coated your body. You, an equalist spy who opposed benders, were about to be eaten by one of their youths. It was laughable! What would your comrades think if they ever heard the story. You doubted they would find it nearly as humorous as you yourself did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the burning sensation continued, your endurance was about at its limit. Once more you found the air thin, yet now new puffs came to refresh it. You imagined the young girl must be at her limit, incapable of swallowing any more air. The pain of your burns was only growing worse as you crouched, too tired to fight your fate any longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. The acid eating at your skin was simply going to kill you before Ikki could attempt a rescue. Resigned, you tilted your head upwards, mouthing a silent prayer amongst the bile, stench, and acid. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t let my death haunt this girl.\u201d A slurping noise erupted from above and cool, clean water belched downwards, filling your open mouth and rinsing the acid from your body. Water continued to belch forward, filling the chamber to the halfway point and expanding it even further than before. The cool water soothed your burns, reminding you that you weren\u2019t dead yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki stood over a washbasin, having just downed her last cup of water. Her stomach groaned and ached from the water and the air, having stretched her stomach further than ever before. Cramps raged through gut and she could feel a pressure building at the base of her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it! She was finally going to puke! Ikki dipped her head down as close to the sink as she could, preparing for what was to come. She had to get this right on the first try as she doubted the equalist had the time to wait on a second attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki pressed her fingers to the back of her throat while squeezing her stomach with her spare hand. She strained her stomach and hunched over. Silently, she prayed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting shoulder deep in acrid water, things were looking grim. The itching sensation had started once more as the stomach around you began to secrete more fluids to compensate for the water. As the air continued to be depleted, black dots had started to dance across your vision once more. You could sense death approaching, and you hadn\u2019t the strength to fend them off. However, even as your mind continued to dull, something alerted you to a coming change, some sixth sense you couldn\u2019t explain. The walls around you convulsed, squeezing inward and forcing the water level quickly above your head. Was this the end?  Were you going to survive this long only to drown?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even as you thought those questions the pressure continued to increase. So great was the pressure that the air was forced from your lungs, putrid water forcing its way into your mouth. Instinctively you struggled, but it was weak and vain. Darkness began to claim your vision and the pitch black world around you slowly began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you faded from consciousness, you became aware of a sudden drop in pressure. A sudden current was whisking you upward, lifting you upwards along with the rest of the stomach\u2019s contents. The sound of retching now accompanied the symphony of gurgles you had grown accustomed to. Near the top of the chamber, you were forced into a narrow tube, barely fitting through the slimy opening. However, you still had no air to breath. Your consciousness continued to darken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDully, you were aware of a sudden cold bombarding your body. Light blazed behind your eyelids, yet you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to stir. You felt your body splash down into a cool pool of water, only to be fished out a moment later. The outside world, it felt so nice, too bad it was too late. Unconsciousness claimed your mind and you knew no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkki looked down at the equalist lying on the counter and couldn\u2019t help but shiver in dread. Red, inflamed skin and hole riddled clothing greeted the girl\u2019s eyes, causing her to cringe in horror. The spy had lost all hair, the acid having eaten it. Guilt once more wracked Ikki\u2019s mind at what she had put this poor person through. However, everything would be alright now wouldn\u2019t it? It had to be! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had worked so hard, gone through so much. The equalist couldn\u2019t die now. Except, there was no sign of movement from the form laid out before her. But she had felt movement within her belly just before she had begun to puke. <br>\r\nIkki didn\u2019t know what to do, but her hands seemed to move of their own accord. After a moment, she found her hand lightly pressing against the spy\u2019s chest, a rhythmic pulse meant to force water out of a drowning victim. She had seen her father teach the very same method to the monks at the temple. A weak spark of hope blossomed within the young girl\u2019s chest. Maybe she wasn\u2019t too late after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the darkness between life and death, you mind hung suspended, its fate yet undecided. In one direction you could sense life, but couldn\u2019t remember why it was so important. In the other you sensed the spirit world, a promise of peace and rest. Your spirit felt tired, tired of living and tired of struggling. Death would be a relief. You began to make your way towards the other world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you had gone far, a painful pressure struck against your chest, forcing you towards life. Why? What force denied you your peace? Madly, your spirit flailed, fighting its way towards death and oblivion. However, the force was relentless. It pounded against your chest over and over, each time forcing you closer to life. No! You sensed a world of agony awaiting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! You\u2019d done your part! No one could claim otherwise. You begged and pleaded with the force, seeking oblivion over the agony that would surely await you, but the force paid you no head. You were close now, just one more push and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, curling over on your side to heave up the water within your lungs. You coughed and sputtered, spilling an incredible amount of water onto the counter top before finally taking a gasp of air. The air was chilled and stank of vomit, but it was the sweetest thing you had ever tasted. You were alive. A surge of excitement at the prospect, and with it returned the full sensation of your tortured body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat was raw, your eyes burned, and your skin felt tender and inflamed. Your head felt cold, but you were too weak to lift your hand to investigate. As your eyes came into focus you looked up, seeing Ikki\u2019s brilliant grey eyes fixed upon you. Tears glistened wetly upon her cheeks and even as you watched, a salty droplet splashed down beside you. Suddenly, you were shivering uncontrollably. You had survived, but you were terribly exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiredly, you shut your eyes once more, and this time sleep rose up to meet you instead of death. The last thing you remember before sleep claimed you was the warm sensation of hands clasping around your huddling form, their heated embrace a welcome sensation against the wet cold.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cautiously, you started out on your journey, immediately crossing the hallway and walking along the opposite wall. You strained your ears and eye as you walked, alert for anything which might signal an approaching resident, but no signs were forth coming. It was too damned quiet. There should at least be the occasional passerby, especially with your proximity to the main entrance. Something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of walking, your heart stopped. This was the moment you had been dreading most. When you walked down the side of the corridor, you had a much larger field of vision. You could see someone coming from afar and respond as needed. Turning a corner, however, robbed you of this advantage. You were blind to any danger that might be lurking just around the bend, though you would probably still be able to hear it. Regardless, it was a terrifying feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of listening at the corner, you finally peeked around. An empty hallway greeted you. A sure of relief flooded through you, and you set off one more. As you walked, you thought once more over your choice of destination and the reasons behind that choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken a while of deliberation, time which you hadn\u2019t felt you truly had, but eventually one choice had stood out above the rest; the kitchen. Everyone had to eat eventually, so it was by far the busiest place in the temple. However, with activity came risk. Your chances of being discovered would be far greater with so many eyes about, but the prospect of such readily available information was just too attractive. Important conversations were commonly held in the kitchen, and anyone who visited the air temple would eventually turn up there. Furthermore, it had an ample supply of food incase your stores began to dwindle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were half way to the next bend when something caught your attention. At first you thought it was your imagination, so soft was the sound, but as it persisted you began to have your doubts. It was a strange noise, reminding you of the sound you get when you remove tape from a surface, but it was infinitely softer. As worry gnawed at your belly you stopped, taking a moment to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood your ground, ears strained for the slightest sound, you noticed something. The sound had stopped when you had. Worried that you might be the source of the noise, you took a moment to check, shuffling in place and walking in a circle, but the sound was nowhere to be heard. Your gear was securely in place and not a sound emanated from your person. A tinge of fear wound its way around your heart, and for a moment you considered turning back towards the safety of your hole, but what would that accomplish? Every moment wasted was another moment away from the safety of your next hideout, though you hadn\u2019t found it yet. Still, the thought of safety was enough to get you moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued your journey with a bit more care this time, traveling as quietly as possible and seeking out the noise, but the sound didn\u2019t return. That was good. Perhaps you had been the source of the sound. You were definitely walking slower at the moment, and you hadn\u2019t tried running when you had stopped earlier. You increased you pace for a moment, speeding up to a half jog for about ten seconds. After a short delay the noise returned, seeming even quieter than before yet still barely audible. You continued your little jog, seeking the source of the noise, but it wasn\u2019t coming from your person. You stopped suddenly and the noise continued for a moment before suddenly stopping as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic was starting to build within your chest as you reasoned out the source of the noise. It started whenever you moved, but you weren\u2019t the cause. Your immediately conclusion was that someone was following you, but a quick check behind you disproved that notion. Still, you imagined you felt eyes upon your back, burrowing into you as your panic mounted. The thought of some unknown being tailing you, invisible yet able to watch your progress, filled you with such primal fear that it couldn\u2019t be ignored. After a second of thought, you tore off down the hall, running for your life and seeking out any shelter available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after starting to run the sound returned, seeming more a pattering now as you raced along the hallways. The air rushed past your ears, filling them with a dull roar, yet now the sound could be heard over even that. You came to a corner and didn\u2019t hesitate as you pushed ahead, escape the only thing on your mind. Ahead, a door frame was visible along the side of the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a storeroom no doubt. You had chosen this path specifically because it the least likely route for idle passers. It passed through the storerooms of the temple before eventually leading to the kitchens. The doorway ahead would undoubtedly have a crack beneath it through which you could escape. The room would hopefully be filled with boxes and crates amongst which to hide. However, even as you had thought of safety a dark shadow had overtaken you, darkening your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great thud resounded from the wood behind you, knocking you off balance. You stumbled forward towards the doorway, the seam clearly visible from where you ran. You were so close, you were almost there, but it was not meant to be. A sticky hand wrapped around your torso, pinning your arms to your side before lifting you into the air. Your tiny body rushed into the air at a dizzying speed, and with equally dizzying speed you were turned around to face your captor. Your eyes were having difficulty focusing and nausea threatened to empty your stomach, but after a moment features began to come into focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo light blue eyes and a gap-toothed smile filled your view, intimidating in both size and proximity. A stubby nose was nearly pressed against your chest and you could feel the air rushing through its nostrils. After a moment, the boy before you opened his mouth, releasing words which seemed to crack like thunder to your tiny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot\u2019cha!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you recovered from the ear shattering boom that was the boy\u2019s voice, you began to struggle against his grip. The boy might have caught you, but that didn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t break free. Twisting and turning, you fought the iron grip clutching at your torso. No, you couldn\u2019t have failed your mission already! You hadn\u2019t even been able to gather some useful information yet! You were only as tall as his palm, so his hand could easily encircle your entire body. However, it was apparent the boy didn\u2019t wish to hurt you. You took advantage of that fact as you wrestled against the boy\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that!\u201d the boy growled as you pushed your feet against his fingers. His grip was tight, but you still managed to make progress. You wriggled your back, trying to scoot to one side or another in order to slide out of the palm and away to freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope blossomed as boy lost his grip on you, your struggles proving a bit much for the young boy. His hand opened and you began slip free, but as you looked down you suddenly had a change of heart. You hadn\u2019t realized how far the drop would be! Even at the boy\u2019s meager height, the drop seemed deadly. You clutched at a passing thumb in a vain attempt to arrest your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the boy brought his second hand up, catching you before you began your decent towards death. This time, when he held you in his hand, you didn\u2019t struggle. After seeing that you weren\u2019t going to try to escape again he lessened his grip, affording you much more comfort but keeping both hands cupped around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat in the boy\u2019s hand, wondering about your fate, you decided to take a closer look at your new captor. A stubby nose greeted you first, flat and ugly. Slightly above, droopy eyes stared at you with boyish curiosity. A bald head caught you attention as it shined in the ambient light, momentarily blinding you. From the ridiculous smile gaping on his face, you gathered that he was missing a tooth. The stickiness of his fingers hinted at some sweet treat devoured not so long in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew this face, though not by sight. It was the face of Meelo, Tenzin\u2019s youngest bender brat. He had a reputation for rowdiness and rudeness as well as a distinct lack of personal boundaries. Judging by his current state, he probably had a lack of hygiene as well. You cursed you luck that of all the people you could have been captured by, it had to be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he said in voice thundered, though it was a normal tone of voice to the young boy. \u201cYou\u2019re a tiny person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPlease, not so loud!\u201d you shouted, which to him probably resembled a high pitch squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he spoke normally, but seeing your hunched form and pained expression he seemed to get the gist of what you had said. He leaned in close now, and his next words came out in a hoarse whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Meelo paused for only a moment before charging ahead. \u201cHow did you get so small?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the boy wasn\u2019t immediately suspicious. That was good. Maybe if you convinced him that you were a friend you might be able to get away. It was worth a shot, you had little left to lose. Setting your mind to the task, you began to spin your tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d he interrupted, his attention caught by something else. A string of questions ensued, some of which you actually got to answer. Meelo was as rambunctious as the tales said and then some. Here in the abandoned part of the temple and without an adult to keep him in line, Meelo was a free to be his annoying, obnoxious self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a sudden burst of irritation. Children! You disliked them immensely. With their short memories and attention spans you just didn\u2019t have the patience to tolerate their nonsense. As you continued to fume, however, you realized that Meelo had stopped talking and was now aiming a pointed glance at your bag. Irritation turned to a note of fear as you realized that there was an equalist insignia plastered right on the side of your bag, too late to hide the telling mark. You hoped for a moment that the boy wouldn\u2019t recognize the symbol, but that hope died the moment you gazed into his light blue eyes. Suspicion stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of the bad guys!\u201d He accused, a surprisingly intimidating glare radiating from such a childish face. Perhaps it was the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread resettled within your heart as you realized that you had little chance of escape now. The boy would likely bring you straight to his father, likely receiving a reward of sweets for his trouble. You would be taken into metal bender custody and questioned. You knew you wouldn\u2019t talk, metal benders rarely tortured captives, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to safely do so to someone your size. Although your secrets would remain safe, your mission was a failure. Realizing the inevitability of the situation, you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead and take me to your father so we can get this over with.\u201d Surprisingly, the boy obeyed. Meelo broke out into a trot, but just as suddenly stopped, unsure of himself. Once more he turned those dopy eyes upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you tell daddy what he wants to know?\u201d Meelo asked. You hadn\u2019t expected him to ask that question. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t as dimwitted as he seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I'd sooner die than talk. Besides, it's not like your father will do anything to try to get the secrets out of me. Torture would be too risky to use on me anyways.\u201d Your reply was simply truthful. It wasn\u2019t clear what Tenzin would do to you once he discovered your presence, but you doubted you\u2019d be hurt. Any torture they could inflict on you to pull information from you would most likely kill you outright at your size, so that would be a fool\u2019s errand. Truthfully, the only knowledge of real import was the existence of a shrinking method for tiny spies, and that would be given away the moment you were seen. Still, you had a reputation as a loyal equalist to uphold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Meelo\u2019s voice was sharp. Shattering all preconceived notions of your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean no? That\u2019s the way these things work. You take me to your father, he holds me for questioning, and I sit in a cell until Amon comes to free me.\u201d As you spoke, uncertainty colored your voice. For a moment, you had forgotten that Meelo was a kid, and kids were prone to irrationality. Not even a minute ago you had been wishing for a way to avoid being brought to Tenzin, but suddenly Tenzin seemed a whole lot better than his irrational brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot until you agree to tell daddy what you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Meelo was fiercely loyal to his father. You could understand where he came from, you were fiercely loyal to your cause after all. However, there was a problem. You were an adult, capable of making rational decisions for rational reasons. At present, you were being held by an irrational little boy who was fiercely loyal to his father and currently had you at his mercy. This could go bad quickly if you didn\u2019t tell him what he wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll tell Tenzin whatever he wants to know. Just please, take me to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou words were sincere. You would tell his father everything you knew the moment he asked, it was all outdated or apparent anyways. The only thing it would cost you was your pride, but the idea of a vengeful little boy roaming halls as you waited to be taken by the metal benders didn\u2019t seem appealing. Although you would surely be watched the entire time, there was still the chance that Meelo might find the opportunity to take his vengeance if you were to lie to him. It would be best if you were a cooperative captive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo stared at you for a long time, reading your expression and thinking intently. His eyes bore into you, probing your face for deception. Was this really the face of a five year old? He seemed far more distrusting than would have been expected of one his age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Meelo's eyes bore into you, they hardened. Terror clutched at your gut as you knew the words to come before they had even been uttered; the words you had dreaded to hear most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your outrage at the accusation was almost as strong as your worry. Staying with the unpredictable boy was becoming more and more stressful as one unexpected turn followed another. You had to convince the boy of your sincerity, no matter the cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying! What makes you think I\u2019m lying?\u201d Your voice was strained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bad guy. Bad guys always lie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart nearly stopped at that last statement.  How do you argue with that logic? Hell, would logic even work on someone as young as Meelo? What would the boy do to you if you failed to convince him of your sincerity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould the boy try to keep you, seeking to interrogate you started lying? Would he simply abuse you until you started confessing imaginary crimes? If he wasn\u2019t willing to believe your words, how could you possibly convince him to take you to an adult?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do to convince you I\u2019m telling the truth?\u201d You feared whatever response you might be given. Meelo wasn\u2019t rational, so it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if his requirements were equally irrational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me everything you know.\u201d Once more, Meelo\u2019s answer left you little to work with. How much would be enough? How could you convince the boy that you didn\u2019t know more once you did finally tell him everything? Chances were good that you would have to lie to the boy in order to satisfy him. You weren\u2019t a very good liar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, something unexpected happened. From somewhere deep within the temple, a voice called. Its warm tone was loving, yet carrying a great weight with it. You realized it must be the voice of Pema, the mother of the boy in whose grip you now rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeelo, it\u2019s time to meditate with your father.\u201d<br>\r\nThings had suddenly changed. With a burst of relief you realized Meelo wouldn\u2019t be able to keep you for long. If he went to meditation, you would soon be discovered and confiscated by Tenzin. If he tried to hide you somewhere along the way to meditation, there was a good chance you could escape. Even then, if he took too long going to meditation, someone would come looking for him and rescue you in the process. You relaxed a little, secure in the knowledge that soon enough you would either be free or in more responsible hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's mind was apparently following the same line of thought as your own, as his face was growing more and more worried. His grip tightened around you once more as he ran to the nearest store room, taking a hand away from you momentarily to open its door. Inside there were crates and boxes, but no suitable prisons. The next room yield similar results, and the third was completely filled with scrolls. Sure, there were urns on occasion, but they were mostly filled to the top with valuable items, making it easy for you to climb out and escape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the empty containers were kept in another place entirely, as all the containers in these storage rooms were filled to the brim with little room to spare. Your confidence grew as Meelo\u2019s frustration deepened. After about the fifth room, Meelo stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you be willing to stay in my pocket?\u201d he asked hopefully. Meelo\u2019s pockets were loose things. It would be easy to peak your head out and shout for help as soon as an adult came by. You stared up at the boy and rolled your eyes, choosing to remain silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d the boy said, his face showing worry at the prospect of being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Meelo bowed his head in thought. This was something you hadn\u2019t thought the boy capable of. His eyebrows drew together and his tongue stuck out at the corner of his mouth. His eyes were unfocused, and with a start you realized he was thinking. After about a minute or so, Meelo\u2019s face suddenly came alight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it.\u201d he shouted, causing you to wince. His voice was bright with pride at his own quick thinking. Far off, you could hear Pema yell once more, but she seemed farther away than before. Perhaps she didn\u2019t know where Meelo was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinking heart, wondered what he could be planning. He wouldn\u2019t be able to pass through the more populated parts of the temple in search of a better hiding place, and it was still unlikely he would be able to find one nearby. You were turning those thought over and over within your head when the answer soon became apparent.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you watched, Meelo\u2019s free hand rose to meet you. He shifted the hand which held you aloft so as your back was exposed before gradually plucking at your pack. A surge of worry and outrage surged through your mind as you realized the boy was trying to take your pack from you, the pack held irreplaceable gear within it, but you were in no position to struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo struggled with the pack for a moment, fighting to get it off of your back. The process was uncomfortable, but you offered no resistance. After a minute of worrying at your back, he finally pried the pack free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised by how many feeling flared up at the loss of your pack. Denied your means of self sufficient survival, you suddenly felt trapped: forced to stay with Meelo else starve. Meelo\u2019s hand dropped to his pocket, depositing your pack within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hand withdrew from Meelo's pocket, it didn't come back to you as you had expected, instead traveling to the front of Meelo\u2019s trousers. Alarm shot through you as potential hiding places suddenly shot to the forefront of your mind, all of which had previously been unthinkable. Meelo grasped the drawstrings which held his pants up and began to fiddle with them, obviously trying to work them loose. A tiny tongue stuck out between two lips as the young boy concentrated upon his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does mom have to tie it so tight?\u201d Meelo continued muttering to himself as he worked at the knot above his groin. A minute had already passed, and though you could no longer hear Pema\u2019s calls you were sure Meelo\u2019s time was ticking away. Each second he failed with his draw strings was another in which Pema might rescue you from your loathed fate. You considered struggling again, guaranteeing that he would have to use both hands to restrain you, but there was still the chance you would die. For the moment, you weren\u2019t even sure if Meelo could untie his pants on his own, nor what he intended to do once they were off. There was no need to jump to such drastic measures, not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute more and you could tell that Meelo was definitely making progress. The suspense of an unknown fate seemed worse than anything Meelo might actually do to you. Still, you didn\u2019t want to let the boy undress himself. You started to struggle, doing your best to feign to escape without actually risking a fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan worked, and Meelo had to withdraw his hand from his pants in order to keep you from breaking free. With his hands occupied, Meelo could no longer untie his pants. You began to pace yourself, wriggling whenever the boy removed a hand to work at his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, Meelo decided to ignore your struggles and work on his pants. You had actually managed to climb onto his sleeve at that point, starting to shimmy along a seam towards the front of his shirt. That had forced him to once more avert his attention, maintaining the stand still, except it wasn\u2019t a stand still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing moment, the threat of discovery loomed larger. She was undoubtedly furious by now, and Meelo would surely be punished for being late. Apparently Meelo was starting to feel the pressure, the threat of punishments for being late, trying to hide his tiny captive from his father, and trying to hide them in his pants of all places looming over head. The young boy almost looked like he was going to cry, so distraught was he at the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay between one of your struggling sessions, Meelo flashed you a ferocious glare. He was furious at your protests, furious at how effective they were, and obviously terrified of being caught. Meelo had grown to dislike as his frustration had mounted. You were the enemy, a bad guy, a liar, and a spy in his eyes. You weren\u2019t supposed to be winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spark flashed in Meelo\u2019s eyes, and suddenly he had the answer to his problem. Eagerly, Meelo\u2019s sticky hands brought you upwards, bringing you closer to his gaping maw.  A moment later, you found yourself crying out in alarm as you were forced between his waiting lips and passed a row of sharp incisors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled for a moment before your world went dark, wet lips sealed you within your new, moist prison. For a moment, shock kept you quiet. You could hardly believe what had just happened. However, your shock was short lived as panic soon took its place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wriggled and writhed beneath you at first, pushing you against the roof of his mouth before starting to suck on you. The suction was immense and intermittent, causing you ears to pop. You clothes were soaked with saliva, dragging heavily at you with each pull. Breathing was difficult, as the sudden suction always threatened to pull your breath from you. You couldn\u2019t even struggle, as you were so firmly stuck by suction and tongue. Overall, it was a living hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fear of being swallowed alive gripped you as you remained pinned. You wanted out, you wanted to be away. You would do anything, tolerate anything, if only your torment would end. However, that was not to be so. Your torment went on as Meelo undoubtedly worked at his pants, working to open the way for what would surely be another hellish torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou vision was blackening and your body was going numb when a light finally broke the inky black. Meelo\u2019s mouth was opening. It was only a sliver, but it was opening. Soon enough you knew why, as the tip of Meelo\u2019s tongue soon pressed its way outward to take its place at the corner of his mouth. This was your moment. The fresh air and short reprieve were allowing you to recuperate. Fueled by panic and desperation, you began to struggle against your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolently, you kicked out, trying to force your way to Meelo\u2019s lips. You pulled at the tongue beneath you for extra purchase, your hands grabbing at the slippery surface and failing to find their hold. Still, you were making progress. Meelo\u2019s tongue had slipped within his mouth once more as you continued to struggle, but you were already reaching his front teeth and beginning to slip your way past, your head and shoulders forcing their way between the boy\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt of pain shot through your ribs as Meelo brought his teeth down. Though he didn\u2019t bite hard, at your size it was still enough to cause your ribs to creak. The sharp wedges that were his incisors stabbed painfully into your torso, and you found yourself beating against Meelo\u2019s lips, trying to get him to relinquish his hold. Breathing was becoming more and more difficult as the pressure of the bite denied your lungs the ability to expand. Once more, the world began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow you, you could see Meelo\u2019s hands continuing to work at the knot. It was a simple know, but to the boy\u2019s young mind it was proving impossibly difficulty to untie. In his concentration, Meelo absentmindedly pushed his tongue between your legs, whirling the little muscle against your nether regions. Your struggles became even more frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of playful probing, you could feel a pressure beginning to mount deep inside yourself. Your face was blushing and your struggles were losing strength. Despite your pants to stand guard, the boy\u2019s tongue was strong enough to force the stimulation upon you. It had been a long time since you had had the comfort of another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith horror, you realized what was happening. The boy was too young to know what havoc his stimulations would wreak upon your composure. The thought of being violated by a young boy was repulsive, but when you went to cry out, your words became a moan. No! This was wrong! You had to stop him. You didn\u2019t want this. However, your body betrayed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour limbs refused to move, to struggle, or to do anything but twitch spasmodically at the pleasure currently overwhelming you. A surge of pleasure shot through you as Meelo\u2019s tongue suddenly twisted against your groin. Your already darkened vision grew darker still as your climax drew near. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the world around you shrank as overwhelming pleasure robbed you of all senses. An ocean of ecstasy overwhelmed you, pounding away at your rationality. You thrashed wildly, caught in the throes of passion. A scream tore from your lips, and the world grew dim.</span></div></div>",

Dully, you were aware that there was something important you needed to remember, some kind of danger, but in your present state, you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to care. Instead, you lulled lazily in your half conscious state, enjoying the bliss of pure, sexual release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a while the world began to come back to you. Your body was wet, but not the wet of being soaked in a young boy\u2019s saliva. No, you were merely damp, as if you had been drying for some time. The air was cool upon your skin while the surface beneath you was warm to the touch. With a jolt, you came to your senses, sitting up in a state of alarm. You weren\u2019t in Meelo\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking about, you immediately spotted Meelo\u2019s hovering face, his eyes concerned. You were currently sitting upon his palm, very close to his face. His breath was warm as it blew past you, taking the edge of the chill which had started to settle upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by Meelo\u2019s expression, the boy must have thought he had hurt you when you had cried out in pleasure earlier. Good, that meant you had more time. Even now, as you strained your ears, you could hear Pema\u2019s voice once more, her voice now tinged with anger and worry. By now, it had probably been twenty minutes since she had first called for Meelo. The number of places left to search was dwindling, and Meelo\u2019s time was growing short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you realized that Meelo was moving. Could the boy have given up? However, as the young airbender continued to walk, you noticed something off. The hand which Meelo wasn\u2019t using to carry you was currently out of sight, and the arm attached to it was surprisingly still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA jolt went through you and you flung yourself towards the edge of Meelo\u2019s palm, eliciting a yelp of surprise from the boy. It didn\u2019t matter. As you reached the edge, you dropped down to look over the edge. Far below, the hand was clutched in front of Meelo\u2019s groin, two limp draw strings dangling from the side of his hand. Meelo had untied his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Meelo turned a corner, immediately walking into a small bathroom. A high window hung from the wall, giving a sparse amount of light to the drab interior. A plain toilet sat in the corner, and a sink was mounted to the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft whisper of cloth dropping accompanied Meelo\u2019s pants as he relinquished his grip upon the draw strings, allowing them to drop to the floor. To your horror, the boy wasn\u2019t wearing anything beneath. His young manhood bobbed as he stepped out from his pants, moving back to the bathroom door and using his now free hand to close it. There was a sharp sound as he pushed the bar lock home. Slowly, you backed away from the edge of his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you looked up, you found Meelo\u2019s eyes fixed upon you. An uncertain expression pained his face. After a moment, you could help yourself. You opened your mouth to plead with your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019ll do whatever you or your father tells me to do. Just please, don\u2019t put me in your pants.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bad guy. Bad guys always lie.\u201d Well technically, you thought benders were the bad guys, abusing their powers to lord over the common folk, but you weren\u2019t about to correct your young captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but do you ever hear stories of good guys sticking the bad guys down their pants?\u201d That last comment of yours very clearly shook the boy. You decided to push the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing in bad. That means putting me in your pants will make you a bad guy. Do you understand?\u201d Meelo nodded at you, looking very worried. However, after a moment he decided to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just wanted to help daddy. I don\u2019t want to be a bad guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, you can help your dad by bringing me to him. That\u2019s what a good guy would do. Don\u2019t you want to be a good guy?\u201d The emphatic nod of Meelo\u2019s head caused you to smile. \u201cThen do the the right thing and take me to your father.\u201d<br>\r\nMeelo wasn\u2019t such a bad kid, despite what he had been about to do to you, only misguided. Now that you had convinced him that what he was about to do was wrong, you no longer faced the threat of being crammed into Meelo\u2019s pants. Confidence started to return to you as you realized you had seized some measure of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you tell Dad everything he wants to know,\u201d Meelo asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him everything he wants to know,\u201d you replied, your voice sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo looked at you for a long moment, studying his little captive. The wheels were turning in his head as he decided whether or not to trust. You held your breath, awaiting your fate. Slowly, tension left Meelo, and you knew what Meelo\u2019s response would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he said at long last. Relief flooded your body, making you feel light headed. \u201cGive me a second to tie my pants and I\u2019ll take you to daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo once more stepped within his pant legs, bending over to grip them with his free hand. He hoisted them up to his waste and began to fumble at the strings, only to realize that he would require two hands to fasten his pants once more. Blue eyes glanced at you with worry for a moment before Meelo sat down on the floor, setting you beside his leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I\u2019m going to trust you not to run off while I tie my pants. You\u2019d better not trick me.\u201d A note of warning was apparent in Meelo\u2019s voice, the cost of running apparent. After you gave him a reassuring nod, the boy went to work on his draw strings, trying to work them back into some semblance of a knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mountain of a boy worked, your eyes spotted something you hadn\u2019t expected. It was your bag. It rested on the floor between Meelo and the door where he had initially dropped his pants. You called up to the boy, catching his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeelo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a moment. I\u2019ve almost got it.\u201d The boy was concentrating fully on the knot, not wanting to lose his rhythm to answer your call. However, you persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy bag: It\u2019s on the floor.\u201d Your voice was raised to yell, seeming deafening to yourself, but doubtlessly barely audible to the giant before you. After a moment, the boy looked upwards, seeing the pack where he lay. It was out of easy reach, so Meelo would have to get up get it, undoing all of his hard work. Meelo looked at the bag, and then at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Meelo had forgotten that you were a prisoner, or maybe he was just overly trusting. Regardless, you began to walk over to the bag. You could feel the boy\u2019s eyes upon your back, watching for treachery as you walked towards the pack. Though it was only a foot in a half away, it too you a full fifteen seconds to reach the pack at a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you bent down to reach for the pack, you stopped, taking a second to take stock of your situation. At present, you were Meelo\u2019s prisoner. However, if Meelo were to hand you off to Tenzin, your chances of rescue would become next to nothing. The equalists wouldn\u2019t waste resources rescuing a failed spy. You would never be able to reach Amon, and thus would never be restored to your normal size. Those thoughts left you feeling sick, despite your previous triumph. However, Meelo had unwittingly given you a chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were only a foot and a half from Meelo\u2019s legs, the boy was sitting, his pants untied. On the other hand, the door was little more than a foot away. If you were to sprint, you might be able to make it beneath the door in less than five seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you weighed your options. You could take your pack and return to Meelo, risking that you might never be returned to normal, but ensuring that the boy would not abuse you. Alternatively, you could snatch up your bag and high tail it beyond the door. The boy would be tipped up by his own pants, and once you made it past, the lock on the door would buy you an extra couple of seconds. You could reach one of the nearest store rooms and hole up within them for a while, avoid Meelo\u2019s attention.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo made a light sound of impatience. You had been waiting by your bag for a few seconds now, and the boy was beginning to grow suspicious. You grabbed your pack, standing up once more. You had come to a decision.</span></div></div>",

I was just checking that nothing was broken.\u201d You made your voice sound jovial, trying to put off Meelo\u2019s suspicions as you slowly started walking back. Seeing that you were on your way back, Meelo went back to fiddling with his draw strings, taking his gaze away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that you were no longer being watched, you immediately reversed your direction, running as fast as you could towards the door. Five seconds was all you needed, five measly seconds of inattention. However, after only a moment of running it became apparent that you weren\u2019t going to get even one second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Meelo\u2019s voice sound surprised and oddly hurt. However, you didn\u2019t look back. You just kept running, trying desperately to make it to the door before Meelo got a hold of you. There was a thrum in the air, and you knew without looking that Meelo was using air bending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost there. The door loomed in front of you, an impassible barrier. Beneath lay the chink in its armor, a one inch tall gap below the blockade. A large shadow fell across you a few steps away from salvation. Would you make it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were charging headlong towards the door, preparing yourself to dive. This was it, your best chance to escape. If you failed, you were not like to get another, not after betraying Meelo\u2019s trust. The world around you had grown dark. Judging by the earlier thrum in the air, Meelo had used air ending to leap into the air, and even now hung suspended above you. At the very last moment, you dove towards the door, flinging your backpack ahead of you so as it didn\u2019t get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fist smashed down in front of you, crushing your bag in mid flight. Horror gripped you at its loss. Your clothes, your lights, your food, your radio, everything had been within that bag. A moment later you crashed into the tops of Meelo\u2019s fingers where they covered his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand wasted no time in snatching you up, leaving the squashed bag and its shattered contents on the floor by the door. The grip was tight around your torso, barely contained rage raging all around you. For a moment, you feared the boy was going to crush you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your life was spared. The boy didn\u2019t even yell at you or accuse you of betrayal, but you didn\u2019t think that was a good thing. Having abandoned his pants in the chase, Meelo once more stepped into his pant legs, reaching down with his spare hand to hoist them upwards. Only, this time he pulled his hand outward, creating a gap between his pants and his lower stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror clutched at you. You had thought you had convinced the boy not to try to hide you in his pants. You had thought that at the worst, you would\u2019ve been taken to Tenzin, not crammed down this child\u2019s pants. You struggled in Meelo\u2019s grip, but he simply squeezed tighter, crushing you harder than ever before. He wasn\u2019t so concerned about your health at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped struggling, and the grip lessened somewhat, though not much. Your ribs ached, but nothing felt broken. Out of breath, you called out to Meelo, trying to reason with the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeelo, don\u2019t do this. This isn\u2019t right! You don\u2019t\u2026\u201d But his voice cut you off. He didn\u2019t yell, but instead spoke in a harsh whisper. It was much more frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a bad guy. You want to trick me, and I almost let you do it. You will stay quiet until I tell you to speak, or I will crush you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was shaking now, his wrath about ready to overflow. You had betrayed him, and in doing so had lost all credibility. To the boy, your words were poison. He would no longer listen to your words, nor would he pay heed to your past conversations. All chances of dissuading Meelo from his chosen path had withered.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYour stomach lurched as Meelo brought his hand down towards his the gap in his pants. You watched as you were gently lowered into the gloom and towards the seat of Meelo\u2019s pants and his awaiting manhood. The fork in his pants offered only a small ledge upon which to rest, and it was to this which you were first brought. But as Meelo set you down, it soon became apparent that this plan wouldn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately slipped, falling off of the sweaty seam towards one of the pant legs. Thankfully, you managed to grab onto the edge at the last moment, dangling precariously between the pant leg and Meelo\u2019s thigh. Directly above you, the head of Meelo\u2019s manhood stared down at you, its dark hole ominous. Above, Meelo also stared down at you, his dark eyes showing annoyance. He reached into his pants once more, and you felt much better riding upon his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of lifting you out of the pants as you had hoped, he instead brought you towards his manhood. The pillar of meat loomed before you, equal to your own length though much thicker. He pressed you against the base, where shaft met pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on.\u201d His command was curt. Remembering his earlier threat, you obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrapped your arms around his girth, your arms barely managing to encircle him. Your legs hung to either side of the meat between your legs, your feet planted firmly against his testicles for leverage. You highly doubted you could last long in this position, you weren\u2019t in the best of conditions at the moment, but you weren\u2019t about to tell Meelo that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful smell of sweat was bombarding your nose, making you want to gag. Meelo apparently didn\u2019t care much for personal hygiene. His hooded meat was damp with sweat, making the flesh about sticky. The whole structure was smooth and absent of hair, offering you no further hold. Disgust warred with fear as you realized the situation you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If Meelo decided keep you like this, dangling from his manhood, it wouldn\u2019t be long before you found yourself tumbling down one of his pant legs. It would be even less time if the rambunctious boy were to bounce around as he always did. On the off chance you managed to survive the fall, death would still be guaranteed without your pack. Your only hope of survival rested on Meelo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rested against his meat, facing towards the young bender\u2019s belly, a strange shift began to occur. With a start, you realized that the strain on your arms was lessening, and that the pillar beneath you was beginning to level out. You were relieved at first, thinking Meelo had come up with some way to keep you from falling, but as you looked up at his face you saw an expression of confusion. Looking over your shoulder in horror, you realized Meelo\u2019s penis was rising of its own accord.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This couldn\u2019t be happening. Being trapped within Meelo\u2019s pants was bad enough, the worst fate you had been willing to allow yourself to imagine only a few moments ago; but as Meelo continued to become more aroused, a new horrifying thought entered your mind. Meelo was enjoying himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up once more to Meelo\u2019s face, a mixture of pleasure, uncertainty, and confusion on his face. Meelo didn\u2019t know what was happening, though you did. From discussions with relatives, you knew that young boys frequently got erections. However, youths weren\u2019t yet hormonally driven to have sex, so they rarely masturbated. Unfortunately, that didn\u2019t mean they were immune to pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Meelo\u2019s penis became fully turgid, things started to heat up. A constant thumping started to surge through the flesh between your legs, pulsing between your thighs and against your most sensitive areas. The scrotum beneath your feet was starting to contract, tugging at your booted feet. Your butt was gradually lifted until you found yourself nearly horizontal, the weight of your hind quarters preventing the shaft from pointing skywards. Above, Meelo\u2019s face was flushed with color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Meelo\u2019s words came out in a hushed whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh spirits, how were you going to explain this to him? Normally, the boy wouldn\u2019t have been given this sort of talk until he was much older, and even then by his father. You needed to get off of Meelo right now. You didn\u2019t want anything to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet me off of here!\u201d Your voice was frantic. This was wrong, this whole situation was wrong. Meelo\u2019s expression was conflicted, half pleasure and half fear. A shadow blotted out what little light reached you within the depths of his pants as Meelo\u2019s hand slowly descended towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Meelo\u2019s hand wrapped around you, something changed. The added stimulation caused the flesh beneath you to spasm, and a low moan escaped Meelo\u2019s mouth. His eyes rolled back in his head and his hand shifted, extending its grip to encircle his penis as well. His hand began to knead you against his manhood, an undulating pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were falling from your eyes at this point. You wanted to go home. You wanted to be with your friends in the equalist training centers. You wanted to be serving Amon. Instead, you were some bender brat\u2019s sex toy. To be brought so low, to be humiliated and abused in such a way, your spirit was breaking and your tears wouldn\u2019t stop coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo\u2019s pace quickened, his hand starting to tug back and forth. The motions dragged you across his length in a back and forth motion, the now sweaty member thrashing with every tug. You noticed that the tugging wasn\u2019t exactly even, and that you were in fact being pulled further and further towards Meelo\u2019s tip. Your legs fell away from Meelo\u2019s scrotum, and a minute later you found yourself draped over his tip, your legs dangling in the air. You desperately struggled not to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands gripped the shaft, but the sweat worked against you. Your grip was weakening. Feeble shouts erupted from your mouth, trying to snap Meelo from his daze, but he either didn\u2019t hear you over he sounds of wet flesh, or didn\u2019t care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back and forth motion of his hand was growing faster, and the rise and fall of the young boy\u2019s chest was growing more and more rapid. He was getting closer to his climax. You couldn\u2019t remain still any longer, lest you fall to your doom, so you began to struggle for a better grip. You struggled to hoist yourself upwards, rubbing against the boy\u2019s head in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low whine burst from Meelo\u2019s mouth at the new stimulation, sending him into a frenzy. His abs began to contract, forcing his torso to bow and straighten in time to the powerful tremors shuddering through his throbbing penis. He bucked his hips and his knees wobbled, but miraculously he remained standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to keep your hold of Meelo\u2019s shaft, bracing for the sudden onrush of fluid which would surely strike your chest at any moment. It never came. Meelo pumped on for a few moments, instinctively drawing out his pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to hand on for dear life as your grip slowly lessened for what seemed like ages before Meelo finally remembered his tiny passenger. A hand came down beneath you, and you gladly dropped down into it. However, when you were finally raised out of your linen prison, angry eyes accosted you. </span></div></div>",

His hand shook beneath you and his breathing was quick and shallow. His fear was palpable, and that in turn left you feeling scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d you began, but Meelo wasn\u2019t listening to your words. He had experienced something new and frightening, and he wasn\u2019t in any rational state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Meelo could continue his rant, a sudden change came over the boy. A pained expression shot across his face, and as quick as he could he ran over to toilet, his pants forgotten as he ran. Without taking you from his hand, he firmly gripped his penis, both hands steadying his stream as the boy relieved his full bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you found yourself pressed against Meelo\u2019s prepubescent manhood, though this time he was relieving himself rather than enjoying himself. You could hear the warm urine hitting the water at the bottom of the toilet, and if you had cared to you could have probably watched it his. In your broken state of mind, it didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Meelo had used you as a sex toy, even unwittingly, something had broken inside you. The thought that a mere child could reduce you to something so low was horrible, but that wasn\u2019t what had shattered your spirit. It was the thought that without your radio, you were stuck like this for the rest of your days. You cast a glance at where the crushed remains of your pack rested, a light brown speck flattened against the hard wood floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Meelo\u2019s hands jostled his meat, and you knew the boy to be finished. His sweaty shaft fell away from you, and you were brought to eye level once more. The angry glare was hotter than ever, as was the fear which glistened in Meelo\u2019s quickly watering eyes. The boy had violated you, yet he was the one about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, footsteps became audible passing through the hall outside, and Meelo\u2019s face froze in terror. They came closer and closer, and hope blossomed at the thought of rescue, but soon enough the footsteps passed. When the sounds had completely faded, Meelo puffed out a sigh of relief, returning his attention back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll answer my questions later, but for now I have to find a place to hide you.\u201d Meelo\u2019s voice was a hoarse whisper, meant to convey his anger. However, you couldn\u2019t really bring yourself to care. You were damned as it were, trapped at your current size with no way to contact the only person who could restore you. What did it matter what happened to you now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook around you, there\u2019s nowhere to hide me. You can drop back in your pants, but I\u2019ll just fall to my death or slip out of your pants legs. You can leave me somewhere here in the bathroom, but I\u2019ll either be discovered or escape. You\u2019re stuck, and thanks to you I\u2019m stuck this size forever.\u201d Your voice was raised in as loud a tone as possible, fury saturating your voice despite Meelo\u2019s hands clenching painfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your words, Meelo's face grew dark with anger. He was a young boy after all, and they were notoriously incapable of accepting blame when things went wrong. Meelo needed someone to blame because he couldn\u2019t face the fact that he had messed up, and the only other person at hand was you. It didn\u2019t matter to you at this point. Your radio, you life, and your dignity were lost. Why should you fear Meelo's anger when you had nothing left to lose.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo's eyes glimmered with an intensity you hadn't yet seen. Deliberately, he sank downwards to the floor, using his one free hand to steady his descent. As his bottom struck the cool wood floor, he spread his legs, his meat dangling down between his thighs as the cool air pricked at the foul orifice wedged in the cleft of his hams. His icy cold voice came alive, sending a chill down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still have one place I can hide you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Regret immediately filled you as Meelo\u2019s intended hiding place became apparent. You had been stupid and rash, devastated by losing your radio. Now, you realized you still had a few things to lose. You might be damned to a life looking up to others, but there were fates worse still. Tears began to run down your cheeks once more as you pleaded with the young giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t put me <i>there</i>. There\u2019s nothing I could have done to deserve <i>that</i>!\u201d However, Meelo merely glared at you. Any influence you might have had on the young boy had long since faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad guys deserve what they get.\u201d As Meelo spoke, his free hand slipped between his thighs. You could see the boy push his manhood aside so as to better access the foul opening which you knew him to be probing, though from where Meelo held his fist against his stomach you were unable to actually see his grisly exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the wrist began to move, a slow, circular motion which brought a disgusted look to Meelo\u2019s face. The small bathroom already had the foul hint of shit wafting through the air, and as Meelo\u2019s wrist continued to move, so too did the stench increase. You sat in a stunned silence, slowly going into shock within Meelo\u2019s clenched fist. What Meelo planned to do you was beyond comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo\u2019s wrist suddenly bent downwards, and a wet squelch filled the room as Meelo forced his finger into himself somewhere below the bend of his pelvis. A pained expression shot across the boy\u2019s face, though you didn\u2019t see it, so transfixed were you by the bobbing of the wrist before you. You imagined what hell the boy\u2019s fingers must be probing into as a wet fart trumpeted. The noise snapped you from your shock, and you cried even harder as Meelo\u2019s plans to hide you finally sank in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo was about to push you into his butt. This five year old bender\u2019s brat was about to shove you, a feeling, breathing human, into the very orifice from which he released his daily shit. You imagined the foul pucker, greedily suckling at Meelo\u2019s fingers, and shivered at the horror of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo had a disgusted expression upon his face as he tenderly probed his anus. He had never touched that part of himself before, not even out of curiosity. As the young boy continued to probe himself, he started to imagine the horror he was preparing to subject the spy to, and a pang of guilt shot through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrinkled skin encircling a rubbery mass, the many ridges tickling his finger as Meelo traced his finger around its rim. The surrounding skin of his ass cheeks had a gritty feeling to them from where Meelo hadn\u2019t thoroughly cleansed himself. Meelo felt dirty as he ventured up and down his cleft, exploring more of the dry landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom was starting to smell like crap, Meelo\u2019s exposed anus filling the air with its foul scent. Within his fist where it sat against his stomach, the tiny equalist continued to cry and struggle, only filling the boy with further regret. However, he had gone too far to turn back now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo knew that if he turned the spy over to his dad now, he would surely be punished. The spy had no reason to keep his deeds a secret, so he would surely tell on Meelo if he got the chance. Though he had chosen his current hiding space in the heat of his anger, he knew it was wrong of him to put another person up his butt, and fully expected to be grounded for a month were his parent to find out. Still, he had no other hiding place in which to hide his captive, and he couldn\u2019t risk the spy\u2019s escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth, the boy forced his middle finger into his butt, pushing it in all the way up to his first knuckle with a wet squelch. Meelo could feel the inside of his butt stretching painfully as trapped air was forced within himself. He quickly squeezed it back out, filling the room with a loud trumpeting noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of making his father proud for finding a spy didn\u2019t compare to the thought of his anger if he were to discover what Meelo had done to his captive. He had to keep the spy for now, if only to convince him not to tell his dad about everything that had happened. After he was sure the spy wouldn\u2019t tell on him, he would hand him over to his father. As another painful jolt shot through Meelo, he regretted not heeding the spy\u2019s suggestion to immediately take him to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet squelches were growing louder and more frequent as you watched Meelo work his finger further into himself. Every now and then the boy would grit his teeth, the discomfort of penetrating himself apparent. However, no matter how much pain the boy might have felt, you were sure you felt infinitely worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was obscured by the by the rise of Meelo\u2019s pelvis, you couldn\u2019t stop imagining the foul pucker which would soon devour you. In your mind, it was a grinning mouth with soiled, sharp teeth, hungry to devour you. It would belch and laugh, its putrid breath fouling the air. You knew your mind was playing tricks on you, it couldn\u2019t possibly be so, but as the wet slurps of Meelo\u2019s fingers continued, you could almost make out a low chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head and retched, but only bile came up. You hadn\u2019t eaten in hours, but right now food was the last thing on your mind. Amidst the stench and the sounds, you felt weak, you felt panicked, and most devastating of all, you felt helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00ac\u00ac~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Meelo continued to work his fingers deeper, he began to grow accustomed to the probing feeling working its way into his rectum. His middle finger was in up to his third knuckle by now, and his ass cheeks restrained him from pushing further. Curious, he flexed his butt, feeling the walls around his fingers clinch in response. An almost pleasant chill shot up Meelo\u2019s spine as he slowly pulled his finger free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorry and longing shot through Meelo as he recognized the feeling as something similar to when the spy had been on his penis. Though it somehow felt deeper and more powerful, a slow pressure was building within Meelo\u2019s belly. Meelo found himself secretly looking forward to putting the spy up his butt, which in turn filled the boy with fear. What was happening to him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spy within Meelo\u2019s fist jerked suddenly as he brought his finger into view, its length browned up to the third knuckle. A foul stink clung to his tarnished digit as he brought it closer for inspection, almost gagging himself in the process. He couldn\u2019t put someone in there! It was inhuman. However, a strange, newly awakened part of Meelo grew excited at the thought. Meelo realized that his manhood was sticking up, its length pulsing with blood.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tore your gaze free of the fleshy obelisk, instead looking at the boy's face where an expression of worry and confusion was plastered across his face. To your utter horror, a gleam of desire flared within his light blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo's fist lifted from his belly, slowly hoisting you skywards as the boy used his tainted hand to pull his knees towards his chest. His head fell down to rest upon the floor as his lower half curled over himself, his knees striking the floor just beneath his armpits. Meelo shifted his arms, planting his elbows past the crook of his knees so as to hold them in place. From your new vantage point hovering high in the air, the object of your horror came into full view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts brown exterior winked at you from between Meelo's spread cheeks. The skin around the dirty maw was stained a darker brown, reminding you of the foul things beyond its lips. Even as you watched, the grotesque mound pulsed rhythmically, an inward and outward motion that almost seemed like breathing. The sight was revolting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, Meelo's tainted finger returned, working its way inside once more in preparation for your meeting with the gritty orifice. It twisted and pushed, setting you to gag at the foul sounds produced. This time, it took a lot less time for the darkened length of the boy's middle finger to pass through the wrinkled portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced back at Meelo's face, seeing an odd mixture of pain and pleasure. Teeth gritted as the boy released a low groan, or perhaps it was a moan? Steely blue eyes strained to remain open as the tarnished finger worked at the opening, the rubbery ring slowly relaxing. When you turned back to check his progress, his finger was once more fully inserted. A fart pushed it way free, blowing past you and causing you to retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so overwhelmed by nausea, that it took a moment for you to realize his hand was carrying you closer. The wrinkled maw was growing closer, as was the tainted digit which penetrated it. This was the fate you had been fearing, of being driven deep into the boy's bowels, to disappear in filth and waste. A moment later, you were directly above the scene, you sight thankfully obscured by the fist around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo pulled his finger downward, stretching his anus and causing a small gap to form. With care, the boy lowered you towards the greasy maw, positioning your feet just above the putrid hole. Hysterical sobs wracked your body, robbing you of even the strength to struggle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meelo held you above the waiting maw for only a moment before beginning the foul deed, lowering your body downward towards your new, wretched prison. Your booted feet pressed against the wet flesh beneath you, setting you to kick and squirm. The attempt was laughable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fist around you held you tightly, holding your arms to your side. Though you wriggled and fought with all of your might, you barely budged an inch. Only your ankles and feet had free reign to move, thrashing wildly and tickling the anus beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Meelo opened his hand, dropping you onto the greasy opening. Your feet immediately slid in, the muscular embrace now clutching at your ankles. The heat of the boy\u2019s bowels penetrated your clothing, seeping into your leg as his hand once more closed around you. However, this time it wasn\u2019t just you which Meelo clutched within his grip, for he had also ensnared his own finger. The soiled digit pressed against your face, its slimy surface grinding against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the boy began to shift his hand, lessening his grip as he raised his hand slightly, only to tighten it once more and push you downwards. To your horror, you sank in a little deeper, the telltale heat of Meelo\u2019s rectum now seeping into your calves. He was milking his own finger, pushing you down with every pull. Encircled and overcome by the smell as you were, you could offer no resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed you eyes, overcome by the circumstances around you. You tried to deny reality, insisting that this was merely a horrible nightmare, but as Meelo\u2019s hand continued to force you downward, that hope too was shattered. You couldn\u2019t possibly imagine something so horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way up your thigh, you began to feel a dampness penetrating your clothing. Rectal mucus was beginning to soak through your pants, and as you wriggled your feet you realized that it had also penetrated you boots. Muscle tugged at your pants, lifting them out of your boots and exposing your bare calf to the sensations of the slimy muscles around you. Something squished against the naked flesh, and you tried to scream. A sickened retch came out instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith agonizing slowness, your descent continued. The rancid taste of feces had penetrated your mouth, forced there by the tainted finger which still protruded from the young bender\u2019s ass. Your eyes yet remained closed, trying to block out some small portion of the horror around you, but instead it only forced you to focus on your other senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark despair filled you, devouring all hope. You couldn't scream, for opening your mouth would drive you to gag. You couldn't struggle, for the flesh around you was unyielding and your nausea had robbed you of strength. You couldn't even pray, for you doubted there were spirits where you were going. Meelo had taken everything from you, even your will to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once Meelo managed to take you in up to your waist, you felt a sudden pressure against your feet. The tunnel into which you sank grew tighter the deeper you slid, and with Meelo\u2019s middle finger inserted inside himself he was unable to force you deeper. For a moment, progress was block. All Meelo\u2019s continued efforts to force you further in came to naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden writhing started to ripple across your body, pushing between your legs and moving the flesh around you. Meelo was wriggling his fingers, trying to loosen your passage and force you deeper still. The sensation was rough, a violent pressing against your knees and groin. Your pants were worked up further, exposing your knees to the cloistering flesh and increasing your distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a gap where the finger had been, and its tarnished length pressed passed your face. It shot out above you, leaving a gap into which your body could sink as Meelo once more slackened his grip. The sudden empty space swallowed you, engulfing you up to your chest and trapping your arms above the elbow before finally clenching down. The rubbery edge of the vile pit now pressed just at the base of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized with dread that Meelo\u2019s heartbeat was thumping all around you, the encompassing flesh seeming a twisted parody of a womb. Under other circumstances, the rhythmic thumping might have soothed you. In this case, it only served to remind you that you were being forced within the hot bowels of a small boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden pressure against the top of your head, and you finally opened your eyes to take in your surroundings. Above, Meelo\u2019s fouled fingers rested against your scalp, preparing to push you still deeper into his rectum. A brown stain coated most of the finger, the slimy residue rubbing off to stain your hair. Below you, Meelo\u2019s eyes were closed, and on his face was an expression of pure bliss. His free hand idly toyed at his throbbing manhood. You realized the pulsing around your body matched the pulsing of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger upon your scalp suddenly pressed downward, filling you with terror. Did he intend to push you all the way inside? Didn\u2019t he know there was no air inside his ass? Despite having lost the will to live, instinct drove you to struggle. Gradually, your body continued to slide deeper, the slimy ring of muscle making its way across your neck and slowly starting to eat at the base of your chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with your nose so close to the hated source of source of stench, you found yourself unable to retch. Your stomach muscles were too tired, too strained by all the previous attempts. You were actually too tired to puke; you almost laughed at the absurdity.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt the muscles around your body loosen. Something pushed its way past your legs, past your groin, passed your stomach, and through the ring of muscle sealing it within. A burst of gas forced its way outward, expanding the sphincter around your throat and allowing it to surge up, over your head. Darkness devoured your vision as you were fully sealed within Meelo\u2019s rectum with what little available air having just escaped.</span></div></div>",

The muscled walls pushed against you from all sides, squeezing and caressing every inch of your body. A sickening heat penetrated your flesh, causing you to break out in a sweat. Mucus clung to your body, as well as a few other things you didn\u2019t want to think too much about, as the gurgles and groans of Meelo\u2019s body sang a duet with the sound of his heart beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the pressure upon your rib cage, you held your breath. The soiled flesh around you was pressed tightly against your mouth, and you knew that if you were to relinquish your breath you weren\u2019t likely to get it back. You could see dots dance across your vision despite the absolute darkness. You had to force your head free, or else you would suffocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked your legs, spreading them wide in an attempt to gain footing. Your hands gripped at the ribbed surface around you, seeking purchase in order to propel you forward. You wriggled and strained, seeking to overcome the tight grip Meelo\u2019s rectum had on you. You face pressed against the sealed anus before you, but it refused to budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperation was starting to claw at your lungs as you remained trapped within your humid prison. The walls were throbbing now, your stimulation having brought them to life. A wet squishing could be felt with every pulse, the slimy walls slapping against one another. To you it seemed almost like a twisted applause, celebrating your humiliating demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lungs burned and your head ached. Your oxygen was running low, but there was no way to replace it. If you released your breath now, you were done, but your lungs cried out for relief. In a rush of air, you forced the breath out of your lungs, attempting to drawn in another to replace it. Only a bit of rectal mucus filled your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choked on the foul taste which invaded your mouth as a panic overwhelmed you, driving you to struggle. You thrashed out with abandon, beating the sides of the walls and fighting to break free of your fleshy tomb, but to no avail. However, it wasn\u2019t your fate to die just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the walls around you heaved, pressing you painfully forward towards the ring of muscle ahead. Your thrashes weakened, the air having long abandoned you along with the ability to move. Your neck strained and pain lanced through your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment more, your head broke through the prison. You tilted your head upward, the ring of muscle ringing the side of your face and covering your ears. You inhaled deeply, the tainted air tasting sweat after having been deprived breath for so long. You took a moment to marvel at the sight of light, something you had feared you would never see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Meelo\u2019s voice rumbled not just through the air, but also through the flesh around you. It was a strange sensation, his voice seeming to come from all around you. However, as the world around you shifted, you had other things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky above fell away as Meelo straightened his legs once more, the cheeks closing in to obscure most of your light. A great pressure pushed in on you as the sphincter around your head tightened, threatening to force you inside once more. Through a narrow crack, you could see the floor below, and could feel the blood starting to rush to your head. Meelo\u2019s pants filled your view where they lay on the floor before you were treated to the view of the back wall as Meelo bent down to retrieve them. Gingerly, he stepped into the legs, hoisting them upward and sealing you in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes were a blur to you as you listened from the darkness. You heard Meelo struggle for a few minutes, presumably tying his pants, before letting out a cry of triumph. That was soon followed by the sound of running water as Meelo presumably cleaned up. Minutes later, the sound of a lock sliding free rang through the tiny bathroom, and Meelo was walking off to face the wrath of his mother. Your pack remained where it had been dropped, the only evidence of what had transpired within that cursed room.</span></div></div>",

The effect left you light headed. Had you really been that tense this whole time? Regaining some composure, you pressed your ear against the door, listening for an occupant. When silence answered you, composure fled you once more and excitement took its place. Giddy, you checked the door to see if you could squeeze past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in luck. Someone had forgotten to close the door completely, leaving a small crack which you were able to squeeze through. The pack had some trouble though, leaving you fearful, but after a bit of jostling you were able to squeeze it through. Having fit through the door, you took your time to investigate your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been expecting a storeroom or perhaps a closet, but what you found instead was a bathroom. A high window adorned the wall across from you, too high to be seen through yet offering ample light. Beneath it rested a ceramic toilet, a plain thing with a sheer wall from floor to seat. The piping was hidden within its cold exterior. Toilet tissue rested upon its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side was a sink. It sat upon a pedestal, its shadowed lip obscuring from sight whatever might lie upon it. Opposite the sink, a large tub rested. It pressed flat against the floor; not one of those fancy legged tubs. Its black, cast iron shone in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one thing you had to admire about the inhabitants of Air Temple Island, it was their cleanliness. This bathroom, as well as any store room, might go years without use yet still would be maintained. The floor was spotless and the tub was free of rust. All in all, it wasn\u2019t a bad place to have lunch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt good to be full after walking so long, and a thick lethargy had begun to settle upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 a nap might be nice. I could wait until it become dark and continue my journey with less risk of being stumbled upon,\u201d you surmised sleepily. You doubted that any vital information would be missed for being a few hours behind schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you thought about it, the more you liked the idea. Your trek had been far more tiring than you had anticipated and a few hours to recuperate wouldn\u2019t be amiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou packed your equipment back into our pack and made your way towards the toilet. Following its edge, you made your way around its curve in order to better hide yourself from view just in case. It was pleasantly shaded and cool behind the ceramic throne. You laid out your sleeping bag and set aside the remainder of your gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpying isn\u2019t so tough,\u201d you said to yourself as you shuffled into your bed to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally woke up, you felt as fresh as spring. The weariness that had plagued your body had vanished, leaving only small bruises on your shoulders from the pack. You crawled your way out of your sleeping bag, stretching lazily and rubbing the sleep out of your eyes. It was then that you started to wonder why it was so dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly very much awake, you darted out from behind your ceramic shelter. You cast your head upward and stared at the window in dismay. The light which trickled through the window was a deep reddish gold. Dusk was settling in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have been asleep for that long!\u201d your tiny voice peeped. But you knew deep down that you had. You felt far too rested to have only been asleep for the few hours you had originally had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChagrined at having lost so much time due to your own laziness, you went back behind the toilet. You still had a job to do, and you intended to do it even in the dark. You had a flashlight in your pack should the need arise, and the need had certainly arisen. You were just finishing packing when the sound of footsteps drifted into your field of hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, to say you heard them is a bit of an over exaggeration. Truth be told, you felt them through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe last thing I need is another delay,\u201d your thoughts cried out, frustration mounting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you had no choice. There was only one path out, and risking everything to gain 5 minutes was just plain insane. Reluctantly, you went back behind the toilet to wait for the footsteps to fade away once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps grew louder. This part of the temple wasn\u2019t commonly used; you had chosen this path for exactly that reason. What would someone be doing in these remote halls? Your curiosity was roused; this could be an important piece of information. Unfortunately, it was much more likely to be some monk on some inane errand. You remained hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps were audible through the air now. A small jolt could be felt through your feet with every step. You guessed that the source of those footsteps must be passing your hiding spot when to your horror, you heard the doors open. Soft candle light flooded the bathroom, but your place behind the toilet remained cast in shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity overtook judgment and you decided to take a look at the interloper. Keeping your small form pressed against the ceramic wall beside you, you slowly edged around into the light. The bronze candle base made a light noise as it was sat down on the edge of the sink just as your target came into view.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When your eyes adjusted, you were shocked to see it was the avatar who towered before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was bent over the sink, placing the candle with care when you first saw her. Olive skin looked golden in the twilight glare of the sun and a delicate nose obscured half of her face. The flare of a high, brunette pony tail caught your attention, swaying with the movement of her head and reflecting sunlight. Her bangs were pulled aside into another ponytail which drooped down to rest upon her shoulder. The blue ties reminiscent of the water tribesmen of the south bound her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light, sleeveless shirt clung tightly against her ample bosom. Her perky mounds swayed as she bent down to pick up a basket of what you guessed were scented soaps. A well developed shoulder muscle flashed as she lifted the basket, as tone bicep strained against a light blue water tribe band. As she curled her wrist to bring the basket closer to her face, the dark blue band around her forearm groaned. This woman was no stranger to hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small cloak of fur hung about her waist, just long enough to allow her to sit upon. Another blue cloth draped across the front of her waist, affording her some modesty. Baggy, blue leather pants were tucked into furred leather boots. You wondered how she wasn\u2019t overheating in those heavy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched, the avatar carried the basket towards the bath tub. She sat it upon the floor beside the cast iron tub and leaned down towards the spout, turning the faucet and readying a bath. You watched Korra, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As an equalist, you felt obligated to do the moral thing and give the girl some privacy. As a spy, you felt the need to try to gather information on the information. Although you felt it unlikely that something important would be revealed by watching the avatar bathe, you watched anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light coming through the window had finally faded, leaving the avatar lit solely by candlelight when she finally decided to undress. She slid the bands around her forearms off one at a time, followed shortly by the ones around her biceps. Her olive skin was cast in shadow where the rise of her muscles obscured the candlelight. She set the pieces of cloth on top of the toilet seat and began to worry at her leather shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoes were worn things, dirty with use. The gnarled leather strings which held it together took some work in order for her to work them loose, but once undone they were sat at the base of the toilet. The very tops of her boots barely reached the toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avatar stood up to disrobe further. She untied the light blue cloth which hung around her waist, loosening the furred leather which draped across her buttocks. The blue cloth which shielded her groin soon joined it, leaving her down to a shirt, pants, and whatever may lie beneath. Those soon joined the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrong, calloused hands reached downwards, tugging at the edge of her sleeveless shirt. It stripped away with difficulty, its tightness slowing its progress. Slowly, olive colored abs were revealed, their contours highlighted by the shadows. Two, four, and then six abs were shown; they\u2019re tightened mass undoubtedly hard as stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt paused at the water tribesmen\u2019s ample chest, upon which the tight cloth appeared to become caught. She tugged at it roughly, apparently used to it. Her face flashed an expression of pain and a small grunt of discomfort slipped from between her lips. Olive arms jerked upwards as the obstacles were overcome, and the blue shirt shot upwards. Tender breasts wrapped loosely in cloth bindings bounced free, the supple flesh spilling from the very top. Bare armpits flashed in the candlelight, smooth and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment she just stood there, her shirt clutched in one hand as she massaged her breasts with the other. Delicately, she loosened the wraps which bound her chest. They slid free, falling to her feat as a moan of pleasure escaped her brown lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing feels better than this.\u201d Her eyes were glazed over as she reveled in her freedom from her stifling clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to ask Pema to let my shirt out. It\u2019s growing a bit too tight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avatar reached down to retrieve the fallen clothes and place them upon the toilet seat. She then turned her attention upon her pants. They proved far simpler to remove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra grabbed her hips, sliding her thumbs into the band of her pants and slipping her hands downward.. As her hands descended, so too did the pants. Calloused palms caressed ripped thighs in their passage, soon followed by tight, rounded calves. Once more, wraps afforded Korra modesty, tied around an between the avatar\u2019s thighs. As the pants touched the ground, the girl stepped out of them; kicking them up onto the toilet with her foot. She slid a finger into the back of her wraps and pulled them loose, exposing her womanhood to the cooling night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed shy in the way that it sought to hide in the shadows between her thighs. A thin matting of curly black hair worked to obscure what little you could see. However, as the avatar turned to climb into the tub you got a clear view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown skin between her legs parted, two thick lips splitting in a gentle smile. A small lump of flesh clung to the front most corner. The lips were parted lower down, offering a glimpse into the pink gullet; its depths shrouded in shadow. It gave the impression of endlessness. A rearward neighbor shone in the light, a brown ring of muscle between two hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sloshing of water accompanied Korra as she settled into the cast-iron tub. Steam rose in waves as she settled against the side. Her hear lulled back against the edge and her eyes flickered shut. A smile played across her lips as she allowed the warm water to wash away her aches and pains.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From your vantage point near the base of the toilet, you had an easy view of the avatar in all of her glory. However, it wasn\u2019t her bare form which attracted you attention, but her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots were unremarkable except for the bit of fur at their tops, folding over the edge where they were sewn into the side. Most likely, they were merely sew along the edge so as they would stay in place, creating a small tube on the inside. Such insignificant details would have been meaningless to anyone else, but at your size it was a golden opportunity. Chances were good that you could fit, allowing you to hitch a ride with the avatar and potentially glean important information. It wouldn\u2019t even be that difficult, as the farthest boot obscured the nearest one from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, you had no doubt that this would be a temporary feat, if you were to attempt it at all. The normal stride of the young water tribesmen was sure to shake you relentlessly, posing a serious danger if you happened to get stuck. However, no reward had ever seemed so worth the risk. It was with these thoughts in mind that you snuck from your hiding place and crept up to the side of the nearest boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boot proved a little challenging to climb upon, its surface coming up to your shoulders, but the leather strap around its girth offered purchase. The surface reminded of you of felt, and tickled you as you climbed. Once upon the flatter surface of the top, you stood upright, feeling give beneath your feet. The climb up the leg would prove much more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of some quirk of the positioning of the boots, you were able to use the other boot to climb upward. You swung your body around the edge and, lifting your feet, wedged yourself between the two. Pushing hard and trying not to slip, you began to crab walk upward. It was slow going, and tiring, but shortly after starting you realized that you were committed. You wouldn\u2019t be able to go back downward without either first going back to the top and dropping back down on the softer body of the shoe, or dropping downward onto wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of your pack was like a boulder pulling you to your doom by the time you reached the fur, but by some miracle you made it. Your exhaustion was far greater than you had expected, and you had feared that you would suddenly lose your grip and tumble downward to the cold wood floor. Gripping the fur tightly, you allowed your legs to drop, smashing into the side of the boot. The grip afforded to you by the fur made it far easier to climb, but you were already weary. The rest of the climb ate at what little strength remained to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally crawled upon the rim of the boot, you collapsed upon its soft, narrow surface. The extra layer of fur had made it just thick enough to lay on without dangling over the edge. You didn\u2019t know what you would have done had it been otherwise. Wearily, you decided that a short, five minute break was necessary before you began to cut a hole in the lining. At least, those were your thought as you laid down your head and promptly fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How long had you been out for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKorra, make sure you don\u2019t fall asleep again like last time,\u201d a high feminine voice called from the other side of the door. You were wondering whether it was Jinora or Ikki when the much deeper voice of the avatar echoed through the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d The avatar\u2019s voice reverberated against the walls, making her voice sound far louder than otherwise. A touch of embarrassment touched her voice. Truth be told, she had been snoring not too long ago, the heat having lulled her to sleep. The sound of sloshing water brought your gaze towards the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned your gaze towards the avatar, you were once more treated to the sight of her naked form. It was completely dark outside and the only source of light in the room was a half spent candle. In the half light, each water droplet shone with a golden radiance as it clung to her bronze skin. Her hair hung wetly about her shoulders and tiny streams of water flowed freely from her locks, wrapping her breasts in a watery embrace. Though her face was mostly cast in shadow, the angle of the candle fully illuminated her womanhood, its cream toned lips failing to hide the pink within. A thicket of black curls flanked the dripping crease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, genitals of either gender weren\u2019t that interesting to you. You had been training for years to be a servant of the equalist movement, and any sort carnal pleasure had always paled in the face of duty. However, at your size and illuminated by the dull glow of candle light, the folds above you were impossible to avert your gaze from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like watching a lion gallop past, both awesome and terrifying to behold. The water droplets in its mane shone with the golden brilliance of the fire beneath. It seemed to peek from between cover, watching you from above and waiting for the opportunity to pounce. You had little doubt that you would be engulfed, swallowed whole to waste away deep within its gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra bent down to retrieve her wraps, obscuring your view and snapping you from your entrancement. You didn\u2019t even remember seeing her step out of the tub. As she leaned down, her body obscured the candle, casting you in shadow and reminding you of where you were. Silently, you prayed as she reached her hand rushed past you in its quest for the strips of cloth she would wrap her pelvis in. Her wrist actually bumped the boot you were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou risked a glance upwards and were horrified; the avatar\u2019s face filled your entire view. Dark as it was, you couldn\u2019t make out details of her face. Only her eyes shone from that mask of shadows. You could feel her breath blow upon your body, moist and warm against your body. Silently, you prayed she would overlook you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You hadn\u2019t had time to cut your way into the boot\u2019s lining, so you had no way to stowaway safely. You could jump and try to scurry your way back to cover, but the fall was very likely to injure you. The vast maw of the boot loomed beside you, offering a second option. It was possible that you could stowaway within the shoe. The drop wasn\u2019t nearly as hard, especially if you were to cling to the sides as you fell. Suddenly, the image of Korra\u2019s foot sliding into the boot and crushing you surged to the forefront of your mind, causing you to dismiss the idea entirely. You couldn\u2019t\u2019 spy on Tenzin or the avatar if you were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the avatar, you realized that she had already put on her pants and was working to bind her breasts. You didn\u2019t have much time. Quickly, you reached for your pack and started to crawl towards the edge. You only had one option, you had to jump and hope that the top of the boot was springy enough to cushion your fall. You had risen to a crouch and were posed to make your leap of faith when tragedy struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the avatar reached towards the toilet to recover her shirt, it slid downward onto the boot. The woolen fabric crashed into you, once more plunging your world into darkness.

Soft worked leather, worn with long use, caught you as you smashed against the ground; all of the air rushing from your lungs. Black spots filled your vision as you struggled to regain your breath. Was anything broken?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you realized that you didn\u2019t have any time to check for injuries. Around you, near pitch darkness swallowed your gaze. The only source of light came from above, a circle of indirect candle light mostly blocked by the shadowy outline of the avatar fitting her shirt on. The reek of sweat and feet emanated from the soft, worn leather which surrounded you, having been absorbed by the boot after long and frequent use. You were currently resting within the heel of Korra\u2019s boot, and any second a calloused foot would come smashing downward to quench your existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou searched around for a moment in search of your bag. Without your bag you were as doomed, as you would have no consistence source of food once within the avatar\u2019s room save the meager rations contained within your bag\u2019s burlap depths. With a quick sigh of relief your hand clasped around the handle of the bag just as your leather prison began to tilt, rising into the air at an alarming speed.

Panic filled you as your hands clawed at the packed leather sole, struggling to rise. Fate had dealt you a bad hand, but you weren\u2019t going to give up anytime soon. You could still hide and hope that your ride was a short one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlindly, you fled deeper within the shoe. You pushed your way beneath the low overhand, at first coming up to your forehead, but quickly dropping until you were forced to crawl. Once you reached the very front of the boot, you wedged your back against the toe as firmly as possible; your pack held firmly behind your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it just in time too. As you barely managed to secure yourself within the toe your entire world tilted. Where before you had been crammed into a small nook, you now found yourself at the top of a long drop. The small trickle of light which had filtered into the boot before was snuffed in accompaniment to the sound of rasping leather. Your world once more tilted, returning to its previous position as blunt protrusions bumped into you in the darkness. A sharp toenail gouged at you, smashing into your side and soliciting a yelp of pain. You\u2019d feel that tomorrow, if you lived to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Korra sat, pulling on her remaining shoe, you were given a moment to take in your situation. In your current location, Korra\u2019s toes weren\u2019t pressed against you. This was good, as the less of an intrusion you posed the less likely she was to notice you. However, this posed a bit of a problem. Whereas you might have been able to anticipate any impacts if you were pressed against the young woman\u2019s feet, in the dark and out of contact you would be pummeled unexpectedly. If struck at the wrong moment it might dislodge you, sending you onto or beneath the water tribeswoman\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing you noticed was the smell. You hadn\u2019t been given much time to take it in before, what with being afraid of being crushed to death and all, but now that you had a moment, you realized that the avatar\u2019s boots really stunk. You had known she was a both a tomboy and very athletic, but by the way the stench clung to the boot you wouldn\u2019t have doubted that she worked out in these things every day. It was enough to make you gag. The feet themselves weren\u2019t so bad considering she had just spent a while soaking in the tub, but that didn\u2019t mean they would stay that way. All you could do was pray that your journey was a short one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly lost your grip as the avatar started walking, your leather prison unexpectedly surging forward. The pit of your stomach roiled as you quickly rose and tilted, the calloused toes rising to smash you lightly against the boot, only to be smashed to the floor once more. You were given a moment\u2019s pause to steady yourself as Korra stepped with her other foot before the whole cycle repeated itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra walked on for a while, every other step trying your strength as she padded through the abandoned hallways. Where was she heading? How far was her final destination? You would have loved nothing better than to know these answers, but only the dull thudding of toes against ribs answered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avatar walked on, oblivious to fact that the fate of a person she had never knew existed literally lay at her feet. Every step brought you closer to losing your grip.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Up and down the boot flung your miniscule form. Dizziness and nausea plagued you mind. You had only been riding for a few minutes, yet you knew the temple to take several minutes to traverse on most trips. Fear embedded itself as you realized that you weren\u2019t going to hold. What was going to happen to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thoughts scattered as Korra\u2019s big toe scored a direct blow upon your abdomen. All of the air rushed from your lungs, robbing you of strength. Your already weakened grip slipped, and one of your hands tore free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror flooded you as you hurriedly clawed at the side, seeking purchase once more. What would happen if you fell free? Would you get luck and slide on top of her foot, only to be felt and discovered? Would you be shaken to death and battered against her blunt toes, your broken unrecognizable once she finally discovered you? Or, would you be granted a mercifully quick death beneath the pounding flesh of her foot, reduced to nothing more than a stain beneath her calloused sole?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra\u2019s foot slammed against the ground once more, whipping you hard into the toe. You quickly took advantage, resetting your body so as to maintain your grip. Korra\u2019s foot lifted once more and her toes thankfully missed you this time. You couldn\u2019t have taken two blows in a row. The pit of your stomach dropped as you were once more lifted into the air, silently praying for a short reprieve. You would get your wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft murmur of someone\u2019s voice reached you within the stinking leather prison, far too muffled to be distinguishable. It sounded familiar, but they must have been too far away. However, Korra wasn\u2019t too far away. Her voice reached you relatively un-muffled as she boomed her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I was just heading back from a bath,\u201d Korra\u2019s reply was friendly. She knew this person. Footsteps could be felt through the leather around you as whoever it was approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t fall asleep again did you?\u201d Your savior\u2019s voice was audible this time, although still garbled. Silently, you thanked them for the short reprieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, that\u2019s just Ikki making up stories. You know better than to listen to her.\u201d Even from the boot, Korra\u2019s lie was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued and you listened attentively, tending to your duties of a spy even in this situation. You managed to identify the other speaker as Asami Sato after a while, and gathered that she was on her way to the bathroom to take her own turn in the bath. Other little tidbits trickled into your ears as you law upon hardened leather, but most of it was useless. However, information wasn\u2019t the most important thing at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally had a chance to rest. Even as you lay there, you could feel yourself start to slowly recover. Your strained arms were lax, and the painful burn which had been gradually building up began to recede. Hope began to return as your chances of surviving the trip increased with every restful second.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, having spent the last few minutes trapped in a moving shoe, being stabbed repeatedly by a sharp toe, sitting still for a change seemed like heaven. The smell wasn\u2019t exactly pleasant, but you were grateful for what you did have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour leather prison reeked with the smell of sweat and cheese. You had noticed earlier that the sides of the leather were slick with oil, as it had greatly weakened your grip, but as you rested it dawned upon you that the oily substance beneath your fingers was most likely body soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought did nothing to comfort you. You had been through a lot, but this boot had obviously been through worse. What would happen if you were unable to find a way to escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted as a rough surface brushed against your body. In the darkness, you couldn\u2019t see what the offending object could be, but considering your location it had to be Korra\u2019s toes. Their calloused tips had absentmindedly stroked your hidden form, now slack and resting upon the bottom in the furthest tip of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror gripped your heart as you realized that you no longer fit in with the rest of the surrounding boot. The slight brush against your prone form might have been all Korra had needed to realize that something was in her boot.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were struggling to push your bag back into the tip of the boot in order to press yourself against it once more when tragedy struck. Groping, calloused digits forced their way over your body, curving their way over your body and pushing down on the leather bottom beyond. Terror and a waxy layer of foot slime choked your senses, calling out for you to thrash, to scream, to panic. However, something inside of you stopped you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would Korra react to something in her shoe suddenly starting to wriggle? The answer flashed through your mind. She would be unnerved by the unexpected struggles, immediately thinking of a spider or some other creepy-crawly before she thrashed her foot around, crushing you in the process. No! You had to stay still. It was the only path remaining to you that had any chance of survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra and Asami\u2019s conversation continued above, however you paid it little heed. The clammy appendages cupping your body held your full attention; they\u2019re curved length pressing down upon you. It would take a mere thought for the avatar to crush you, contracting her toes and squeezing you painfully. You doubt such an act would kill you outright, but it was not unlikely that a few bone may be broken were she so inclined. She wouldn\u2019t even know that the object trapped beneath her toes was fragile enough to damage with such a seemingly light gesture. A feeling of helplessness settled in as you realized that you were powerless to do anything save pray that she treated you gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surge of dread filled you as the muscle coiled around you contracted. However, instead of crushing your puny form they instead lifted, the tips of the toes withdrawing to once more probe at your intruding mass. The calloused pads pushed down, applying a bit of pressure before shifting back and forth, questing clumsily in order to identify your nature. You held still, giving away nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation above continued unabated as Korra shifted from light prodding to pushing, rolling you back and forth within the tip of her boot. In your movement, you noticed that the backpack wasn\u2019t with you. Perhaps it was still lodged deeply within the tip of the boot, safely out of reach of harm. You released a sigh of relief that the fragile equipment would not be damaged before stifling a giggle at the absurdity of the thought. You might not survive the next ten seconds, what did a backpack matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra might have sensed the slight movement stifling a giggle had caused, because at that moment her toes paused. They\u2019re weight rested upon you, pressing into your chest, abdomen, groin, and legs with a pressure which wasn\u2019t quite painful. However, there was no guarantee that such gentle treatment might continue. Should the avatar suddenly turn violent, there was little you could do to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you do if her gentle probing became something much more dangerous? Under such circumstances, would you have a choice in the matter? The only thing you might do to stop her was wriggle, informing her that it was no mere pebble which she crushed but a living, breathing creature. Under such circumstances, she might take the time to free you from the leather which had come to encompass so much of your life, but then again she might just panic and crush you as you had feared before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt the ball of her foot lift to your side, and with a surge of terror the toes shuffled you beneath the calloused surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surprised shriek was torn from your mouth as you body was pushed roughly beneath the ball of Korra\u2019s foot. The flesh here was still slightly damp from her earlier shower, and the clammy surface was that much more chilled. Your body was tensed as you waited for the impending crunch as you were crushed into the leather beneath. You waited and waited, sweating profusely despite the damp chill. One last, insane thought rushed through your head, wondering if the dampness from the bath had spared you from overheating. You laid there, awaiting for the impending death which hovered above you for what seemed like an eternity before your killer descended once more to claim your life, however it wasn\u2019t your fate to die yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the crushing force you had imagined, the ball of Korra\u2019s foot came down almost gently. The calloused, damp surface coming to rest gently against you abdomen. Slowly, so terribly slowly, the flesh above you started to move, further mapping out your dimensions. Laughter sounded from the outside world, reminding you that Korra neither knew what you were nor cared enough to let you presence interrupt her conversation. It was a bitter reminder of exactly how insignificant you were at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tore your attention away from your thoughts; away from the foot above and your own predicament. It wasn\u2019t immediately obvious, even you weren\u2019t aware of what had grasped your attention so strongly with such pressing matters to worry about, but with a growing realization you began to realize something. The boot was starting to tilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden tilt, as you might have expected while Korra was walking. It was a gradual tilt, a gentler tilt. Korra didn\u2019t know what she had in her shoe, but it was strange enough that she didn\u2019t want to smash it before taking a look. Perhaps she thought you a lost bathroom implement. Regardless, the pressure above you disappeared completely, allowing you to fall bonelessly towards the safety of the arch below. You hit Korra\u2019s heel, releasing a sigh of relief at the newfound space above. The clatter of loose supplies was the only warning you had before your pack struck you full on in the face. The already pitch black confines of the boot seemed to grow darker still as consciousness left you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was something urgent you needed to address, some niggling itch in the deeper recesses of your mind, but the cloudy haze which hung upon your thoughts obscured such memories, leaving only a dull ache behind your eyes. Where were you? You longed to answer such a question, but opening your eyes seemed an impossible task at the moment. Perhaps it would be best to simply lay for a while and regain your strength?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And if we bring him to Tenzen, what? They'll ask a few question, lock him up, and we'll be no closer to finding my father.\" A feminine voice reached you in your stupor, thick with bitterness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And you think we can do any better?\" A deeper voice answered the first, feminine and challenging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It wouldn't hurt to try.\" The first voice retorted back with an accusatory tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What do you plan to do, flick him until he talks? I nearly killed him by accident. What if you hurt him, huh? He's too small!\" The deeper voice sounded exasperated. The voices were starting to seem familiar somehow, but you weren't exactly in the right state of mind to be remembering much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You can heal him with your water bending.\" Water bending. For some reason it filled you with revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Not if you accidentally kill him.\" Somehow, you realized they were talking about you. Mention of injury and death sent a chill through your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There are other ways to get answers besides pain.\" The lighter voice grew quiet as it spoke, as if thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm still thinking about that. However, I know for a fact if we turn him over to Tenzen, we'll never get any answers.\" There was a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs if a doorway had opened, your memory began to return. You'd been caught! Those voices, you knew who they belonged to. The Avatar and Mr. Sato's daughter. They'd both been there when the avatar pulled you from her boot. Ignoring the stinging brightness, you opened your eyes, forcing them to adjust to the bright daylight that filtered in through a nearby window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe room around you was open and spacious, ornately ornately in the style of the airbenders. Wooden beams were exposed in the tan mortar walls, making it seem as if they had been embedded into the structure. A few pieces of wooden furniture was easily recognizable, but on the whole the room seemed sparse. It took only a moment for you to recognize where you were, the end table next to the bed. Luckily for you, the Avatar and the Asami were both preoccupied with their argument, allowing you the chance to make your escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're right.\" The avatar deflated as resignation colored her voice. You quickly pulled yourself into a crawl, your limbs screaming n agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know.\" Asami's voice took on a soothing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"How are we going to do this?\" Korra's usual spunk was back in a flash now that she had a clear goal. By now you had managed to reach the end of the table near the bed. It was a long way own and a long way across, and you doubted you would make it either way. It was then that you remembered that you were missing your pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"First, we need to find a proper cell. Else, he may escape.\" At Asami's words, a sudden realization hit you and without looking you dropped to the ground. Usually eyes tended to be drawn towards the subject of a conversation. Hopefully you had gotten down in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We could always stick him back in my boot.\" There was a hint of humor in Korra's voice. Though you didn't turn your head to look, the avatar's voice definitely seemed clearer, as if she were facing you. Thankfully she didn't notice your change in position, else they would have already caught you. Frantically, you looked around without moving, seeking some way off of this end table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Maybe, though I'd rather have him somewhere more secure. Do you have any boxes?\" With a jolt of excitement, you realized an escape route. Though you couldn't jump across to the bed and you couldn't survive a fall without injury, you could certainly grab the bedding on the fall down and slow your descent. It would be risky, but at your smaller size your body seemed stronger, relatively speaking. Though you weren't sure you could make it, you were sure you didn't have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Probably.\" In a sudden burst, you got up, ignoring your body's screams of protest. Without allowing yourself the time to hesitate, you rushed off of the edge, reaching out to grasp the dangling blanket before you. The pit of your stomach jolted as you managed to latch on, but were unable to fully halt your descent. Still, you managed to slow yourself enough that by the time you reached the floor, you were able to catch yourself on all fours with minimal injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then let's... He's gone!\" Asami's voice rose in surprise and you realized your time was short. You needed to find someplace to hide, and quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's impossible. He was there just a second ago.\" You didn't even pay attention to Korra's words as you rushed forward beneath the bed, heading for the other side. You hoped against hope that something would show up, some miraculous means by which to escape. The ground beneath you shook as a rapid series of footsteps hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I've got the door blocked. Check the floor.\" The avatar's determined voice rang out from the direction of the door, marking that direction as a dead end. If only you had had another minute before they had realized you were gone. A series of soft impact marked Asami's steps as she hurriedly moved towards the bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides a wardrobe, the bed, and the end table, there was no furniture to speak of. It was the airbender's way to live modesty, and as a result, there was little in the way of cover. Still, the bed had legs, which would offer some form of cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPanic fuelled you as you rushed towards the nearest leg, a large wooden pillar. It was more than large enough to conceal you at your current size, though you doubted it would serve for long. In a rush, you dove behind it, pressing your back against its solid frame. The rustle of cloth greeted your ears as Asami lifted the bedding, checking beneath the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't see him.\" After a moment's pause, the young woman's voice reverberated loudly within the enclosed space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Search the legs. He may be hiding behind one of them.\" You cursed at the avatar's remark. You realized your capture was inevitable, but Korra's added advice wasn't appreciated. The sound of hands on wood could be heard as Asami crawled around, presumably checking around the end table's legs. It wouldn't be long until she moved on to your spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"See anything?\" A note of anticipation hung in Korra's voice as she questioned her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nothing. I'm heading to the other side. Keep your eyes peeled.\" There was a tremor of frustration in Asami's voice as she rose to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a flash of inspiration, you realized this was your chance. With the bed shielding you from the avatar's eyes and Asami walking around, you had a chance to retreat to the other side of the bed, the side that had just been searched. You doubted it would save you from discovery, but it might buy you a minute or two. Once more, you charged beneath the bed, reaching the other side and taking cover. Again, the rustle of cloth met your ears as Asami got down on all fours in search of her missing captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm not seeing him!\" Exacerbation colored Asami's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"He has to be here somewhere. Check the pillows in case he managed to get on the bed.\" At Korra's suggestion, Asami withdrew, granting you a few minute's reprieve. You couldn't keep this up forever. Casting your head about, you looked desperately for an out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Come on.\" You desperately whispered to yourself, urging yourself to find an answer. There had to be a gap in the wood, or a hole in the wall somewhere. However, the room was well kept and neither of these things made themselves apparent. Perhaps there was some way to climb up the legs of the bed and into the cross beams of the bed? A quick glance dissuaded that notion as only sleek wood met your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"He's not here either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Toss me one of the blankets from the wardrobe. I'll use it to block the door's gap so i can search with you.\" Asami's booted feet tapped across the floor at the avatar's suggestion, and you realized that you were out of time. You might avoid one pair of eyes, but two would be impossible. You had to act fast, even if it was something stupid, if you had any hope to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn a mad dash, you rushed towards the wardrobe, Asami's longer stride carrying her there far faster than you could have ever hoped to reach it. However, your goal wasn't the wardrobe. You reached the young woman's shoes as she was gathering up the blanket. Realizing you only had a moment to act, you quickly jumped onto her foot, springing off of it in order to reach the bottom of the wardrobe. Hopefully, Asami would be too preoccupied with the blanket to see you. You held your breath as you clambered onto the wooden panel, hoping her boots were sturdy enough to shield your presence.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air rushed from your lungs and panic surged through you as you realized you could breathe.

In a moment, the woman relinquished her death grip on you in favor of a more open grasp. You took a shuddering breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Where was he?\" In a moment, the Avatar was look over Asami's shoulder, her icy blue eyes boring into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There's a box in there. We can use it to hold him for now.\" Seeing that Asami's hands were full, Korra shuffled beside her, rummaging through the wardrobe for a few moments. When she pulled her hands free, the avatar held a wooden box. Opening the lid, Asami quickly dropped you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That should hold him.\" There was a note of triumph in the Avatar's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Come on. Let's bring him to my room.\" Together, the women left Korra's room, leaving you within the dark confines of your new prison.</span></div></div>",
