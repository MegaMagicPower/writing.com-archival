She has pale skin, brown hair, and brown eyes. Amongst her peers, Anna is known for one trait in particular: the abillity to keep a level head in almost any situation. She is always calm; pursuing wrongdoers with a completely neutral look on her face- a trait that only makes fighting her all the more intimidating. Outside of battle, Anna is always direct in her conversations; prefering to avoid small tack if possible. When the Northern Kingdom of Rime went through a violent change in regime that resulted in a ruthless dictator seizing the throne, Anna was given the task of insuring that no object of power would fall into the despot's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoli Moondrop:<br>\r\nRace:Half Elf<br>\r\nClass: Cleric<br>\r\nAlignment: Neutral Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoli is a Cleric of Paelor currently acting as Anna's traveling companion. Her mother being a wood elf, her skin has a somewhat greenish tinge to it- causing a bit of a contrast between her skin and her dark colored hair and eyes. Holi is extremely optimistic; to the point of being somewhat naive. She believes that all living creatures have the potential to do good, and only by witnessing great suffering are people driven to commit evil acts. She doesn't do mutch fighting herself; prefering to heal and give aid to her allies than to draw her mace; and given that she's rather clumsy, her usual attempts at combat often end poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kate Frosttouched:<br>\r\nRace:Human<br>\r\nClass: Wizard<br>\r\nAlignment: Chaotic Good<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate is a political refuge on the run from the law after the recent regime change in the kingdom of Rime. Up until then, she had enjoyed a quiet life of relative luxary complete with daily studies at the kingdom's most prestigious wizard school. However, because she had blood relations with the old ruler, she was hounded out of the kingdom; and several of her closest friends died to help her escape. Now hiding out in Halfax, Kate holds an intense grudge against the current regime; one that might eventually spill over into a hate for her entire country if left to fester unchecked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna's greatsword swung in a wide arc, catching a few lizardmen by surprise and ripping them clean in two. Alerted by the deaths of their comrades, three more crawled out of the darkness and charged the paladin; only to share a similary gruesome fate. The second wave was followed quickly follwed by a third, and then a fourth. After several straight minutes of combat, the flood of greenscales that flowed out and around from the surrounding ruins finally stemmed down to a trickle, before drying up entirely as Anna smashed the final one's skull in with the pommel of her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did they attack us?\" Holi said with an extremely nervous look on her face. \"We didn't do anything to them beforehand- why would they do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna merely shrugged as she took a moment to rest and wipe the purplish blood from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is probably their territory,\" the paladin finally said after her face was clean to the point that it was no longer dripping with the purple ichor. \"They see any outsider as a threat and move to kill them on sight. Animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't want to hurt them. Maybe if we try talking to the next one we see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Anna replied with a leveling sigh \"Do you know how to speak Draconic? 'Cause I don't. If we try to talk to them, we might as well be speaking infernal for all the good it will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoli let out a sigh of her own. She didn't know how to speak Draconic. Oh well. Maybe the lizard folk would atleast leave them alone now that they could see they weren't the type of individuals who could be easily beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna led the way through the decaying roads surrounded by all sorts of collapsed pillars and broken statues. According to local lore, these ruins they were now marching through once housed a powerful civilization. One that ruled over both expanses of land that made up the modern day kingdoms of Halfax and Rime, and had many more holdings beyond the great sea. Rumor had it that some of the ancient civilization's treasures had survived whatever had wiped the people out all those years ago- and the deeper you went into the rotting city, the more likely you were to find something of great value. That alone was enough reason for Anna's order to send her off to investigate; and it was only by chance that Holi had gotten dragged along for the ride. Normally, she never went off with an adventuring party; always staying at the monestary to cure illnesses and patch up artisans who more often than not proved to be just as clumsy as she was. It was only because the local workers had done a better job of not hurting themselves this week that the head priest had finally allowed her to go traveling- and here she was now, traveling through dark, damp, and broken corridors. Not that any of that bothered her right now, for she was far to distracted by the odd apeal the ruins had and the very fact that she was finally seeing the world, which had been a lifelong dream of hers for quite awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrack. Holi looked down to see that a stone tile beneath her foot had crumbled. The sound was quickly repeated by a few more tiles. The combined sound grew louder and louder, until it was engulfed by the much louder sound of something shattering- that something just so happened to be the floor Holi was standing on. With a drowned out shriek, the half-elf plummeted downwards into the darkness below; falling for several seconds straight, before impacting into a thankfully deep pool of water. After sinking like a stone for a few moments, Holi let go of her shield and mace and struggled upwards towards the surface, thankful that she didn't own any heavy metal armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaah,\" Holi yelled as she broke through the surface, quickly taking in a series of quick breaths. Luckily for her, quite a few rays of light reached down to this level, allowing her eyes to adjust to the new level of brightness easily enough. Not knowing what else to do, Holi started to swimming towards the nearest shoreline. It took her a little while trying to swim in her somewhat heavy robe, but eventually she finally found a small ledge that she could reach and proceeded to pull herself out. As soon as her head cleared the miniture wall, her eyes caught sight of a rather small building with a dome roof. What was most odd about this building was that, other than a few broken windows, it remained almost entirely intact. Completely soaked and forming a small stream behind her with every step, Holi decided to investigate the lucky building to see if she could find anything that might help her dry herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small ammount of effort, Holi managed to pull the stone door of the building open, revealing a prettily decorated interior that was taken up almost entirely by a circle of statues. What was most peculiar about these statues was that they all depicted women who looked rather heavy; each one having a rather swollen face, a rounded gut that pushed out against their robes, and large thighs that forced the stone women to take up a wide stance. Holi found the statues to be slightly funny looking, and chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, it looks like someone had too much to eat,\" Holi said as she went up and poked one of the stone stomachs jokingly, before realizing that the statue on the far left was holding a fragment of some sort of crystal in it's left hand. It glowed brightly, and Holi realised it's presence was probably the only reason that she could see right now. Knowing that Anna was here searching for something glowing and magical, she decided to pocket it. However, when she put her hands over it, it glow suddenly intensified tenfold, temporarily blinding the cleric. When the light finally died down, Holi noticed a tingling sensation in her right palm, and looked down to notice that the crystal had burned some sort of blue rune into her hand that she couldn't recognise. The crystal, still in her hand, was glowing a lot less impressively than it had been beforehand, just barely enough to illuminate her immediate surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a deep rumbing from Holi's stomach, and the half-elf bent over in pain. Man, she was hungry. Like, haven't eaten all day hungry. Only problem was, she had no idea where her pack was right now; probably at the bottom of that pool of water along with her weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now what am I going to do?\" </span></div></div>",

She has tanned skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. From a very early age, she has been taught to believe that maintaining order is important to keeping everybody safe; and that people who break the law for selfish reasons deserved to be be punished harshly. She is completely devoted to her work and spends nearly every waking moment reviewing paperwork and everyone's schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal Stillpond<br>\r\nRace: Elf<br>\r\nClass: Druid<br>\r\nAlignment: True Neutral<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVal is part of a dying order. The power of nature is slowly ebbing away as urban sprawl becomes more commonplace; putting her druid circle's entire existance at risk. Val, and all other members of her circle, are trying to find anything that might preserve the remains of the natural elements. She has a brown, treebark-like color to her skin along with similarly colored eyes and greenish hair; causing her to look kind of like a tree when standing still. Spending her whole life away from large settlements, Val is largely ignorant to mainstream culture; and is prone to embarrasing herself by making false assumptions about what is right and wrong. Another side effect of living so far away from society is that Val is illiterate, which tends to be another source of embarrasment. Agreeable and shy, Val has a longway to go if she is going to find anything that can save her circle. Currently, she has a camp situated just a few miles outside of Halfax's capital city, hanging out with her boar companion which she rather blandly named Tusk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazi Smoothcut<br>\r\nRace: Gnome<br>\r\nClass: Rogue<br>\r\nAlignment: Chaotic Neutral<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazi absolutely loves having a good time; and is willing to go through almost anything to insure that she has one. Impatient, easily bored by those around her, and not quite the smartest gnome one could find, Razi is sure to stir up trouble wherever she is. She has blond hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. Currently, Razi is hanging out at a local tavern inside Halfax's capital, Stonegate.</span></div></div>",

She crossed her arms triumphantly.  \"Tol' ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStinky Old Bert, the bartender, hobbled over to Razi, took one of her tiny hands in his enormous meat-hook, and raised her arm over her head so high she lifted off the ground a few inches. \"The winner:  Razi Smoothcut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mix of cheers and boos as those who'd bet on Razi collected their winning from the unlucky larger group who'd put their money on Gustavo Flamebeard, Esq, a traveling merchant who was currently making the acquaintance of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazi hiccuped and swayed on her feet as Stinky Old Bert pressed the pouch of her winnings into her hands.  She fumbled with it, but no matter how drunk she was there was no way she was dropping a purse of gold.  Not even if she was passed out.  Not even if she was dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was you,\" S.O.B. muttered into her ear, \"I'd scamper now before someone gets wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, she could hear unhappy, suspicious muttering beginning to swell around her.  Razi scampered, although not quite in a straight line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazi emerged from the bushes, lacing up her breeches -- though she was giving serious thought to not bothering.  There had been a couple of problems in the plan, in retrospect, both thanks to a serious underestimation of just how much Gustavo Flamebeard, Esq., could drink.   For one, even though S.O.B. had watered down her drinks until they were four-fifths water, she hadn't had to fake being drunk.  In fact, she was dangerously close to plastered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second problem was that, alcoholic or not, twelve mugs was twelve mugs, and a little gnome body wasn't meant to hold so much liquid.  Eight trips to the bushes later, and she still felt like a bulging waterskin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Make that nine,</i> she realized desperately, fumbling with the laces she'd just finished tying.  Some getaway!  At least the angry voices in the distance were a long way away - none of them could track for beans, despite the trail she was leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really weren't supposed to stop and count the money until <i>after</i> you were free and clear.  That was how getaways turned into getcaughts.   But she was <i>so</i> curious, and they were <i>so</i> slow, and as previously mentioned, Razi was dancing on the edge of Shitfaced Canyon.  She dug into the pouch curiously.  And discovered that there was a third problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A few coppers?</i> she thought, just managing to bite back an enraged screech.  <i>And a worthless old map?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw right away what had happened.  That idiot S.O.B. had been conned.  The merchant had played it safe, preparing for a loss by offering a stupid fake treasure map, and the bartender had bought it hook, line, and sinker.  Of all the lousy, rotten, infuriating cheats!   And it didn't even look half as good as the fake treasure map <i>she'd</i> put up as a stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well.  She eyed the map.  <i>Wonder what's actually here under the X?</i>, she thought.  <i>Rocks?  Trees?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged.  She had to get out of town and lay low for a while anyway.  And she wasn't likely to be pulling any jobs for a few days -- she was too bloated to sneak through the tight cracks.  So she'd humor Mr. Redbeard, Esq.  Who knows?  Maybe there was actually a treasure.</span></div></div>",

The church of Hextor had been a major backer in the recent regime change in the kingdom of Rime. As a result, the current ruler favors the church immensely; greatly increasing the church's budget and completely removing the high level of scrutiny the church had always been suffered under during the previous king's rule. As a show of thanks, the church has assinged Sister Blackshield the task of finding a weapon worthy of a true ruler as a symbol of gratitude for the despot to weild. Blackshield has bright red hair and freckles- traits she resents deeply and attemps to hide them under her black robes. Like most members of her chuch, she is rather arrogant; seeing non-fallowers as individuals of lower intellegence who require a strict system lording over them to prevent them from burning civilization away entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolvia \"The Red\"<br>\r\nRace: Teifling<br>\r\nClass: Sorcerer<br>\r\nAlignment: Neutral Evil<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ruthlessly ambitious individual, Solvia grew up being hunted by random bands of peasents; until one day her magical powers manifested and she burned an entire mob alive. Her powers grew exponentially after that day, and Solvia is now an infamous criminal with ties to almost any crime imaginable that occurs within the borders of Halfax. As her alias suggests, her most defining feature is her dark red skin- a \"good luck\" gift her grandfather passed down to her. She also posesses a small set of horns and a tail; as if she didn't stand out enough already. Having recently learned of a paladin's planned expadition to find hidden treasures of untold power, Solvia has decided to track the paladin and aquire anything the paladin finds through force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavith<br>\r\nRace: Succubus<br>\r\nAlignment: Chaotic Evil<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavith has spent the past few years basking in the lap of luxary. A while back, she killed and posed as a local noblewoman in a wealthy province in Rime; and has since then spent every waking hour being wated on hand and foot. This lifestlyle has caused her to become extremely lazy, to the point where anything other than eating, drinking, or sleeping is seen as an annoyance to her. Recently however, she has come in contact with an unknown individual promising her even greater wealth and power. Peaking her interest, Lavith has invited this individual to her house in hopes of coming to some sort of an agreement. While Lavith can assume practically any form as a succubus, her defualt demon form has grayish skin, black hair, and blood red eyes.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Will you be needing anything else, my lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing for now, Natasia,\" The demoness sais as she took a sip from the drink one of the help had just brought up for her. \"Return to the dining room and make sure that everything is prepared for the arrival of our guest tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant nodded and left the spacious bedroom that Lavith spent almost every waking hour lounging about in. Ever since she had \"moved in\" a few years ago, the succubus had developed a habit of spending more and more time laying in bed; oftentimes not even getting up from the same position she slept in. There was simply no need to go through the hassle of traversing through the rather spacious manner when she had \"inherited\" servants that could do all the walking for her. As luck would have it, the noblewoman she had replaced had been the lord of one of the most propserous provinces in the kingdom of Rime. All it took was a tax raise here and a diversion of public funds there, and Lavith could afford almost any luxary she desired to get her hands on. Aside from eventually having to work around that annoying concept of mortality; after all, the noble she had replaced was going to have to officially die in a few decades so as to avoid arrousing suspision, and Lavith would have to put up a show of leaving everything to a supposed heir, and continue to repeat that process every seventy years or so, she was going to spend eternity living like royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled inwardly as she took another deep drink from the red liquid resting in her glass. Yes, life was indeed good, She didn't even need to disguise herself while at home, as all of her servants had been magically charmed to accept her other-worldly appearence as being nothing out of the ordinary; thus freeing her from the effort it took to keep a long term alternate appearence up. As she downed the last of her drink and rang a bell on her nightstand to request another, she couldn't think of any reason why anyone would ever risk losing what she had right now; which made her decision to invite a competely unknown stranger to her home all the more odd. Sure, the letter she had recieved had promised even greater wealth and power, but that only ment that the writer knew the reader was already wealthy and powerful; which she was. Normally, it wouldn't be of any real concern, but why would a total stranger expect help from a noble? And what help could she possibly provide aside from financial backing; and Lavith was normally not interested in anything that might increase her exposure to others or involve a significant ammount of work on her part. This was more than likely a bad idea; and yet, deep down, her demonic nature was always thirsting for more, and the very idea that she could get more of what she had now had driven her to allow this stranger into her home and give him/her a chance to peek her interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rang, my lady?\" a voice seeped into the room and echoed slightly from the threshold of the ornately crafted door that led into the master bedroom. Lavith turned her head upwards from her empty glass and glanced at the servant. It was Natasia again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. I was hoping I could get a refill- oh, and could you bring me up some sweet rolls? A dozen would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, my lady.\" The single-minded servant removed the empty glass from Lavith's hands and quickly left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavith was currently sitting in the dining hall, having previously edited her appearence to match that of the manor's fomer mistress. Causing her hair to turn blond, her eyes a light brown, and her skin to lighten to a very pale white. According to human customs, it was considered rude to eat before everyone had arrived; not that human customs had ever interested Lavith in the slightest. Currently, she was enjoying a rather large cut of beef, another glass of the red liquor she had taken a liking to, and a whole loaf of freshly baked bread. As she was about half way through, there was a slight knock on the door; barely audible enough to get the demoness' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, my lady,\" The servant said nervously. It looked to be one of the first floor orderlies that Lavith rarely interacted with, and consequently, his name escaped her. \"Your...guest has arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant was suddenly shoved out of the way and replaced with a figure trying it's best to obscure some sort of abnormal features with an oversized black robe. Despite it's best efforts, Lavith's inhuman eyes immediately picked up on the fact that the figure at the verly least was hiding a tail and a pair of small horns under all that cloth; and since it wasn't concealing the widely hated features magically it could only mean one thing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, and what can I do for a tiefling such as yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure stopped moving closer towards her, and drew it's arms to pull it's hood down. Sure enough, it was indeed a tiefling; and one that stuck out like a sore thumb at that. She had all the textbook features: Red skin, the aforemented horns and tail, and a slight sharpness in the shape of her teeth that made them look slightly more bestial than human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that that's out of the bag, I suppose we can get straight down to buisness. My name is Solvia. Recently, i recieved some information on the locations of a few very powerful items that I happen to have an interest in. Unfortunately, multiple other parties might be after the same items, and I was hoping that you may be able to provide some help in insuring that said items are aquired by the proper party in question- namely me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Interesting story. But how would a noble such as myself, who has no experience with traveling, be of help in this little adventure of your's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiefling laughed for a few seconds, before giving off a grin that displayed all those inhuman teeth in little rows of minature daggers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I believe your potential contribution to my expedition could be quite invaluable... Lavith.\"</span></div></div>",

The page grew exponentially with each opening, and, once finished, the teifling laid the large piece of parchment down on an unoccupied space of Lavith's rather impressive dining room table. Apparently expected to come and look at what her blackmailer had brought out, the succubus merely shuffled over towards the other end of the table and took note of the dipiction of a rather large of a gem that was being held up in the air by multiple pairs of hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Stone of Limitless Bounty,\" The sorceress said, correctly guessing what Lavith was going to say next. \"From what my research has gathered, it once had the power to keep entire armies supplied in the field indeffinately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once had?\" the succubus asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was apparently shattered into six different pieces right around the same time the old empire fell. Unfortunately, any other information on the stone-including any other powers it may have had, have been lost to the ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you thought this was worth bringing to me, why exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" Solvia's smile was almost impossibley wide now, displaying what seemed like dozens of sharp pointed teeth. \"I believe I know where one of the pieces is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiefling pulled out a set of smaller sheets that had been covered in disorganized penstrokes. The writing was so bad that Lavith quickly gave up attempting to make out any of it, prompting Solvia to begin explaining things again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's taken me month's of raiding arcane libraries and cross-reffrencing a few local folktales, but it seems that I've finally more or less pinpointed the location of one of the fragments. According to all of this, the fragment in question is located a few miles deep in the nearby Chillwood Forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And based off this chicken scratch you have here,\" Lavith was clearly annoyed by just how quickly it seemed the tiefling's information could turn out false by now, her mood clearly conveyed by the tone of her voice \"You believe that part of the stone is somewhere in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know it's there,\" Solvia retorted, her confidence in her work completely unwavering. \"Wizards from Rime's various schools have all reported magical readings from the general area- but so far, no one has been willing to put the time in and find the source. Think about it for a moment, if all of these fragments could be found, then armies would never have to wait for supply lines to be established. Morale would never be low, as everything they could want or need could be instantly supplied to them. A battalion could fight on almost indeffinately; only needing to stop in order to replenish troops if significant casualties are sustained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavith had to admit, that did sound rather impressive. Freeing a fighting force from the need to stop for supplies would greatly increase it's mobility; thus making outflanking enemies all the easier. Having the best outfited army would insure that she could expand her influence; which would give her access to even greater wealth and make her life even more luxurious and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demoness smiled. She liked the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright teifling,\" Lavith said as she reached over and began eating the remains of her loaf of bread. \"You have perked my interest in this little crystal of your's. In return for keeping my existance a secret and helping my expand the size of the land under my control, I will offer what ever aid I can to help you find the Stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" The sorceress said as she began collecting her papers from the table. \"Meet me at the northern edge of the woods at midnight. I'll be slightly off of the main road- you'll know me when you see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I will.\" Lavith nodded in agreement as Solvia immediately exited the room as she finished speaking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As always on the rare occasions where Lavith was actually required to leave the safety and comfort of her estate, the succubus was currently being carried to her destination in the litter she had purchased for herself. The exterior of the raised platform was painted black and gold, and the interior contained a lavish sofa that was big enough to support three people. Sure, it was dark out now and flying their would have been much faster, but, as with all physical exersion Lavith found it to be an annoyance; prefering to remain seated on something soft at all times. This preference, however, always insured that the demoness' travels attracted atleast one group of theives hoping to strike it rich by mugging a noble. Unfortunately for anyone who happened to approach the litter with the hope of making some gold, the only thing they ever recieved for their efforts was a set of five sharp claws shoved right through their chest. For even though Lavith hated exerting herself, she was still immensely powerful by average human standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a waste of time,\" Lavith said to herself with a yawn as she scraped some chunks of flesh off her dagger-like claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving dealt with the obligitory bandit gutting she had somehow made a habit of doing every time she had to go somewhere, the succubus returned to her mobile seat and was carried the rest of the way with now further interruption. To the succubus' minor surprise, the tiefling had been true to her word, and was currently waiting for the demon a little off from the main road .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Tell me, have you ever heard of a little something called subtlety?\" The sorceress angerly spat. \"We're trying to find an object of ultimate power that people have been trying to find for generations, and you're traveling in a box that someone can spot from a mile away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavith rolled off the platform her servants carried and landed nimbly on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you never said I couldn't,\" the demoness said with a smug look on her face; she clearly enjoyed getting under other people's skin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolvia felt a sudden urge to shoot horrible things at the succubus- but then quickly remembered that she actually needed help in retrieving the crystal, as she needed something strong to cover her while she focused on homing in on the crystal's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I suppose it doesn't matter anyways since I doubt that anyone knows we're here.\" The teifling said with a deep sigh. \"Okay, here's the plan: I will concentrate on homing in on the fragment's magical aura while you remove anything that might wander into our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple enough,\" The succubus said with a slight nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and your little friends should wait out here. Seeing as how you'd never get your box to fit in through the line of trees anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavith frowned, but responed with another nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, just give me a moment to concentrate and we can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress sat down and immediately adopted a lotus pose. After what seemed to be far too long for the succubus' liking, Solvia generated a small sphere of energy in her hands that deformed slightly when she pointed it towards the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There. Now if we just travel in the direction this thing points in, we should be able to find the fragment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how long will that take?\" Lavith said as she moved in to get a closer look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know exactly!\" Solvia half mumbled through gritted teeth. \"Just... follow my lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to think of any more prodding questions to use for now, Lavith merely followed Solvia into the darkness-filled woods. For the most part, their little trip was largely uneventful. Even though Chillwood Forest was notorious for all sorts of wild animal attacks, not a single creature dared to cross their paths- not even the expected insects eager to chip away at lost travellers. The journey simply consisted of them jumping over roots and manuvering around the occasional stump or log. To Lavith's immense relief, this bothersome exersise only lasted on for about an hour, before the two of them reached a clearing that had been pepperd here and there by broken bits of building and statue that made it clear that something of a park must have been here long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" the sorceress said as she crushed the orb in her hand; thus extinguishing it's guiding light. \"I can't seem to get a more specific lock on it's location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, in order to find what we're looking for, we're going to have to go back in town and pick up an archeological team? Is that the plan now?\" Lavith said as she picked up a tiny piece of a wall and flicked it back towards the trees behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I wouldn't have been able to find it if it had been buried underground. Just... keep your eyes open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Lavith, she could see in the dark, so trying to find a small object sitting in the dark in the middle of the night wouldn't be too big of a problem for her. The two of them split up and began circling around the clearing, carefully examining the ground so as to not overlook anything that might be what they were looking for. After nearly another hour since they had entered the forest, the work-hating demoness was about to call it quits, when she happened to catch sight of a ray of light reflecting off a wet leaf. Turning her head in the opposite direction of where the light had impacted, she saw that the beam of light had originated from a crystal like object that seemed to be surrounded by a set of stone fingers. Excitedly, Lavith rushed over to the crystal and snatched it up. As soon as she had the light source firmly placed in her had however, it's glow suddenly intensified exponentially, momentarily illuminating the clearing as though it were mid day. As quickly as the flash of light had come, it soom faded away. returning to a much level lower of light emitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for her vision to recover, but Lavith was quickly able to reorient her self after the flash. The first thing she noticed was that her left hand- the hand she had grasped the crystal with- was now afflicted by a strong tingling sensation. After bringing it to her face for closer inspection, she saw that an unrecognisable rune was now etched into the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Happened?\" Solvia yelled as she sprinted over to the succubus fallowing the aftermath of the flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I think we found what we're looking for- and it seem's to have taken a liking to me.\" Lavith said as she brought the crystal chunk and the mark it had left on her hand out for the teifling to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. This wasn't in my notes...\" The sorceress mumbled to herself as she began pacing. \"Nothing I read about it said anything about having a special affect on the individual who held it- though this is deffinately what i sensed earlier, no other stupid rock here has a magical aura like this one. We should take it back into town for study, and see if this mark of your's has any special meaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heading back sound's good right about now,\" the demoness said as she suddenly clutched both hands around her stomach. \"I just suddenly remembered that I left dinner unfinished.\"</span></div></div>",
