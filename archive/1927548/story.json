Your alarm clock rings and you get out of bed as you let out a yawn. You check your watch and let out a sigh. \"Still early,\" you mutter to yourself. \"Well, I'm up.\" You walk out and look out the inside of your... house. Well, okay, it's the inside of a fire extinguisher cabinet. But it's something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're lucky to have lasted this long. Just a few months ago, you were sailing with some friends when a huge storm rocked the boat and crashed you onto the shores of this beach. You were lucky to have survived, but imagine your surprise when you landed on a beach filled with giant monsters. Fortunately, the manager of the beach gave you a job as a lifeguard. It's not much of a job considering all you can do is act as a second pair of eyes to a giant gargoyle. But Roxy was a nice partner and you always felt safe around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's still early. So what are you going to do with your time before you have to punch the clock?</span></div></div>",

You look around and make sure Paisley isn't in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used to think that mermaids were a dream come true if they were real, but there was nothing dreaming about that mermaid. She was rude to the beach goers and she even spit at Roxy one time. What's worse is that she saw you as little more than a snack and you wouldn't be surprised if she was the reason you were the only survivor of the shipwreck. But fortunately she was nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief and then swim out. You couldn't believe it. Even the shallow end of the water was deep to a human like you and as you swim out, you see just how deep it is. It's a good thing you're in top physical shape or this would end dangerously. But even with your muscles, you were weak as a kitten compared to monsters hundreds of feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you hear something.</span></div></div>",

Being a mermaid, she was virtually immobile on the land and you let out a laugh as she's trying to come after you. \"You'll be laughing from the inside of my belly, you twerp!\" Paisley showed her sharp teeth and snapped them, but you walk slowly away as she tries to chase you. \"You're out of shape, Paisley,\" you say. \"Get that lardass of yours back in the water.\" Paisley grits her teeth. \"For your information, mermaids do not have asses! I'm going to get you!\" You just walk away as Paisley is struggling to go after you.

That's when Stella looks ahead and gasps because she sees Paisley beached in the sand. \"Paisley!?\" Paisley at this point is weak and looks physically ill as she sweats heavily under the hot sun right as Stella flies down to her. \"Paisley!\" Paisley lets out a groan. \"Good day, Stella.\" She says weakly. Stella is the only monster on the land that Paisley gets along with, mainly because they both enjoy tormenting you. \"Don't worry, Paisley,\" says Stella. \"I'll get you back to the water.\" Stella grabs Paisley by the tail and flies in the air, dangly Paisley and making her grunt. Paisley begins to turn pale due to the fact that she wasn't used to being in the sky and looked like she would vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, Stella drops her with a splash back into the water. \"How did you get yourself beached, Paisley?\" Paisley lets out a hiss. \"That bloody Stephen got away from me again. I thought if I went after him on the land, I could get him but I completely forgot mermaids can't move out of the water.\" \"Damn,\" says Stella. \"I'd sure love to hear that little twerp scream in agony going down your throat. But you can only get him if he goes near the water.\" Paisley lets out a groan. Stella then gasps. \"Wait here.\" She says. Stella flies off as Paisley looks in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Stella returns, Paisley is picking her teeth with a fishbone. Stella flies down into the water and holds up a strange potion. \"What the Davy Jones is that?\" Paisley gives a smirk. \"This is a potion I bought from a kappa from Horrorville. It has the power to make two monster exchange species?\" Paisley is even more confused as Stella pours the elixir into two glasses. \"It couldn't be any simpler. It will turn you into a fairy and me into a mermaid and once you're able to leave the water, it's munch time for Stephen.\" Paisley raises an eyebrow. \"I hope it works and that it isn't permanent. I'd hate to lose my gills forever.\" Stella smiles wickedly and hands Paisley her glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your enemies drink the potion but does it work...</span></div></div>",

You feel the water current changing as it enters her mouth, and you panic more, your limbs thrashing. Paisley's tongue touches your feet, and as by instinct, it wraps around a thashing leg, and starts to pull. You let out one final scream as your body is dragged underwater into her mouth. She closes her mouth with a dramatic nash, smiling as she dives back underwater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flail around the water in her mouth, trying as hard as you can to hold your breath as the tongue pushes you, tasting your body. Then, you feel a slight bit of pressure, and you are pulled in one direction, soon sliding downwards. You gasp as you are pulled into her throat, your lungs starting to fill with water, and with one final gulp, you are sucked down into the giant chasm that is her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land somewhat softly at the bottom, and you gasp for air, which you actually recieve. You spit out the water in your lungs, coughing and wheezing. You guess that the mermaid filtered the water into her breathing, leaving her stomach with air.

You then hear Paisley's voice. \"Don't you dare throw up in my stomach, human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spit out a bit but try to hold the vomit. \"Paisley! Let me out!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Roxy orders a White Russian for her and you get a simple beer. As you wait for your drinks, you decide to ask Roxy about the pollution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, apparently there's some sort of gunk in a small pool near the eastern cove. A female werewolf touched and got incredibly fat and... oh no. Not her.\" Roxy says, looking at a nearby booth. You follow her gaze and see what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the both was an incredibly fat chimera in a blue one piece. She had three heads: a bald hippo with blue eyes and grey skin; a bald snake with orange eyes and black scales; and a light grey furred panther with short red hair and black eyes. Her body was an anthro panther with a snake for a tail. All three heads were staring in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized her as Susan. She was always at the beach, but not for sun or surf. She was a stalker, and the target of her obssession was Roxy. You heard that she was always watching Roxy and even stole and wore some of her swimsuits. You also heard that she even had a shrine to her in her home. You had to deal with her a few times because she got violent if anyone talked to Roxy. Each head had a different personality and appetite: the snake was shy and a vegan; the hippo was sane and ate cooked meat; and the panther, the one you were most afraid of, was completely insane and ate humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, and today was going so well.\" You say, unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Roxy replied. \"Maybe we can get out and away from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both take your drinks (which had just arrived) and started for the door. Do you make it?</span></div></div>",

Roxy and you quickly swallow your drinks and give a size of relief (followed by a loud belch in Roxy's case) right before Roxy flaps her wings and flies up. \"That was too close for comfort,\" says Roxy. \"That Susan Carvonis drives me so crazy with her relentless stalking.\" You let out a scoff as Roxy places you in her pitch black hair. \"Welcome to my world. Let's check out that pool and we'll see what's up with that mysterious pollution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy flies over a small grotto by the bay and lands on the docks to get a closer look. There was a strange magenta-colored fluid in the water. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d you say. \u201cThere it is. And its seeping into the cove. Roxy nods her head and then notices some drift wood before getting an idea. In no time at all, your gargoyle friend builds a dam to stop the flow of the polluted water into the bay. \u201cThat should keep the damage under control.\u201d As Roxy says this, she fails to notice her tail has touched the polluted water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your gargoyle friend takes out a vial and then uses it to take a sample of the pollutant. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better,\u201d said Roxy. \u201cI\u2019d say this stuff was nebutori or something similar. But it only seems to effect monsters who touch it. I\u2019ll take it to Helga in the morning and she\u2019ll be able to tell me what this slime if. For now, we better block off this area before it spreads into the beach.\u201d As Roxy says this, you slide down into her hand. However, you notice something strange. Roxy\u2019s palm seems bigger to you. \u201cRoxy?\u201d you ask. \u201cAre you getting bigger?\u201d Roxy glares down at you as her eyes glow red. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asks. \u201cUh, never mind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Roxy then places you on her left breast and then walks off to put up some signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the bar, Susan sat her enormous rear down on three stools before she pounded her fist to catch Mesa's attention. \"Three white Russians.\" Says the hippo head calmly. Mesa gives Susan her order and Susan's three heads guzzled every last drop. The snake head hissed and sprung up to look around for any sign of Roxy. \"Ssshe wasss here.\" Susan angrily scratched the side of the table and the panther head gave an angry growl. \"It's that Stephen boy isn't it?\" Susan asked to herself using her panther head. \u201cHow dare you toy with my emotions by hanging around someone who doesn\u2019t deserve you? You will be mine, my chubby lemon of my eye. If I have to, I\u2019ll drop that invader down my throat.\u201d Susan then grabs a handful of hot wings and stuffs them into the mouth of her hippo head right before her snake head swallowed an entire flask of gin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, another monster came in. This one was a decrepit looking male jabberwock with a catfish-like face and pitch black eyes along with a thick fu-manchu mustache. He was hunch-backed and was wearing an old-fashioned red and white striped bathing suit like people wore in the early half of the 20th century. He snuck his way up to Susan and Susan\u2019s hippo head noticed him. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d The jabberwock took out a bottle of grape soda and poured himself a glass before he hissed and spoke. \u201cWhat do you expect from me? I\u2019m old.\u201d Then Susan showed her claws to the jabberwock. \u201cDid you bring it.\u201d The jabberwock gave a growl and held up a heart-shaped bottle filled with pink liquid floating in it. \u201cThis is it. Just a slip of this love potion into the gargoyle\u2019s drink with a piece of your DNA and she will fall deeply in love with you.\u201d Susan\u2019s three heads smiled wickedly and then Susan took the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jabberwock gave a growl. \u201cWhat about my money?\u201d The panther head roared ferociously at the jabberwock. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you only if the plan succeeds. Only after Roxy is mine. Only after Roxy is mine. The jabberwock nervously nods his head before Susan tosses him to the side. She then gives a growl before she tries to put her fiendish plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you were staying at Roxy\u2019s house and were standing on her shoulder as she was getting ready to watch a Corona Poe movie. \u201cHurry up with that sandwich, Roxy. I want to get on with the movie. Corona Poe is my favorite.\u201d Roxy was in her kitchen putting together the type of sandwich that would put a Dagwood to shame. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. Ouch!\u201d Roxy bumped her head on the ceiling fan and grumbled. \u201cWho lowered the ceiling?\u201d she asks herself. You look in the kitchen and see that Roxy appears taller. Sure, Roxy was already the size of a skyscraper, but something was bugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither you or Roxy noticed was that Susan was outside the window and her snake head placed the love potion vial in her mouth before she slinked in through Roxy's window. Suddenly there is loud music coming from the DVD you're watching and it startles her, causing her to drop the love potion right next to the bottle of pollutant that Roxy had on the windowsill. You turn your head but the snake head retreats, causing you to turn your attention back to the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's snake head then grabs what she believes is the love potion and then slinks her head, uncorks the bottle and pours it into the Olympic swimming pool-sized cup of pink lemonade that Roxy had on the table, retreating once Roxy comes out of the kitchen with her sandwich. You see her butt coming in and you have to jump off the couch onto the table to avoid getting flattened. Surprisingly, Roxy seems to take up the whole couch. She doesn't appear any fatter than usual but she definitely seems to have gotten bigger. You'd almost swear she looked taller than her sister Petra. You decide to shrug it off as Roxy is pouring salt on her sandwich. \"Roxy,\" you say. \"That sandwich is big even by your standards.\" \"Are you saying I'm fat?\" asks Roxy in annoyance. \"No,\" you say. \"I'm saying that you'd probably have to dislocate your jaw just to take a bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy gives a scoff right as the movie starts. From the looks of it, it's a western-style movie. \"I see we're watching a western tonight.\" You say as Roxy is trying to bite into her oversized sandwich. \"Well,\" says Roxy. \"Corona Poe is a bison-based minotaur. This is one of her first movies. Dances with Wendigos.\" As the movie opens up in the middle of a large open plain at night, Roxy takes a sip of her tainted pink lemonade as Susan watches and then gags and coughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxy?\" you ask. \"Are you alright?\" Roxy then feels her stomach. \"Ugh. I think this lemonade has.. (hic!)\" Exactly what was it that Roxy drank.</span></div></div>",

Roxy then looks and see her breasts expanding and tear through her black tank top and making her scream as she holds her expanding stomach before it cracks her coffee table and sends you flying as you land on her girth. Roxy grits her fangs. \"Not one word about my weight, Stephen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy feels her stomach in pain and then stands up and lets out a yell of pain because not only has she bumped her head on the ceiling but her head actually went through the ceiling into her attic. Susan is looking and all six of her eyes pop out of her three heads. \"What the heck!?\" yells the panther head. \"I don't underssstand it,\" said the snake head. \"It was ssssuposssed to make her fall madly in love with me.\" The hippo head then points to the bottle of potion still on the table and the now empty bottle of pollutant. \"Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy crouches down and then runs out onto her verandah before she screams as the verandah collapses under her massive feet. Roxy stands up and then she feels ripping because her underwear was tearing apart and her tank top follows. \"Oh no!\" \"Roxy?\" you ask. Roxy stumbles forward and seems to get bigger in both height and weight as she walks and then she recoils in pain before you tumble down her breast. \"Whoa!\" As you look up, you see that Roxy is rapidly growing to the point where her breast and butt are being pressed against the type of skyscrapers that are skyscrapers to giant monsters. \"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround, monsters look in horror as Roxy continues to grow and run out of the way as she keeps getting bigger and bigger. \"This must be that pollutant she swallowed,\" you think to yourself as you try to get a good grip on Roxy's growing, fleshy yellow body. \"It's made her even more massive than usual.\" You then slip and yell as Roxy stands up and folds her wings to cover her booty while she uses her hands to hide her breasts and privates. \"Oh no.\" Groans your gargoyle friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the pollutant has taken effect, Roxy has grown to 15,000ft high, making the other monsters look like ants in comparison. Roxy screams as she tries desperately to cover herself. Susan's three jaws drop as she looks up at the titanic gargoyle's massive rear right in front of her. That was when Roxy realizes something. \"Stephen!?\" she yells. \"Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you were on Roxy's...</span></div></div>",

As much as I hate to admit it, I hope she rests in peace.\" You feel yourself and see that you're covered in a bizarre blue liquid and see the same liquid leaking out of Stella's back. You mentally gag because you're covered from head to toe in fairy blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that most of the beach has been destroyed and several of the monsters from Terrordale (including Mesa, Chihiro, Reimu and even Fran) receiving medical attention. \"What happened?\" you ask. Roxy lets out a sigh. \"After Horrorville attacked, the Terrordale army managed to fight back. Not easy since we were up against mostly dragons and gargoyles. But they will be back. They were out for blood.\" Opal lets out a hiss as she's gluing the gem on her forehead back together. It must've been broken in the fight. \"This is all Paisley's fault!\" she yells. Fran nods her head as her daughter Helga bandages her. \"Fran hate Paisley! Paisley eat peace ambassador! Paisley bad mermaid!\" Then Fran holds her arm in pain, prompting Helga to sit her down. \"Mom,\" Helga says. \"Don't move around too much. You'll reopen your wounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and see that some of the monsters from your Winter job at Grimmsly Lodge showed up, namely Roxy's bahamut friend, Elisa, a giant monster resembling a hippo with gills and dragon's wings. Accompanying her and tending to the injured were Azure the werecoyote, Hippolyta the hippogriff, Victoria the Frankenstein, Felicia the werejaguar and Lydia the kamaitachi. Even Dr. West and Nurse Whitney from the K.D.P. are there. \"Normally,\" says Dr. West. \"I'm not this kind of doctor. But we need everyone we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney let out a sigh. \"And the K.D.P. was destroyed in the attack. All the patients got loose. As if there wasn't enough chaos all around us at the moment. Kath, bring more antibiotics, we've got more heavy injuries here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Elisa comes forward to speak with you and Roxy. \"Things really got pear shaped over here,\" she says. \"At least you guys are okay.\" Roxy hands you to Elisa and then walks away. \"Elisa,\" she says. \"Please hold onto Stephen for me while I take Stella to the morgue.\" Elisa nods her way as Roxy walks away. \"This is just great,\" says Elisa in annoyance. \"I finally get Edgar to agree to a date this weekend and then a war breaks out. That Paisley did it this time.\" \"At this rate,\" you say. \"We're all gonna get killed. Except for those who are undead.\" Elisa walks into a tent that appears to be arranged like a war room. There were several monsters under the tent. Only one of them you recognized and you didn't like it. It was Elektra, a loxodon waitress for Grimmsly Lodge in the winter. That elephantine giantess was also trying to eat you during the winter just like Paisley does in the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Elektra looks at you, she just lets out a sigh and lowers her trunk. \"I don't have time to eat you at the moment Stephen,\" she says. \"We've got bigger fish to fry. Literally.\" \"Elektra?\" you ask. \"What are you doing here?\" \"What?\" asks Elektra. \"I used to be a soldier. I'm a war elephant.\" You groan at that joke before a black furred Nemean lion slams his hand on the table. \"We barely won with our lives. The Horrorvilles will be back later. Our defenses can't take another assault. We've got to take the fight to them.\" Every monster in the tent except for Elisa and Elektra roar up in agreement. \"We can't do that,\" says Elisa. \"Roxy's sisters live in Horrorville. Not to mention some of April's cousins. We're twin cities for crying out loud!\" \"Shut up Starking,\" says Elektra. \"This is war Elisa.\" \"But there has to be a better way!\" yells Elisa as the hippo dragon giantess opens her mouth and shows her sharp teeth. \"This is Paisley's fault we're in this mess. She's the killer. I have an idea. What if we were to capture Paisley and hand her over to Horrorville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as you sit in Elisa's palm. That was a good idea, it was all Paisley's fault. She ate R.L. and threw Horrorville and Terrordale into this mess. You'd want a part of any plan that would give Paisley what's coming to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what is the ultimate decision?</span></div></div>",

Horrorville and Terrordale are both glad that that evil mermaid terrorist is dead. But I wouldn't rest on my laurels if I were you. Aqua told me that another aquatic monster is moving into Paisley's grotto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the news and cough in surprise before you slip and fall down into Roxy's cleavage. Roxy then slaps herself in the face. \"Terrific. Another sea rat to worry about harassing the beachgoers.\" You try to stand up, but Roxy's sweat has you stuck to her left breast upside down with one leg in the air. You let out a grumble and try to shake free as Petra spreads her wings out ready to fly. \"I advise you keep an eye on this new monster in case they try anything funny. Also Roxy, I'd advise you to spend less time at the beach grill. Someone might think a whale washed up on shore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra laughs at her sister's expense and then flaps her wings to fly back to Horrorville as Roxy grits her teeth. \"I am not fat!\" she yells. \"I have big bones. At least I don't have to duck my head every time I walk through my own front door. Sometimes she drives me so crazy Stephen. Stephen?\" Roxy looks down and sees you trying to shake yourself free of her hot sticky breast until she peels you off. \"Will you be more careful? That's the fifth time this week I've had to peel you off.\" \"Sorry,\" I said. \"Well, better go check out the new neighbor.\" Roxy places you in her ear as she flies in the sky right over Paisley's abandoned grotto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what kind of monster would move into a dead mermaid's grotto. Especially given how severe Paisley had been killed. First, Mesa chopped off her tail and then Phoebe set her human half on fire as everyone else ganged up on it. You'd have buried what was left, but Carmen ate Paisley's human half and Mesa threw the bones into the trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't reflect on the past because you see something swimming out of the grotto. \"There she is Roxy!\" you yell. \"Down there!\" Roxy flies down and you both take a look to see that the new resident of Paisley's grotto was....</span></div></div>",

You started to blush really madly as you are surprised that Koyuki just asked you how you are doing. For a great white shark, she is quite nice, because normally she would be eating humans.

I am friendly with all humans. I never eat one at all, I just focus on fishes and fruits. Just came from Horrorville after the whole tensions was defused.\" Koyuki replied just as she lets you onto the stone gritto, and then she goes and grabs a cookie from her jar and hands it to you. \"Want a cookie?\" Koyuki asked. \"No thank you, but thanks for asking.\" you replied, but Koyuki just gives it to you anyway. \"Seriously... take it, I heard you and the other giantesses beaten up Paisley, that girl who attacked the ambassador in Horrorville.\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not get into that.\" you replied. \"I think she deserves to be dead.\" Koyuki repled just as everyone laughs.</span></div></div>",

I hear there's a mermaid in these waters.\" \"Will you two quit arguing,\" says the boss of the ship, an elderly looking African man with a graying beard. \"Chuck, Diggs, make sure no one can see those barrels.

It tasted positively awful. Burp. Ugh. And it has made me absolutely gassy. I hope I never run into such putrid ooze again.\" You decide you've eaten enough humans for one day and decide to retreat back deep thousands of feet under the water. What those surface dwelling monsters didn't know was that there were a large number of mermaids near Gravefield Beach. You were just the only one to surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're swimming down a street of glowing coral, another mermaid swims up behind you. From the looks of it, she was a mermaid with the upper body of an African American woman and the tail of a parrot fish. She had long brown hair and was wearing a kelp bra as she glared at you. \"Paisley!\" she yells. \"I've got a bone to pick with you.\" \"What the devilfish do you want, Polly?\" \"Well,\" says the parrotfish mermaid. \"I had a date the other night with a Japanese sailor I met in the human world. He was a no-so and it's all your fault, I'm sure you ate him, you gluttonous bitch.\" \"How do you know it was me?\" \"It's always you! Every human ship that's come into these waters was sunk because of you.\" You let out a scoff. \"Bloody hell, Polly. I'm hardly the only mermaid who eats humans. There are plenty of other fish in the sea. Literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you swim off, Polly gives you a glare. \"I hate shark mermaids. They're always full of themselves.\" You ignore that parrotfish girl but then you let out a burp and hold your stomach. You then moan as you hear the sound like a shotgun. \"Bloody hell,\" you say. \"One of those yummies must've been packing a gun. How annoying. Those disgusting things give me indigestion. Perhaps some medicinal seaweed should settle my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swim into what appears to be a mermaid cafe. The proprietress was a mermaid wearing headphones and with long blackish blue hair and she had the tail of a koi fish. \"Musa,\" you say as the proprietress is locked in her music. \"Musa.\" The woman doesn't pay you any heed. \"Musa!\" you yell at the top of your lungs, startling the koi fish girl. \"Oh,\" says Musa. \"Paisley. Didn't see you there.\" \"Enough with the chit-chat, Musa,\" you say. \"Chop. Chop. Caesar Kelp salad.\" \"Salad?\" asks Musa as she gets to chopping. \"Don't you usually eat humans.\" There's a dark blonde haired goth girl swordfish mermaid with a dark blue tail and a long nose at the next table and she lets out a scoff. \"Humanity must be extinct by now with her appetite.\" \"Shut up.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMusa brings you your salad as another mermaid swims up to you. This one was an auburn haired and red tailed flying fish mermaid. \"Hello, Paisley.\" \"Skyler,\" you mutter. \"It never fails, I sit down for something to settle my stomach and in swims the one mermaid who can kill my appetite. Why don't you go to the bar and drink yourself to death?\" \"Cute,\" says Skyler mockingly. \"Have you caught Stephen yet?\" You let out a sigh as Musa gives you your salad and you dig into it. \"Roxy saved him against. Bloody gargoyle. If she were down here, I would shove my tail fin up her large and rather unflattering ass. There is a lavender skinned and yellow tailed mermaid resembling an overweight Asia woman at the counter who had the tail of a scorpionfish. She let out a laugh. \"That big yellow thing is a gargoyle? I thought she was a whale that learned how to fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Arachne,\" says the swordfish woman. \"I'm surprised Paisley isn't as big as that gargoyle with how much she eats.\" \"Gladys,\" says Paisley. \"Just because you haven't had a date in years doesn't give you the right to criticize me, so keep your large nose out of my affairs.\" Gladys let out a scoff as Arachne laughs and Skyler gives a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you let out a yawn as you swim into your seashell bed. \"That Gladys doesn't know what she's saying. I am nowhere near putting on weight.\" You yawn and go right to sleep. The next morning you let out a yawn but it takes you some effort to open your shell bed and then you groan as you swim out of bed. But as you do, you realize something and feel around your body. \"Sweet zombie Triton!\" you yell as you realize something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how, but now you're... </span></div></div>",

You just exposed the world to a virus that women morbidly obese.\" You just give  a gulp as you hold onto your third chin. \"Oh, bugger.\" \"Oh bugger is right, Paisley,\" says Gladys. \"It could take years for the world to recover. All around the monster world, that nebutori is going to be wreaking havoc.\" You bite your fingers because you realize that all around the monster world, nebutori will be flowing and causing all sorts of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Terrordale alone, the nebutori was flowing through the plumbing system. Inside one apartment, there was a brown furred cerberus girl who was very muscular. Her left head had a yellow highlight in her hair and was smiling, the center head had a red highlight in her hair and looked pissed off and the right head had a blue highlight and looked sad. The cerberus girl's left head was humming as the entire creature was in the shower. What none of the cerberus girl's three heads noticed was that her butt was rapidly expanding and even bumped against the shower door to make it crack. Elsewhere in Terrordale, there was a violet-skinned gargoyle women with short and spiky hair. She was dressed as a business woman and from the looks of it, she had Lactose Overload Syndrome. All it took was one sip of bottled water before the gargoyle businesswoman noticed that her breasts were expanding and in an attempt to hold up her already enormous breasts, rolls of fat grew on her back and were tearing at her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Horrorville, there was a blue-skinned heterochromial zombie girl wearing a pair of large horn-rimmed glasses in her pajamas who let out a yawn as she entered her bathroom and then wet her electric toothbrush to brush her teeth. As the water got into her mouth, her pajamas were looking tighter and tighter on her undead ass. Directly above there was a purple-skinned and very muscular cyclops in a jogging suit who was drinking water as she was getting ready to jog out. As she jogged out of the apartment building, she failed to notice her belly expanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the K.D.P. nearby, a bright red-skinned Jersey Devil woman with long pink hair was right outside sweeping up when a wave struck her and covered her in water. The Jersey Devil woman then looked down to see that her bikini looked like ti was tattooed on. As she was trying to figure out what was going on, she bumped into a python gorgon with brown scaly skin, a hook for a hand and an enormous rear that appeared to have gotten even bigger due to the nebutori right before the gorgon girl lost balance and fell down grunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe epidemic then spread to Fearfield as well. A bright yellow manticore girl in a gladiator style outfit was walking to work at Under Gloom when it started to rain. Before the manticore could open her umbrella, her belly started to expand and her thighs were so big that she hip-checked a tree and made it fall over. Also in the rain, there were three monster girls waiting for a bus, a gigantic purple-skinned succubus with yellow cat's eyes and a black business suit, an orange skinned neko-genie hybrid with purple hair worn in a ponytail and a belly dancer's outfit and an iara with green hair in a ponytail, silver fish scales covering her body, webbed hands, a dorsal fin and a giant butt. All three of them were getting noticeably larger as they were soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe epidemic even spread far away. In Dreadberry at a high school, there was a blue-skinned mer-lion who was drinking away at a nearby fountain and didn't seem to notice the water's effect on her. A teacher passed by her and from the looks of it, she was a heavy set mummy with tanned skin and Shiny Midnight Black hair wearing a red jacket and bright golden gauze. The mummy girl took a sip of coffee and didn't notice how loose her bandages were looking on her. Down the street, there was a red-skinned and pale blonde gremlin girl who was in a garage and from the looks of it had soaked herself with water as she was staggering away trying to pull up her pants. Her minotaur lower helped her but noticed that her pants looked tighter on her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in Screamtown, at the winer part of town, snowflakes were falling and several female monsters including a black-furred Nemean lioness, a sky blue hippogriff with rainbow hair and a cyan-skinned yeti dressed as a fortune teller, were expanding as they moved through the snow. At the summer part of Screamtown, a Hawaii-looking whale shark mermaid was swimming through the water when she heard a tearing sound and tried to fit her bra on her much fatter breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this wasn't even getting started with the horror that would be unleashed on Gravefield Beach.</span></div></div>",

You and Gladys swim overhead to see that hundreds of mermaids had been affected by the nebutori. \"Oh no.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne archerfish woman is blushing. From the looks of it, she was morbidly obese mostly in the stomach and a pilotfish merman, who you can see is her husband, is wrapped up in bandages down to his tail fin. There was a moray eel mermaid who was sweating as she was completely immobilized on the seabed and as she was trying to fan herself. There was even one porcupine fish policewoman who had a sour look on her face because her breasts and cheeks had puffed up so much that it looked as though they were as big as islands. \"Personally,\" you whisper to Gladys. \"I don't think it makes a difference with that porcupine fish cop.\" Gladys grabs you by a love handle and you swim back to Musa's bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you find that Musa had gotten so fat she was stuck between her bar counter and groaned as she tried to squeeze out. \"Damn this nebutori!\" yelled Musa. Musa then turned to see you and Gladys and gave a glare. \"Paisley!\" yells Musa. \"You gave me nebutori!\" \"Oh, please don't throw a tantrum over this, Musa. I didn't know this was going to happen.\" \"Can't breathe.\" You hear a voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and smirk as that flying fish snob, Skyler was three times as obese as you and was flat on her back. You and Gladys have to use all the effort you can to lift Skyler. \"I'd rather be dead than fat,\" groaned Skyler. \"This is torture.\" \"This is karma.\" You say to Skyler. Skyler grits her teeth but then Gladys's eyes pop out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paisley,\" she says. \"Something just occurred to me.\" You mutter as Gladys's boob pokes you in the face. \"The nebutori is in the water. The ocean flows to rivers and springs. That very same water leads to reservoirs in the surface world. Some of it even winds up in a bottle. Which means big trouble for the surface world.\" Your eyes pop as you hear about that. \"Oh shrimp.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, on the surface world, the nebutori is spreading like wildfire. Gladys said that it was irreversible and not contagious but it didn't matter about the latter part since the stuff was in the water. In Fearfield, there was a chalk white-skinned and blonde vampire girl, pear-shaped and with half a disfigured face taking a shower and humming to herself when she suddenly felt her butt and boobs expanding and let out a scream. In the woods near Horrorville, there was an ogopogo woman and a brocken specter woman on a hike. The Brocken specter girl wasn't breaking a sweat but the ogopogo was panting. \"Come on, Odile,\" says the specter girl as the ogopogo girl pauses to drink a bottle of water. \"Pick up the pace. \"Come on, Bettina,\" says Odile. \"You know I'm a water monster. I have to... ugh!\" Odile feels her stomach as it expands and accidentally tosses her water bottle on Bettina who instantly begins to bloat out, showing that the nebutori effects ghosts as well. In Terrordale downtown, it's raining and a werecoyote woman and werejaguar girl, both already somewhat pudgy walk out of the supermarket and as they're loading the car, the rain hits them and they both grunt in pain as they nebutori causes their stomaches and thighs to bulge out. Even way out in Panicburg, one Mngwa woman with an already titanic ass finds her rear bulging out of control as she's immobilized on the ground and shaking as her panties all but explode. All over the monster world, your mistake is wreaking havoc on the populous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack underwater, Gladys was shaking her head. \"You really futzed up this time Paisley. You had to screw the perch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

As you're both flying, you can hear the milk in Lascivite's breasts splashing around. She had Lactose Overload Syndrome and that made her breasts really big and fill with milk, albeit unable to lactate. The three of you fly down and find Stella sunbathing on the beach. \"Stella,\" says Roxy. \"Shouldn't you be working? Fran told us to keep an eye out for Paisley. She ate 300 humans yesterday.\" \"How is that my problem, lard butt?\" asks Stella. Lascivite shook her head. \"How did that fairy become a lifeguard anyway?\" \"Well it certainly wasn't built-in floatation devices.\" Says Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLascivite storms up to Stella to try and give her a peace of her mind just as Connie and Carmen came forward. Carmen was a yellow-orange furred dingo-like creature with purple hair called a bandersnatch and she was eating a burger as she walked towards the water. Your eyes were on Connie, the purple tailed, mocha-skinned BBW naga goth girl slithering with surfboard in hand. \"Hi Connie.\" You say. Connie smiles and waves at you. But Lascivite's eyes are on Carmen. \"Excuse me,\" says Lascivite. \"You shouldn't eat before going surfing.\" Carmen finishes her burger and lets out a laugh. \"That's a myth, Sheila,\" she says in her Australian accent. \"I think I'd know.\" Both Connie and Carmen paddle out as you look at Connie's swinging tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love to watch that reptile surf.\" You say. \"Guess who!\" yells a voice. You turn and see April walking forward, hips shaking as she holds a surfboard of her own. \"Oh no.\" You say. \"Good heavens, Stephen,\" says Roxy mockingly. \"It looks like your girlfriend, Stephen.\" \"Fatass smartass.\" You think in annoyance. As April walks forward, a large waves comes forward and splashes her, Stella and Lascivite as they all yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella spits out water as her sunglasses slide off and to her annoyance, April shakes like a dog to splash water all over the fairy. Lascivite lets out a laugh and so do you and Roxy. Stella just gives an angry pout while Connie and Carmen are riding the next wave. \"Here, Lascivite.\" Says Roxy as she hands the wet succubus a beach towel. \"Thanks Roxy.\" Lascivite takes the towel to dry herself when Roxy notices something strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Roxy?\" you ask as you sit on your gargoyle friend's shoulder. \"Uh,\" says Roxy. \"Lascivite, are your breasts getting bigger.\" Lascivite looks in confusion and then hears a ripping noise as she sees her bikini top ripping and her emerald breasts growing bigger. She gasps as waves splash. Now the milk in her breasts sounds like entire tidal waves. Lascivite falls to the ground as her thighs begin to expand as well and she screams. You let out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez!\" yells Roxy. Stella then lets out a groan herself as she feels her butt getting bigger and then she falls flat on it as she feels her bikini bottom getting tighter and she moans. \"Hey!\" yells April. \"Look at you, Stella. I never thought I'd see the day when your ass was bigger than mine. April then grunted because her already gargantuan butt was expanding as well and so was her belly and her breasts. Connie and Carmen looked on and gasped before they crashed into each other and fell into the water themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them crawl out (or slither in Connie's case) in curiosity. \"April?\" asks Carmen. \"Lascivite? Stella? What's..?\" Suddenly Carmen's belly started to expand and so did her cheeks as she let out a grunt. Connie's snake tail expanded and soon she was wobbling on her back. \"You gotta be kidding me!\" yells Connie. \"What's happening!? This can't be an allergic reaction, I haven't eaten a human in...\" Connie then muffled because her breast expanded and hit her in the mouth. Roxy has to rub her eyes to see what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. All the girls were getting exponentially fatter. Sure April and Connie were already fat but they were getting absolutely massive. They looked like they'd become even bigger than the already obese Roxy.

Stella and April had their butts to each other and they were equally large and were the biggest parts of both the fairy and the werewolf's bodies. \"What's happening to us!\" cries Stella over her multiple chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gadzooks!\" you yell. \"They're so big that they make you look small, Roxy.\" Roxy even pinched Stella's ass cheeks to the fairy's discomfort and poked Carmen in the belly to that bandersnatch's discomfort. \"But how?

She was an obnoxious jock that treated you like crap. The other was Hannah, a blue skinned long nosed tengu who liked to torture humans for fun.

It makes them extremely obese and lethargic.\" \"You mean it turns them into Roxy.\" says Stella bitterly. \"Ouch!\" Roxy literally kicks Stella's ass for that remark, there's enough of it that it would be impossible to miss. \"What a horrible disease,\" says Carmen. \"Getting fat without the work of eating. That's a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's boobs get so big she falls over and crashes on the ground. \"Oh,\" she says. \"The nightmare gets worse.

Stella is good friends with her.\" Roxy explained to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks for the reminder... say, maybe you and I should go on a date one day.\" and then Roxy just drops in love as you really ment it for her. \"Well no need, but heck... a date works great. I will see what I can do.\" she told you before she flies off. You are lucky to be in love with Roxy, as apparently she is \"really\" in love with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She's wearing a black two piece swimsuit that shows off her generous cleavage. She also has a large set of fangs, but fortunately for you she'd never use them on you. Lila didn't eat humans, but that's only because she was afraid of blood. Pretty strange for a vampire, but hey you're not complaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here?\" she asks brightly. \"Oh, just going for a swim. You know, getting some exercise.\" you answer. She lowers her head down to you and looks you over. \"Well you look kind of tuckered out, are you done?\" she asks cutely. \"I suppose.\" you say. \"Guess I kind of forgot how deep it can get for a human out here.\" She then straddles her surfboard and sits  up to her full height. \"Well, if you want, I could give you ride back to shore. Its not too far for me.\" Then her face lights up and she claps her hands together. \"Ooh! Or you can come out with me and surf a little!\" You do have a little time, and that might be fun. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

As she does this you cant help yourself from looking towards her bikini bottoms. Given her position, and the way she is straddling the board, there is little left to the imagination. Your heart begins to beat faster and your body begins to react to where your mind is going. \u201cAre you alright Steven? You\u2019ve got a 100 yard stare going on or something\u201d Lila asks.

You realize that this woman is a griffin, a hybrid between an eagle and a lion. The griffin rises from her towel and you notice her athletic build underneath her skimpy black bikini. In her hands she holds a drink. She approaches Lila and as she gets closer you notice that she is fairly short for a monster, around350 ft. as she gets closer you can see the griffin knows where you are and is forming a scheme. You shudder to imagine what it wants from you. Once she is near Lila the griffin suddenly trips and you are hit with a freezing liquid as the griffin goes down. Lila jumps back in shock as the griffins slush splashes all over her bikini bottoms, staining them red. \u201cI\u2019m sooo sorry\u201d the griffin says as she looks up at Lila \u201cIt was an accident\u201d. \u201cMan these were my favorite bottoms\u201d Lila wines \u201cnow they\u2019re ruined\u201d. She helps the griffin to her feet and the griffin makes her move. \u201cPerhaps we could just change bottoms. After all they both appear to be the same color, or at least were before I ruined yours\u201d Lila looks the griffin up and down and notices that they are indeed both wearing similar bikini\u2019s. \u201cI couldn\u2019t ask you to do that\u201d Lila says, \u201cIts no problem, I\u2019m the one who messed up\u201d the griffin replies \u201cMy name is Aella by the way\u201d. \u201cIf you insist\u201d Lila says, \u201cthis was my favorite bikini\u201d. \u201cFollow me, there\u2019s a changing station over here\u201d Aella says with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Lila and Aella are both in the changing station. Lila drops you and the bikini bottoms and wraps a towel around herself. From the tangled fabric you can make out Aella dropping her own bottoms but unlike Lila she makes no move to cover herself up. She hands the bottoms to Lila who graciously accepts them \u201cthanks again\u201d she says as she puts them on. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it\u201d Aella responds as she picks up the bottoms you are tangled in you try to cry out to Lila figuring that the monster you know is safer than the one you don\u2019t, however she doesn\u2019t seem to hear you. From your vantage point you notice that Aella\u2019s bottoms are more than a little snug on Lila\u2019s voluptuous form however she doesn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cWell I have some surfing to do\u201d she says as she walks out of the tent, \u201cThanks again\u201d and with that she is gone. Above you the griffin chuckles to herself as she tosses the bikini bottoms, and you, onto the bench. She straddles the bench giving you a nice view of her pussy; you feel warmth spreading to your face as you blush at the sight. \u201cWell well well, what have we here? A small human looking to get lucky it would seem. It\u2019s a good thing I happened to notice you, otherwise you may have taken advantage of that poor girl.\u201d \u201cI would never do that\u201d you say as begin to struggle again, \u201cLila is my friend\u201d \u201csome way to treat your friend\u201d she says causing you to stop mid sentence. \u201cIt was a mistake, I got stuck there on accident\u201d you say. \u201cYou don\u2019t look stuck to me\u201d she says. And you realize that your struggling has finally freed you from the bikini. \u201cNow your going to do something for me human, to make amends for your transgressions.\u201d She leans back on the bench and appears to ponder the options. Once she has come to a decision she leans forward and says \u201cyour going to sate my. . .\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before long you feel her tongue raise and force you into her throat. The moist tunnel presses you downward slowly as you hear a load gulp.

She had brown hair worn in a regal medieval style and a purple two-piece bikini bearing a coat of arms on one of the breasts. The frog and Lila wave to each other as they're about to pass each other but what Lila didn't notice was that the frog woman noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now very afraid because that was a werefrog that spotted you and you did NOT feel like getting eaten today.

You shut your eyes and wait for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do land, but not on water. You instead hit something solid. Opening your eyes, you're surprised to see that the water has suddenly frozen over. You landed on a patch of soft ice. Thanking you luck that you didn't turn into a stain, you slowly stand up, amazed at how you didn't break anyhting. You see that the wave has frozen too, and Lila is staring at it, confused. You turn and see a bizarre sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of you was a 900 foot tall person in a bulky, black mechanical suit with transparent tubes, which had a light-blue liquid. You look up further and see a glass dome helmet, allowing you to see who save you properly. It was a female werewolf with brown eyes. She didn't have any fur or hair, exposing her light blue skin. Looking behind her, you see a path of solid ice leading back to shore. You were truly baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange werewolf picked you up. You shivered in her hand. \"Are you alright?\" She asked, sounding like she was speaking through a phone.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" You say. \"Who are you? I don't think I've seen you on the beach before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Andrea Kennick.\" She replies. \"This is the first time I've been to the beach. I saw you fall off her board and ran over to save you. Guess my condition is good for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila got off her board and looked at Andrea, confused. \"Wait, we're a ways away from shore. How did you see Stephen, AND get over here so fast? And how did you freeze the water? And what condition? And-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" Andrea yelled. Lila promptly shut her mouth. \"First, werewolves have keen senses and are pretty fast. As for the other two... You ever heard of that comic character Mr. Freeze. Well, I have a genetic mutation that's like that. My body is such that I cannot leave a sub-zero environment or I'll die. That's why I wear this suit. The coolant running through this suit keeps my body below zero. And it made so anything I touch freezes solid. And no I don't know how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused. You never heard of something like this. \"Wait, if you can't survive out of sub-zero, why are you at a beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may not be able to feel the sun without dying, but that doesn't mean I can't see the ocean.\" Andrea replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Anyway we should get back to shore. Roxy and Fran are going to want to know what happened.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you.\" Lila says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, do you mind if I take him?\" Andrea asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you go with.</span></div></div>",

What exactly is it?\" You decide to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctors think are not exactly sure.\" Andrea replied. \"My body temperature is far lower that it should be. Last I checked, my body temp was -50 degrees. If I go in a location above 0 degrees, my body goes into heat shock. I only have a couple of minutes to get to a sub-zero environment before I die of heat stroke. However, I have a coolant delivery system implanted in my body. It keeps coolant circulating in me even without my suit. It only lasts a few hours, though, so I still need my suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" You reply. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. When I go out, I need every piece of my suit. If even one part is missing, I'm doomed. And I need to replace the coolant containers every few days. As for freezing what I touch, they don't have a clue. The suit keeps that in check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you have a hard life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea stays silent for a moment. \"I do. I have very few friends, because who wants to hang out with a freak like me? People often call me \"Ms. Freeze\". I hate that name. The friends I do have are understanding. I can't have pets or else they freeze, and I've only ever had one lover. You can guess what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reach shore. Roxy and Fran are waiting there, wanting to know what happened. You explain everything to them. That seems to satisfy them, and they walk off. When they do, you ask Andrea the time. She tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my shifts up.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Andrea replies. \"If that's so, I can show you my apartment. I live alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you accept the offer?</span></div></div>",

You swim towards the surface as fast as you can, realizing that you're in deeper water now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully you make it out before you suffocate.

There has got to be somebody around here who could help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to see that there are exactly three lifeguards on duty, all of them female. First of them was a big red sphinx girl with blonde hair. She was huge and obese and like all sphinxes, she walked on all fours. The sphinx woman was flying overhead as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second lifeguard was a blue skinned behemoth girl. She was a monster resembling a hippopotamus with skin as thick as a dinosaur. She was even larger body mass wise than Roxy and had an unusual hair style that was half red on one side and half blonde on the other. The behemoth woman looked up and smiled at the sphinx flying around. \"Come down for air once and a while Kylie,\" says the behemoth girl. \"I can take over patrol for you.\" The sphinx flies down and then licks her paw. \"I'd like that very much Dominique,\" she says to the big behemoth girl. \"But one question, where's Elaine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see the third lifeguard coming out. She was a yellow skinned wereseal resembling an elephant seal. She also had silver hair worn in a bob cut and snorted as she dripped seawater and snot from her nose. \"No damage here girls.\" She said. Kylie lets out a sigh. \"Elaine. Wipe your nose please.\" Elaine blushes and then rubs her nose before the three lifeguards walk off in different directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow's your chance.

From the looks of it it had to be five hundred feet tall at least. Just when you swim close to the sands of Horrorville, the monster surfaces. It is a girl monster, apple figured in shape and with bright blue skin and long blonde hair. She had scales on her belly and a fish's tail, but she had hooves for feet and the face of a horse. You've heard of this time of monster. It was a kelpie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kelpie flips her hair and takes a deep breath as she switches from gills to lungs and walks forward. Then you realize something. This kelpie, you never met her, but you've heard of her from Roxy. Roxy told you that her name was Aqua and she lived in the same apartment complex as her little sister Petra. You had never met Petra either, but Roxy told you if you got into trouble in Horrorville, it would be the best idea to find her. Fortunately Aqua lived on the same floor as Petra. This was some good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you remember Roxy also telling you that Petra's apartment was extremely dangerous to humans for two reasons. Petra's landlady was a mummy by the name of Nefernina and from what Roxy said she was <i>the worst person she'd ever met</i>. The woman was a total control freak and hated humans with a passion. Almost every one of the tenants hate her guts (or would if they hadn't been cut out and placed in jars). Roxy even told you that they should've nailed that bitch's sarcophagus shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only danger. There was a werewolf named Lupa that patrolled the halls. Lupa was nothing like April, the one werewolf you knew, the only werewolf you knew was friendly towards humans. Lupa loved humans, but unlike April, she loves them as food. Roxy told you that Lupa was so gluttonous she'd make it a priority to devour every human she sees. And since she could get you on land too, that made her worse than Paisley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember that that apartment is filled with monsters from <i>Horrorville</i>. You had just washed up from <i>Terrordale</i>. You don't know why, but Terrordale and Horrorville have had a vicious rivalry since the twin cities were first formed and monsters from either side hated each other with a passion. If the monsters in that apartment found out you were from Terrordale, they might tear you apart. And from the sound of it, the monsters in that apartment included a gorgon, a manticore, a yeti, a thunderbird, a banshee and a fire genie among others. None of those sounded like the kind of monster you'd want pissed off at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Aqua was a possible hazard. You heard kelpies were predators to humans and Roxy said she didn't know whether or not Aqua was a maneater. What do you do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: This time use the monsters that <i>aren't</i> part machine)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured that Aqua didn't need to know what was going on. So as the titanic kelpie steps forward and lets out a sigh, you make a run for it to avoid getting stepped on. You run up towards her beach towel and duck into a pocket on her titanic flower printed jacket. Aqua takes her towel and dries herself off as she takes a deep breath and closes her gills. \"That's enough ocean for one day,\" she said. \"Back to the apartment.\" You duck deeper into Aqua's pocket as she puts on her jacket and takes her surfboard and begins to walk back towards Horroville, towards Monster Arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver at the thought, you were in Horrorville and headed towards an apartment complex housing at least twenty monsters. Monsters that might not take kindly to seeing a human lifeguard from Terrordale, their hated rival city. You wonder if you'll even be able to reach Petra without getting torn to bits. Come to think about it, you had never even met Petra before. You had no idea what she looked like because Roxy didn't show you a picture of her yet. Well given that she was Roxy's sister, she was obviously a gargoyle so that gave you a clue and from what Roxy said, Petra was the only gargoyle in Monster Arms. Logically if you find a gargoyle, you'll find Petra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty five minutes later you hear a door turning and you peak out to see Aqua has reached the apartment complex known as Monster Arms. You gulp. You were about to venture into the hornet's nest. You don't know the monsters in this building, for all you knew, this could be a house of monsters as mean as Stella or even Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAqua walks into the building and you look around to see some of the walls were beginning to decay and the wallpaper was coming loose. You shake your head. This Nefernina woman sure did a shoddy job keeping this place together. Then you hear stomping a see a monster come from the mailroom and hide back into Aqua's pocket. The monster was a crimson skinned manticore woman with purplish hair. She was very obese, looked even moreso that Roxy and was wearing a black shirt and blue jeans as she was carrying a newspaper upstairs. The manticore also coughed slightly and held onto her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Astrid,\" says Aqua. \"That flu isn't getting any better is it.\" Astrid just makes a sniveling noise. \"No, Chel said it would take a few days to get better. How's the beach doing without me.\" Huh. Astrid must've been a lifeguard at the beach you washed up on. Aqua lets out a laugh. \"They're missing a good lifeguard. Can't wait to have you back.\" \"Thanks.\" \"By the way. How'd you get the flu anyway Astrid? Isn't it a human disease. As far as I know, you don't even eat humans and you're a manticore.\" Astrid rolls her eyes and looks around. \"I'd rather not say.\" She said weakly.\" As Astrid walks up stairs, you see her moon sized cheeks shaking along with her large scorpion's tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she said was obviously a cover up for something but you didn't care as long as Aqua was walking upstairs. As soon as she reaches the top, you were going to run out and find whichever apartment Petra lived at. Roxy said Petra knew about you and you're certain she'd help you back to Terrordale without her neighbors tearing you a new hole for trespassing into Horrorville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Aqua is walking upstairs, you hear footsteps behind her. \"Uh-oh.\" You say. The monster following Aqua was a giant gorgon girl with gray skin, black cobras for hair and a pair of yellow sunglasses to keep from petrifying anyone who looked her in the face. \"Oh hi Georgia,\" says Aqua. \"How was the art contest.\" Georgia's snake hair hisses loudly and you cower in Aqua's pocket. Georgia is in a bad mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That white furred bag of Terrordale flea bait!\" she yelled. Georgia must've been talking about Kath, a weretiger painter who visited Gravefield beach on a regular basis to get some fresh air as she worked on her masterpieces. \"I stayed up all night working on an iron sculpture of Echidna herself,\" says Georgia as she grits her teeth. \"And that bitch from Terrordale wins with a painting of a bunch of turtle skeletons! Lousy Terrordale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that Georgia. Gotta go.\" \"No,\" says Georgia. \"We need to talk. Remember the five skulls I loaned you three weeks ago?\" Aqua lets out a laugh as you cover your ears. \"Oh yeah, thanks gorgon duddette, I was short on the rent that day. If it weren't for you, Cleofatra would've thrown me out.\" You actually laugh at that joke. That must've been the tenants' nickname for Nefernina. Cleofatra. That's clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia then makes her hair hiss and shake and Aqua gets the message. \"Oh. Don't worry Georgia. I ain't no deadbeat. I've got the cash.\" Then you realize something. You're standing in the pocket where Aqua keeps her wallet. \"Crap!\" you yell. Aqua's hand reaches in and you tremble and try to run. If Aqua grabs you, she'll realize you stowed away. And if Georgia finds out you're from Terrordale, even if she was normally friendly towards humans, you'd be in big trouble. But can you get out of the way as Aqua reaches for her wallet?</span></div></div>",

You see, this morning I was working as a lifeguard at the beach there, I went out for a swim, and then suddenly a wave takes me to Horrorville, and I ended up in the beach there.

Man why don't your idiots from Horrorville understand this?\" you said, stressed out of your current situation that you are in right now, and you are just hoping you can get out of it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard about.... THE DAY?\" Aqua asked you. \"No, I never did.\" you replied to her with complete honestly, and then Aqua decides to explain it to you. \"Originally both sides of the city were together, and everything was just completely peaceful. Terrordale had a more summerly and spring fill, and we have the more winter and fall feel, and the two sides supported each other, and everything was peaceful, and then suddenly one day... a monster like us was killed by one of their kind, and then suddenly they accused us that one of their monsters were killed by one of us, and it was all true. Ever since that day we never trusted those folks, and they don't trust us, and that also applies to every human that lives here today in both cities. That is why we don't tolerate people from your city.\" Aqua finally explained to you just as she tightens her grip again, getting you even closer to choking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why not apologize and just let me.....\" you said before you decide it wouldn't be worth the effort to explain every single detail again as you know that they just wouldn't believe you anyway. \"You know what.... forget it, go on ahead and kill me.\" you told them, knowing that it was over for you and your life. You look into Georgia's eyes, and then just like all stories with Medusa, your body turns into complete rock and you couldn't move at all, and then eventually you turn completely into stone. Aqua then crushes you and you shattered completely in bones. Well, guess all that trouble to explain to them was all for nothing, and now it has cost you your life. \"Well, that is now taken care of. I apologize for this, you can go as an apology.\" Georgia said to her, deciding to let her go and not have to suffer anymore with the human, but the kelpie girl finds the bones in her pocket and gives it to Georgia. \"Here it is now. It's enough to pay for it.\" Aqua told her, now paying Georgia. \"Thanks. See ya.\" Georgia said before she goes back to her room and then Aqua goes off with her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen is now dead sadly thanks to the two monsters. Man it looks like the cities will never be rekindling any time soon.</span></div></div>",

Aqua walks up the stairs just as a muscular purple Cyclops girl is jogging past her. \"Hi Aqua.\" Says the cyclops. \"Hey Irene,\" says Aqua. \"Watch out for.\" Suddenly you hear a crash and cover your ears. \"Ow.\" Says Irene nonchalantly. Obviously the cyclops fell down the stairs, but her muscular body could probably take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you. You were on the top floor in an apartment building in Horrorville full of monsters that hated Terrordale (Petra excluded). You let out a sigh. \"Come on, Petra, come out.

This must've been Petra, Roxy's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't believe what you see. Petra had bright orange skin and long white hair reaching down to her tail. While Roxy could best be described as a BBW, her sister wasn't fat at all and instead had a shocking hourglass figure, but what really surprised you was how tall she was. Aqua only reached up to Petra's knees. That gargoyle girl had to be 1000ft tall. Sure, she was Roxy's younger sister, but she definitely wasn't her \"little\" sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Petra walks towards her own apartment with her mail, you rub your eyes.

Chihiro shivered. \"They had tanks. \"I retreated into the ocean and eventually came to Gravefield Beach. A weretigress painter, Kath, she told me you were looking for extra help.\" \"Good old Kath.\" You say with a smile. \"It must be hard being a hybrid creature in a world of monsters. Chihiro let out a sigh and then smiled. \"I think I'm doing well for myself. I'm only a year old.\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"I'd never tell.\" Chihiro laughed and swung her large tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what happens?</span></div></div>",

This woman had to be around 950 feet tall. She had forest green skin, long purple hair and purple eyes. You saw that she had an athletes body with a slim stomach, toned butt and long legs. But your eyes were drawn to her breasts. They were gargantuan, almost the size of her body. You were surprised that they weren't touching the ground, wondering how she could even lift them, let alone walk. You got you answer when you saw her spade tail and horns: she was a succubus. She was wearing a purple bikini and had sunglasses on the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFran cleared her throat, snapping you back to reality. \"Stephen, this is Lascivite. She is your new co-worker and will working at the rental hut. I want you to show her around the beach\" She told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You replied. Then you walked over to Lascivite. \"Mind picking me up so we can start the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\" She said in a thick French accent. You detected an air of coldness in her voice. She bent over, picked you up, and place you on her shoulder. You thought you heard a sloshing sound come from her breasts when she picked you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLascivite started out the door, but Fran stopped her. \"Wait, Lascivite. I just wanted to make sure your... condition won't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you,\" Lascivite snapped \"My breasts may grow and produce milk, but I can't lactate at all.

She is your new boss after all.\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My breasts are my pride and joy. I get defensive about them.\" She answered.

First is Phoebe, a pyromaniac phoenix harpy.\" Lascivite gives a gulp upon hearing that. \"Then,\" you say. \"There's the bipolar spriggan, Eunice.\" Lascivite shivers at that as her milk shakes in her breasts. \"And then there's Natasha, a black widow drider who thinks she's a pirate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLascivite gets more nervous by the second. \"A lot of these patients sound really bad,\" she says. \"You don't a lifeguard, you need an army.\" \"Well,\" you say. \"There's one who isn't as bad as the others.

For obvious reasons, she only showed up at night or when it was particularly cloudy. She was a very good vampire who looked like a monster version of a doll. But she was a poor excuse for a vampire. You remember having to calm her down when she cut her foot on a piece of glass as Roxy tended to the wound. How a vampire survived so long without drinking one drop of blood is beyond you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was that bandersnatch Carmen. She was always goofy around and making the other surfers laugh. But she had quite an appetite on her and was often seen hanging around Mesa's grill. You're afraid that she might see a human as a tasty snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother girl you remember a lot more fondly is Connie.

Maybe she was so friendly because she couldn't eat you. Humans make her swell up like a balloon, more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was one you really didn't like, that show boating baku Reimu. She hates humans for some reason and is always treating you like you weren't there. One time she even sat on you. You're lucky the beach cushioned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one surfer you didn't want to run into was Hannah, that sadistic blue tengu girl. You've seen her torture humans in the worst possible way. You swear you once saw her setting a human on fire. Lifeguard or not, Hannah would probably treat you no better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you're walking you hear footsteps getting closer towards you.

She was wearing her black lipstick and her long hair had indigo highlights that matched her snake like eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor clothing she was wearing nothing more than a scaly bluish purple bra and was holding onto a skull print surfboard. Connie flickered out her forked tongue before looking right down on you. \"Hey there Stephen.\" She said. \"H-Hi-Hi Connie.\" You mutter nervously.

Lifeguard as you know. I may be a human but I... I'm very good at looking.\" Connie let out a hissing laugh as you saw her breasts and belly jiggle like balloons. \"You know little guy,\" she says. \"You're lucky I'm not like other nagas. Most naga girls would gulp down a tiny morsel like you without a second thought. If I did that I'd swell up like a pufferfish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a nervous laugh. The reason why Connie was so friendly around humans was because her allergies made it so she couldn't eat them. Of course that implies she's eaten humans before.

You realize this could only be one monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Carmen, a gigantic bandersnatch, a monster resembling a dingo/fox hybrid with long thick fur. Carmen was a surfer and well liked by the others, even Reimu and Baku because she was someone of a jokester. But you tried to avoid her. As demonstrated with the chips she was crunching on as she walked froward, Carmen had an appetite that could put a minotaur's to shame. You mostly see her at Mesa's grill and stacked up enough plates for a human to build a skyscraper to reach to the sun. It was a wonder that she wasn't three times as big as a sumo wrestler by now. Presumably it all went to her large chest. That scared you. Carmen would eat anything and you weren't sure if that included humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't Carmen's appetite you were most concerned with at the moment because Carmen almost stepped on you. \"Carmen!\" you yell. \"Wait!\" Carmen stops and munches a few more chips before she looks down, sees you and steps back. \"Sorry about that Stephen mate,\" says the bandersnatch in her Australian accent. \"I sometimes forget that one of the lifeguards is the size of a crumb. Speaking of which.\" Carmen then picks up that chip she dropped on you and eats it. \"It's lucky for you I stopped when I did.\" \"Yeah, I was almost crushed.\" \"Not that mate, you'd have dropped dead from my foot stench first. These things are rank enough to start the Bubonic Plague anew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a laugh at Carmen's joke. \"You going surfing?\" you ask. \"Don't you have to wait an hour after eating.\" Carmen lets out a laugh. \"That's a myth Stephen and besides, I already checked the ingredients. These chips weren't made from Devil Fruit.\" You laugh again before Carmen finishes her snack and throws the bag into the trash. Then she stops herself. \"I wonder what Mesa's cooking,\" she said. \"That's my third bag and I've still got the munchies. If I had a tapeworm I'd have eaten him by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can giggle this time, you tug on the tip of the bandersnatch woman's tail. \"Uh Carmen, I have a question I've been meaning to ask since I met you.\" \"What's that mate?\" asks the bandersnatch. You shiver as you get ready to ask the question. \"Well, since you seem to like eating just about anything, I was wondering... what do you think of humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen opens her mouth wide to show her terrifyingly sharp teeth before she gives you her answer.</span></div></div>",

Why single out you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause you're small enough to carry.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" You were a little hurt by that. \"I'm not sure. I'm needed here at the beach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice, Tiny. I already cleared it with Boss lady. You're coming with me, like it or not.\" She explained curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're face fell. The choice was already made for you. \"Fine. When do we leave?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After work.

So you just shut your mouth as Lascivite started the car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Lascivite, the meeting was in Fearfield. You didn't exactly know how far it was, your best guess being 4-7 hours. So you were in for a long ride. The first hour was quiet, neither you nor Lascivite talking. Then, after another 20 minutes, you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you a question?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you end up working at Gravefield?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLascivite sighed. \"I wasn't well liked. Got held back in school. Got to college and things were no better. When I graduated college, my LOS kicked in. Made things worse. Couldn't get any jobs. So I moved to America. Found the beach. End of story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a bit bad.

You let out a gulp. You knew Mesa all too well. She was a large and fat minotaur resembling a brown and white ayshire cow with an udder as big as her head and long curly brown hair. Usually, Mesa was very friendly towards you. Although she did joke about one day cooking you and serving you to the next hungry monster girl to come forward. But you had a thought. Maybe she was being serious. After all, there were tons of monster species that eat humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah walks up to the grill and bangs on the counter. \"Hey Mesa! You here!\" You hear the sound of a bell and Mesa gets up as her udder shakes up and down. \"Oh, hi Hannah. What can I do you for?\" Hannah gives a fiendish smile and places you on the table. Mesa is surprised to see you, but then she smiles wickedly, a face you had never seen before on the cow woman you thought was your friend. \"Well, what have we here? Out a little early aren't we Stephen.\" \"Now, now Mesa,\" you say. \"Don't do anything rash. I'm your fr.... Ah!\" Mesa picks you up and then licks you, causing you to twitch. \"Mmm. He's just as delicious as I thought he'd be. So Hannah? How do you want him? Fried, boiled?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gives a vicious smile. \"Oh, it's not for me,\" she says as she places a roll of skulls on the table. \"I have someone special in mind for this human.\" You let out a gulp. Something tells you that it will be just as much torture for whoever eats you as you. \"Ah,\" says Mesa. \"Good. And I'll cook him without killing him. Humans always taste best when they're alive.\" Mesa even licks her lips and you squirm as she swings her udder and walks up to the grill. \"Please Mesa, don't do this. I'm a lifeguard here.\" \"Sorry Stephen, but humans are at the bottom of the food chain. So Hannah, who's the lucky girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gives a vicious look.

They were going to cook you and serve you to Roxy, your own partner. But Mesa lets out a sigh. \"Are you kidding Hannah. Sure Roxy's a big eater, you don't get a huge gut like that for nothing, but she doesn't eat humans. Heck, gargoyles that actually eat humans are as scarce as brains in Fran's head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gives an evil laugh. \"Well, Roxy doesn't have to know.\" \"Aha,\" says Mesa with a mooing laugh. \"Good thinking. Maybe I'll ever turn her onto human meat.\" \"Please Mesa,\" you say. \"You're my friend. Don't do this.\" But Mesa shakes her head. \"I'm sorry Stephen, but I have to serve anyone who's hungry. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll make Roxy's belly very happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa walks forward and then holds you over a vat of frying grease and you're sweating in fear before Mesa sniffs you. \"You should consider this an honor sweetie.\" Mesa drops you screaming into the grease and you scream as the hot golden liquid burns your skin. Mesa shakes the vat and you try to swim out but the tide of the grease is too strong. You're shaken about and you nearly drown before Mesa pulls you out. Your entire body is covered in third degree burns. Mesa then literally rubs salt in the wounds by spraying you with cooking oil and making you scream. All while Hannah is watching and laughs like a maniac at your pain. That blasted tengu. \"If I survive this Hannah!\" you shout. \"You're banned from Gravefield Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa finishes by seasoning you with some salt in pepper. You were amazed that you were still alive, but your burns were so severe that you could barely move. Finally, Mesa places you on a burger made from dinosaur meat and douses you were burning spicy mustard as you scream. Finally Mesa covers you with the other bun and then kisses her own palm. \"Congratulations Stephen,\" says Mesa. \"You're about to be part of a masterpiece.\" \"Oh man,\" says Hannah. \"I can't wait to see the look on Roxy's face when I tell her she ate her partner.\" Mesa blows on her finger and Hannah takes her seat at the bar as Roxy comes forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Roxy,\" says Hannah. \"How are you doing this morning?\" Roxy gives Hannah a glare. \"Hannah,\" she mumbles. \"I hope for your sake you've been leaving Stephen alone. Mesa, have you seen Stephen? He wasn't home when I opened the fire cabinet this morning. Sometimes I think he forgets  how dangerous this beach is.\" You try to call out to Roxy but Mesa shoves down on the bun. \"Oh don't worry,\" says Mesa. \"I'm sure he'll turn up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy then looks at the burger not knowing you're in it and licks her lips. \"Is that anyone's burger.\" \"Actually,\" says Mesa. \"It's yours. Free of charge.\" \"Thanks Mesa.\" Says Roxy as she doesn't notice Hannah laughing evilly. You look out of the burger to see Roxy's yellow fingers grabbing it by the side and then you start to crawl out and look out to see Roxy's mouth open wide to show her gargoyle fangs. What a cruel irony, thanks to the machinations of that evil tengu, your own best friend is going to eat you. You're smothered in the bun but you have to call out to her to let her know you're in the burger. \"Roxy!\" you yell. \"It's me Stephen! Whatever you do!

It sounds like it's still alive. \"Roxy lifts the top bun off the burger, and gasps when she sees your emaciated form. \"Sweet mother of Echidna! Stephen, what happened to you?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still in agonizing pain, and can barely speak. All you manage to say is \"Hannah...Mesa...\" before you passed out from the pain. When you awake, you find yourself in a body cast in a miniature bed at the local hospital, Roxy sitting by your side. \"Thank goodness.\" She says with a sigh of relief \"I was beginning to think you died.\" You can't move or speak, not because you physically couldn't, but because the cast ceasing your body covered everything except your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably want to know what happened while you were out.\" Says Roxy. \"After I almost ate you, I flew you here as fast as possible. Once you were admitted, I went back to the beach and told Fran what happened. Needless to say, she wasn't happy. She fired Mesa from her job, and I pulled some strings with my sis to have Hannah arrested.\" That news pleased you greatly. You always thought Mesa was your friend, but instead she betrayed you, and put you through unimaginable pain. You never want to see her again. As for Hannah, you hope she gets the death penalty, or at least life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Roxy's face turns grim. \"Stephen, I have some bad news. Your body was so badly burned you didn't even look human anymore. They had to do a skin graft on you. Seeing as there are no humans nearby, they had to find a doner.\" Proxy very carefully unwraps the bandages around your head and holds up a tiny mirror in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose skin do you have?</span></div></div>",

You see Roxy smiling down at you and then see that there's a large bandage on Roxy's neck. \"Roxy,\" you say in surprise. \"That...\" \"Oh,\" says Roxy. \"Don't worry. It'll grow back. I'd give anything to save my best friend from death's door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh as you look up at Roxy and feel around your body. For the rest of your life you'd have the skin of a gargoyle. Even though it was just grafted on, it already felt tight on you and appears to have started setting in. You feel your leg however and moan before Roxy waves her hand and hisses slightly. \"I don't think you should be moving around too much. Fran told me to tell you not to come to work until that skin has fully set.\" You let out a moan. \"Thanks Roxy,\" you say. \"Ow. I can still feel the burns. Hopefully your skin won't be as appetizing to certain predators.\" Roxy lets out a laugh. \"Good luck eating you now. Gargoyles aren't edible. Not even cannibals would touch us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to get up but Roxy gently picks you up and places you in her cleavage. \"I better take you home,\" she says. \"Wait. I don't think you should be at the beach for a few days in your condition. Why don't I take you back home to my house.\" You nod your head. \"I'd like that Roxy. You're a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after you both leave the hospital, Roxy is flying through the air with you in her cleavage. Your new skin is slightly itchy, but you can't complain. But that experience was scary. You were almost eaten and by Roxy of all people. If you hadn't screamed, your best friend would've devoured you and never have known about it. You'd have perished in Roxy's stomach. Thank goodness she had good ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Roxy reaches her house, which is a really nice looking place on top of a cliff, she unlocks the door and you both go inside. Roxy places you on a table as she walks into the kitchen. \"I'll bet you're starving after that harrowing ordeal,\" your gargoyle friend says. \"I'll go make dinner.\" You smile. \"Okay, but nothing grilled please.\" As Roxy is busy cooking you see a photograph on her table. Roxy was in it as well as two other gargoyles, namely her younger sisters Petra and Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra, the sister who arrested Hannah, was a tall orange skinned gargoyle who had to be 1000ft tall. She looked to be in better shape than either of her sisters given her hourglass figure and massive breasts. She also had long white hair that you wouldn't expect from a girl her age. Then again you didn't know how old Roxy exactly was; she looked like she was in her twenties, but monsters have longer lifespans than humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other gargoyle, Janet was a bright red gargoyle with purple hair worn in a ponytail. She was pear shaped but still considered very attractive by monster standards. You heard from Roxy that Janet was working at a summer camp for girls this time of year. What you found surprising however was that from the photograph, both Roxy's sisters were taller than she was. Ironic given Roxy was the oldest. Though she was obviously the heaviest of the sisters. Not that you'd say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roxy is busy, you're busy feeling your new skin. It feels great and you got to spend a few days with Roxy recovering from the burns. Stupid Mesa and stupid Hannah. You hope you don't see either of them again.</span></div></div>",

She has to duck to get in the door, and when she stands back up she's way taller than her sister. \"Hey sis, just wondering how you're doing.\" Petra says as she walks in. The ground shakes even more than usual because of her massive size. \"I'm okay, its Stephen that needs time to recover.\" Roxy answers. \"Yeah, I figured. Losing your skin's gotta be awful. It was really good of you to give him yours though.\" Petra says. \"Still, almost eating your best friend's gotta hurt a little.\" Roxy looks down. \"Yeah, just thinking about it makes me feel guilty. I was so close to killing him.\" she says. \"Roxy, you saved me!\" you call from your spot. Petra looks over at you and walks over. She bends over to get a closer look, her massive eye looming overhead. \"Oh you're the one!\" she says. \"How's the new skin?\" She gently touches you with one of her huge claws. Much like Roxy she's very gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He needs to keep from moving around until it sets, but he'll be fine.\" Roxy says as she walks over. Having the two gargoyle sisters hovering over you is a bit embarrassing. They're both very attractive and their breasts are practically filling your vision. \"I think something might have gone wrong, his yellow's looking a little strange.\" Petra notices. As a matter of fact you're just blushing, which Roxy picks up on. \"Oh, he's just a little overwhelmed from having two girls like us so close.\" she says with a smirk. \"Well you do have a generous figure Roxy.\" Petra says with a slight smile. Roxy glares at her but doesn't lose her cool. Guess she knows not to try and mess with her sister. Must be tough with her being the older one. \"Seriously though, I thought Connie was the girl for you.\" Roxy says with a fake lovey dovey voice. You frown at her, making her laugh. Its true that you're in love with Connie but this whole situation has you thinking. Maybe you should try some other options. A near death experience will do that to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I was just making dinner, so stay Petra.\" Roxy tells her sister. She then walks back to the kitchen, with you staring at her butt. Just because you might start looking at other girls doesn't mean you'll go straight for Roxy, but you can't deny she's a definite possibility. Petra sits down near the table you're on. \"So how does the new skin feel?\" she asks. \"Its a little itchy, I hope it sets soon. Other than that its not so bad.\" you answer. \"From what i can feel it actually seems tougher.\" Petra chuckles. \"Well we gargoyles are very thick skinned. It helps when you have to protect people. In your case though it'll help against predators.\" she says. You can't believe you're actually having a conversation with such an imposing monster. When Roxy finishes dinner she comes to pick you up. As she carries you to the table you get a look at Petra's butt. Its not as big as Roxy's but its still very nice. Then...</span></div></div>",

You are sat down next Roxy's plate as the two off them begin eating. \"Here Stephen.\" Roxy says, tearing off a piece of her steak. Looking up you see her lowering it toward you, but your eyes are drawn to her breasts. When the scrap of meat lands next to you Petra chuckles from across the table. \"Looks like you made it too big.\" she says, pointing to you with her fork. It really is about twice your height. As Roxy tears a smaller piece Petra notices you staring at her sister. A small grin forms on her face and she takes a bite of her meal. \"So Roxy, exactly how close are the two of you?\" she asks, putting her normal serious face back on. \"Thats a weird question out of nowhere.\" Roxy answers. \"He's practically my best friend. He's certainly the only one around the beach I can actually hang out with a keep my sanity.\" You look up as you chow down on some meat. \"Well if worse comes to worse the KDP's right next door.\" you joke. She chuckles and taps you on the head. \"What about you Stephen?\" Petra probes further. You ponder for a second before answering. \"Well, I gotta say I'm closer to her than anyone else around here.\" you answer. \"When Fran found me on the beach I was scared of everything at first, but then I found out Roxy would be watching out for me. I was psyched to have a gargoyle around since they're so reliable, but eventually we just sort of hit it off.\" Roxy holds out a claw, which you slap for a high five. \"Best lifeguards around!\" she says. \"Yeah, and she's really...\" you stop before you finish you were about to say something weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? She's what?\" Petra asks, fixing her gaze on you. Roxy looks down quizzically. \"She's well, really attractive.\" you say. Roxy laughs and bops you on the head. \"Look I know you like big girls, but I'm not your type.\" she says, then turns to her sister. \"He's got the hots for a naga that comes to beach a lot.\" she explains. A small smirk forms on Petra's lips. \"But you've got what he loves. I doubt there are any bigger women than you around out there.\" she says. Roxy's eye twitches and you back away from her slowly. \"I'd watch it if I were sis. You should remember who's oldest around here.\" The orange gargoyle just rolls her eyes. You meanwhile are just sitting there, looking from one giant woman to the other. Petra still looks calm as ever, but Roxy is visibly annoyed. To her credit though she's not as mad as she usually gets when someone brings up her weight. That doesn't mean you can't feel the tension in the air though. You're about to say something when Roxy slams her hand on the table, causing you to bounce into the air. \"Don't try to make me look like a fool in front of my friend.\" she says. You look up and see that now her breasts are hanging directly over you. Its enough to make you stare with your mouth slightly open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra sees you staring and smirks. \"Why don't you ask him what he thinks?\" she asks. Roxy glances down and notices that you're blushing a little. \"Whats up with you?\" she asks. Petra sighs before you can answer. \"Oh for the love-he's into you!\" she says bluntly. Roxy tilts her head and stares at you. \"Well you are pretty much one of the hottest girls I know, and I like being around you.\" you say nervously. \"But what about Connie?\" she asks. \"Well a lot has happened to him. Maybe he's rethought some things.\" Petra answers for you. You are suddenly lifted up to Roxy's enormous eye. \"Is that true?\" she asks. You give an awkward smile in response. She smiles in return and clears her throat. \"Well I guess we can give it a shot. I mean, we already share the same skin.\" she says. She sets you back down and the three of you finish your meal, making light conversation. Afterward Petra gets ready to leave and the two of you see her off. \"It was nice seeing you sis.\" Roxy says. \"It was nice meeting you.\" you add. \"Likewise. It feels good helping my sister out.\" she says, winking at you. \"And make sure you stay nice and big, the way he likes it!\" she says as she spreads her wings and takes off. \"Hey!\" Roxy calls after her angrily. As her sister fades into the sky she sighs and turns to you on her shoulder. \"Well? Where do we go from here?\" she asks.</span></div></div>",

Roxy carries you to her bedroom and places you on the mattress before she removes her clothes. Once she's down to her bra and underwear your eyes widen. You've seen Roxy in her swimsuit a billion times, but this is a new experience. Her giant breasts look great in her bra, ready to come out when she decides to let them. Further down you take in her love handles, just above that amazing gargoyle ass. Throw in her thunder thighs and you've got the complete package. Its no secret that you're into big women, and Roxy has always been your type. You've known it ever since you first met her, but you're only now realizing that she's totally your ideal woman. As she tosses her clothes into a basket she looks down and notices you staring. \"Geez Stephen, I know you like to check out my body sometimes but this is new.\" she says with a smirk. Its now that you realize your mouth is slightly open and you quickly look away blushing. The gargoyle picks you up and holds you up in front of her face. \"Well since we're a couple now why don't you get better acquainted with this hot bod?\" she asks. You nod silently, causing her to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy gives you a kiss before lowering you toward her breasts, contained in a dark red bra. \"I'm sure you're acquainted with these ladies, right?\" she asks. You certainly are, since she sometimes stuffs you in her cleavage to carry you around. This time however, she drops you inside and starts fondling them. The fleshy walls around you move up and down, to and fro as her claws grope them. You just enjoy the cushiony warmth of these fleshy pillows. Its still great how such tough skin can be so soft. Your bliss is interrupted when she pulls you out and moves you down lower. You admire her love handles and thighs but she skips over them and brings you behind to her butt. \"How about this?\" she asks, wiggling her rear. Her cheeks jiggle and she slaps one for effect. Then in one quick motion she drops you into the back of her underwear and lets it go with a snap. You're pressed against her ass and love the feeling. Still, you can't believe this is actually Roxy. Is this just how she is when she's intimate? You wonder about it when she grabs you and brings you back up to her face. \"Enjoy the tour?\" she asks. \"You know it!\" you answer with a vigorous nod, but your eyes wander and you can't help but ask her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you skip those awesome thighs though?\" you ask. She looks away and mutters. \"There's noting great about them.\" She's not looking you in the eyes. \"But they're so bi-\" you start but her head snaps back to attention and her sharp glare shuts you up. \"I mean, they're so FULL. They just look so luscious and inviting.\" you tell her. Roxy gets pretty angry when her weight comes into question, although you thought she would make an exception in this case. Guess not. You give her your best smile, but she maintains her hard stare. \"Word of advice. If a woman doesn't like to talk about her weight, then you don't talk about her weight.\" she says while carrying you to the bed. \"But, since I like you I'll let it slide.\" She sets you down before removing her bra, then picks you up again. Now this is new! You've never seen Roxy's bare breasts before, and its got you immediately hard! She lies down and places you on one of them with a smile. \"We're hitting the sack now, but maybe next time I'll let you play a little, wherever you want.\" She gives her thigh a slap, then settles in for sleep. You lie down on your soft bed of flesh and eventually doze off as well.</span></div></div>",

Upon inspection you find that Roxy has her hand on her chest, pinning you to the soft mammary. You struggle a little but its no use. Her hand is way too heavy. She yawns and suddenly her hand moves as she shifts positions in her sleep. Finally free, you stretch out on the yellow surface that is your bed. For a few minutes you just lie there and enjoy the moment, Roxy lightly snoring in the background. When you decide to get up you turn and look over at the massive face sleeping above you. You've been working with Roxy for a long time, but she looks so beautiful to you right now. With a smile you decide to wake her up and start walking toward her. Unfortunately her hand comes back down right on top of you, pinning you once again. With a sigh you decide to just wait it out and watch her face from your spot trapped on her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Roxy finally wakes up she stretches out with a yawn, releasing you from captivity. She looks down and sees you lying on her boob and smiles. \"Morning.\" she says and grabs you. \"Enjoy your bed?\" You sigh as she holds you in front of her face, but then grin. \"Yeah, it was great, even the part when you trapped me on your boob.\" you say, which is true. Your gargoyle girlfriend grins back at you and gives you a kiss. \"Well maybe I'm just trying to make sure you don't get away.\" she suggests playfully. Man, its kind of surreal having Roxy kiss you like this. Wonderful, but surreal. \"Yeah, well we know what happened the last time you let me out of your sight.\" you jibe at her playfully. A look of remorse passes over her face before it turns to a half smirk. \"Hey, low blow.\" she says, pulling you in for a very aggressive kiss. \"At least some beautiful gargoyle lent you some skin.\" she says, scratching you under your chin. The two of you lie in bed, playfully chatting like this until Roxy decides to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a morning shower Roxy heads to the kitchen for some breakfast. Again, this is a new experience. Being in in the shower with her arouses you way more than you thought it would. Seeing the water slide down her body as she washes herself had your little guy below standing up more than a little. Her breasts and ass jiggle as she latheres herself in soap, not to mention those thighs she was so eager to dismiss last night. Your mind snaps back to attention when she grabs you and washes you as well. The two of you then head for the kitchen, where Roxy makes a bowl of cereal for breakfast. As she eats she gives you a piece of cereal she had dipped in milk. \"So what do you think everyone will say?\" you ask. She swallows a mouthful of food before answering. \"I don't know, I can't see anyone being super shocked about us. In fact, I'd say most won't even care. You know those beachgoers are into their own things.\" You nod and finish off your cereal, wondering how the day will go exactly. After she cleans up Roxy carries you out the door and off to work.</span></div></div>",

You actually like how it feels in your hands as you stroke it and even sniff it. You could not believe it. You and Roxy together? Who would\u2019ve thought that it would come to it. Sure Roxy was your best friend and all but this was something new. As you flew overhead, Carmen was loading her surfboard into the back of her truck and then lets out a gasp as she sees you on Roxy\u2019s shoulder. As Carmen is struggling to put her jaw back, Lila walks up behind her, holding an umbrella to shield herself from the sun and then she looks up and sees you with Roxy. Lila smiles smugly at Carmen and then holds out her hand. Carmen sighs and then hands Lila a large roll of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roxy was flapping her wings, she didn\u2019t notice that Stella was closing up behind her. Stella noticed you with your new skin and smirked as she flew down hoping to cause some trouble. \u201cHello, Maza,\u201d says Stella. \u201cI almost thought that it was Phineas Fogg\u2019s air balloon flying right in front of me, but I guess I was close.\u201d Roxy gives a slight grumble but then shrugs her shoulders.\u201d Stella blinks in confusion. Usually making fun of her weight was the surest way to get Roxy to throw a nasty tantrum, but this time, she barely reacted. Stella looks in confusion. \u201cWhat?!\u201d asks Stella. Roxy flies ahead and Stella pouts but then she sees you relaxing in Roxy\u2019s hair and then smirks. \u201cOh my gosh, Stephen,\u201d says Stella. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging around with Roxy so much, you\u2019ve caught gargoyle jaundice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually Stella gets you so uptight with all her insults and obnoxiousness, but this time, you didn\u2019t react. You were so in love with Roxy right now (as difficult for it was for you to believe yourself), that you couldn\u2019t care less what Stella said about you. It was as if she wasn\u2019t speaking at all. Stella realized you ignored her and she got really mad. But then she thought of a way in which she could possibly get a rise out of you and Roxy. \u201cI heard what Mesa did. Kind of harsh for Fran to fire her like that. I mean, a good cook is hard to find, especially one who makes such good meat patties like Mesa. You should be grateful for Mesa\u2019s house special. I bet it would\u2019ve been delicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver remembering what almost happened and it looked like Roxy was going to get mad at Stella. Her eyes even glowed bright red for a moment. However, Roxy then gives a smirk. \u201cYou know, Stella, you\u2019re just upset that you\u2019re single.\u201d Stella gives a gasp. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d Roxy lets out a laugh. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t as shallow as you think anymore. I\u2019m so happy right now, even your cracks about my weight can\u2019t faze me. Heck, if you were any funny, you wouldn\u2019t need to laugh at your own jokes. You\u2019re just a petty little ex-queen bee out of high school but you still haven\u2019t grown up at all. Why else would you pick a fight with someone like me. You\u2019re just a sad little girl.\u201d Roxy lets out a laugh as she flies ahead, leaving Stella speechless as her jaw drops. By the time Stella realizes what happened, Roxy is farther away up ahead. \u201cWait!\u201d yells Stella. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me! Pay attention to me! Pay attention to me!\u201d Stella actually breaks down crying as she flies and tries to catch up with you and Roxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Roxy share a laugh at Stella\u2019s expense. \u201cI\u2019m in such a good mood,\u201d you say as you stroke Roxy\u2019s ear. \u201cNot even that pest Stella can ruin in.\u201d Roxy plucks you and then kisses you, covering you in gargoyle spit.

I'm as fit as a fiddle.\" Roxy gives a purr. \"More than fit. We're a couple now.\" Fran gives a look of surprise and claps as Chihiro smiles. \"That's great, Roxy,\" says the chimeric beast. \"I always knew you two would make a great couple.\" You and Roxy share a kiss as Chihiro and Fran smile at you. \"Fran very happy. Oh, before Fran forget. Fran already hired replacement chef to take Mesa's place. Name Zoe. She former beachgoer.\" You give a blink. \"Zoe?\" you ask. \"The blind landshark?\" Chihiro let out a giggle. \"No, silly, Zoe Orcaton. Go check her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Roxy decide to check out the beach grill and as Roxy flies forward, you see a familiar face at the grill. It was Roxy's youngest sister, Janet and she had her friend/fellow ranger, Edgar sitting on her shoulder. \"Hi, Roxy,\" says Janet. \"How have you been.\" Roxy hugs her sister and you look across to see Edgar. \"Oh,\" says Edgar. \"You must be Stephen. I'm Edgar.\" You smile and shake hands with Edgar yourself. \"A pleasure to meet you. Did you finally settle on a girl.\" Janet gives a smirk at that but Edgar shakes his head. \"What? Oh no. I'm still trying to make my decision. I'm just dating each girl one at a time and it's Janet's turn.\" Janet let out a laugh. \"Oh,\" she says. \"I was already in the lead. By the way, this new cook is really working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Roxy. \"Is she? I'd like to see this new cook.\" Edgar gave a laugh. \"Oh, it's hard not to see her.\" There was then an earthquake rumbling and you and Roxy look in surprise. Mesa's replacement was in fact a giant black and white were-orca who was completely bald and was wearing a chef's uniform. But what made her stand out was that she was even fatter than Roxy. She would weigh over 16000lbs if she was human. It was a wonder she wasn't immobile like Ambrousine as she stomped forward. \"Good grief!\" yells Roxy in surprise. The orca stuffed her face with a few baguettes before stopping in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she says. \"I'm Zoe Orcaton. So nice it is to meet you. Helena told me about you two.\" \"Helena?\" asks Roxy. \"You mean, Helena Kroft?\" Zoe nodded her head. \"I'm good friends with Helena and I'm sure that I'll be good friends with the two of you.\" Zoe holds out her hand and Roxy shakes it. \"Now, you two look hungry.

Standing in front of you is April Howler, the self professed love of your life. She's got a smile on her face upon seeing you, but its different from her usual one. \"Hey Stephen, Roxy.\" she says. Her tone goes through a noticeable shift when she greets Roxy. \"Hey April.\" you say, giving her a small wave. Roxy is about to say something but April interrupts her before she can. \"You won't believe what I heard from Lila on the way here. She said the two of you were dating! Pretty crazy, huh?\" the werewolf says with a small laugh. You and Roxy both look away awkwardly, causing her to smile to falter. \"Listen April, I'm sorry but its true.\" you admit. April's smile disappears completely and Roxy tries to comfort her. \"Look, it just kind of happened.\" she  tries to explain. \"I guess all the time we spent together sort of created some pent up attraction, and well, it finally came out.\" April isn't too accepting however, and starts to get upset. \"You've known me just as long as her! Are you saying that she saves your life and your in love just like that? I would have gave you my skin in a heartbeat! Just imagine how adorable you would be if we had matching fur!\" She seems on the verge of crying, but for some reason calms down. \"Whatever. I know this is just a bump in the road. One day you'll realize you love me, so I'll let Roxy take care of you until then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril turns tail and walks off in a huff. You and Roxy look at each other in confusion after that verbal assault. \"Well she was always kind of off beat.\" you say with shrug. \"Lets just hope she doesn't go insane and try to kill us.\" Roxy jokes. \"Well I doubt she'd get too far, as tough as you are.\" you tell her while stroking her neck. She walks onto the beach and surveys the area, looking for anyone who decided to come out early. Of course you see April, who is busy collecting shells. She spots you and gives you a flirty wave.You wave back and hear Roxy give a sigh. Elsewhere you see Kath setting up her easel, and you spot Lila and Carmen running out to the ocean. \"Everything seems okay.\" Roxy notes. \"But it is pretty early. She takes a stroll down the sand and looks over at the empty food hut. While Mesa did almost kill you, its still a bummer that you have to wait until Fran hires another chef. \"I hope we get another chef soon. I already miss Mesa's cooking.\" Roxy says. She winces slightly and looks at you, but you just pat her shoulder. \"Don't worry about it, and I'm sure Fran will make sure to find someone who won't fry me up.\" you assure her. \"Though I doubt it matters with my new skin.\" Your girlfriend smiles and rubs your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later the two of you are sitting on the beach watching the ocean. At this point its a little late in the morning and more people are beginning to show up. Roxy maintains a good watch on her surroundings to make sure everything is okay, but manages to sit back and relax as well. You're resting between her boobs when...</span></div></div>",

Dusting yourself off you walk over to the shoreline, where  something is shining in the sun. \"Where are you going?\" Roxy asks, sitting up to better watch you. \"I think something washed up from the ocean.\" you call back. Upon reaching the object in question you find that its a large glass bottle lying on its side. It towers over you, the sun reflecting off of it. Inside it however, is what appears to be a large green ball of swirling energy. You stare at it for a second, wondering what it could be. The ground trembles as Roxy walks toward you. The bottle rises into the sky when she picks it up to examine it. \"What do you think it is?\" you call up. She bends down to grab you and puts you on her shoulder. \"I don't know.\" she says, holding it up to the sun. \"Well, might as well hold on to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head down the beach and eventually come across Opal's tent. \"Maybe she'll know what this thing is.\" you suggest. Roxy walks inside and you see Opal sitting there behind her crystal ball. \"Come for divining?\" she asks, motioning you closer. \"Hey Opal,\" Roxy greets her. \"We actually wanted your help identifying something.\" The carbuncle leans forward. \"Oh?\" She motions for you to come forward. Roxy holds out the bottle, the green orb still swirling inside. \"Thats...\" Opal says. \"Hold on, let me make sure.\" She closes her eyes and the jewel on her head glows. After a second her eyes shoot open and she recoils. \"Envy!\" she exclaims. You and Roxy look at her confused. She sighs and composes herself. \"That is the sin of envy. The very essence, contained in a small space.\" she explains. \"Really?\" you ask as Roxy holds it up and stares at it. \"Where did it come from?\" Opal shakes her head. \"I have no idea. I know that there are essences for the other seven sins as well, but no one really knows where they come from.\" she says. \"Wait, seven?\" Roxy asks. \"Despair is also one of the deadly sins.\" Opal tells her. \"If this thing is so important, than why was it just floating in the ocean?\" you ask. Opal shrugs. \"Who knows?\" it could have been lost at sea for hundreds of years, or it could have been trapped in a sunken ship and recently floated to the surface. I'm not an expert. Whatever the case, just make sure you keep it safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've found out what the bottle is the two of you exit the tent. \"Should we have left it with Opal?\" you ask. \"Nah, I think its kinda cool. We just have to not open it.\" Roxy tells you. \"You know, we never asked what would happen if we did.\" you add. Suddenly the bottle is snatched out of Roxy's hand in an instant. \"Having fun you two?\" the thief asks. Its Stella, seemingly over her earlier breakdown and back to normal. \"I guess it makes sense, losers like you are made for each other. Birds of a feather, they say.\" she taunts. Roxy just sighs. \"Seriously? You have nothing better to do?\" she asks. Stella pouts a little. \"I was just passing by, not looking for you! I have better things to do than worry about you and your tacky trinkets!\" she says, casually uncorking the bottle. \"Wait!\" you shout, but its too late. The green orb flies out of the bottle and hovers in the air before shooting toward...</span></div></div>",

The green orb floats over Roxy's head and makes a beeline for the werewolf. \"What the-?\" Stella says as you and Roxy turn to see where the sin is headed. April, unaware of what is happening, is simply collecting shells for her crafting. Just as she bends over to grab on the green ball of energy flies toward her round ass and enters her body. After standing back up with shell in hand she looks around, feeling a little strange. The feeling quickly goes away however and she continues with her business. She would, that is, if you and Roxy weren't walking up to her. \"April!\" you call. \"Are you okay?\" The werewolf tilts her head a little confused as she answers. \"Yeah, why do you ask?\" she responds. The moment she sees you however, a green tint, unseen to the rest of you, flashes in her eyes. \"Uh, just checking.\" you tell her. You and Roxy look at each other nervously while she watches you. \"Well, I have to get back to my shop.\" she says. \"Unless you decided to leave Roxy for me?\" she bends over to give you a view of her cleavage. Roxy rolls her eyes and you shake your head awkwardly. \"Sorry, but no. I mean you're great and all but...\" you stammer as April gives you a smirk. She bids the two of you goodbye and turns to leave. Her tail wags slowly as she walks, looking back at you once for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanna tell me what that was about?\" Stella asks. Roxy gives her a sideways glare. \"That bottle had the essence of envy trapped inside of it.\" she says in an annoyed tone. \"It was supposed to stay trapped, but SOMEONE let it out and it possessed April.\" Stella just shrugs. \"She seems fine to me.\" Roxy folds her arms with a frown. \"I'm sure she does, but something's bound to happen. Opal told us that that much. The thing is concentrated envy.\" she says. You look at the werewolf walking away in the distance. \"I guess we should just keep an eye on her for now.\" you suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you discuss the situation with Stella and Roxy, April is heading home unknowingly with sin in tow. Recalling how you were worried about her makes her smile. <i>He's so thoughtful! I wish I had a sweetheart like him!</i> she thinks to herself. Then her expression darkens a bit. <i>Why does Roxy get to have him? I've loved him for as long as I've known him! She's been with him all this time and just NOW decides to make a move?</i> Its faint, but her eyes are tinted green as these thoughts run through her mind. <i>Its almost like she's just flaunting him in my face! I want him so bad!</i> She continues ranting in her own head when suddenly she stops. Her eyes go back to normal and she regains herself, but her thoughts of you are still strong. As she walks along the street to her home she glances at a shop down the road. <i>I wish my shop had a sign that nice.</i> She has one more envious thought before entering her house/store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once everyone is at the table you begin eating. Roxy made roast beef and mashed potatoes, with veggies on the side. You share off of Roxy's plate, and find it a little difficult to tear the meat. This is because its its actually a whole roasted cow. Seems Roxy isn't accustomed to making human sized portions. As you try bite into the cow she scoots you away with her claw. Then she slices it for you and lets you resume. \"Thanks Roxy.\" you say. She smiles and begins eating herself. You look over at Petra and see that she's neater than Roxy. She doesn't eat slow, but its definitely her own pace. \"So uh, Petra.\" you start. \"How do you like being a cop?\" Petra looks at you. \"It's a full filling job.\" she answers. \"It feels good to protect and serve. Its kind of a gargoyle instinct. Thats why most of us take jobs that protect others.\" You look up at your giant friend as she eats. \"I guess that explains why you became a life guard, huh Roxy?\" you ask. \"But why didn't you become a cop too?\" Roxy stops and looks down. \"Well lets just say I didn't have the mentality for it.\" she answers. Petra raises her eyebrow and Roxy frowns. \"Hey, I like to live a little!\" she says. Petra sighs and smiles. \"Well at least you're still helping people. Guess the instinct's still in you.\" she says. \"Is your other sister a cop?\" you ask. \"No.\" Petra responds. \"Janet didn't have much of an ambition for it either, but she still does good work. She's a counselor at a summer camp for girls. I can't help but be happy that she's looking out for kids.\" Petra is more talkative than you'd thought she'd be. You find yourself moving closer to have a better conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the only police officer in the family?\" you ask. \"Nope.\" says Petra. \"Our mother is one. She works over in Panicburg. Its a pretty bad neighborhood, so they have to have a good police force. Its made up of all gargoyles and mom's the chief. She's the best of the best.\" As if she's not even thinking Petra cuts a piece of her meat and offers it to you. You begin eating it when Roxy lets out a stifled laugh. \"Whats so funny?' you say. \"This, this situation.\" she answers, gesturing to you and Petra. \"Petra's never opened up to anyone outside of the family like this. Talking about Janet and mom, looks like she likes you Stephen.\" Petra is visibly shaken up and blushes. \"What do you mean? I'm just being nice.\" she says. \"Oh? You're not usually this nice to strangers. Look, you're even sharing your plate with him!\" Petra finally realizes she's been eating with you and blushes more. You meanwhile just look confused. As the two gargoyles argue you realize its the kind of argument two sisters would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's practically family already don't you think?\" Roxy says pointing at the bandage on her neck.They're still going at it. \"I know! Maybe you two should hook up!\" she says teasingly. Petra is shocked, as well as you. You look at each other and then look away. This is not how expected this dinner to go. Petra looks just as lost you. She really must not be used to this kind of situation. \"Come on, you've never even been on a date. Why don't you try it?\" Roxy urges. Petra frowns. \"Like you're one to talk! I don't see you with a guy. Hell, the only one of us close to having a boyfriend is Janet!\" she counters. \"Yeah, and she's going after a human, so why don't you?\" Roxy says with a smile. Their sister likes a human? You're now more interested than before. Eventually the two sisters stop and focus on you. Roxy is grinning while Petra looks embarrassed. She seems to be trying to act cool and collected but can't hide the blush. \"Come on, what do you say?\" Roxy repeats. </span></div></div>",

You have a thing for big women, but Petra's figure is definitely great too. \"Well..I wouldn't mind.\" you say a little quietly. Petra blushes more and looks away. Roxy picks you up carefully and presents you like some sort of prize. \"Come on, look  at him.\" she says like she's holding a kitten or something. Petra is still being stubborn, but is definitely showing signs of cracking. This is probably why a girl as attractive as her is still single. She's so stoic and serious, it must be hard for guys to hit on her. The difference is that now her sister backed her into a corner. \"Look, I need to use the bathroom.\" Petra says as she gets up. \"I'll get her.\" Roxy says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Petra is gone you look up at Roxy. \"Maybe you should leave her alone. If she doesn't want to she doesn't want to.\" you say. Roxy lifts you to her face. \"Look, I know her better than you. She's definitely interested, and thats never happened before. Any guy who ever attempted to woo her's always gotten the cold shoulder.\" Then she looks like she realized something. \"Now that I think about it, you've always had a bunch of girls after you. I never thought you'd get my sister though. Are you some kind of wizard? Maybe its the gargoyle skin.\" she ponders. You just shrug your shoulders a little embarrassed. You don't know why monster girls like you, it just sort of happens. \"Just think though, if you hook up with Petra then you're set! She's good looking and she'll definitely protect you.\" Roxy says. She's really enthusiastic about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming sound signal's Petra's return. Before she gets there Roxy brings you closer. \"Is your skin feeling okay?\" she asks in a whisper. \"Uh, yeah.\" you say. \"Okay, then get ready. I have an idea.\" she tells you. Once Petra is there she sits back down, only for Roxy to stand up. She walks nonchalantly to her sister and pretends to trip. \"Whoops!\" she says and tosses you while making it look like an accident. You land right in Petra's cleavage and clench your teeth, waiting for the pain. It doesn't come however. Your skin is setting pretty well. It also helps that Petra's boobs are really soft. They might not be as big as Roxy's but they're still a good size. Its still pretty cool that their skin can be tough and soft at the same time. Petra carefully fishes you out and scolds her sister. \"He could've been hurt!\" she says. Roxy smiles and shrugs her shoulders. \"Sorry, it was an accident!\" she says unconvincingly. \"He's already been through so much, he doesn't need you tossing hm around.\" Petra tells her. \"Well you certainly seem like you're getting attached to him.\" Roxy says slyly. Petra notices that she's holding you closely and stroking you with a claw. She stops when she realizes what she's doing. \"See, you won't admit it but there's definitely some interest.\" Roxy says. Finally Petra breaks. \"Okay I'll give it a shot! Jeez!\" she says. The two of you lock eyes and smile while Roxy laughs happily. The next day you have your date and...</span></div></div>",

She taps you on the head and chuckles. \"Yeah but it was worth it right?\" she says. Its a good thing your skin has set. That little tap would have hurt like hell a day ago. Soon there's a knock on the door and Roxy lets Petra in. \"On the dot, as always.\" Roxy says. Petra is dressed casually, her figure making it look good. \"Are you ready for your big day?\" Roxy teases. Like you, Petra just rolls her eyes. \"I've been dealing with this all morning.\" you tell her. \"I don't think I've ever seen her this excited.\" Petra offers her hand, which you climb on. \"Well she's never had many opportunities to mess with me, so when she finds one she goes all out.\" Petra explains. She then places you on her shoulder and leaves, with Roxy waving from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whats the plan?\" Petra asks you. \"I haven't really thought about it.\" you say. \"Do you have any ideas?\" Petra nods and takes you off of her shoulder. \"Hold on.\" she says, and takes off into the sky. As she flies you look down and see that she's heading away from Terrordale. You look up at her to ask where she's going but stop when you are confronted with her boobs. You decide to just wait until she lands since the view above and below is so good. When she's back on the ground you ask where you are. \"Horrorville.\" she tells you. \"I thought you might like a change of scenery, so I brought you to my town.\" Looking around you do notice that its different from Terrordale. It also seems good since she'll be the one walking and she knows the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra starts walking down the street as you look around. Suddenly you hear a voice from  behind. \"Hey babe, looking goo-\" it starts before she turns around. The owner of the voice, a minotaur, stops short when he sees her face. She of course has to look down on him, and her stoic expression makes him back up. \"Maza!\" he says with a nervous look. Then he turns and walks away, getting faster by the second. \"Uh, what was that about?\" you ask. \"Just a local troublemaker.\" Petra tells you. \"I've had to deal with him a number of times.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look up as Petra walks into a building. You read that it says the Cauldron Cafe. \"You're gonna like the food here Stephen,\" says your gargoyle date. \"I know the head chef, Bernice.\" You actually smile. Maybe Horrorville wasn't as dangerous as you thought. Petra walks up and sees a giantess mandrake resembling Venus McFlytrap, except with two sharp fangs sticking out of her mouth. Before the mandrake girl can speak, she sees you in Petra's cleavage and looks in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" the mandrake waitress asks. \"Ir look like a gargoyle but it's as big as a human.\" Petra simply glares at the mandrake who steps back from the much larger monster. \"Uh, right this way ma'am.\" Soon, Petra is lead to a table where she takes her seat. She takes you out of her cleavage and the two of you read a large menu. You look outside to see several monsters passing by out the window. \"Well,\" you say. \"So this is Horrorville. It's actually kinda nice. Lila, Opal and Reimu were saying bad things about it the other day and said it was a dump.\" Petra lets out a laugh as she reads the menu. \"That's the feud going on. Some of my neighbors have some harsh things to say about Terrordale. Personally, I think the feud is stupid. It's been going on ever since the cities were founded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the menu and see some odd things such as snake surprise, slime desert, roasted vulture salad. Basically everything monsters consider food. As you're pondering on what to order, you look up at your date. \"So Petra. About your neighbors?\" Petra smiles. \"I've got tons of neighbors. Monster Arms is a big apartment. The only thing I don't like about it is the landlady.\" \"Oh, she's mean?\" \"That's the understatement of the millennium. That three thousand year old used roll of toilet paper is the worst person I've ever met. She's a horrible tyrant and a worse landlady. She casts evil spells on anyone who can't pay the rent. I'll bet the only reason she made it to the afterlife is because her heart was so black and foul, it poisoned the devourer. Unfortunately, I can't arrest her for public obnoxiousness.\" Wow, it sounded like Petra really hated this landlady of hers. She must've been an even bigger bitch than Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for my neighbors,\" says Petra. \"I've got tons and I mean, literally tons of them, all crazier than the last. First is my next door neighbor, D.J. Elle, a thunderbird with attitude. It isn't a party until she starts cranking her tunes. Then there's the head chef at this cafe, Bernice, a fire genie who's a grouch most of the time, but she's a good friend.\" Petra lets out a laugh before speaking again. \"Then there's Aqua, you might have seen her, she's a kelpie girl who practically lives on her surfboard.\" You actually distinctively remember seeing a kelpie resembling a fat equine version of Lagoona Blue on the Horrorville side of the beach. Maybe that was Aqua. \"And last of my neighbors on my floor,\" said Petra. \"Is Irene the cyclops.\" \"Irene?\" you ask. \"Any relationship to anyone named Paula?\" \"Irene is Paula's daughter,\" says Petra. \"She visits her every week. Kinda sweet since the old girl is screwed up in the head.\" \"I know,\" you say. \"Uh, Irene doesn't eat humans does she?\" You remembered the last time you went to the K.D.P., Paula tried to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra lets out a gargoylish laugh at that thought. \"Irene would never eat a human. The girl is a total health nut. She's always exercising and she refuses to eat anything fattening.\" You almost feel insulted. Does that mean Irene saw you as junk food? \"Then there are my other neighbors. There's Georgia the artisan gorgon, Chel, the yeti nurse, the one monster in the apartment almost as big as me, then there are two troublemakers; Shelly, this kappa I'm investigating for too many fraud charges to list and Patsy, a neko girl biker who runs with a bad crowd.\" You actually gulp. You'd wonder who'd think about doing anything illegal in a building with a cop on the top floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's Mavis, a banshee opera singer who makes my ears want to vomit. That stubborn kook thinks she has the voice of an angel. A fallen angel is more like it.\" You laugh at Petra's joke. \"And there's Alicia, a jabberwocky I'm investigating. I'm pretty sure she's on some illegal drugs. Then there's Izzy, a basilisk school teacher.\" A gorgon and a basilisk? You guess that this apartment has a lot of earth elemental monsters. \"There's this manticore named Astrid who is keeping a human mate under the landlady's nose,\" continues Petra. \"I forgot their gender though. Then there's Layla the dullahan, there's something about her that makes my skin crawl, that horrible centaur drunk Zelda, I feel sorry for her roommate Catalina, that man-hating hodag Renee, that schizophrenic chimera Bianca, that crybaby ghost Corlette, Giselle, the human-phobic sphinx and lastly there's Cadence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cadence,\" you say. \"That's a beautiful name. What type of monster is she?\" \"She's a zombie,\" says Petra. \"Nice gal but she hasn't spoken coherently since she rose from her grave. She's an author, you might've read some of her books; Metropolis After Night, the Broken Mirror. She has a human roommate named R.L. you might get along with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, Petra sure had a colorful set of neighbors. \"Wow,\" you say. \"Sounds like an interesting place. Maybe I should visit.\" Petra bites her lip slightly and shakes her head. \"That's not a good idea Stephen,\" she says. \"You could run into Lupa.\" \"Lupa?\" you ask. \"She's a big, fat, greedy werewolf obsessed with scarfing down every human she sees. No matter how many perish in her overstuffed belly, that wolf will always find room for more.\" You gulp. Then you remember something. April mentioned her cousin's name was Lupa. This must've been her. \"You don't think Lupa would attack me do you Petra?\" you ask. Petra shakes her head. \"Not with your new skin,\" she says with a smile. \"Lupa is a glutton, but she draws the line at cannibalism.\" Petra then lets out a sigh. \"She must be thinking about... well, it's not important.\" Petra smiles lustfully at you and you smile at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe you were on a date with such a hot gargoyle. Sure, she could stand to gain a few... boulders... given your usual taste in girls. But she was still beautiful. Just then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mandrake waitress returns to your table, still looking at you oddly. A human with the skin of a gargoyle was probably a strange sight, and the mandrake didn't know what to think about it. She wasn't about to ask any more questions about you with the look Petra gave her earlier, though. \"Are you two ready to order, or do you need a minute?\" You look up at Petra with a look of uncertainty. You could somewhat stomach monster food most of the time, but you were never good at decision making, <i>especially</i> when it comes to monster food. They all left you with a similar taste in your mouth anyway. Petra looks down at you and smiles. \"Tell Bernice I'll have what I had last time, and to add a little bit extra on the side for my date here.\" Did... did she just call you her date? I mean, you <i>were</i> her date, but she actually called you her date. You wonder if that means things are going well between you and Petra. The waitress simply nods, and gets one last look at you as she leaves, still looking puzzled. You couldn't blame her, you weren't exactly used to having Gargoyle skin yourself. It was thick and tough, not like what you're used to. Now, with the waitress gone, you and Petra were alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Stephen...I've talked enough about myself, haven't I? How are things on the beach?\" she says, looking down at you with a smile. \"Well, aside from Mesa and Hannah trying to kill me... thanks for dealing with Hannah, by the way. Huge weight off my shoulders.\" The gargoyle smiles. \"No problem. After hearing about what she did to my sister's partner, I couldn't miss the opportunity to dish out some justice...that, and things have been tame over here. Relatively speaking.\" You nodded, feeling somewhat grateful that she'd go through the effort to deal with Hannah, even if only because there wasn't much to do in her hometown. \"Anyway, aside from that I can't complain. Your sister makes a good partner, and <i>most</i> of the monsters on the beach are fine to be around... some of them I'm not so sure about. But having Roxy around to keep them in line helps.\" Petra nods, and just looks at you, not saying a word. You weren't sure if she just didn't know what to say or if was sizing you up. It could very well be both. Either way, she looked at you with a warm smile, which you returned. She was a very nice gargoyle. You'd have to thank Roxy for hooking you up with her later, if things go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention shifts suddenly as a large serving tray suddenly plops down on the table, creating a loud metallic clang that threatened to burst your eardrums. Shaking it off, you look up, expecting to see the mandrake from before...only to see the head chef that Petra mentioned. You didn't expect to see an Ifrit, but you figure that a fire genie made the most sense for a monster who would spend a lot of time cooking. \"Here you are, Petra! Same thing you ordered last time, and the time before that, and the time before that...\" \"Oh, stop it, Bernice. You know I can't resist the Dinosaur Ribs!\" \"Can you blame me for wanting you to change it up every once in awhile? Wait...where's that friend of yours? I added extra portions for him and everything.\" Petra just glanced towards you, and the Ifrit followed her eyes, scanning the table before noticing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...a human friend?\" she says, biting her lip and staring at you. \"Is that a problem?\" says Petra, looking at Bernice with a hateful glare. \"No, nothing like that Petra...it's just the extra portions I added were made for someone a little larger to share.\" Petra just let out a sigh, looking over the dinosaur ribs, which you begin to do, aswell. As much as you had a distaste for monster food, you did love ribs. And Dinosaur meat was kind-of like normal animal meat...albeit huge, thick, and unreasonably tough, but it tasted vaguely like meat. \"We'll manage, Bernice.\" \"Alright, alright. Well, talk to ya' later Petra. And I might see you too, uh...\" You're about to tell her your name when Petra just says \"His name's Stephen.\" \"Right, well, see you too, Stephen.\" And with that, you and Petra were alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra set you on-top of her outrageously large plate, and used a claw to slice off a chunk of Dinosaur meat, which was actually reasonably sized, despite being able to be sliced off with a single finger. Thanking her, you both began to dig in. As you began to struggle to tear off chunks of the thick dino meat, you look up at Petra, as she's distracted by the meal, and get a good look at her. I mean, you'd been in her cleavage already, so there wasn't much of her you haven't seen, but you look anyway, just to admire. She was a looker. A little thin, but with just enough curves in the right places. Add on to the fact that she's both really nice, Roxy's sister, <i>and</i> a cop, and you honestly wouldn't mind if things went a bit...you know. And it'd bring you closer to Roxy as a friend, although that's not something you were aiming for. It'd be a nice perk on the side, you suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting it off with Petra wouldn't be too hard, since she actually seems to like you already. But as the date goes on, and you eat, and talk with Petra...just how far do things go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The date goes on and you find yourself really hitting it off with Petra. Being a monster and cop she's got plenty of cool stories. She even seems interested in hearing about your misadventures. \"You've seen a lot around this city huh?\" you ask as she chews on her dinosaur meat.\" She swallows before she answers. \"Well I would think so, I'm a cop. I like to know as much as I can.\" she says. \"Once I had to break up a fight between a couple of hydras. Their heads were all tangled up with each other and we didn't fix them until we got them to the station.\" You laugh at her story and gnaw at your morsel of meat. She sees you struggling and nudges you away from it. Her claw then comes down and in a matter of seconds mashes the meat until its good enough for you to eat. \"Thanks.\" you say. \"No problem.\" she says. \"Now how about you? Roxy told me before but I want to hear from you how you ended up in Terrordale.\" You swallow your food and explain. \"Well I was actually on a boat in the human world when a storm hit. Long story short I went overboard and somehow ended up on the beach in Terrordale. Roxy found me and we've been best friends ever since.\" you tell her. Petra wipes some meat off of your face with her claw. You can see one thing she has in common with Roxy. They can both be very gentle when they need to be. \"Well add that story to having all your skin replaced and I'd say you've had a pretty interesting life too.' she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on the food is almost finished but Petra decides to take the rest home. \"Well its getting a little late so I think we should be heading out.\" she tells you and lowers her hand. You hop on and she puts you back in her cleavage. \"Are we heading back to Roxy's?\" you ask. Petra blushes and clears her throat a little. \"Well actually its getting dark out, so you can stay the night at my place, its pretty close.\" she says. \"If you want that is!\" she quickly adds. You blush as well. You didn't think things would go this well. \"I'd love to.\" you manage to say. Petra pays the bill and exits the cafe, but instead of flying she walks down the street. It is getting pretty dark out but you're not worried in the least. You feel plenty safe with her. She soon comes to a huge apartment building and enters. She begins to climb the stairs to her room on the top floor. When she gets there she passes a thunder bird who you assume is Ellie, who is heading to  her own room. \"Hey Petra, turning in?\" she asks.\" \"Yeah, so keep it down.\" Petra answers. Then Ellie spots you. \"Whats that?\" she says and leans a little closer. \"Is that a tiny gargoyle?\" Then she grins and opens her door. \"Got a little guest eh? Good luck officer.\" she says. Petra rolls her eyes and enters her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering she sets you on a table and picks up her phone. \"Hey sis.\" she says. \"Yeah, it went great.\" Both of you blush and smile when she says this. \"We came back to my place and he's going to stay the night.\" She pauses for a couple of seconds and sighs. Roxy must be teasing her. \"Goodbye Roxy.\" she says a little annoyed and embarrassed before she hangs up. Looking around you see that the place is pretty simple. Its got everything a single woman needs. \"Sorry if its not very fancy.\" she says. \"I'm kinda usually focused on my job so I keep it simple.\" You smile up at her. \"I like it.\" you tell her. She takes the leftover food and puts it in her fridge. From what you see there's not much in there. She must not be the cooking type. \"Look, I'm kind of acting out of character.\" she says suddenly and picks you up. \"I acted on impulse and invited you over.\" Then she carries you to her bedroom and sets you down on the mattress. \"I've never been too romantic but I really like you.\" she says, then swallows nervously. At this point you're pretty nervous too, but as recent events have shown you, life can be short. \"I'm ready if you are.\" you say. Petra nods and begins to take off her clothes. When she's naked she crawls onto the bed and towers over you. Even if she's not big like her sister this sight reminds you she's still massive. Her huge boobs sway as she moves and you think you can see her privates leaking. \"Well, lets go.\" she says as her tail sways back and forth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nervously she brings you in close and kisses you. Her lips envelope your whole body and you are coated in gargoyle saliva. She lowers you back down slowly and on the way you pass her breasts. You reach out and grab her nipple, causing her to jump. You are flung from her hand and land on her boob. \"Sorry about that.\" you tell her. \"I couldn't resist.\" Petra looks down and blushes. \"No, its okay. It felt good.\" she says. Taking the cue you crawl on her boob until you reach the slope. You slide down her boob until you land on the nipple and straddle it. She lets out a gasp and bites her lip as you grab it with both hands. You also kick at the sides of it as if you're  spurring a horse. Petra grabs her other boob and begins playing with it, as well as fingering herself down below. Eventually her movements become enough to knock you from your perch and you tumble down to the mattress below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you land you look up to see Petra looking back with an embarrassed expression. \"I got caught up in the moment.\" she mumbles. \"Uh, so did I.\" you say. \"Lets keep going.\" she says. You nod and walk up to her womanhood. Reaching out you touch her sensitive area and she moans in response. Then you use both hands and try your best to stimulate her more, even making your way inside. \"Oh! You're going in?!\" she exclaims. Her surprise is cut short by her moans of arousal as she falls onto her back. Inside you begin pleasuring her and are soon joined by two giant clawed fingers. Petra and you work together to build her up until she climaxes. You are pushed out in a flood of juice and you both lie there for a minute. She picks you up and gives you another kiss, which you return. This time her tongue snakes out and licks you all over. \"That was incredible.\" you say. She smiles widely in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath of what just happened the to of you lay in bed peacefully. You are on top of her boob as she lies on her back. \"I think its time to clean up.\" she says, to which you agree. At the moment you're covered in dried sweat, saliva, and her lady juices. She gets up and carries you to the shower in her palm. When she starts the water she sets you down to the floor. \"Be careful of my feet.\" she tells you and begins to wash. You have to say its quite a sight. Looking up at this titaness as she washes, the water splashing off of her, is making you horny again. Once again her tail is swishing around, and her heart shaped butt is in clear view. You never thought you'd see a sight like this. When she finishes she picks you up and cleans you gently as well. Then the two of you return to the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I'd do something so impulsive!\" she marvels. \"I know, this was an amazing night!\" you say as you once again lay on her soft breast. \"My sisters think I'm something of a stick in the mud though.\" she tells you shyly. When you first met her you had sort of the same impression. Guess she just opens up to right people. The two of you drift off to sleep. The next day...</span></div></div>",

When you do you hear a giggle. \"Good morning Stephen.\" Petra says from above. You look toward her face to see her looking down at you with a smile. \"Good morning.\" you say. The two of you lie there for a little while longer, with you enjoying the feeling of her breast and her getting a little more rest. Eventually she picks you up and sits upright on the bed cross legged. \"So does this make us a couple?\" she asks hesitantly. \"I guess so.\" you answer. Petra raises you up and brings you to eye level. \"You don't sound too sure.\" she says, giving you a hard stare. \"Okay okay we're a couple! Sorry officer.\" you say with a laugh. She chuckles as well and gives you a giant kiss. She then gets up and gets herself dressed, which you watch eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both of you are all set Petra carries you to the kitchen for breakfast. She pours herself a bowl of cereal and sets it down next to you. \"Sorry I don't have much else to offer.\" she says and offers you a piece of cereal. \"Its fine.' you say and begin munching on your morsel. When she finishes eating she looks at you. \"So are you ready to head back to Terrordale?\" she asks. \"Actually I was kind of hoping to spend the day with you.\" you suggest. Petra blushes and smiles. \"Well, if thats what you want then okay. I'll just call Roxy and let her know.\" She then calls her sister to tell her whats going on and you find it quite amusing. She tells Roxy you'll be staying with her and then she frowns and rolls her eyes. After a few more seconds she sighs. \"Goodbye Roxy.\" she says and hangs up. \"She giving you a hard time?\" you ask. \"Of course. She's eating this up.\" Petra says. \"I bet she's just glad her sister has a boyfriend.\" you tell her. Your new girlfriend gives you a kiss and then picks you up. \"Lets get going then.\" she says and places you between her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way out of the apartment Petra once again runs into Ellie. \"Did you two have a good night?\" she asks with a grin. \"Can it Ellie.\" Petra says while blushing. The thunderbird continues smiling and walks away. As Petra makes her way to the front door you see a variety of monster girls around you. You even see a huge werewolf who you assume to be April's cousin Lupa. You're suddenly thankful for your new skin. If you're going to be coming around Petra's place you want to appear unappetizing. When Petra heads outside what do you guys do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You put a hand on her breast and look up at her. \"I trust you'll keep me safe. Gargoyle's are the best guardians right?\" you say. Petra grins and gives your head a rub before heading for the police station. \"Okay, I'll make sure you're fine.\" she says. You look around at the hustle and bustle of Horrorville as she enters the station. Inside you see all kinds of monsters walking around in uniform. There are other gargoyles like Petra but also a lot of other types. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra heads to her desk and sits down. She takes you from her cleavage and sets you down. \"I thought you said it could get dangerous.\" you call up. \"Well today I'm just catching up on some paperwork, but I might get called into the field.\" she tells you. She then takes out some papers and begins filling them out and filing them. As she works you watch and every so often she reaches over to scratch your head. Just when you start to get a little bored someone walks over. Looks like its another cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Petra!\" the new giantess says as she gets to the desk. She's a chupacabra woman with pretty large breasts and nice round butt. She's got bluish gray fur and spikes going down her back with black hair that reaches her shoulders. \"Doing some paperwork?\" Petra regards her with a glance and gets back to work. \"Yes Rosalyn.\" she says. \"Same boring Petra.\" Rosalyn says with a smirk. She leans on the desk and you notice her rear is dangerously close to you. Petra's claw comes down and scoots you away from Rosalyn, who notices. \"Who's this? A human?' she asks and gets a closer look. \"Yes, I'm her boyfriend.' you say. \"What?! Boyfriend?\" the chupacabra says and starts to laugh. \"Old stone face? How did someone as boring as her get a boyfriend?\" Petra rolls her eyes. \"Try not to talk to her Stephen. She's annoying and a loose cannon.\" Petra tells you. Rosalyn scoffs. \"So what if I get a little intense? I get the job done!\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a voice calls out. \"Maza! You and Rosalyn are on on patrol!\" it says. That must be the chief. Petra groans at having to be paired with Rosalyn. \"I work better alone.\" she tells you as she puts you between her boobs. Rosalyn grins as she watches Petra handle you with care. This must be a side of her no one sees. How does it go?</span></div></div>",

Rolling her eyes your girlfriend gets in the passenger side and buckles up. She then presses you a little further in as Rosalyn pulls out of the lot. Once you're out on the road Rosalyn looks over at Petra as she strokes your head with a claw. \"So how'd you find a gargoyle that small?\" she asks curiously. \"I'm not actually a gargoyle.\"you tell her. \"I'm a human, but I had an accident so I got a skin transplant. The donor was a gargoyle.\" Rosalyn gives you an impressed look. \"Wow, you really lucked out huh?\" she says. \"Yeah, the donor was actually Petra's sister.\" you say. \"Its how we met.\" Rosalyn makes a turn and continues talking. \"So how far have you two gone? Have you went all the way?\" she asks with a smirk. \"Thats none of your business!\" Petra says coldly. Rosalyn burst out laughing at this. \"Oh my god! You have! Stuffy old Petra had a little fun!\" she says. \"And I do mean little. Whats it like having him in there?\" You blush from embarrassment while Petra gets more and more annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rosalyn continues to tease the two of you you suddenly come across a scene unfolding on the street. It looks like a group of monsters are in the middle of a brawl and are causing damage to their surroundings. Rosalyn stops the car and you all get out. \"Alright, break it up!\" Petra calls out. Most of the monsters scatter but one stands her ground. Its a minotaur woman with huge breasts, bigger than Petra and Rosalyn, and a very chubby figure with a giant udder. She's got dark brown fur and long brown hair that looks kind of shaggy. She looks pretty strong and doesn't even flinch at the cops before her. She actually steps forward defiantly. \"Again, Mina?\" Petra asks. \"So? I was just having some fun.\" she says. \"I suppose collateral damage is fun?\" Petra asks, pointing to the broken window of a nearby shop. \"Maybe it is.\" Mina says with a grin. \"Lets just take her in.\" Rosalyn says. \"We caught her disturbing the peace and she damaged someone's property.\" Mina frowns. \"Why don't you go find a goat to suck on?\" she says and starts to walk away. Rosalyn grabs her arm but she breaks free and shoves her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thats it!\" Rosalyn says and leaps at Mina. The two of them hit the ground and begin struggling. You look up to see if Petra's going to do anything but she's just puts her hand on her face. \"Uh Petra?\" you say. \"Don't worry this happens a lot with Rosalyn.\" she tells you. You look back and see that the two of them are back on their feet and still going. Rosalyn hits Mina with a punch but the minotaur grabs her and shoves her into Petra. When they collide their breasts mash up against each other and you spill out into the chupacabra's shirt. She immediately gets back to the fight while Petra checks to see if you're okay. When she doesn't find you in her cleavage or on the ground she looks at the fighting monsters. \"Stephen!\" she exclaims and jumps in. She rushes over and pries the two of them apart. \"Where's Stephen!?\" she asks loudly while holding each of them with one claw. \"Never heard of him!\" Mina says and kicks Petra in the stomach. It doesn't take her down but she lets go. Mina tackles Petra and the three of them tumble down. You get tossed out of Rosalyn's boobs and are thrown someone else's. By the leathery feel you can tell they are Petra's but your relief is short lived. The fight is still going and you get thrown around again. Eventually you end up in a furry pair of breasts, but whose are they?</span></div></div>",

You are tossed all around but you are able to hear a voice calling out. \"Stop!\" it yells. You recognize it as Petra and soon hear Rosalyn cursing out loud as well. Your unwitting captor stops running and you are able to look up and see Mina. She's pressed against a wall remaining quiet. She appears to have ducked into an alley. You prepare to shout for help but she begins moving again and you find yourself being thrown around again. You can hear monsters all around sounding startled as Mina charges through them. You can only assume they're trying their best to stay out of the way. No one wants to be in front of a charging bull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally stops Mina starts walking slower. You hear a door open and close as she moves. You try to climb up her boobs and she feels you squirming. With a confused look she picks you out of her cleavage and holds you to her face. \"A human?\" she says. \"How the hell did you end up here?\" You prepare to explain but she just shrugs. \"Whatever, a snack is a snack.\" she says, and lowers you to her mouth. \"Please! I was just spending time with my girlfriend, Petra! Please don't eat me!\" you cry. Mina stops and pulls you back. \"Maza?! She's your girlfriend!?\" she asks in shock. She laughs for a minute but then realizes something. \"Oh shit! If she doesn't get you back she'll assume I did something to you!\" she exclaims. \"Does that mean you'll take me back?\" you ask hopefully. She looks at you as if you're dumb. \"If I do that they'll take me in for the fight.\" she says. \"Its wouldn't be the first time, but I'd rather not go through the hassle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina walks over to a shelf and gets an empty jar. She drops you inside and screws the lid on. There are air holes in it, so you assume she's had humans here before. \"So what will you do?\"  you ask. \"I don't know.\" she answers. \"I might leave you somewhere for her to find. You seem like a nice guy so you'll tell her I didn't hurt you. That will have to wait until later though.\" You nod eagerly, happy that you'll be getting out of this. Having a gargoyle as your girlfriend is coming in handy. The minotaur turns her TV on and heads to the kitchen. When she comes back...</span></div></div>",

You slump down in the jar, bored out of your mind. Suddenly your vision is taken up by Mina's gigantic face appearing out of nowhere. \"Say, now that get a better look, you look kinda like a gargoyle.\" she says. \"Never seen one so small.\" You stand up and walk toward her. \"I'm not a gargoyle.\" you tell her. \"I had a skin transplant. A gargoyle happened to be the donor.\" She takes another drink from her bottle and smiles. \"You must feel lucky huh?\" she asks. She's pretty talkative. Guess the alcohol must have loosened her up. \"Yeah, I do. I wouldn't have ended up with Petra if it wasn't for this skin.\" you tell her. Suddenly Mina reaches for the jar and takes the lid off. She then picks you up and carries you to the couch, where she sits back down. \"I was getting a little tired of standing there.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina sets you on her shoulder and relaxes again. Her shaggy hair is all around but its actually feels nice. \"So what about you?\" you ask, starting another conversation. \"You seem to know Petra and Rosalyn.\" Mina laughs as she takes another drink. \"I run into them a lot.\" she explains. \"I have a knack for getting into fights, and it gets out of hand sometimes.\" She puts her hooves on the table in front of her and kicks back. \"If they know you, then won't they come here to find you?\" you ask. \"Oh, I just moved in, so they won't know I'm here for a while.\" she tells you. Guess she's used to the cops if she treats them like visitors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mina continues to talk you notice she's still drinking. \"Uh, you like to drink huh?\" you ask. she doesn't answer but finishes her bottle. \"Well, thats that.\" she says, then pulls you off of her shoulder. \"Don't worry. If I do drink I only have one bottle.\" she says. You don't want to tell her that her one bottle was pretty big. Mina loses her grip and drops you, sending you into her cleavage. When you land you feel the softness and feel a little guilty. Her boobs are amazing! They're softer then Petra's and even bigger to boot! Being a cow it makes sense she'd have big breasts though. She giggles from above and fishes you out. \"Sorry little guy.\" she says, but then drops you again. This time you tumble down her shirt toward her lower half. You land on her udder and bounce along until you come to a stop. as you stand you get a good feel of her udder and feel her shiver. When you look toward her face she looks....</span></div></div>",

She then reaches down and pats you on the head a little roughly. \"I'm just gonna take a little nap, so you make yourself comfy.\" she says as she drifts off to sleep. \"Hey wait!\" you call up, but its too late. Mina is snoozing away on the couch while you sit on her massive udder. You sigh and stare up at the minotaur as she sleeps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to see if you can get off of her udder and wait for her to wake up. You walk along the cow's appendage and get a view of her apartment, as if you're staring from the top of a mountain. You consider try to slide from her udder to the couch but you might tumble to the floor if you're not careful. You groan slightly and decide to wait it out here. You walk around and eventually sit down. You absentmindedly lean back and rest your back on something. When you touch it you feel the ground shudder and Mina stirs in her sleep.You look behind you and see that you're leaning on one of her teats. Whoops, guess thats a sensitive part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to get up when you are doused with some kind of liquid. You look up and see a glob of milk trickling down her teat onto your head. She's producing milk now? You heard that minotaur women need to be milked every so often, guess she's about due. You get a little in your mouth and find that it tastes pretty good. Feeling bold, you decide to get another taste. You cup your hands to get some milk and gulp it down. You're careful not to actually touch her teat, remembering that you have a girlfriend. You're pretty sure Petra wouldn't like you fondling Mina's udder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mina moves in her sleep and you are thrown forward. You hit her teat face first and feel her shudder.

You were surprised because Janet was 825ft tall, meaning she was a full head taller than Roxy. She had bright red skin and long purple hair worn in a very long ponytail with two small horns on her forehead. You guess that not all gargoyles have horns since you know that Roxy didn't. Janet also had a pair of D-cup breasts and a chubby stomach (though not nearly as obese as Roxy's) but that was not what you noticed first. She had a HUGE ass that had to be at least as wide as she was tall. It made Roxy's fat ass look small in comparison. It was a wonder it could fit through the doorway because it was like the world's largest tomato. It made her jeans look more like a thong and you could even see her pink thong underneath and it resembled dental floss. She was also wearing a black tank-top that also looked tight on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Janet,\" says Roxy. \"Come right on in.\" You couldn't stop staring at Janet's booty as as walks in. You even look up as it casts a shadow over you. \"How's Stephen doing?\" said Janet. \"I heard what happened and I can't believe how cruel some people can be. I understand a lot of monsters eat humans but that was a little over the top there.\" Janet's long tail is right in front of you and you couldn't believe how minuscule it looked. It looked like a red spaghetti strand that got stuck between her cheeks. You couldn't help but stare. However, Janet then turned her head. \"Where is Stephen anyway?\" Janet bends down to look for you and her ass is dangerously close to you. It looks like Janet's rear is big enough to cover the entire couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Janet's butt presses against the couch and you slip and fall and have to grab onto Janet's tail, getting stuck between her cheeks yet. Janet feels you and then yanks you out before standing up. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Sorry. You must be Stephen. I'm Janet.\" \"Janet,\" you say. \"That's an odd name.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Janet in confusion. \"Well,\" you say trying to change the subject so Janet doesn't realize you've been staring at her butt. \"It's just that, Roxy, Petra...\" Roxy rolls her eyes. \"It rhymes with \"granite\".\" She explains. \"Oh!\" you yell. \"Oh! That's funny ass hell.\" Then you gasp. You said the word \"ass\". Then Janet begins to poke you. \"I hope that you're okay,\" she said. \"I still can't believe you have Roxy's skin now.\" Janet then notices the bandage on her sister's neck. \"Ouch,\" she says. \"Well, you should be safe now as soon as that heals. So, what's for dinner, Roxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy gives a smirk. \"Tomato soup.\" \"Yeah,\" you say. \"Thanks Roxy. A nice big fat red tomato.\" You then gasped. \"Butt... I mean but, that doesn't mean... Roxy, don't you think that's a little heiny, I mean a little Heinous! Heinous!\" Janet realizes what's going on and gives a laugh. \"Oh, I get it.\" Janet spanks herself and laughs again. \"I know. You see, my body is really weird. Most of the fat in my body goes right to my rear. Just look at this plump red tomato. Got me first place in Ms. Horrorville a few years ago.\" \"Ms. Horroville?\" you think to yourself. \"So Janet's a pageant queen.\" You wonder if female gargoyles were considered attractive based on their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon dinner is ready and Janet sits down, requiring three chairs to hold up her massive booty. You couldn't help but continue to stare. Janet then smirks. \"Sorry to disappoint you, but I've got my eye on someone else.\" \"You and Elisa and many others,\" says Roxy as she bites into stegosaurus steak. \"Still in the running are you?\" Janet gave a smirk. \"Yep. Just you wait, Edgar is going to be my husband and I'm going to bear his eggs, you'll see.\" \"Edgar?\" you ask. Roxy lets out a sigh and hands you a small slice of her meat. \"There's a male counselor at the camp that Janet works at. However, Janet has a lot of competition. Even Elisa.\" \"Bah,\" scoffed Janet. \"That hippopotamus isn't going to get my man.\" \"What species is he?\" you ask. \"Gargoyle? Werewolf?\" \"Human,\" said Janet. \"Although he was raised by a Nidhogg.\" \"Stephen, do you remember Sora? That's her brother.\" You heard that Sora had an adoptive human brother. You guessed that was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it dangerous for a human to work in a camp with so many female monsters?\" you ask. \"That's not a problem,\" says Janet. \"Edgar has been enchanted so he can't ever be killed. He's been eaten hundreds of times, sat on thousands of times, mostly by me, nothing can destroy him. Of course, there are a lot of girls after him besides me and Elisa. There's Dolly Fleece, a big fat golden weresheep who was raised by humans. She even keeps her folks in her cabin with her. There's that party animal pumpkin head, Nat, that garbage disposal kappa, Skyla, then there's Heloise, that hellhound deadbeat. She's only in the camp to avoid going back to jail. I reported her last week and got her in big trouble with Kaylee for bringing bourbon to the premises. Heck, there are even so girls who don't work at the camp who I have to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like Edgar is really popular.\" You say. \"Well,\" says Janet. \"Seeing as you're still recovering and won't be ready to return to work for days, Camp Darkly opens tomorrow. Perhaps you can be a guest.\" Roxy gives a look of worry. She's not 100% confident how well you'd do with all those little monster girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's your reply?</span></div></div>",

Edgar and Elisa and Janet can handle them but...\u201d Janet let out a scoff. \u201cIt\u2019s just for the day, Roxy. Don\u2019t get overheated.\u201d Roxy gives a sigh. \u201cOkay. But remember, just because he has new skin doesn\u2019t mean Stephen is indestructible.\u201d Janet gives a laugh. \"Oh don't worry. He'll be safe with me. Besides, they wouldn't have hired me as a counselor otherwise.\" Janet lets out another laugh and Roxy laughs as well, albeit more nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Janet is flying over the woods outside Horroville with you on her shoulder. You couldn\u2019t believe the number of trees. \u201cWow,\u201d you say. \u201cThis is a nice change of pace.\u201d Janet gives a laugh and then flies down and you arrive at a camp. The summer camp is called Camp Darkly from the looks on the sign and it was a rather large camp. \u201cHow many counselors are at the camp.\u201d \u201cIncluding Edgar and me,\u201d said Janet. \u201c13. There has to be at least 13 counselors. It\u2019s the law in these parts. The inspector threatened to shut us down otherwise.\u201d \u201cInspector?\u201d \u201cRobyn Queen,\u201d says Janet. \u201cShe\u2019s an obnoxious hobgoblin who\u2019s always on our case, badgering us about the safety of the camp.\u201d That Robyn sounded a lot like Stella from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the camp, you could see several of the counselors. First of them was a yellow-green skinned kappa with reddish brown spots and long green hair. She was apple-shaped with a big belly and D-Cup breasts and was stuffing her face with potato chips. She appeared to have finished five bags already and at one point she paused from eating her chips to bite into a whoopie pie. Clearly she was a bigger pig that Carmen. You take it that kappa woman was Skyla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a giant obese weresheep with a round booty (though not nearly as big as Janet\u2019s) and F-cup breasts. She had silver horns that curved downwards and long thick golden fleece that glittered. She was also wearing a pink version of the counselor uniform complete with bedazzles. That must\u2019ve been Dolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext of the girls was a chuby girl with long blonde hair and C-cup breasts. She looked almost normal if a little albino, except that her body looked like it was made of wood and she had a giant pumpkin for a head. She was giggling as she was putting up banners. That was clearly Nat. She appeared to be humming \u201cAre You Ready for the Summer\u201d to herself as she stopped and clapped her hands. She definitely looked like she belonged in a camp for little girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another girl showed up and you saw that that counselor looked anything but qualified for her job. She was a fat-gutted black-furred hellhound with horns where her ears should\u2019ve been, C-cup breasts, a devil\u2019s tail and long red hair. She was carrying a scrub brush and a bucket of cleaning supplies but what made you really surprised was that she was smoking a cigarette. And she\u2019s supposed to be working with children? The hellhound woman glares at Janet as she walks by. \u201cThanks for getting me stuck on latrine duty, asshole.\u201d Says the hellhound woman to Janet. \u201cWatch your language, Heloise,\u201d warns Janet. \u201cThere will soon be children present.\u201d Heloise just spits her cigarette at Janet\u2019s feet in spite. \u201cWow,\u201d you say. \u201cShe really doesn\u2019t like you.\u201d Janet lets out a scoff. \u201cShe\u2019s the competition. I have seven rivals for Edgar in the camp alone.\u201d You let out a whistle and then you hear a loud chewing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and see that there\u2019s an obese bright yellow-furred werewolf girl who looked like she was one of April\u2019s MANY cousins. She was wearing a red hood over her head and she also had golden brown hair. She had E-cups and a massive rear. You then see a skeletal human hand sticking out of the wolf girl\u2019s mouth and your skin turns pale. On her shoulder was a human who didn\u2019t seem afraid of her. He looked your age and had tan-skin and silver hair. You realize that that was probably Edgar. It would make sense that if he was immortal like Janet said he was, he wouldn\u2019t be afraid of the werewolf girl, but it should\u2019ve disturbed him that she was chowing down on a human. She quickly slurps the remains of her meal and then gags before she drinks from her canteen. \u201cYou ate too fast again, Miranda,\u201d says Edgar. \u201cYou always eat too fast.\u201d \u201cBite me, Edgar.\u201d Says the wolf woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s Edgar. He looks like quite a catch. But I\u2019m afraid that werewolf has him today.\u201d Janet gives a scoff. \u201cMiranda is a lesbian,\u201d she says. \u201cI have nothing to worry about from her. She\u2019s Edgar\u2019s best friend, not his girlfriend.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me? She\u2019s his version of Roxy? But she eats humans. Doesn\u2019t that bother him?\u201d Janet shrugs her shoulders and then smiles as she walks up to Miranda and Edgar and shakes her breasts and smirks. \u201cHello, Edgar. Happy first day of summer. Another year with big red. Rowr.\u201d Edgar blushes as Janet wiggles her tail and Miranda shrugs it off. Skyla and Dolly turn their heads and glare at Janet. Then Dolly notices you on Janet\u2019s shoulder and smirks. \u201cBe careful, Edgar. She\u2019s a cold-hearted snake. Looks like you\u2019re not satisfying enough for her.\u201d Edgar grunts and then looks in surprise to see you. Miranda notices you as well and you\u2019re concerned that she\u2019ll eat you. Then she sniffs you and raises an eyebrow. \u201cIs that a human? He smells like a gargoyle.\u201d You wave nervously as Janet turns around and glares at her rivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor your information, Stephen is a friend of my sister\u2019s. I barely even know him.\u201d \u201cBologna,\u201d says Skyla before she chews into a bologna sandwich. \u201cYou\u2019re already in the lead so you\u2019re being smug about your supposed beauty.\u201d \u201cGo stick your mouth back into a bag of potato chips, Skyla.\u201d Says Janet. Dolly gives an angry bleat. \u201cYou know, Janet, your arrogance is really irking me. I\u2019d kick your ass but I\u2019d lose a good foot in the process.\u201d \u201cLanguage! Your ears must be so stuffed with that ridiculous wool that you can\u2019t hear me, you ovine creep.\u201d You gulp. Yikes. You only saw four of Janet\u2019s rivals but three of them were already hostile to her. Poor Edgar has an entire harem of Aprils who\u2019d probably kill each other. That\u2019s when Nat notices you and lets out a squee. \u201cAnother friend! Sweet! Is he a new counselor? I\u2019m Nat! I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get along very well! Of course, I already have eyes for Edgar but I still like you as a friend, I hope!\u201d You raise an eyebrow. \u201cShe must have sugar for blood.\u201d Then Nat realizes something. \u201cHey, how come his skin looks weird?\u201d Skyla takes a closer look and is surprised. \u201cNat\u2019s right. His skin looks like a gargoyle\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because my sister gave him a skin graft. He was nearly cooked to death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar\u2019s face turns pale upon hearing that. \u201cOh geez.\u201d \u201cSo his skin was replaced with gargoyle skin,\u201d says Miranda. \u201cGuess I can\u2019t eat him.\u201d Edgar gives a glare at his friend. \u201cReally, Miranda?\u201d Miranda gave a scoff. \u201cI was joking. Sheesh. Just because I\u2019m the only counselor who eats humans, everyone picks on me.\u201d You give a gulp. What a crew Janet worked with.

Your new skin was blue, but thankfully not the cyan shade of blue like that tengu that got you into this mess to begin with. Your new skin appeared to have come from Fran. You're speechless. You now had the skin of a troll. Roxy gives an uneasy look. \"When Fran heard about how severe the damage those two did to you was, we didn't have to twist her arm for her to be a skin donor. Sorry, if it's a ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue,\" you say. \"I'm going to be blue for the rest of my life.\" You then start to scratch at your exposed body. \"Not to mention itchy,\" you grumble. \"It feels like there's sandpaper under this skin.\" Roxy gently grabs one of your arms between her clawed fingertips. \"Don't scratch,\" she says. \"You might reopen the skin before it sets. The nurse said you were practically a skeleton until they grafted that blue skin on you. One wrong move and your insides might fall apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a groan and have to hold your nose to cough. You smelled like troll blood. Fran must've given up a very sensitive part of skin to help you heal. \"Thanks Roxy,\" you say. \"I seriously thought you were going to eat me.\" Roxy gives a look that almost seems like she's offended. \"Never ever, I'll admit I could stand to lose some weight, but I'd never eat a human. That was a horrible trick for them to play on you. Mesa's lucky she's not in jail with Hannah for nearly killing a lifeguard. I heard she relocated to Fearfield. Carmen is going crazy waiting for us to find a replacement chef.\" You let out a grunt. \"I hope the next one's a vegetarian. Nearly made into a burger by a cow, if that's not irony I don't know what is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Roxy turns her head and you stand up in the hospital bed as you hear footsteps. One of the nurses, a giant hourglass shaped weredeer girl with gold colored antlers, came forward. \"You've got a visitor to check up on you Mr. Dukes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy moves to the side as another monster walks forward carrying a big bouquet of flowers, but who is it?</span></div></div>",

You feel the pressure of her teeth as they cut through the bun just below your feet.  The bun around you begins getting chewed up as you slip out onto Roxy\u2019s tongue. You are now where you never thought you would end up. Within the moist cavern of roxy\u2019s mouth. \u201cRoxy!\u201d you shout \u201cStop Eating its me Stephen!\u201d but judging by the fact that she was still chewing she clearly couldn\u2019t hear you. And if the noises she was making were any indication it was clear that she was enjoying the burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside Hannah and Mesa exchange knowing smiles as Roxy compliments Mesa on her cooking. \u201cThis has got to be the best burger I\u2019ve ever had\u201d she says \u201cNew recipe?\u201d Mesa smiles \u201cNo its an old recipe with a bit of a . . . Familiar new ingredient\u201d Mesa chuckles. Roxy slows down her chewing and fixes Mesa with a confused look \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cOh nothing you need to concern yourself with honey, just chef talk.\u201d She says quickly covering up her slip of the tongue \u201cIf you like it so much I may give you the recipe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue dodging Roxy\u2019s tongue as you try and call out to your partner. Due to the conversation going on outside however Roxy cannot hear you. As she closes her lips one final time you catch a glimpse of Hannah smiling evilly at you. Raising her hand she gives you a slight wave and mouths the words \u201cHave a nice trip\u201d before you are sealed away in Roxy\u2019s mouth. You start to scream as Roxy raises her head up but are cut of as her tongue finally gains purchase on you. You are forced against the roof of her mouth and pushed back with the chewed remains of the burger. You get a sinking sensation as you hear a large gulp and are forced into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa and Hannah exchange grins as they see a bulge travel down Roxy\u2019s throat and disappear behind her collarbone. She lets out a burp ad pats her gut. Soon Roxy has finished off the burger and has begun wiping her mouth off. \u201cDamn that was a good meal\u201d she says letting out another burp to accentuate her point \u201cYou hhve to give me that recipe Mesa\u201d \u201cWell here is a writeup of the recipe honey\u201d Mesa says with a smile \u201ceverything you need to know is on there, and I can make that for you any time.\u201d \u201cThanks Mesa\u201d Roxy says as she quickly reads the ingredient list \u201cWait what is this?\u201d she says suddenly shocked \u201cDoes this say human?!?!\u201d. \u201cOf course suggah you know I use humans in most of my recipes\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t use them in this burger did you?\u201d Roxy asks. \u201cWell of course I did.

I just love the taste and feel of the little critters going down my throat.\" Mesa swings her hips as she says this, but this just makes Roxy feel even more sick. \"But I'm a gargoyle, Mesa!\" yells Roxy. \"Gargoyles aren't supposed to eat humans! We're supposed to <i>protect humans from getting eaten</i>.\" Mesa shrugs her shoulders and smiles. \"I'm sure that once in a while a garg gal likes to experiment with her diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy gets up and walks away feeling her stomach in guilt. \"I can't believe I just ate a human,\" she said. \"And liked it. This isn't good. I needy to work this out, maybe stop by a bar after work and maybe see how well the little morsels do with rum. Oh my gosh! What am I saying?! Calm down Roxy. Man, what am I going to tell Stephen. Right now I can't help but see my best friend wrapped in a hotdog bun with mustard. Where is Stephen anyway? I gotta find him before some predator gets him. And then I can have him all to myself.\" Roxy grabs herself by the mouth in horror at her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Roxy didn't know was that you were in fact in her belly. It was enormous. Given how fat Roxy was, it would be possible to build a human city in her ginormous gut. You look around in horror as you stand on bits of digesting burger. You always lived in fear a monster would eat you, but you never thought that it would be Roxy. Not to mention you were so burned from Mesa cooking you that you could barely stand at all. You look around and see remains of fishbones and dinosaur bones and they were slowly eroding. Unfortunately, the burger you were on was eroding just as fast. You weakly look down at the stomach acid and cough. If you fell in there, you'd wind up as nothing more than a few extra inches on Roxy's fat ass. You had to get her attention. It wasn't too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly grab a fishbone and row your dissolving burger boat until you reach the edge of the stomach. You start to pound on Roxy's bloated stomach wall from the inside, making small bulges appear where her navel would be if she didn't come from an egg-laying species. \"Roxy!\" you shout. \"Roxy! It's me, Stephen! I'm in your tummy! You gotta throw me up right now!\" You look back to see the burger was dissolving beneath your feet. If Roxy didn't hear you, you'd melt in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does your obese gargoyle friend hear you?</span></div></div>",

I don't really feel like getting sued.\" Hannah realizes this, but unfortunately, she knows how to lie with a straight face on. \"Oh, are you kidding? What kind of naga doesn't like slurping down humans. It's not as if Connie doesn't know how to swallow her prey.\" Mesa lets out a groan and you would say that Hannah is lying but she unwittingly covers your mouth with a finger and then shrugs her shoulders. \"I hope you're right Hannah.

Maybe you can observe her art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was also Opal, the carbuncle fortune teller in her tent of telekinesis.

You didn't know if she even liked humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could check on Mesa, that minotaur girl who runs the beach grill. She was very friendly when you and Roxy made your rounds and gave you free food sometimes. But she did always joke about making you into a meal one day. At least, you hope that she's joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was April, that pear shaped dire werewolf girl. She ran a trinket store where she made jewelry out of shells and tiles on the beach. But April was just crazy about you and wanted you as her boyfriend. You're certain she jiggled that big behind all the time as to get your attention. Of course, you're afraid to find out how far she'd go to have you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there was a monster you didn't know that well, Laura, the four headed hydra scuba diver and she was walking forward in her wetsuit right now. Of course, everyone told you she was nothing but Horrorville trash and that she doesn't belong in Terrordale.

She is the artist after all. \"Its really good, did you paint me by memory?\" She gets shy again. \"Yes, I studied you whenever I saw you.\" You think that she could have just asked you to model for her, but then remember how shy she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its pretty good.\" you say. \"Do you have any paintings of anyone else?\" She shakes her head. \"No, this is the first one I've done.

You rise higher and higher into the air as Roxy chases the obnoxious fairy. \"Roxy!\" you try to call out to her. She doesn't seem to be paying attention though. Looks like Stella has her full attention. You hope to god that she doesn't accidentally let go of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two winged monsters are now well into the sky. Stella seems to be staying ahead and out of Roxy's reach. Your gargoyle friend is flying quite fast but can't quite catch her. They go straight, in circles and even do some loops. Meanwhile you feel like you're going to throw up. At least you haven't been dropped yet. Stella is pretty confident that she won't get caught so she turns around in mid-flight. \"You don't really think you can catch me do you? Its a miracle something this heavy can even get into the air! I'll bet your wings are about to fall off!\" she calls out. Stella's taunts give Roxy the extra push she needs. She grits her teeth and makes her wings work overtime. She moves a little faster, then suddenly has a burst of speed. This catches Stella off guard, and she finds herself in the gargoyle's grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy grabs her and you are flung from her claws in the process. You scream like crazy but don't appear to be headed for the ground. Instead you find yourself caught between the two monsters. As they grapple and struggle with each other you are bounced off of their bodies. Since their so close together they're keeping you contained with their bodies. You hope that you can survive this midair cat fight. Eventually Roxy gets the better of Stella and the two of them begin to go down. You feel the descent and pray that their bodies will cushion your fall. Soon they hit the ground with a huge boom and continue to fight. Roxy is clearly stronger than the fairy and pins her down. Before she can deliver a well deserved punch however, she is interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxy. What you doing?\" asks Fran, your supervisor. She happened to be there when the two of them landed. Roxy and Stella both jump to their feet and try to explain themselves. \"We just bumped into each other while we were flying.\" Stella says quickly. \"Thats right, and I was trying to help her up.\" Roxy adds. Fran's not the brightest monster, so she buys their story. \"Okay. You be more careful. Now have nice day!\" she says with a smile and walks away. The two girls glare at each other. \"I'll get you next time you pest.\" Roxy says. \"Whatever.\" Stella responds and the two of them go their separate ways. Meanwhile you find yourself wedged deeply in someone's cleavage. You ended up here during their rough landing. Who's cleavage is it? </span></div></div>",

It was Roxy and you were shaking in her boobs as the titanic yellow orbs shook. \"Roxy!\" you shout. \"Roxy!\" The gargoyle giantess looks down and then lifts you up with her claws as her boobs bounce. \"I'm sorry about that Stephen,\" she said. \"Mother Weisman, I should've made sure you were safe first. Ooh, that Stella makes me so mad. Not only was she mean to Kath, but she had to...\" Roxy grits her teeth and her eyes turned red just thinking about that obnoxious sprite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fairy had quite a mouth on her and one of the things you appreciated the least about her was the fact that she seemed to think that a girl had to be skinny to be beautiful. It's not Roxy's fault that next to nobody can be as skinny as a fairy. Nothing more than flying twigs. Personally, you thought Roxy looked like a bombshell, but you were into SSBBW monster girls like Connie. Nothing set off Roxy more than when somebody made fun of her weight and as you sit on the gargoyle's shoulder and she flies into the air, you wonder how you could teach Stella a lesson about the female body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass and it's closing time at the beach. Roxy lays you on the ground before waving at you. \"Well,\" says your gargoyle friend. \"It's quitting time, Stephen. I'll be seeing you tomorrow.\" \"Have a good night, Roxy.\" You say. Roxy lets out a laugh. \"I'm a gargoyle, Stephen. Every night's a good night for me.\" You're walking back to the lifeguard station and you're about to climb the ladder to your home in the fire cabinet but then somebody kicks the ladder and causes it to break as you yell and fall to the ground. \"Oopsie.\" Says a mocking voice. You look up and see Stella laughing at you and looking down on you. No doubt she was the one who broke your ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she has the nerve to kick you to the side before walking out and laughing. You let out a grumble. Thanks to that stupid fairy, you couldn't even get into your own room. \"I'm starting to hate fairies.\" You say to yourself. Well, you figure that while it is risky, maybe there was still somebody on the beach who could help you get in the fire extinguisher cabinet. Or eat you if you were unlucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure you'd walk close to the KDP. Maybe Whitney or Diana was punching out and could help you. But as you're walking ahead, you are almost trampled by a giant pink cat's pawn and you yell. You look up to see a monster giantess dressed as a gypsy woman. It was Opal, the fortuneteller and from the looks of it, she heard your scream. \"Stephen?\" she asks. \"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in your fire cabinet?\" You grunt. \"Stella broke my ladder, Opal. Could you lend me a hand.\" Opal let out a growl. \"Stella,\" she says with venom in her voice. \"I should've known. Don't worry.\" Opal picks you up and then walks into the lifeguard station to take you back into the house and even took some tape from a nearby desk to repair the ladder. \"There,\" says the fortuneteller. \"That should fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Opal,\" you say. \"Man, that Stella is the biggest bitch I've ever met. How did she become a lifeguard with her bad attitude.\" \"Well,\" says Opal. \"You obviously haven't met the fair folk. Most of them are real donut holes.\" You mumble. \"But not only did Stella torment me, she bullied Kath earlier and she made fun of Roxy's weight... again. I'd like to...\" Opal then gave a smile. \"This one's on the house.\" She said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Opal returned to her tent and drew two magic symbols on a piece of wood and put two wax figurines on the symbols. One was sculpted to look like Roxy and the other was made to look like Stella. Opal said some magic words and the symbols lit up and made the figurines glow. Opal kept chanting and then the wax figurines lit on a magical fire before she smiled. \"Let's see how Stella likes it when the shoe is on the other foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you wake up early and decide to go on an early patrol. If Opal hadn't fixed the ladder that Stella broke, you'd never be able to get down. As you walk forward, you see a shadow and look up into the air to see a flying monster and look in surprise.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts had gotten only slightly bigger but now her stomach had to be at least 700ft wide to say nothing of her ass and hurricane hips. Her face was so chubby that she barely looked like she had a neck anymore. As she landed her bulbous feet on the ground, it created a loud earthquake and sandstorm that knocked you off of your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stella?!\" you yell out in surprise. \"What happened to you?\" Stella bent over and looked down at you with a glare. \"I'm pretty sure you happened to me somehow, you little twerp!\" The now titanically obese fairy yells at you. You gag as Stella grabs you in her grip and holds you up to her face. \"I should stomp you into oblivion right now,\" says your fairy nemesis as she positions you dangerously close to her enormous lips. \"Or perhaps I should turn you into a bloody smear on my ass now that it's as big as that gargoyle bitch's!\" That's when you notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stella!\" you yell. \"Your hair!\" Stella looks to her side and gasps because the side of her hair now had a distinctive white highlight. Stella gasped. \"Opal,\" you say realizing who did this. \"She did this. She must've put a curse on you.\" Stella drops you in her sandals and squeezes you between her index and big toes before stomping off to confront Opal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Opal was polishing her crystal ball when Stella stomped in. \"You dirty carbuncle!\" yelled Stella. \"Doing this to a fellow fae!\" The carbuncle turns around and purrs as she looks at Stella. \"I see you've finally got your comeuppance for all the times you were a jerk,\" says Opal. \"But it gets a lot worse than merely shifting weight with Roxy.\" Stella unclenches her toes and you gasp for air as you jump off the giant fairy's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Stella demands from Opal. \"Well,\" said Opal. \"Notice that white lock in your hair. Every time you're rude, insulting or otherwise unnecessarily mean, you'll age.\" Stella gasps and sees that she now has a white highlight on both sides of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you stood on the floor with Opal. This was going to be good. Stella is forced to carry you back to the lifeguard house. \"This isn't happening,\" Stella muttered. \"Fairies aren't supposed to get old. This sucks. Now I have to be nice to humans.\" You let out a laugh and Stella is about to get rough with you but quickly remembers that she didn't want to be fat <i>and</i> old and quickly zips her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you two get back...</span></div></div>",

You look down to see a pair of orange wings beating at high speed and  spraying fairy dust all around. You must've gotten stuck in Stella's cleavage during that scuffle. Of all the rotten luck. You were stuck to a pixie with a bad attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella was laughing to herself as she flew over the beach. \"If that gargoyle's brain was as big as her ass I'd really have been in trouble. Maybe I should've told that stupid troll that barbarian attacked me. It's not as if she needs this job. Something tells me she won't starve.\" As Stella is laughing, you get more annoyed with her and try to lower your neck to bite her, but you're stuck too tight. The only good part was that Stella didn't appear to have noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the beach, a young goblin girl is building a sandcastle, which gives Stella an idea as she smirks. Stella flies down too fast to be seen and completely obliterates the sandcastle before that sprite flies off to laugh as the goblin girl is in tears. With the way Stella is rotten towards the beachgoers, it makes you wonder how she got a job as a lifeguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Stella flies off, laughing to herself. \"I love being a fairy. Oh, but I'm so bored. And I'm starving. Maybe Mesa has something yummy. Maybe a nice salad. Wouldn't want to blimp up like a certain gargoyle.\" Stella lets out that annoying laugh again and you get more annoyed. \"But then again, I wonder how Paisley's doing today? I could use some company from one monster on the beach almost as beautiful as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly very scared. You always suspected Stella was friends with that man eating mermaid.

While Kath did look great in the painting, what surprised you the most was the sight of your very own form right besides her. While at first glance it did appear just like any typical human, but there was no denying the keen features on the figure. \"wow...\" you mutter gazing up at the painting in awe and slight confusion. \"it looks great...but...why exactly did you add me?\" you ask her with a slightly raised brow. \"I wasn't really in the landscape...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Kath's furred face exhibited an even deeper shade of red by the comment as she quickly averts her eyes and raises her shoulders slightly. \"Is...I-is it strange?\" she asks in a concerned tone, as if unsure she did something insulting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! not at all!\" you quickly retort while waving your hands up dismissively. \"I'm not angry or anything...it's just...that I'm just curious why you wanted to add me.\" you ask truthfully as Kath's large head slowly turns back to the painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-well...\" she stammers. \"I...I just thought it would seem right to add you in the painting...s-seeing as how you work here.\" She replies, though to be honest it was hard to tell if she was being completely honest or not. Unsure whether or not you should press on with questioning her artistic inclusion, you ultimately decide to drop the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you nod your head acceptingly while gazing at the small painting of you. \"well, you certainly do have my scale perfect.\" You add humorously as a small giggle managed to escape Kath above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks.\" She replies before finally turning to gaze down upon your miniscule form. As you return a gaze up at her huge orbs, one dying question soon manages to envelop your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kath?\" you call the massive feline curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-y-yeah?\" She stammers with wide eyes for a brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to seem intrusive...but how come you spend most of your time alone?\" While you were already well aware of how shy she was, you always did wonder how she would be like if she was to hang out with either you or one of the other beachgoers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long pause emerged from the question as Kath once again averts her eyes. \"w-well...you see...I'm not so social around...others.\" she states<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?...well...why not just hang out with others on the beach?\" you ask curiously. \"there's tons of people here, and I'm sure you'll manage to make some really awesome friends if you get out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKath's eyes widen by the suggestion as a shade of red became visible underneath her fur, \"b-but...what if they don't like me, or what if I'm too strange or something?\" she counters as her voice quivered slightly. Just by her tone alone, it seemed she was extremely anxious about interacting with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...why not hang out with someone who's a regular here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"l-l-like who?\" Kath replies as her head slowly cocks to the left.</span></div></div>",

Shelia had turned the station into a complete mess, with so much garbage everywhere that the main door would barely open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the issue of food. She had cleaned out the entirety of the lifeguard station's kitchen, and even Mesa was saying food she cooked was dissapearing. Though you wondered how, since it seemed Shelia was too lazy to even get off the couch. And she just kept getting fatter, to the point where the couch broke under her weight. She didn't seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Shelia was one of the rudest people you'd ever met. Anyone who came into contact with her got insulted and belched at.

You look up and see the giantess and from the looks of it she was an enormous and obese pear-shaped wereleopard who was wearing a white tanktop and blue jacket with the a nametag reading \u201cMia\u201d and a tight pair of jeans that left her butt visible, much like a plumber\u2019s crack. She had bright gold and white fur over her body and black spots but with long red hair and a scar on her right ear. However, the most startling feature was that her right arm was completely mechanical. It reminded you of that one-armed ogopogo girl, Shelby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal herself seemed surprised and disturbed to see the leopard giantess. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d the carbuncle fortuneteller says. \u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d asked Mia. Opal gave a hiss. \u201cExcuse me? I have more right to be here than you. This is my Tent of Telekinesis.\u201d The leopard giantess blinks and then rubs her chin with her mechanical arm. \u201cYou mean that this isn\u2019t a changing room? Damn.\u201d The girl whacks herself in the face before she walks out. You\u2019re forced to run to avoid getting stepped on and then you yell as you trip and grab the leopard lady\u2019s tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in turn startles the leopard woman and she looks down at you before she plucks you off of her tail with her mechanical arm. It felt strange being in a robotic hand. It was so cold and felt like a pair of metallic rocks. You even shiver before the leopard takes you up to her face and notices your lifeguard uniform. \u201cA human lifeguard on a beach for giant monsters?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou must be Stephen.\u201d You were confused. You had never seen this titaness in your life and yet this 850ft high wereleopard knew your name. For that matter, why wasn\u2019t she eating you? After all, she was clearly a carnivorous monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even think of the matter, you hear a flapping noise and Roxy soars down from the sky and notices the feline giantess. \u201cMia?\u201d asks your gargoyle friend. \u201cRoxy!\u201d yells the leopard girl. Mia places you on her shoulder before she and Roxy exchange a large hug and laugh to each other. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in months, you metal moggy,\u201d says Roxy. \u201cI see that ass of yours has gotten bigger.\u201d Mia gives a purr and a laugh. \u201cLike you\u2019re really one to talk about people\u2019s weight. Janet and Petra grew past you in height because you were too busy growing the other way.\u201d Roxy just gives a scoff and then notices you. \u201cOh. Hey, Stephen.\u201d Roxy takes you from Mia\u2019s shoulder and you blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know this woman?\u201d you ask your gargoyle friend. Roxy gives a scoff. \u201cOf course I know her,\u201d says Roxy. \u201cStephen. Meet my cousin Mia.\u201d You look at Roxy in surprise and then look at Mia. Did Roxy seriously say that Mia was her cousin? Wereleopards and gargoyles aren\u2019t even similar species and you weren\u2019t really sure how gargoyles were classified in the animal kingdom. Heck, wereleopards are born alive while gargoyles hatch from eggs. You then decide to speak your mind. \u201cRoxy,\u201d you say. \u201cMia\u2019s a wereleopard. You\u2019re a gargoyle. How could she be your cousin?\u201d Mia gives a scoff. \u201cI\u2019m adopted,\u201d she says. \u201cDuh.\u201d Well, that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMia lives in Direopolis,\u201d says Roxy. \u201cIt\u2019s a mountaintop village that\u2019s half a day away from Terrordale. I didn\u2019t even know you were coming Mia.\u201d Mia gave a laugh. \u201cSurprise, cousin. I take it Janet and Petra still live in Horrorville? How\u2019s Aunt Gaia doing?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s doing as well as she can in the monster world\u2019s worst city.\u201d Mia gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me? Panicburg is an amusement park compared to Direopolis. I still can\u2019t believe that I moved to a town that\u2019s practically a giant asylum.\u201d \u201cAsylum? Like the KDP?\u201d you ask. Roxy lets out a sigh. \u201cDireopolis is a very strange town. From what Mia tells me, the townsfolk are all quirky bordering on insanity. At least those six weirdos who run that restaurant you told me about keep you from starving.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d you ask. Mia lets out a sigh. \u201cThere are three human-monster couples who run a restaurant called Neo Neapolitan that\u2019s a magnet for trouble. I\u2019m a handycat, which means every time something breaks, they call me to fix it. I spend so much time there, I practically eat nothing but pizza since I\u2019m too busy for normal meals. That\u2019s why I came here. I needed a vacation. Ugh. I\u2019ll bet that by the time I get home, there\u2019ll be a huge crater in its place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy let out a laugh. \u201cCome on, Mia. I\u2019ll take you to the changing tents.\u201d Roxy walks her feline cousin down the beach, all while you can\u2019t help but stare at Mia\u2019s mechanical arm. \u201cMia,\u201d you say nervously. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what happened to your arm?\u201d Mia just stares at you before speaking in a blunt tone. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d You nod your head and then Mia enters a changing room to change into her bathing suit. As Mia is changing, you crawl up to Roxy\u2019s ear. \u201cSeriously, Roxy,\u201d you say. \u201cWhat\u2019s with Mia\u2019s arm? I didn\u2019t know cyborgs actually existed.\u201d Roxy stares at you. \u201cStephen,\u201d she says. \u201cYou seriously don\u2019t want to know how Mia lost her arm. Fortunately there\u2019s a eccentric inventor in Direopolis and she built Mia a replacement arm. \u201cDid it hurt to put it on her?\u201d Roxy gave a scoff. \u201cOh yeah, it hurt. My aunt had to hold Mia\u2019s good hand while she was being grafted. Then that madwoman remembered after she put the arm in that she had anesthetic.\u201d\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Mia came out wearing a...</span></div></div>",

Strangely the feet almost looked human. This was one of those humanoid monsters and the toenails, now the size of mountains at your shrunken size, were painted with gold colored polish with star designs on them. You recognized these feet all too well. \"You have got to be kidding me.\" You mutter to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see this titaness was wearing a red and red lifeguard's uniform similar to your own, but you knew for a fact it wasn't Roxy. No, this was Stella, your most hated coworker. Stella was a giant fairy, though smaller than Roxy and Fran (unsurprising given their species). If you didn't work here, she'd be the shortest monster working at the beach. She had long blonde hair and orange sparkling wings. She looked like a fairy from a TV show you saw a long time ago. Ironically, that fairy was also named Stella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the reason Stella was your least favorite coworker was because she was <i>very</i> condescending towards humans and mocked you every time she got the chance. The day she started work and you first met her, she kicked sand over you. That pixie had a rotten attitude and if you were her size you'd pull her wings right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had to get to safety before Stella stepped on you and pushed you into the sand, so you jump on Stella's sandal and hide between her big and index toes. You cover your mouth and cough. Who would've thought fairies would have a bad case of foot odor. As you're coughing, you hear Stella giving that annoying laugh of hers, magnified louder because of your smaller size, nearly deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirty minutes in and Stephen hasn't punched in yet. Stupid human. Maybe now Fran will finally fire him.\" She laughs again and you give an annoyed look. Stella always knew how to get on your nerves. \"Wouldn't it be great if he got eaten by a bandersnatch or something? It would be his own fault for getting shipwrecked on monster shores. That's human stupidity for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella laughed again and you grit your teeth. Why did Fran have to hire that obnoxious sprite? She was completely insufferable. Then she said something to really make you angry. \"After all, he's just a seeing eye dog for that leather winged blimp Roxy. Seven years of experience and these days she needs that human to look over her shoulder. Then again, a gargoyle who can't see her toes needs all the sight she can get. And I'll bet she's a fossil, considering her \"little\" sister has hair so white they could build a ski-lift on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella laughs to herself at the insults she thought she was saying to herself about both you and Roxy. You had had it with her up to this point. \"Oh that is it,\" you say. \"Take this fairy bitch!\" You knew it was stupid and there was a chance Stella would find you even if you were shrunken to the size of a grain of sand to a 300 foot fairy, but you decided to run up between her toes and bite her, just to take out your frustration of her rotten attitude towards her fellow lifeguards. But will Stella notice it?</span></div></div>",

Looking up, it's impossible to see her face past her gigantic breasts, but if you had to guess, she was surveying the beach. Giving you a precious few moments to get a hold of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy's claw was, in and of itself, large enough to walk across without danger of falling off. It was at least...30 feet long? And that was only her claw! Looking ahead, you noticed an even larger, more yellow-tinted landmass up ahead that you knew had to be her gigantic...pinkie toe. This was bad. How small had that carbuncle made you?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you slammed into her claw as her foot rose into the air, Roxy probably beginning to walk. Your stomach lurched as you rose higher and higher into the air, the toe moving faster then you previously thought possible for a living creature. Finally, it slowed to a stop near Roxy's knees, and it began to descend once more as she took a step...only you weren't descending with it. Her foot movements had actually sent you flying a little bit, catapulting you upwards off of Roxy in effect. Yelling as loud as you could (although you doubted she could hear you), you began to fall once more, sailing past Roxy's gigantic visage as you fell towards the sand, large enough to be sharp, jagged rocks ripe for impaling you on impact. Is this really how it's going to end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were so light now that your descent was considerably slower, and to an outside observer you'd be gently floating down towards the ground, if they even saw you at all. Of course, it sure didn't seem that way for you. You'd probably still die on impact! But there was one plus to it; it sure as hell made you easier to catch, even by accident. And sure enough, as Roxy took another step forward, you could barely react as Roxy walked right into you, causing you to slam into her swimsuit at an alarming speed, stopping your descent but sending you sprawling as you tried to recover as she continued to walk, with disregard for your existence.

So all you could do was hope the didn't do anything drastic. \"Hello Stephen, darling!\" Says April as she bends down to see you, giving you a view of her cleavage. \"Hi, April.\" You say as politely as possible \"Nice swimsuit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril smiles from ear to ear when you say that. \"Do you like it? I picked it especially for you.\" She spins around to show you her back, revealing the bottom of her bikini to be nothing more than a thong, her huge, rounded rump in plain view, with her tail wagging above it.  \"So Stephen, I was wondering, maybe you would like to, oh I don't know, spend the day with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that if you wanted to see the end of this day, you had better agree. April was obsessed with you, and if you refused, who knows what she would do? You reluctantly accept her offer. April gives a small squeezing of delight before picking you up and placing you snuggly between her breasts. \"Comfy?\" You wouldn't say it out loud, but you actually we're kind of enjoying you current spot. As April heads back to her jewelry stand, she is approached by someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

She looked a lot like April, especially in the face, but had darker fur and curlier hair that was let down rather than in April's huge ponytail. She was also heavy like April except she looked as fat as Roxy and was wearing a rose and purple split colored one piece bikini. April's eyes pop as she sees this other werewolf and gives a worried look as she uses a finger to jam you further into her cleavage. \"Hey!\" you yell. \"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stuck down so much only your head is showing and April shushs you. \"Be quiet Stephen honey,\" she says. \"I forgot she was visiting. My cousin Lupa from Horrorville. You do not want her seeing you. She loves humans but not in the way I do. She'd eat you in a heartbeat.\" You gulp loudly. This was terrific. Another Paisley, except this one wasn't confined to the water. If you wanted to get out of this alive, you had to stay in April's breasts as Lupa walks forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April!\" yells Lupa. \"Hey you! How's it going?\" April and her cousin walk up to each other and share a French kiss as their breasts and pushed into each other. You see Lupa's cleavage is on par with her cousins. You liked BBWs but if you showed yourself you'd be seeing this one from the inside. \"So Lupa,\" says April. \"What brings you here?\" Lupa just lets out a sigh and fixes her hair. \"I just wanted to see my favorite cousin. Even if she is a weirdo.\" What did she mean by... oh, that's right. Lupa probably knows about April's crush on you and it would only make sense that she'd find it weird, to her it was making love with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's everything at the old jewelry stand?\" asked Lupa. April lets out a giggle. \"Well, I never run out of supplies with the waves doing my shopping.\" April laughs at her joke and you sweat in her cleavage. It was unbearably hot and you couldn't move your arms or legs. You really hope Lupa doesn't see you, she was even drooling slightly before she wiped her mouth. She looked like she was hadn't eaten a human for some time and was craving one like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's everything back in Horrorville? You still working at that fashion company.\" \"Best designer they have. You should see what I have planned for the Summer.\" April then gives a frown and you notice she was going to ask a sensitive question. \"So, have you caught R.L. yet?\" Lupa just gives an angry growl. \"That little snack has been lucky so far, but one day, I'm going to gobble him up.\" Lupa gnashes her teeth and you shake in April's breasts. This woman was just as bad as Paisley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Lupa decided to ask April a question that she herself was extremely uncomfortable with. \"What's this I hear about you having a human boyfriend?\" April gives a proud smile and giggles as she squeezes her breasts together, making you groan as you're squeezed between them. \"Oh you mean Stephen? The cutest thing. You know, he is a lifeguard here.\" Lupa just rolls her eyes. \"You're weird. That's like a cat dating a canary. I gotta tell you one thing, Stephen had better really be your boyfriend, cause otherwise...\" Lupa gives an evil smile and licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize something. This must've been a trap to get you to agree to be April's boyfriend. April didn't forget Lupa was coming. Why that sneaky wolf. What now?</span></div></div>",

How could someone as friendly as April have such an obviously predatory savage as her cousin. \"I have an idea,\" says April to her cousin. \"Why don't we head off to Mesa's bar and grill for lunch. She's a good friend of my and she'll got the most awesome burgers, fish and if you're in to it, I think she cooks humans.\" Upon hearing the word humans, Lupa's mouth begins to water and some of her drool even flew off on you and you gagged as you swallowed it. \"You had me at humans cuz. Let's go.\" Both wolf women shook their tails as they made their way up to Mesa's grill and bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are bounced about deep in April's shaking cleavage as the dire werewolf who insists on having you as her boyfriend smiled and winked down on you. \"Don't worry,\" she whispered to you. \"Lupa's not going to eat my boyfriend. That's you.\" April giggles and you let out a grunt. If Lupa saw you, you'd have to pretend to be April's boyfriend just to avoid getting eaten and judging from Lupa's heavy body weight, she was even more predatory than Paisley. She even licked her lips. \"I haven't had humans cooked in a while,\" she says. \"It would taste so sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril gives a look of disgust. \"Why do you like eating humans so much Lupa?\" asks April. Lupa turns and gives a WTF face at her cousin. \"April, we're werewolves. Anything small enough to fit in our mouths, especially humans, is food. Besides you eat sheep and goats alive.\" You gulp. You didn't know April ate the livestock of humans. \"That's different,\" says April. \"Humans are so cute.\" Lupa lets out a look of disgust. \"Please stop before you kill my appetite. I'd like to meet that human boyfriend of yours. That Stephen as you call him. If he's not a loyal boyfriend, he's going down the old hatch, you know that right.\" April shakes her head. \"No wonder you're still single. 130 years old and you can't get a date.\" \"130!?\" you ask. Lupa was alive when Jack the Ripper was? Lupa didn't look a day over 18. Werewolves must take longer to age than humans. If that was true, how old was April?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" you mumble to yourself. \"She's a wolf and a cougar.\" Lupa lets out a sigh. \"I may not approve of my cousin dating a human, but April, listen to your heart and not to the voices in your head like Persephone did.\" Lupa gave a sad look at that thought and April gave the sad look. You tug on one of April's strands of hair and the pear shaped dire wolfess looks down on you. \"Who's Persephone?\" April whispered down to you so Lupa couldn't hear her. \"Persephone is a cousin of ours we don't like to talk about. She's currently in prison.\" \"What did she do? Rob a bank?\" April sadly swung her head a few times. \"She murdered tens of innocent monsters, cooked their corpses and ate them.\" You nearly had a heart attack. April had a cannibal in her family. April lowers her head as she squeezes her breasts together, making you grunt. \"It took seven gargoyles to take her down and now we're not even allowed to visit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver and shake and then Lupa turns her head. \"Who are you talking to?\" she asks. \"Uh no one.\" Says April nervously. Lupa shrugs it off and soon the two reach Mesa's grill. The minotaur woman was washing dishes as both her breasts and her udder jiggled. \"Morning Mesa.\" Said April. Mesa turns around and spots April. \"Howdy there April,\" said Mesa in her southern accent. \"Who's your friend.\" \"This is Lupa, my cousin from Horrorville.\" Mesa drops one of her dishes in the sink and lets out an angry snort as you hide deeper into April's fur. \"Horrorville?!\" yells Mesa. \"Your cousin is from Horrorville!?\" Monsters from Horrorville and Terrordale were deadly enemies and hated each other with a passion. Both twin cities have been feuding since they were founded and you had no idea why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa snorts at Lupa but Lupa waves her hand. \"Leave me alone bossy, I ain't here to cause any trouble. Just a friendly visit to my weird cousin. She tells me you're a regular kitchen wizard and I'm a little bit of a carnivore.\" Lupa licks her lips. Mesa actually stops being angry and lets out a giggle. \"That's good to hear,\" she said. \"Just wait right here.\" Mesa returns to the grill and you see that Lupa is picking her teeth with her claws.\" \"She looks hungry,\" you tell April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril lets out a sigh. \"She's <i>always</i> hungry.\" \"I was afraid of that.\" You groan and you have to wait for Lupa to finish eating to try and get out of this nightmare that lovestruck April dragged you into. While April would never eat a human, that cousin of hers was dangerous. What exactly does Mesa bring out for Lupa?</span></div></div>",

You could smell it even from within April's cleavage, and it made you cough and gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Lupa heard you, due to her sensitive ears. \"What was that?\" \"What was what?\", April says, pretending not to have heard you.

What a day this has been so far\u2026 first April, then Lupa, now this. Lupa placed you inside the bikini bottom of April, and you are right now looking up the hairy (******). What is she making you do here? Is she trying to make you have sex with April? You hope not, as you never had sex in your life, and you are a bit of a man that doesn\u2019t want to engage in sexual content until you are married. You have of course good moral standards that you are trying to uphold here, but sadly that appeal isn\u2019t going to last long here. \u201cAlright Stephen\u2026 you better prove that you are really her boyfriend, and this is how you are going to go it. You are going to (****) her up good, or in cleaner terms have sex with her, otherwise you are going to end up in my stomach, digested completely to where you are burnt completely to a crisp by the acids that is in the stomach.\u201d Lupa threatened just as she reveals the situation to you right at that very moment. It almost makes you want to complain straight to Lupa, but she would eat you the moment you try to do so. That is when April decides to say this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Lupa, do you think this is taking it a little bit too far? I mean I really want him as my boyfriend, but I want to have sex when I get married, as I do have moral values you know.\u201d April tries to tell her so that you don\u2019t have to have sex with her. Lupa then starts to laugh uncontrollably as Lupa mocks this with perhaps the funniest laugh that she has in her entire life. I mean it was just funny on what April said to her. She wants to prove herself in a different way than sex. \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! That is so funny!!!!!!! I JUST CANNOT STOP LAUGHING!!!!!!\u201d she laughed manically, and it was that laugh that really makes your ears want to kill itself. \u201cThat is the most pathetic thing I ever heard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so? It is my opinion.\u201d April told her cousin, but she wasn\u2019t going to cut it at all and comes back and opens her panties, grabs you, and opens her mouth and shows you her teeth. This made you scream very quickly, and it was nothing that you want. It seems for April defending you, she is going to make you her snack right there and then. \u201cI really don\u2019t care at the moment if she says that she is your boyfriend or not, but I will let you know that any human who wants to be any of my cousins boyfriend always has sex with them regardless of their moral standards or not, and if you aren\u2019t willing to show that, then it looks like I will be eating you right here and right now. So now I am going to give you one last chance to reconsider human. Prove to me that you are her actual boyfriend by having sex with her on the spot with me watching, or I will eat you right here, and right now, and enjoy every single second of that snack, as for you know, humans is my favorite thing to eat.\u201d Lupa threatened with a mighty growl right on your face. You were scared to death by it, and it almost makes you want to kill yourself. But you value your life a lot more than this, so you had to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Lupa, I will have sex with her, and don\u2019t worry April, I will make this short and painless.\u201d You told her. You were extremely reluctant to do this, but it looks like you are going to end up doing it anyway. You just want this to be over so you can get on with your life. \u201cAlright Stephen, let\u2019s get this out of the way. I hate that condition my cousin placed on us.\u201d April admitted. She picks you up and you are placed right back inside her panties, but not before Lupa stops her. \u201cI got a better idea.\u201d Lupa said. She grabs you when April pulls you out. \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d you said with a mutter. \u201cOh it\u2019s a good one.\u201d Lupa said just as she rips all the clothes right out on you until you were butt naked. April screamed a bit when she noticed a nude \u201cyou\u201d. You just hope no one sees this, otherwise you would be embarrassed beyond belief. \u201cOh how could this day get any wor\u2026\u201d you try to say but Lupa growls at you with her teeth once more. \u201cAlright, I am going to do it.\u201d you said. April places you back in her panties. Once you were back in there, you went right up to the (******) and with your (*****) exposed. You insert your (*****) into her (******), but then suddenly you slipped and you fall right inside her (******). Oh boy, this isn\u2019t good at all. You are now stuck right inside April\u2019s hairy (******). This is not pretty and not good at all, not in any sort of reason and doubt. \u201cHELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril can feel something has climbed right into her (******) and she then notice that it was you. \u201cStephen, are you okay?\u201d April asked him in worry, and then Lupa begins to laugh really big this time. \u201cDid he ended up going straight inside your (******). Oh that is just so classic.\u201d Lupa laughed. \u201cIt looks like he is really your boyfriend to go inside of you. Hope he can find his way out so I can thank him for his honesty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHH!!!! That was so cruel Lupa, that was just cruel. I just hope Stephen is alright.\u201d April said, trying to now pick her hands inside her (******), and then Lupa goes and stop her. \u201cNo, don\u2019t do that. Let him find his way out, I like to see him being a man in doing it so I won\u2019t have to eat him. I like to see how dedicated he is to you.\u201d Lupa told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

If you REALLY are April's lover, you'd do this in a cinch.\" She states in an almost demeaning tone, as if she was deliberately trying to make you feel bad for your so called 'girlfriend'. \"G-Give him some time!\" April retorts with a shudder in her voice. \"Being that small, it'll take him a bit to get his bearing back there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down, you couldn't help but feel relieved yet at the same time annoyed over April. Here she was trying to save your life from her gluttonous fleabag of a family member, yet still she hasn't said a word in trying to help you out in this...awkward situation. For all you knew, she could be all for this humiliating task. \"Alright Alright! i'm going!\" you cry out as loud as you could to reply to the pudgy cousin. \"Dammit all...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small groan, you slowly try to balance yourself against the huge furry globes surrounding your body. If you thought staying in April's cleavage was bad enough, this was at least triple times worse. As the intense heat from the wolfess's body radiated all around you, your body immediately begins to become slick by the great amount of sweat seeping from your pores. Nonetheless. you slowly attempt to traverse your way into the canyon sized crack of April's rump. After what seemed like a couple minutes, you begin to grunt as the heat was starting to get to you. The deeper you seemed to get, the more hotter everything became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done yet?\" Lupa's voice asks with an irritated growl to boot. \"you try being tiny my size.\" you think aloud with a roll of your eyes. \"Stephen...are you alright down there?\" April asks with a sense of worry in her voice. \"What? haven't you done this with him before?\" Lupa asks, growing even more suspicious over her cousins attitude. \"O-Of course!\" April quickly replies to your surprise. \"But...he hasn't been down this long before...\" While April's response did catch you completely off guard, you had to admit she was doing an acceptable job at trying to act the part of lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now?\" Lupa questions her cousins reply before giving a light chuckle. \"Well then. Maybe..THIS can help!\" This!? you think aloud before you suddenly hear April let out a shocked bark above. Just as you turned your head to gaze behind, you soon notice a massive odd surface rushing towards your location between the furry globes. \"w-wait...is that!?\" it didn't take long for the back end of April's bikini bottom to rush right against your body pushing you deeper between her rear end. \"Y-You've gotta be kidding me!\" you shout as your back was being shoved deeper within April's butt. \"L-Lupa! stop!\" April shouts above as Lupa no doubt was giving her cousin a massive wedgie in order to help your course out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quick movements of the fabric felt like the worst roller coaster you've ever been on, minus the loops and dips. Despite your attempts at trying to latch onto some passing by fur, the slickness of your sweaty body made it nearly impossible to get a steady holding. Just when you thought the ride was endless, you soon let out a loud grunt as the front of your body immediately impacts a solid wall before you. As you were about to let out a sigh of relief from the literal 'back seat' ride, your eyes quickly widen as an awful aroma began to emanate in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Crap!\" you exclaim, in both shock and utter disgust as you finally realize where you were. While your head was turned to the left during the entire push Lupa gave, you were absolutely reluctant to turn it facing forward. After a second or so of hesitation, you slowly move your eyes before you to gaze at the unbelievable sight. Mere feet away from you was A huge pink wrinkly surface that was clenched up right in the middle area. \"N-No way...\" you grunt in utter horror as you were now stuck in front of April's massive sized Anus. The opening overall seemed large enough to fit an entire school bus, but what was even worse was the intense amount of heat and the horrid smell it was emanating out. If it smelt this bad outside, you certainly didn't want to know what it was like in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you so long?\" Lupa asks, growing even more annoyed by your reluctance. \"H-He's by there.\" April stutters, easily managing to feel your location within her mammoth sized butt. \"he really is.\" \"Well...get going lover boy!\" Lupa shouts. \"I really hate that wolf...\" you mutter with a growl to follow. Just as you were about to move however, a sudden idea pops into mind. Lupa had no idea just how far you were in April's crack. This was actually really beneficial on your end, considering you could lie your way out of this whole mess. Then again, you could always try to hold up what's left of your pride and continue on with this...task. </span></div></div>",

She was wearing an artists smock and black underwear. But what you truly noticed was her weight. Ambrosine was gargantuanly fat, even making April and Roxy looking stick thin in comparison.

While you'd never say it to Mesa's face, you felt that a lot of things monsters consider to be food were strange at best and outright disgusting at first.

I don't even know what it is half the time.\" Knaoa shrugs her shoulders. \"You never know what these giants might consider food.\" You shiver in place. \"I know one thing monsters consider food that I'm not crazy about. Knaoa, Mesa is just kidding about the whole cooking humans thing right.\" Knaoa looks up at Mesa working at the grill and gives a look of fear thinking about her minotaur friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure about that herself,\" she whispers to you. \"It's frightening that I work alongside a monster who could be planning on cooking me. One time Mesa told me she might decide to eat me herself. After all, females of Mesa's species widely consider humans to be food.\" \"Why is that? Cows don't eat people. Why would minotaurs eat people?\" Knaoa shrugs her shoulders. \"I guess when you're as big as Mesa, all smaller critters qualify as prey. You're lucky to work with Roxy. Gargoyles never eat humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just get back to your burgers and enjoy the meal. Mesa and Knaoa were both very friendly. Perhaps you're over thinking it. Maybe Mesa was only joking about cooking humans. If so it was a cruel joke. Then again Roxy was here and it's doubtful Mesa would try anything with your gargoyle partner keeping an eye on you. Knaoa was alive and well. You figure if Mesa was dangerous to humans, she would've cooked Knaoa by now and maybe even eaten her. But could you really be sure.

Maybe even prime rib? Oh well, it was good; that was all that mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween bites, you spare a few looks up at Mesa as she whips up food for other customers. She's as cheerful as ever, though she makes a few quips about eating or serving humans that make you cringe. But it's not like she'd try anything with Roxy right there, right? Right! And Knaoa didn't seem all that scared of the minotuaress anyway, and she was around Mesa all day: that meant a much bigger chance of being her lunch than you, yet Knaoa was just fine. You smile and take another bite, sure you had little to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Thunk!*</i> You jump and look up from your meal, finding a small frosted glass on the counter below you, filled with what looked like a chocolate milkshake. Well, \"small\" by monster standards, anyway. To you, it was easily the size of a house. The ice cream inside looked nice, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying your lunch, aren't we, little guy?\" Mesa asks as she leans in, covering you in her shadow and smiling. \"Careful you don't eat too much, you might have to hit the water. And if you get a cramp, you'll get so tough I'll never cook it out of you!\" She shakes a spatula at you, almost like a parent would toa little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Though a bit intimidated at seeing her this close, you chuckle at her quip. \"That whole thing about getting cramps 'cause you ate before swimming is a myth, Mesa. I'll be fine...and I'm a lifeguard, remember? You snack on me, Roxy would have a new pair of leather boots by tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy smirks and nods at your little quip, but otherwise stays quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa snorts, chuckling. \"Got me there, Stephen...though I could just find a way to be sneaky about it. Who knows?\" She winks at you, then turns around toward the grill...giving you a <i>very</i> good look at her plump bovine rear. She was wearing a purple bikini, but only for modesty's sake--being a cow-like monster, Mesa wasn't what most would call 'slim'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dart your eyes back down, cheeks flushing. Were you really just staring at Mesa's butt? Not the most gentlemanly thing to do.<br>\r\nThat, and she'd probably sit on you if she caught you doing that again. It had happened before, with a bahamut-girl wearing a bikini a few sizes too small for her rounded dragon-hippo form. The swim-suit was barely visible on her and when you'd asked her to leave and put something else on, you ended up pinned under her multi-ton, scaly ass for an hour until Roxy happened by and got her off of you. Not one of your favorite days on the job...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so caught up in your flashback that you didn't notice Mesa's tail twitch, crack like a whip and slap you across the back...right into the chocolate mlikshake. Shivering from the cold and trying not to sink into the creamy quicksand, you look up to see Mesa's smirking face above you. She winks, then you feel the glass lurch upward--she must have grabbed it. Seconds later, a giant straw stabs into the ice cream next to you...and then you realize that Mesa HADN'T been kidding about \"being sneaky\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, and that burger had been so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what would Mesa do with the milkshake...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She puts the milkshake in front of Roxy who is too busy eating to notice you're missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Roxy,\" says Mesa. \"Have one on the house.\" \"Thanks Mesa,\" says Roxy as she takes the milkshake. \"That's rather neighborly of you. These milkshakes are good Mesa, you should have one yourself some time.\" Mesa lets out a hearty laugh that you hear as an evil laugh. \"I intend to.\" You couldn't believe it. You thought Mesa was your friend, but now she's gonna eat you. Mesa immediately snatches the milkshake you're in and licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like she's gonna suck through the straw, but at the last seconds she forcefully takes the straw out of the milkshake and then chugs the entire thing causing the ice cream to flow into her mouth. You try to swim for it to keep from being eaten but the chocolate is too thick and soon you're in Mesa's mouth. \"Mesa!\" you shout. \"Don't eat me!\" But you slip onto Mesa's tongue that wraps around you like a snake and then drags you into her mouth before snapping it shut as she wipes the chocolate ice cream off her lips and smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the minotaur's mouth, the tongue moves erratically as you're buffeted by the ice cream and even cough as some of it is forced down your throat. You hear moans of delight coming from Mesa as she pushes you against her flat grinding herbivorous teeth. This was a nightmare come true; being eaten by a giant cow with a mouthful of ice cream. Mesa then decides to end it and holds up her head. You try to grab hold of her tongue but some of the ice cream falls down on you, covering your head and causing you to slip down into Mesa's throat where the minotaur giantess swallows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, you were in one of Mesa's four stomachs in a mountain of ice cream. Under the mountain that is. You gag and expect to die, but somehow, the digestive juices don't hurt you. Then you remember, you won't be digested for real until you're in the last stomach. You burst out of the ice cream and climb to the top as you shiver and look around. You were in pure horror. Mesa ate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the cow woman smiles and rubs her bloated stomach as milk drips from her udder at how exquisite your flavor was. At that moment, Knaoa walks along the table and looks around before running so Mesa could see her. \"Mesa,\" she asks. \"Where's Stephen?\" Mesa then gives an evil smile and glare Knaoa's way, scaring the heck out of Knaoa as the minotaur giantess taps her stomach.</span></div></div>",

I think I will have another one right now, and thankfully there is another one right there.\u201d Mesa said with an evil smile just as she rubs her stomach and looks at Knaoa, who is now really scared, but still wants to get her boss to come to her senses somehow. \u201cUh Mesa, are you alright?\u201d Knaoa asked as if she was a scared girl. She is hoping that her boss doesn\u2019t eat her at all, after all bot she and Mesa are good friends despite some hiccups, and she is just praying to god that she doesn\u2019t have the same fate as Stephen. \u201cI am fine my friend. I am just going to have you as a snack if you don\u2019t mind, my snack was so good I just want to have another one right here and now.\u201d Mesa said evilly just as she now picks up the scared girl and brings her to her wide open mouth. Just before she eats her, Mesa takes one good lick on Knaoa to make sure it was edible, and then her eyes just jolt right open. \u201cNow that hits the spot.\u201d Mesa said evilly just as she now throws the girl in her mouth, but Knaoa manages to grab and hang on to the tongue. Mesa then begins to shake her tongue in order to get Knaoa to lose her grip and let go. Eventually that does end up happening to Knaoa, and she slips all the way down in her throat, through the esophagus like a roller coaster slide, and eventually she hits face first in the ice cream that Stephen hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight back outside, Mesa was done having her snack and had a good feeling in her stomach that her food will be digesting soon. That shake was really good to her. \u201cMan, that shake was just delicious.\u201d Mesa smiled just as Roxy comes back after finishing her shake. \u201cI must admit, that was really really good.\u201d Roxy told her. \u201cI got to get back to work right now, thanks for the shake.\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou are welcome.\u201d Mesa said just before she goes back to work, she comes back to notice that something is off. \u201cWhere\u2019s Knaoa?\u201d Mesa wondered. She look at her station for a few moments and around and then came to thinking this. \u201cI think she is right now taking a break. After all, sometimes all that work that I put her through tends to exhaust her; and no kidding.\u201d She said before she got back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn The First Stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a day so far? You were doing your usual job as a lifeguard, and then you went to get some lunch from Mesa and Knaoa, and by a big turn of events, you ended up in a shake, and Mesa ends up eating you. You thought you were going to die, but you actually managed to survive as there was no acid. You were though having a pretty bad cold. All that cold ice cream has surely given you a headache, not to mention you ate some of it all in one time, giving you a brain freeze. After a bit your headache seems to go away, however what happened next was a bit of a surprise. You heard a scream that is that of a girl coming down and you look up to see Knaoa falling right into the same ice cream as you. Thankfully the fall wasn\u2019t bad, and so was your fall pleasant.  You run up to Knaoa to check if she is alright. \u201cKnaoa, are you alright?\u201d you shouted to her. Knaoa woke up and notice you. \u201cStephen? You are here to.\u201d Knaoa said just as she comes and hugs him. You hug her to make sure that she is not scared at all. \u201cYep, somehow I got into the shake and I was swallowed by Mesa, what was she thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t notice you when I was cooking your meal. I got done with it and then I went up to check on Mesa, and then she looked somewhat evil right then and then she picked me up and then she gave me a lick, thought I was tasty, and then she throws me into her mouth, and I tried to hang on to her tongue but eventually I gave way and I fell right into an ice cream.\u201d Knaoa said in a hyper panicking way as if she was going to have a heart attack, but then you hugged her again. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. There is no acid in here so we are fine.\u201d You told her in a concern and father like way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true, but Mesa has four stomachs, and we have got to out of here, but hopefully not get to her fourth stomach, as that is where all the digesting will begin. I learned that at Monster High School.\u201d Knaoa told you as she had some knowledge on minotaurs and how they have 4 stomachs. \u201cI moved here when I was a child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is interesting thing to here, but right now we have got to find a way out of here before we become digested by Mesa. Is there anything we can do? There is surely no way we are going to climb back up through her mouth as we will more likely be falling from there if we try to, and secondly and most importantly, if we go into her fourth stomach, we are surely going to die, so is there an idea that you have that can get us out of here, as I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d You asked her as she knows minotaurs a bit, and she started to ponder about it for a moment before she was able to think of something in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know an idea.\u201d Knaoa told you. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d you asked her. \u201cWell, I am going to be honest though, you are not going to like it. We are going to have to be ready when we get to the fourth stomach, and perhaps if we use the food items around here correctly, we could end up getting through the other parts of her body, and perhaps we can try to escape through her ears.\u201d Knaoa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Mesa turns her head and both glares and smirks at her assistant at the same time. \"Say one word to Roxy,\" the minotaur whispers under her breath. \"And <i>you're</i> next.\" Knaoa backs off as Mesa grins at her. Meanwhile, in your frosty prison you feel yourself being pulled through a current and you're scream if you weren't muffled by chocolate ice cream. You feel yourself going up a large tube and realize to your horror that Roxy is drinking the shake and you with it. You try to swim down but it's no use. Lifeguard or no lifeguard, there was no way you could swim through thick ice cream.

It had a simple, old-time design, but it looked like it had been repaired several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen was amazed. He had never seen a submarine in real life before. He couldn't tell if it was abandoned or not. Laura pulled him from his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There an open hatch-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the submarines-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top. Let's go in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Stephen could answer, Laura was already on her way to the sub. They reached the open hatch and climbed in. Closing the hatch above them, the water suddenly drained. Laura took Stephen out of her mask and put her on her shoulder, then entered the sub proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was nothing like the out. The hall they were in was narrow, but it was furnished like the inside of a home, with desks nailed to the floor and pictures on the hull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think someone lives here?\" You ask Laura, confused. Before she could answer, you heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO THE F**K ARE YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, both you and Laura faced a woman with a harpoon gun pointed at you. The woman was a Oni, around 725 feet with orange skin, red eyes, and short black hair. She had a set of small horns on top of her head. This woman was incedibly fat, to the point of almost bursting out of her black, one-piece bikini. She did not look happy at your intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID WHO ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU IN KAREN?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren must have been the name of the sub. You decided to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Stephen and this is Laura. We saw you subma- I mean Karen near the reef. The hatch on top was open. We thought Karen was abandoned, so we came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she still looked mad, she at least lowered her harpoon gun. The hull of the submarine started creaking. Suddenly, the woman started touching the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, don't worry Karen. I'm dealing with these two. I'm sure they'll leave soon enough.\" She said while stroking the wall.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis woman was cleary crazy. You cleared your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, do you mind introducing yourself?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Aquell.\" The oni replied, still stroking the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want Aquell to point her harpoon gun at you again, so you asked a simple question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind showing us around Karen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquell stopped stroking the wall and looked at you. How did she react to your question?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jen was one of the more troublesome of the escapees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stingray woman's backstory is a tragic one. She was walking home from a movie about a megalomaniac mad scientist named Dr. Saturday but before she could reach home, she passed a condemned building just as it was being destroyed and some heavy debris hit her on the head and nearly killed her. Unfortunately the impact left her with brain damage that made her believe that she was Dr. Saturday herself and as such she has sworn to take over Terrordale. Since her family admitted her to the asylum, she's been trying to take over the town starting with the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was a nuisance because she was good at building weapons and tools that actually worked. Also being a haniver, she could fly through the sky and swim underwater like a torpedo.

The Kaiju Disarming Plant. The reason the hospital was called that was because it was a mental hospital for monsters who would destroy the human world if they went into it. Last time you checked, there were at least twenty patients. You're so scared you hide in Roxy's cleavage as your partner looks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy just gives you a smile. \"You don't have to worry Stephen, you have me to protect you remember?\" \"Oh,\" you say. \"Right. Thanks partner.\" Roxy smiles and as Dr. West walks you away, an orderly walks up to you. She was a blue bahamut, a monster resembling a cross between a fish, a hippo and a dragon. \"Hi Jedda,\" says Roxy. \"What's up?\" \"Hi Roxy,\" says the bahamut. \"Hello Stephen.\" You knew Jedda because her older sister, Elisa, was Roxy's best friend (besides you of course). Jedda was friendly like her sister, but you noticed she was staring at you with hungry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way,\" says Jedda as she escorts you and Roxy towards group therapy. Elisa told you that Jedda was a predator and was taking self-help classes to try and give up human meat. She wasn't having much success and that made you nervous. \"You know Stephen,\" says Jedda. \"I shouldn't be saying this since I'm married and well... a lesbian... but you look good today.\" \"Thank you Jedda.\" You say. Jedda lets out a giggle. \"In fact, you'd look even better wrapped up in a tortilla with lettuce and tomatoes.\" You gulp at that thought as the hippo monster blushes. \"Oops. Was that out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, miraculously Jedda brings you and Roxy to group therapy without eating you up. You look forward to see Whitney, the head nurse already there. Whitney was a giant wererhinoceros with long orange hair and a blue tattoo over her eye. For someone who was even... ahem... more well covered than Roxy, she was beautiful. Too bad she was married. Amusingly enough, you heard her husband was a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhitney wasn't alone however, there were six patients with her. You could identify them because Fran kept a copy of all their records. First of them was Cassandra, a gigantic purple vampire type werebat who was playing with a toy plane. Cassandra's problem was that a head injury regressed her back to childhood. She was the most innocent patient in the K.D.P. but also one of the most dangerous if you were a human because she tended to mistake them for toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next patient was Hazel, a titanic wereskunk who was wrapped up in a straitjacket. Hazel scared you. She was a giant monster version of the Joker and even looked the part with her green hair and chronic slasher smile. She was really plump today which meant she hadn't sprayed for a long time and that meant she was fully loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Artemis, a purple python, a dragon resembling an actual python with arms and legs. Artemis was a drunk who came to the K.D.P. to get sober. Too bad all that withdrawal has given her a craving for human flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Artemis was Nicole, a nuckelavee, a skinless red horse woman. Nicole was a masochist who was admitted for torturing herself in extremely cruel ways. There was a rumor her boyfriend sent her to the K.D.P. after he caught her about to sit on a chainsaw. Her already gruesome looking body was covered in scars that made her a nightmare to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nicole was Paula, an obese rose skinned cyclops wearing a maid outfit. You hear Paula had a serious case of O.C.D. and would throw a nasty tantrum whenever somebody tracked so much as a speck of dirt into the K.D.P.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally was Amalthea, a pink and white striped unicorn who was just as obese as Paula. Amalthea was a depressed creature who thought she was the last unicorn and was very suicidal. Unfortunately, she drowned her sorrows by swallowing humans by the handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe session was about to start and Whitney adjusts her glasses. \"Okay everybody,\" she says. \"We're going to try and reach for the person you are deep inside your minds, buried beneath all the demons in your heads.\" Hazel smirks and moves her eyes slightly. \"Mine's not talking,\" she says. \"Must be a mime.\" Hazel lets out a psychotic laugh as Whitney rolls her eyes. \"Well, that's nice, Hazel.\" Amalthea lets out a sigh. \"What good is nice or naughty?\" she asks. \"Being a good person doesn't extend your life. We only go through life doing good deeds because we believe it will compensate for the inescapable death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra stops playing and runs to Whitney to grab hold of her. \"Ms. Whitney,\" she says. \"Amalthea's scaring me again.\" Whitney lets out a sigh and taps Cassandra on the back before she notices you and Roxy. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Roxy, Stephen, how good of you to join us.\" \"Hey Whitney.\" \"Roxy,\" says Artemis with a smile. \"How's it going?\" \"Hi Artemis,\" says Roxy. \"Congratulations, three weeks sober.\" Artemis notices you in Roxy's cleavage and flickers her snake's tongue before she licks her lips. \"Are you going to eat that?\" she asks as she points to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream and dig down into the cleavage before Amalthea groans. \"Artemis gets a snack,\" she says. \"But I don't see anyone bringing me humans.\" \"Nobody is eating any humans,\" says Whitney as she hands Cassandra a candy bar to calm her down. \"Just the thought should be considered a mental disorder.\" Roxy steps back from Artemis before Paula turns her one eye and it practically pops out of her head. She notices that Roxy's talons are covered in sand and screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" she yells. \"You're tracking sand all over the floor! I was up from dawn disinfecting this entire hospital! Do you have any idea how filthy a public beach is!\" \"Geez,\" says Roxy. \"Sorry!\" \"And that's not even considering what's in the water!\" yells Paula as she pulls her hair. \"There are syringes in the sea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pulls on Roxy's tail and gives a creepy smile as you look down at her. \"Excuse me Ms. Maza,\" says Nicole. \"Are there any great whites in the water. I love to feel the little nippers chewing away at my fingers. Oh, Whitney, can I play with Phoebe tonight? She's gathered all the toilet paper in the K.D.P. for kindling and I want a front row seat of the fire. Just the touch of it on my skin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese girls were even more messed up than the ones you were used to chasing. They must be the more psychotic cases in the K.D.P. \"Absolutely not,\" says Whitney. \"Nicole, you have a serious mental condition. Feeding it will only make it worse. Take a seat Roxy. Roxy grabs two chairs to sit down on as Whitney continues with the group therapy. You let out a slight snicker that Roxy needs two seats to hold up her weight but Roxy glares down at you and you look the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Whitney,\" you say as you look at the ring on her finger. \"Happy anniversary.\" \"Thank you Stephen,\" says the rhino giantess with a smile. \"Now, let's carry on girls.\"</span></div></div>",

Not enough to freeze to death, but enough so you can easily catch a cold if not prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: Can form and control any kind of water, due to the moisture in the air.

Finally, she can breathe underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: Other than her animalistic features(See above), she looks like a human woman her age, except only being 300 ft tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: This is honestly her weirdest trait. Instead of being quite ferocious(Much like her genetics), she's actually a peaceful giant that sometimes gets out her cell through stealth. Loves music, really wants to see other people, and is afraid of seeing blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy blood? Well you see, although rare, when Avery sees blood, she goes into a rage, roaring \"Musha, musha, MUSHA!\"<br>\r\n Last time it happened, it took a traq dart powerful enough to kill a dinosaur. ..........Yeah, not a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll-in-all, Avery is a little weird, but hey, everyone's a little weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the Desk of Dr. Kaguya West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Before you ask, yes, I want Kaguya to be a supporting character.

She practically wrecked Paris after some stupid kid kept taunting her.\" \"But she's a gargoyle,\" you say. \"You're a gargoyle. Maybe you can talk some sense into her?\" \"Not likely.\" Says Roxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy flies down in front of Eartha and automatically Eartha glares at Roxy. \"What do you freakin' want Maza?\" Eartha asks rudely in a French accent. \"You're in an unusually good mood today.\" Says Roxy sarcastically. Eartha scoffs and turns to you before she glares. \"Traitor.\" She mutters. Roxy gasps and gets a little annoyed. \"<i>I'm</i> a traitor? You're the one who's a disgrace to the gargoyle race. Eating humans? Disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly run and hide behind the side of Roxy's hair. Normally gargoyles didn't eat humans and according to Roxy this gargoyle did. Eartha poked Roxy in the breast before responding. \"For your information, I'm the only gargoyle who knocks what little jerks those humans are. At least they have one thing they're good for. If you were smart, you'd eat that little cockroach on your shoulder right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy shakes her head. \"I realized just how horrible those humans are after I woke up covered in paint,\" said Eartha. \"That was the last straw.\" \"It was a prank. No reason to lose it and go all Demona on everyone.\" This was getting nowhere fast. Roxy was losing patience with Eartha by the second and Eartha was as stubborn as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off my case Roxy,\" says Eartha. \"I'm not in the mood for a no account fatty like you.\" \"Fatty?!\" yells Roxy getting angrier. \"<i>I'm</i> a fatty?! Those thighs of yours could be used as wrecking balls Blondie!\" \"At least I'm not shorter than my younger sister!\" \"You don't even have a sister!\" \"Go to hell Maza!\" \"Why don't <i>you</i> go to hell Blondie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Roxy,\" you say. \"Calm d..\" \"You stay out of this Stephen,\" warns Roxy. \"This is between me and broccoli buns here.\" \"I'll eat you alive lemon drop.\" Says Eartha in response. \"I'd like to see you try!\" yells Roxy.

This is bad. Eartha having anger problems is bad enough, but she had to bring Roxy's weight into it. They trade insults a little more until you feel a massive shift as Roxy rushes forward. Eartha must have finally gotten to her. You hold onto her hair for dear life as she slams into the other gargoyle. They grapple with each other while you try to regain balance. \"Whats the matter butter ball? Am I too much for you?\" Eartha taunts. \"Well you've definitely got me on weight. I'd say you're TOO MUCH period!\" Roxy spits back. You begin to tremble as the two of them try to overpower each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contest of strength ends when the gargoyles end up falling over into the sand. They land with a powerful boom, sending you flying off of Roxy onto the beach. When you get up and shake yourself off you see an amazing sight. The two of them are rolling around in the sand, clawing and yelling at each other. Its like watching two mountains fight. You are snapped out of it when they begin to roll towards you. The ground rumbles as they get closer and you desperately try to get out of the way. You manage to dive to safety and stop to catch your breath. Suddenly a shadow looms over you. Roxy has Earth pinned on her stomach, and Eartha just spotted you on the sand. With a grin she reaches for you and you make a break for it. Before her hand can grab you Roxy's own hand shoots down and pins it to the ground. As you sigh in relief Eartha elbows Roxy and throws her off of her back. They resume they're brawl while you just try not to get crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the fight heads back your way. You run around trying to dodge the moving arms and legs that move erratically. Out of nowhere Roxy slams a fist into the ground, no doubt trying to hit Eartha. It doesn't hit you but the force sends a shock wave that launches you into the air. When you come down you find yourself headed right for Eartha's massive chest. With a boing you land on her breast and bounce a couple of times. You come to rest in the valley between and look up in time to see Roxy's own rack coming down. She crashes down and you are sandwiched between the boobs of the two gargoyles. They struggle and roll around some more with you being thrown around on their bodies. You wonder when this will end when suddenly a voice calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, break it up!\" the voice says. Roxy is pulled off of Eartha, leaving you wedged in the green woman's cleavage. You can see that Fran is the one who pulled Roxy off. Looking over you see an albino whererhino walking over. Its Whitney, the head orderly at the KDP. She must have been the one you heard. \"All right you two, fights over!\" she says. \"Fine, fatty over there is lucky you showed up.\" Eartha says. \"Oh yeah!?\" Roxy shoots back and starts forward before Fran grabs her arm. \"Roxy, you calm down.\" the troll says. Roxy takes a breath and relaxes while Whitney tells Eartha to do the same. Meanwhile you're still unnoticed in her breasts. You begin to call out but Eartha folds her arms in a huff, squeezing her boobs together and trapping you. Everyone begins to walk and...</span></div></div>",

Butterball there is just mad she lost.\" Eartha responds. \"I didn't lose you over sized melon!\" Roxy shoots back. \"Roxy. Calm down.\" Fran says as she puts a hand on Roxy's shoulder. \"I think part of the problem is anger issues.\" Whitney says. Roxy rolls her eyes. \"Well I could have told you that. She's an anger management patient.\" she says. \"Actually, I was referring to you as well.\" Whitney says. \"What?\" Roxy says. \"Well it seems you got a little overly upset when Eartha called you \"butterball\". Maybe you have issues regarding your weight?\" Whitney suggests. Roxy remains silent and frowns. Normally she would get defensive, but it seems she's trying to keep calm in front of Whitney. It doesn't help that she's still a little worked up from the fight. \"I think it would help if you would attend a little session at the institute. Just one, to see if it helps.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some coaxing from Fran Roxy is sitting in a room with Eartha and Whitney. You are still in Eartha's breasts struggling to escape. Eartha feels you but dismisses it as an itch. She's too annoyed to care right now. \"Okay, lets get started.\" Whitney says. \"Why are we both here?\" Roxy asks. \"I think it will help if you two can get a grasp on what makes the other angry.\" Whitney replies. \"Whatever.\" Eartha says and slumps back in her chair. \"Now Eartha, why don't you explain why you're so angry.\" Whitney says. \"I'm not, I just don't like humans. They're annoying and only good for eating.\" she answers. \"How can you say that? Gargoyles are supposed to be protectors.\" Roxy says. \"Yeah, until the ones you're protecting turn on you and torment you.\" Eartha spits. \"Just because one human played pranks on you doesn't mean every human is a pest.\" Roxy tells her. By this point you've finally righted yourself and have squeezed out of her boobs. She looks down and sees you. \"Case in point. They're like bugs. They can turn up anywhere.\" she says as she pulls you out. She begins to lower you to her mouth but Roxy snatches you away. \"What the hell were you doing in there?\" she asks you. \"I got a little jumbled up in the fight.\" you explain. \"Okay, I think Stephen can sit in on this.\" Whitney says as she picks you out of Roxy's hand. She takes you over to her chair and sits you on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you were going to eat him!\" Roxy says to Eartha. \"Are you telling me you've never thought about it?\" Eartha asks. Roxy glares at her. \"Not that you could use any more to eat.\" Eartha adds. \"Listen you-\" Roxy starts before stopping. Whitney raises an eyebrow. Roxy sighs and folds her arms. You are watching it all from Whitney's shoulder, a little amused. Not to mention you have a great view of Whitney's rack. She's massive! Her husband is a lucky man. \"So I think if you come to terms with your weight you'll feel better.\" Whitney tells Roxy. Roxy just looks away. \"You know Roxy, you look great. You're a very attractive girl, and your size is one of your best qualities.\" you offer. \"Stephen you're a chubby chaser.\" Roxy tells you. Whitney chuckles as you feel a little embarrassed.

Upon descending you find that its a parasol being carried by someone. When Roxy lands she inspects the parasol's owner. It appears to be a zombie girl. She's got part of her lip missing, but she's pretty good looking as far as zombies go. Her hair is brown with a white highlight and done up in ringlets.  When she was still alive she must have been beautiful. The most striking thing about her though aside from the parasol is that she's wearing a bright yellow dress that looks somewhat out of place. \"Hey Roxy, is she a patient at the KDP?\" you ask your gargoyle partner. \"I'm not sure. If she is this must be the first time she's gotten out, cause I've never seen her before.\" she says. The zombie is looking around with an air of curiosity. \"She looks pretty harmless.\" you observe. \"Well don't be too relaxed. If she is from the hospital we don't what she might do.\" Roxy warns you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy walks over to the wandering girl and greets her. \"Excuse me miss! What are doing out here today?\" The zombie looks at her and smiles. \"Oh I'm just enjoying the beautiful day. Its been a while since I've been outside.\" she says. There is a southern drawl in her voice. \"So how did you come by our beach?\" Roxy asks. The girl gives a little curtsy before introducing herself. \"My name is Mercy. I used to live on my family's estate, but other than that I don't remember much. I woke up one day in a strange town and they were kind enough to let me stay in that nice hotel.\" she explains. \"Hotel?\" Roxy says. Mercy points to the KDP. \"That one over there. Its quite accommodating and the staff is very entertaining. Judging from you I'd say that the whole town likes to dress up in costume?\" she says. Mercy begins feeling Roxy's wings and marveling at how real they feel. \"She's obviously not in her right mind.\" Roxy whispers to you. \"No, I think she's not in her right time.\" you say back. \"She doesn't even seem to realize she's a zombie.\" Roxy sighs. \"Well lets get her back to the hospital. They can deal with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you whisper with one another Mercy spots you on Roxy's shoulder. \"Oh! You've got a bug on your shoulder\" she exclaims and snatches you off in a flash. You struggle as she holds you between her fingers. Her glove is worn away in spots, probably from being underground. \"Actually, this bug looks familiar.\" she notices. \"They're quite the delicacy where I come from! I've seen one scurrying around the hotel but I haven't been able to catch it.\" Mercy moves you to her open mouth and prepares to eat you. Before she can though Roxy snatches you away. \"Uh, sorry but I'd rather you didn't eat him.\" she says. You've almost been eaten a number of times so Roxy's developed good reflexes in these situations. \"Why not? Is it your pet or something?\" Mercy inquires. \"Tell her I'm human!\" you say to Roxy. \"I think that would be a shock to her. We should let the KDP handle that.\" she tells you. Mercy shakes her head and turns away. \"No matter. I just wanted to walk along the beach. The hotel staff doesn't let us leave for some reason. I finally manged to slip past them so I'm not going to waste this day.\" You give Roxy a sympathetic look. \"She seems really happy to be out here. Maybe we should let her walk on the beach and then take her back.\" you suggest. What do you do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roxy isn't one hundred percent sure about what to do in this kind of situation. Mercy definitely wasn't an ordinary mental patient. She sure wasn't like any of the psychos that regularly broke out of the KDP. She seemed more ignorant and naive than actually insane. Although it would probably be best not to be seen around her considering that she had just tried to eat you, so you crawl back behind Roxy's long hair as Roxy lets out a sigh and then she takes Mercy by the hand. \"Uh,\" she says. \"Right this way... Mercy. Welcome to Gravefield Beach.\" \"Gravefield Beach?\" asks the southern belle zombie. \"That's an ominous name for a little old beach. Oh well, looks charming.\" \"Right this way.\" Roxy was escorting Mercy down the beach and you turn to see Mercy's half-rotted face and from your position you could even see the inside of her mouth. How on Earth could she have not noticed that she was dead? Was she that much of a ditz. She probably died in her sleep if she hadn't realized how big she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy,\" says Roxy. \"How exactly did you find yourself in Terrordale?\" \"I don't really know myself, sug,\" says Mercy as she scratches her face, giving you a good few of her bony fingers. \"I woke up out in a rather large rock garden. For some reason, the rocks looked like crosses and angels. Then I passed by some rather odd looking tree stumps that looked like they were made of iron. I waited hours for a carriage to come. The first one looked mighty strange since there wasn't a horse in front of it and the carriage looked an awful lot like this strange beetles that kept ramming into my feet. I definitely ain't in Texas anymore.\" Not only did she not know she was dead, she had no idea she was 325ft tall. Then again, she came from a time and a place where folks weren't well educated since she was clearly from the time of the wild west.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy just kept looking around and saw several of the beachgoers \"Now those folks are strange. Going swimming in their costumes like that.\" \"Uh, yeah,\" said Roxy nervously. \"Costumes. Mercy, the uh... night before you arrived at the... hotel, do you remember anything strange?\" \"Well,\" said Mercy. \"I'll admit I was rather drowsy the night before. I think the lemonade made me sleepy. It tasted rather funny.\" Funny lemonade? Aha, she must've been poisoned to death. \"By the way,\" said Mercy. \"That's a very realistic gargoyle costume you're wearing. What did you use for the wings.\" \"Uh,\" said Roxy trying to hide the fact that her wings were in fact real. \"Leather.\" \"Aha, and what did y'all use for the big pot-belly? Is that a sack of flower under there.\" Roxy bit her lip in frustration as you laughed into her ear. \"Quiet, Stephen,\" says Roxy. \"Or I'll see how good a butt plug you make.\" You quickly shut up as Mercy continues to walk along the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy then sees Mesa's grill up ahead and smiles. \"Uh, Mercy. You must be starving. You look like you haven't had anything to eat in centuries.\" \"I'll admit, I am feeling a little peckish.\" You just hope humans aren't on the menu. Roxy walks Mercy up to Mesa's grill. \"Howdy, Roxy,\" said Mesa. \"Who's your friend?\" \"Mesa,\" says Roxy. \"This is Mercy.\" \"Pleasure to meet y'all,\" says Mercy as she shakes hands with Mesa. \"You're the first fellow southerner I've seen in this quaint little town.\" Mesa then pulled up a seat and smiled. \"Does it hurt to sit down with that thing on?\" asked Roxy pointing to Mercy's bustle. \"You get used to it.\" \"So,\" said Mesa. \"Can I start you two ladies off with a couple of drinks? Coca Ghoula? Sprite? Beer?\" Mercy was looking hard at the menu. \"You wouldn't happen to have sarsaparilly would y'all, sug?\" Mesa raises an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Roxy,\" you say. \"I'm not sure if we can keep this up forever. Sooner or later she's going to find out that she was poisoned to death centuries ago.\" Roxy lets out a sigh. \"I must say,\" she said. \"She's surprisingly well preserved. You'd think she'd be nothing but bones by now.\" Mesa hands Mercy what looks like a soda. \"I'm all out of sarsaparilly.\" Says Mesa sarcastically. Regardless, the undead southern belle just takes her drink and drinks it, not noticing that her rotted lips are causing it to leak out, to say nothing of the holes on her actual body. Roxy lets out a sigh. \"This is going to be a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen who should sit next to Roxy and Mercy but...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh! What is that horrible stench!\" asks a familiar and very unfriendly voice. \"Did something die over here? The stench is otherworldly.\" You let out a groan. \"Stella.\" That fairy walked up holding her nose as she landed next to Roxy who let out a groan. \"Hi, Roxy,\" says Stella smugly. \"I see you're a fat **** like you usually are.\" Roxy's eyes glowed red at that comment. \"I see you're a blonde, skinny, obnoxious cretin that even Puck wouldn't touch with a caber.\" Stella just stuck her tongue out at Roxy. Man, you hated that stupid fairy. Somebody definitely needs to take her down a peg or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella sniffed the air again and noticed Mercy still looking at the menu. \"Ugh,\" says Stella. \"So that's what I've been smelling. I don't know why Fran lets them on the beach. They'll only poison the water the moment they step in.\" Roxy gave a growl. She wanted to tell off Stella for being anti-zombie but she didn't want to cause any distress to Mercy who seemed to be horrified at what she was reading. \"Good grief. Don't tell me y'all cook dogs in this town. That's just plain old horrid.\" Mesa let out a groan. \"Of course I don't cook dogs, you idget. That's grade-A apatosaurus meat. You know, dinosaurs?\" \"Dinosaurs?\" asked Mercy with a laugh. \"Don't y'all be ridiculous. Dinosaurs ain't been around for millions of years.\" Stella raised an eyebrow before Mercy noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y'all must be a friend of Ms. Roxy's. I like your outfit. Though it looks a bit lazy compared to all the others I've seen. But still, those fake wings are impressive.\" Stella just gags. \"Me? Friends with that yellow-skinned, leather-winged whale? Yeah right. Wait a minute, costume?! What are you talking about, zombie?\" Mercy seems very confused. \"Zombie? What's a zombie?\" \"What's a zombie?!\" asks Stella in disbelief. \"It's what you are, numbskull!\" Mercy lets out a scoff. \"I don't think I like the way you talk about me. Y'all still haven't answered my question?\" Roxy and you are both shocked. \"Stella!\" you yell. \"Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, tact has never been one of Stella's strong suits. \"Listen here, Daisy Duke,\" says Stella. \"A zombie is a reanimated corpse. If you want to know what one looks like, look in the mirror, because you're apparently too stupid to realize that you're dead. I don't know how you came back to life but you have obviously not been alive for some time.\" Roxy gasps. You give a gulp. Who knows how Mercy would react to hearing that she was a zombie. However, Mercy was still not convinced of her undeath. \"That's crazy talk. I'm as alive as they come. If I was dead do y'all think I'd be talking to you right now. I may be out of my element but I ain't dead. Just a little misplaced. I woke up in a rock garden before I made my way too...\" \"That wasn't a rock garden, stupid!\" yells Stella. \"That was a cemetery! Not only are you a zombie but you're a <b>giant</b> zombie. How dense can you be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes Mercy a while to process what Stella said but she just laughs it off. \"Y'all are very funny, little missy,\" she said. \"That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard.\" \"Then maybe this will convince you.\" Mesa lets out a confused snort and then Stella thrusts her hand into Mercy's chest and makes her scream. \"Stella!\" yells Roxy. Stella pulls her hand out and takes out what looks like Mercy's heart. It was shriveled and looked like it was so dry it would've take much to reduce it to dust. Mercy was horrified at seeing her own heart and held her chest as she panted but then she realized that she wasn't dying. Stella then gave a smirk and held up a compact mirror to show Mercy her undead face. Mercy takes a look at herself and makes a face of pure horror. \"You can have your heart back in a minute,\" says Stella smugly. \"It doesn't work anymore anyhow. Also, that building over there, it's a mental hospital. I'd say you're one of the patients. Clearly you were admitted because you couldn't figure it out for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy is horrified but then she gagged and realized something. \"Then that strange delicacy,\" she said. \"Those bugs.\" \"Those weren't bugs,\" says Stella. \"Those were human beings you ate. And by the way, nobody in this town is wearing a costume. They're all real monsters. Including me.\" Stella flew up into the air and Mercy looked in pure shock. Roxy gives a look of sympathy. \"Stay calm, Mercy,\" she says. \"Stay calm.\" But Mercy can't stay calm and runs off screaming as she tries to hide her rotted face under her parasol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Stella decides to be extra nasty and pulls on Mercy's dress to strip her into her undergarments. Underneath Mercy's dress, she looked rather voluptuous and hot albeit still decayed. She had a rather large pair of breasts and what Roxy thought was a bustle was just a rather large bubble butt. One of Mercy's legs was shown to have decayed into bone while the other was still flesh and it was shown that some of Mercy's ribs were exposed. Mercy screams as she sees the rest of herself and then tries to hide her corset and panties as she runs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy!\" you yell. Roxy gives a glare at Stella. \"You are so insensitive, Stella.\" Stella lets out a scoff. \"I'm a fairy, it's what I do.\" Roxy lets out a groan. \"As soon as I tend to Mercy, I will squash you like a bug.\" Roxy then flies off in order to try and find any sign of Mercy. \"She's gotta be around here somewhere,\" you say. \"It's not like a giant zombie with a parasol is going to be hard to find.\" Roxy looks down to see several beach umbrellas. \"That's what you think, Stephen. Just keep an eye out for her. She's out of her time, just found out she's a zombie and is scared beyond belief.\" \"Aha,\" you say. \"There she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut where is Mercy at the moment?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">(9/21/2016: Under new management. Originally created by RedHurricane)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Stephen, a human washed up on Gravefield Beach in Terrordale, a city populated entirely by titanic sized versions of the monsters of folklore and legend. You had no idea this would happen but you made the most of it becoming a lifeguard at the beach. They needed somebody who could keep a good eye and weren\u2019t picky about what they hired. Of course, being the only human in a beach for monster giants is extremely dangerous. Can you guard your own life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Beach Staff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy Maza- Your partner. A 750ft tall gargoyle with long black hair and yellow skin. A little on the pudgy side but still beautiful. You basically ride on Roxy\u2019s shoulder and act as a second pair of eyes for her. She's also the older (but shorter) sister of Petra from my Monster Arms story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFran Cisco- Your supervisor. A blue skinned troll girl, muscular in appearance. Shorter than Roxy but taller than Stella. Fran is overly friendly towards humans, but not very smart. Speaks in broken English. But she does like you, a little more than you\u2019d like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChihiro- A younger new addition to the beach. (Addition by UltraGTS), A giant 18 year old (in appearance) chimera with crab claws for hand, a human upper body, a scorpion's tail and spider legs. Appears in certain story lines. She was originally going to be a mutate and then I retconned her to a nightmare but she got out of hand and her creator harassed me to a breaking point so I made her a chimera human hybrid. (Note: Please only include Chihiro in this interactive. I don't want to see her in any of my other inter actives).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLascivite Angeline Jedore- An OC of the 12th doctor. Lascivite is a 950ft tall forest green-skinned and purple haired succubus. She has an athletic body but gargantuan breasts due to a medical condition. Unlike other succubi, he prefers to be by herself, not being interested in romance. This makes her seem cold, but she can warm up to particually nice people. Despite this, she is obsessed with her unusually large breasts, always taking extra care of them. She loves horror movies and books, particularly psychological thrillers. She adores the color purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Enemies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella Birnbaum- A blonde haired hourglass figured fairy with bright orange butterfly wings. Stella is a rival lifeguard of both you and Roxy and extremely haughty. She\u2019s very arrogant towards humans and is always making you feel small(er than usual). You really hate her and think she shouldn\u2019t be working here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaisley Van Manen- Your worst enemy. A giant hourglass shaped mermaid with short primrose colored hair and the tail of a purple tiger shark. Paisley lives in an underwater grotto near the beach and is rude and insulting towards land based monsters. Unfortunately for you humans are Paisley\u2019s favorite food and she warned you that if she saw you in the water, she\u2019d gobble you up. Speaks in a slight British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Surfers- You know a few surfer girl monsters that visit Gravefield Beach. Some are good and some you don't get along with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila Tepes- A young and voluptuous vampire girl. She's very sweet and bubbly and surprisingly has never tasted blood in her life. In fact, Lila is so afraid of blood that she panics whenever she sees it. In your opinion, she's a pitiful excuse for a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie Andrews- A BBW goth naga girl. Connie has the upper body of a dark skinned woman, but the lower body of a purple anaconda. Despite her fearsome appearance, she's friendly towards you. Of course, you think it's only because she can't eat humans without suffering an allergic reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReimu Shiibashi- The showoff jock of the monster surfers who visit the beach. Reimu is a giant gray furred baku girl and doesn't like humans that much. She often acts as if you're not there<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmen Bando- A giant curvaceous bandersnatch woman. Resembles an orange furred cross between a dingo and a fox. She's the jokester of the surfers and has a big appetite, though she never gains a pound. You don't know if she'd eat humans but you don't want to take chances seeing she'll eat everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah Yamaguchi- A blue skinned tengu woman with long white hair. Unfortunately for you, hannah enjoys torturing humans, although the other monsters are unaware of it, she is a sadistic creature that treats humans as little more than insects. You're afraid of the things she'd do to you if she caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouna Andrews- An addition by UltraGTS. Kouna is Connie's twin sister and looks identical to Connie albeit more girly and with a pink bikini. Like her sister, Kouna doesn't eat humans and instead is a lot more flirtatious, especially towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Beachgoers- There are several non surfers at the beach you often interact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKath Williams- A white furred weretigress. A shy sort of monster that visits the beach in order to paint. She never interacts with the other monsters, but you think she\u2019s nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMesa Bovine- A giant white and brown furred minotaur woman, heavyset in body shape with a huge udder. Mesa runs a beach grill and is very friendly towards both you and Roxy. Though she often tells you that one day she\u2019ll cook you up to serve you to the next monster girl to come to the grill or eat you herself. You really hope she\u2019s joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal- A giant pinkish skinned carbuncle. A creature resembling a giant puma with a crystal in her forehead. Opal has the beach\u2019s permission to work as a fortune teller in a \u201cTent of Telekinesis\u201d. Although you\u2019re not sure what she thinks of humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura Lernean- A red skinned hydra scuba diver. Her four heads are always finishing each other\u2019s sentences. You don\u2019t know much about her since Laura never speaks to anyone. Unlike the other beach goers Laura is a scuba diver. However, everyone says she\u2019s trouble since she\u2019s from Horrorville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril Howler- A pair shaped dire werewolf artisan that uses seashells and glass washed up on the beach for her crafts. She's crazy about you and tells people that she's your girlfriend whenever you're together. You usually try to avoid her because April's a borderline yandere. Ironically, even though April's friendly towards humans, Lupa from Monster Arms is her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena Ryd Murdoch - A 950ft tall Pegasus and an additional by the 12th Doctor. Elena has grey fur all over her body, long, black hair, and brown eyes. She has large wings on her back and hooved feet. She has average sized breasts and a decent butt. Due to her years of drinking, she has developed a permanent beer gut, which is actually full of beer. Elena's years of drinking have left her in a permanently drunken state. By that, we mean even if she hasn't had a drink for days, she will still be completely drunk. Her years of drinking have also changed her body: her belly has become a beer storage facility, and whenever she drinks, the beer doesn't digest; it just stays in her gut and accumilates and she can't get it out. For some reason, it never spoils. Despite both of these, she is fairly nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea Kennick - A 900ft werewolf who is an O.C. of the 12th Doctor. Andrea has brown eyes, but no hair or fur due to her nature, showing her icy blue skin. Her body shape is unknown, since she always wears a bulky mechanical suit to simulate a sub-zero environment. It is known that she does not have Lactose Overload Syndrome. Andrea was born with a bizarre genetic mutation that made it so she cannot survive out of a sub-zero environment. It also made it so anything she touched was frozen solid. As she got older, she was given a suit to keep her body at sub-zero and keep her freezing ability in check. Despite this, Andrea is a fairly decent person, if a bit anti-social. She has earned the nickname \"Ms. Freeze\" due to her nature resembling comic character Mr. Freeze. She hates this nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan Marcus Carvonis - An 800ft chimera addition by the 12th Doctor. Susan has three heads: a snake, a hippo, and a panther. All The Snake has black scales, orange eyes and is bald, the hippo has grey skin, blue eyes and is bald, and the panther head has light grey fur, black eyes, and short red hair. The body is that of a really fat, anthro panther with a snake for a tail. She wears a blue, one-piece bikini. Like Aquell, Susan is insane. She harbors an unhealthy obsession with Roxy, having a creepy crush on her. A room in her home is even a stalker shrine to Roxy. She is usually seen watching Roxy or stealing swimsuits she has worn and wearing them herself. Each head has a different approach: the snake, who is shy, watches from afar; the hippo, the most sane head, simply wants to talk; and the panther, the most insane head, steals her possessions and becomes violent if anyone talks to Roxy. Each head also has a different appetite: the snake is a vegan, the hippo only eats cooked meat, and the panther eats humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe Orcaton -  A 985ft tall Were-orca who is an OC of the 12th Doctor Zoe has shiny black-and-whit skin, no hair, and black eyes. Being a were-orca, Zoe is gargantuanly obese, to the point where if she were human, she'd weigh 8 tons. Despite this, she is not immobile. She has legs and can walk on land. Zoe is the definition of a glutton. There's one thing on her mind at all times, and that's \"eat, eat, eat\". As long as Zoe is eating, she's happy. Whenever she is seen, she is always eating. She is also extremely proud of her massive weight. She thinks fat is sexy, and wants all women in the world to be fat. She is friends with Helena Krofft in Monster Slopes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Psychos- There\u2019s a mental hospital built near the beach that's called the Kaiju Disarming Plant because of the large number of dangerously insane monsters admitted there. Unfortunately some of the patients tend to escape the K.D.P. and retreat to the beach. You and Roxy have to make sure they don\u2019t cause trouble on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha Bailey- A drider giantess with the lower body of a black widow spider. Natasha is an insane monster that thinks she's a pirate in the 17th century. She's the most openly violent of the five regular patients that break out and is known to mug people and trap them in her spider webs. You and Roxy mainly have to make sure she doesn't attack anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen Handel- An blue and white haniver girl. Basically a monster resembling a humanoid manta ray. Jen suffered a head injury and now thinks she is Dr. Saturday, a mad scientist from a science fiction movie she watched. She is out to try and take over Terrordale, starting with the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEunice Dent- A spriggan, a type of grotesque fairy. Half her body has red colored while the other half is blue. She's extremely bipolar. One minute she's nice and sweet, and the next minute she's dangerously angry and psychopathic. Stella doesn't like her, seeing her as a disgrace to the fairy race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira Clay- A giant purple skinned clay golem girl. Mira is a paranoid giantess who believes that the sky is evil and is going to fall down on her head. As such, she can usually be seen hiding indoors or underneath something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe Ordain- A beaked phoenix harpy girl. Phoebe is a pyromaniac and the most dangerous psycho in the hospital. Opal holds a grudge against her for burning down her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery- An addition by UltimateNeo. Avery is a 27 year old 300ft chimera creature. Unlike most chimeras, she is a hybridized monster with the appearance of a landshark, the strength and suction cupped arms of an octopus and the ice powers of a Yuki-Onna. She can breathe underwater and turn invisible. Normally peaceful but goes into a rage yelling \"Musha, musha, MUSHA!\" whenever she sees blood. She started to go crazy when she was 12 and witnessed her human boyfriend murdered by a vampire serial killer who kidnapped them both. She snapped and tore the killer apart and was said to have eaten part of her. That's when she was sentenced to the K.D.P.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Other<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Kaguya West- (Addition by UltimateNeo) The head of the mental hospital. A giant kitsune woman with golden fox tails and ears. She's usually the one to report the psychos breaking loose. Fortunately for you she's mostly a vegetarian as far as humans are concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquell Cousteau Harker- An addition by the 12th Doctor. Aquell is a 725ft tall oni with orange skin, red eyes, and short black hair. She has small horns on the top of her head and fangs. Her body used to be hourglass shaped, but her years in her submarine have somehow made her incredibly fat. Aquell is a bizarre woman. She is always on her submarine, searching the sea bed for sunken treasure. She used to do it with her best friends, but they died in a storm. The loneliness and loss of her friends drove her insane. She now thinks of the submarine as a living person and her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila (no last name) - An 800ft tall electricity elemental who is an OC of the 12th Doctor. Sheila's body is made of yellow electricity that constantly sparks. The electricity on the top of her head is made to look like a ponytail. She has solid white eyes and no mouth, though she can still talk and eat. She is very fat from her years of laying around, though is still fairly attractive.  Sheila is probably the laziest person ever. When she shows up at someone's house, she plants herself on the couch and never, ever leaves. She'll mooch off of whoever owns the house, eating their food and hogging the TV. She's also very rude, insulting everyone she meets and belching a lot. She is too lazy to get a job, so she never pays for ANYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbrosine Sanfourche Peinture - A 1100ft succubus who is an OC of the 12th Doctor Ambrosine has violet skin, black eyes, and medium length red hair tied in a bun. Ambrosine is massively fat, to the point of immobility, though she uses a motorized board to get around. She always wears black underwear and an artist's smock. Ambrosine is a famous French artist, known for her incredible paintings of landscapes, people, and things she dreams of. But she is also very temperamental.
