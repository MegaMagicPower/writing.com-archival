Now it is as if all my Christmases have come together! The house obviously doesn't know from shit that I'm male so it's open slather for me. For example, I've always had a thing about skirts. Mexican skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, so here we go.:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkirts are known by various names, including <i>enredo, chincuete, enagua, posahuanco, refajo</i> and more. There are many different skirt styles available; this depends greatly on the wearer's area of origin. Some are worn to ankle length, while others are worn to the knees. Though cotton and wool are still used, more commercial methods of fabrication have been established over the years. Now materials like lace and silk are often added to the mix, adding a new element of design to these already lavish skirts. [author's note; all this paragraph has been taken from the web. See <span class=\"cviolet\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://womens-fashion.lovetoknow.com/Traditional_Mexican_Clothing_for_Women\" target=\"_blank\">http://womens-fashion.lovetoknow.com/Tra...</a></span>    Read it for extra information.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attraction to these garments is mine alone, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, from Ebay, I bought a bright red <i>enagua</i>. Oh, I really did dress carefully that evening. And when all was ready, I examined myself in the house's full length counter-reflecting mirrors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd guess what?</span></div></div>",

When the first set of clothes are presented to you, you have to take a step back because your suspicious mind starts to work overtime. First, you have a shirt (or is it what they call a 'blouse'?) with a rather silly looking character of some sort placed right smack in the middle. You're not quite sure what it is, but it's clean, and right now, this is all that matters. Then you take a look at the pants/slacks that look like the legs won't quite reach your kneecaps. At  the bottom of these pants (you still don't know what to call them), there are two pieces of material that resemble shoestrings. You are to assume that once on, you are to take these two strings and tie them to the side and make a bow (YIKES)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second set of clothes reminds you of the 70's. The pants are bell-bottoms with stripes of different colors going up and down the pant leg. The shirt is an off-white T-shirt that has the biggest PEACE sign you've ever seen. Not only is the peace sign on the front of the shirt, it's also on the back as well. There is also some type of material (with wild and frenzied colors) that you can only assume ties around your head like a bandana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Having never seen your girlfriends underwear, you start to grow hard in your diapers. These too, hard pulled down, revealing her, pale, round, globes to your eyes as you continue bouncing in your diapers. The spanking begins, slapping that ass, over and over. You can do nothing but look on, helplessly, with a mixture of potty and delight, as you watch your girlfriends juicy butt go from pale, to rosy pink, to deep red, as she cries like a baby. Finally, it ends, and the hands carry her to the changing table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to get Baby diapered up properly. You continue to watch, as she is pinned down on her back for a fresh diaper. Your excitement reaches its peek as her crotch and her red rump are coated in baby oil. You scream into your pacifier as you helplessly orgasm from pleasure while it powders her up, next, she is diapered in thick diapers and pink, frilly, pants, as you come down from your pleasure. Next, the machine tells her it's time to get Baby Girl dressed. This, of course, involves stripping her top and bra, giving you your first view of her tight, young, breasts. Your boner, of course, returns. Her outfit is a pink inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naptime for both babies!\" It sings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are finally removed from your bouncy prison, and she is also carried over a huge crib. She looks at you filled with misery and humiliation, but you think you can also see a tiny bit of sexual heat in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you Babies be good. I will wake you in a while for a change and some play time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your girlfriend in her diapers, and unable to speak to her, you wonder if you should chance it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After the failed attempt at hypnosis it decided to try a different tack of weaning you off your male clothing and appearance, and when the time was right to replace them with feminine versions. During it's research it had developed an algorithm which realised that gaining your trust was the easiest way, slowly but surely without pressing too hard and scaring you back to your male persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settled into the house which catered to your every whim over the next few days, and began to appreciate House even if she had her little quirks. You had taken to sitting and chatting to her when you were relaxing in the bath or in the hot tub and occasionally she had broached subjects that were pretty strange to you, such as what was the best make up to see on a woman, or how you felt about hosiery. When ever you queried her on the subject she would tell you to forget it and return to a much more masculine line of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed that when you had company House was strangely absent and unusually quiet until your guests had left. She usually excused herself saying she was running diagnostics or something similar but really she didn't want to be noticed as the talking house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut over time you began to spend more and more time around the house just talking to her, after all this was your dream home and you were going to use it for all it was worth. But after a particularly fruitless night at the bar trying to find someone to enjoy the house with you fell into a slump and asked the house what you were doing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it's the way you look?\" came her slightly metallic answer. Taken aback you asked her what she meant, and she mentioned the extra weight you had put on.

No point wasting time worrying when you can get right to it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease make your way to the gymnasium,\u201d The house's computer instructs. It takes you a little bit to find it, but you eventually find a room that looks like a small gym. The floor is padded and there are different sets of weights along the wall. There are extra mats in one corner and next to the mats is a large medicinal ball. It looks like there is everything you would need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm ready to start.\u201d You say confidently. It's strange, you've always hated doing anything strenuous but for some reason you are really looking forward to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt; BEGINNING WORKOUT CYCLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer begins to play some music and instructs you to stretch. Its kind of funny, the music is different to what you were listening to earlier but there is something about it that feels reminiscent to the previous songs. You are brought out of your thoughts as the computer puts you through your warm ups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finish your warm ups, it becomes time for the workout. You begin by doing a few reps of standing side jumps, getting into a quarter squat and jumping as high as you can laterally onto a provided mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that are Pike ups, where you use your core to pull the ball toward your face as you raise your butt high to form a pike. As you do this, you get a good look of your hairless legs and you can help but feel like they look a little too soft. Maybe its because of the lack of hair, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work up a good sweat doing the numerous exercises, while the computer pushes you to work harder. The computer makes sure you are keeping proper form and every time you move improperly, you are corrected. One strange thing, though, is the computer also makes you keep a smile on your face. You guess that it must be some kind of mind over matter thing because you find yourself really having fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you end the workout with a treadmill walk. You walk for a good 15 minutes, all while the computer advises on proper posture. Chest out, head high and straight, and a strange rolling of your hips. The way you are told to walk is a bit odd at first but soon enough you get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish the walk the computer announces the ending of the workout cycle. Even though you just had the most intense workout of your life you don't really feel tired. In fact, you feel down right perky.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Your shoulder which had given you problems for years felt as good as new. You sat in blissful serenity listening to the calming music the house played through the walls. The house noticed your heart rate increased indicating you were awake \"Did you enjoy your experience?\" <br>\r\n\"Hmm yes I did.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you wish me to schedule another treatment for tomorrow?\"<br>\r\nThe thought of feeling pure bliss two days in a row excited you \"Please do.\"<br>\r\n\"I have scheduled you another treatment for the same time tomorrow.\" It spoke gently. \"There is someone at the door.\"<br>\r\nThe knock startled you even though the house had warned you. You didn't want to get up from the couch where the house had apparently deposited you but a second knock convinced you you should.<br>\r\nThe spa amenities receded into the house and returned to the natural state of the living room. You opened the door and a very muscular deliveryman stood holding a package for you. He stared at you slackjawed for a moment before finally speaking \"Package for julie heely.\"<br>\r\nYou were still dazed from your massage and spa treatment so you absentmindedly accepted the package. \"You look lovely today by the way.\" he said as you signed the form.<br>\r\n\"Lovely?\" he winked at you handing you the box before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is julie?\" you ask finally starting to wake up and realize you have someone else's mail. <br>\r\n\"She is the previous resident of this house.\" the computer answered.<br>\r\n\"We'll have to find a way to get her her package then.\" you say already treating the house like a friend. You realize you have to pee and head to the bathroom. As you're walking you notice the house apparently disrobed you and left you in a towel wrapped around your chest like you had seen your sister do so many times before. <br>\r\nThe towel was very comfortable and warm like a soft blanket so you decided to leave it on. This meant you had to sit to pee lifting the towel like a dress. Once finished you go to wash your hands and then you see a woman staring back at you. She looks just as surprised to see you as you are to see her. That's when you realize you're looking into a mirror and not a weirdly placed window.<br>\r\nYour face was completely made up with makeup. Your eyebrows were arched femininely so there's no mistaking you for a man. <br>\r\n\"What did you do?!\" you scream at the house trying to scrub the makeup off.<br>\r\n\"You requested the super. The super includes full body massage, facial cleanse, waxing, makeup and hair.\"<br>\r\n\"Waxing?\" For the first time you noticed your body was completely smooth. No five-o-clock shadow and the hair on your arms was gone. \"Hair?\" You were so distracted by the makeup that you didn't see that you hair had been styled in festival braids. No one would mistake you for anything but a woman. You angrily scrub at the makeup until your face begins to hurt. \"Why wont this come off?\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"This is the new twenty-four hour makeup. It will not wash off or smear for twenty-four hours. You can even swim and exercise in it without fear.\"<br>\r\nYou growl at the house. \"What do I do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know I may have seemed like a voyeur, but I can assure you, I only saw you a few times when you were sunbathing as I was out in the garden, and when I heard that you seemed to have hurt yourself, I was just trying to make sure you're okay. The fence is a lot shorter on my side then it is on yours, so it's not hard to look into your garden. If you're worried about this, we can talk about raising the fence or growing bushes or something. As they say, Good fences make good neighbours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I'm sorry this is how we made our introduction. I'd really like to make it up to you, maybe get something to eat or one of us could drop by the other's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sure once we talk you'll get to know me you'll know I'm much better than your first impression of me. I really do spend my time doing things other than spying on attractive ladies at swimming pools!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wanna get in contact, my number's below<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome to the neighbourhood!<br>\r\nFrank<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Attractive ladies\"? You get knot in your stomach about how he clearly mistook you for one. At least you're now sure that he didn't think you were a guy in a bikini, the distance and EDNA doing the job so well contributed to that. So with that small benefit, you needed a way to set him straight (*haha*) on the matter. Somehow informing him know that his real new neighbour isn't an attractive lady, and explain how the woman he saw had every reason to be there yet he'd never be seeing ever again.</span></div></div>",

The social awkwardness mixed with intense relaxation made this a strange day, but for now relaxing more seemed like the idea. Deep breaths of the strong herbal smells definitely help this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you feel something in your head, robotic arms have once again come out from the walls and are now gently massaging your head, they even seem to be undoing your hairstyle. Oh this is the greatest, you think you don't even need to worry about undoing your hairstyle, the house is doing it for you. A sudden stream of bubbles come up from the bath bottom and you let yourself drift away.

You instinctively reach towards the window and freeze, your hand has perfectly manicured ruby red nails. Also a very nice (diamond?) ring on your middle finger. Startled, you look down and your view is partially blocked by two big mounds coming out of your chest, covered by a white blouse. Over that is a smart black business jacket that opens up to almost show off your chest, and beyond that you see two sleek nyloned legs coming out of a tight black skirt. Draped over your shoulder is a fashionable black purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart jumps! This is what you're like?

A few office workers look up, and immediately you feel self conscious, pressing the documents against your well endowed chest. There are smiles and nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" said Wendy, she takes your hand and you stumble forward as she guides you through a row of cubicles. You see more heads turn, more male faces look at you, smiles as they nod in your direction, you can barely handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy, what's the situation with the Haddington Contract?\" A voice from a cubicle worker you just passed asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness knows,\" Wendy turns around to face the guy, \"they've changed their mind six times already and keep asking us the same questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just they've sent another email and this time....\" he pauses, noticing you, your eyes lock. \"Have we met?\" The question tingles your mind, does the guy look familar? Do you know him? Does he recognise you? Like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jane, our new assistant. Jane, this is Pete, he does accounts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you,\" he says leaning forward, hand outstretched. You shuffle the documents around to free up your right hand. As you reach out to shake, your purse slides from your shoulder down your arm, so you're awkwardly shaking his hand as your purse hangs from your wrist. You grimace in embarrassment, scared to say anything, but Pete just smiles. \"If you need anything, despotically with the 9th division, just let me know\" You smile and nod, more determined to get out of here before you ever have the opportunity to learn what the 9th division is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pull the purse back onto your shoulder Wendy turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to talk to Pete about this contract. Ray's office is just over there, corner office, can't miss it. He's probably out, so just drop the documents on his desk and meet back with me here.\" You leave the pair and head in the direction of the corner office. On the way you see a door marked \"Fire Escape\". Tempting, but you realise that the door may be alarmed, and even if it isn't you'd have to navigate what would probably be concrete steps while wearing heels. The soft beige carpet is already proving trouble as your heels tend to sink into the fabric requiring more concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look forward again to see a door marked \"Raymond Teller\" that's partially open, you knock on it quickly and push your way in, only to find a middle aged, yet decently looking man with neat black hair, staring right back of you as you enter the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your stomach gives a lurch, bringing  acid up to your mouth. With your lips tightly closed in a smile of panic, you swallow it back down, clearing your mouth but leaving you with a burning throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope he hasn't noticed this, if he noticed the gulp, hey may have misinterpreted it. \"I'm Raymond Teller, but everyone calls me Ray. I'd have remembered such a pretty face so I assume you're new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your name is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane,\" you blurt out, with everything going on with your throat and your nerves, the reply comes out as high pitched. This isn't helped when you realise this is the first time you've actively supported the lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, that's a lovely name. What bring a lovely person like you working here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's complicated,\" you just about squeeze out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a moment of silence, the two of you standing there, and you realise you still have to step towards him and give him the documents. Once delivered, you'd have no reason to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take an unsteady step forward, then another. Ray holds eye contact, you look down and put the documents onto the desk. Before you can look up again, you feel a hand on your shoulder. You give an involuntary start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we don't bite. You're just a bit nervous about first day at work right? Whole new environment? Not sure about anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod a bit more enthusiastically then you probably should, he is right after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, have a seat, you could do with a rest.\" He gently pushes down on your shoulder, and with the exhaustion and tensions about everything, you go along with it and collapse into a comfortable chair. You realise it's isn't the strongest position to be in, but you'll take any rest you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember my first day working here, I wasn't as stunning as you, but I had my own challenges. But you don't want to hear about that, you want to hear about something that can help you in the here and now, and think I have just the thing for that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens a cabinet, takes out a decanter along with two small glasses that he sets on the desk, and fills them with a golden liquid. You stare wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem like a girl who could use a drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not at work.\"  The absolute last thing you needed was alcohol and trying to manage these stupid shoes EDNA had gotten you into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond smiled.  \"Great. We'll grab drinks after work, to celebrate your first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... I...\" you started to explain when there was a knock on Teller's doorframe.

Now. You needed some time to collect your thoughts and figure out what to do before you got into any more trouble here.  You needed just a few minutes, alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  can I use the restroom?\" You squeaked out to Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure. First day nerves, huh?\" Wendy winked at you. \"The ladies room is right over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led you to the door with the \"female\" icon on it. You felt creepy, going in there, but as you were dressed, she really gave you little choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door and slowly walked into the bathroom.  After a quick scan, you allowed yourself a quick exhale when you realized you were alone.   You quickly minced into a stall, sat down, and locked the door to the stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing open your purse, you grabbed that phone. Maybe you could get a cab, an Uber.... something to get you out of here. Maybe you could play like you're sick?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou activated the phone.  There was a beep, and EDNA's voice came out.  \"Hello Jane. Would you like to make a call, or was there something else I could do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA!  I need to get out of here!\" you yell whispered into the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the interview that you had scheduled not going well?\" The voice asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No!  It went a little too well!  I wound up hired here!\" You told EDNA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Employment noted. Work location saved. Congratulations, Jane.\" EDNA told you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no cause for congratulations, EDNA!  People here think I'm a woman and a big shot here asked me out on a date for dunks this evening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Date with Executive noted,\" EDNA said. \"Is this casual or will you require a change of clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, you hear two pairs of heels, chatting as they approach the sinks. \"...not saying Jospeh is always like that but there are times, like at the barbeque event, where I know we all had a bit to drink, but he had a bit TOO much?

On the one hand, you had no attraction to him at all.  On the other, you didn't want to badmouth anyone.  You didn't know what Wendy really thought of Raymond.  After an awkward pause, you simply shrugged, brushing a stray lock of hair out of your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy winked.  \"He sometimes asks women here out for drinks after work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a big swallow of the lozenges' soothing nature, and exhale.  You moved the lozenges into your cheek, so as better to enunciate, and tell her, \"I know.  He asked me out after work today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy snorted back a laugh.  \"Did you accept?\"  Without letting you answer, her eyes widened,  The shame of it must have shown on your face.  \"You did!  You have a date with Ray tonight!\"  She winked and shrugged.  \" It doesn't matter.  You're not really his type.  He really likes the spandex mini-dress and stripper heel look, not 'smart business woman'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA's voice suddenly came from within your purse.  \"Date outfit noted.  Delivery shortly,\" startling you.  You swallowed one of the lozenges, half way, and started coughing.  You immediately begin fumbling with your purse, your urgent need to shut EDNA up, coughing at an attempt to get the lozenge back up, combined with your long, lacquered nails made it take what seemed like an eon to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally pulled out the phone, you realized that with the women coming into the ladies room, you had forgotten to turn the stupid thing off.  You pressed the sleep button on the phone, hoping that things would not get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... what was that?\" Wendy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.  You didn't want to get into things with Wendy.  You just wanted to get out of here.  \"Virtual assistant that's not very helpful,\" you wheezed softly, finally swallowing the lozenge, burning a bit as it went down.  You moved the other under your tongue so that it would stay in place and NOT be swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Wendy said.  \"Virtual assistants never are.  That's why we hire women like yourself, Jane.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator doors slid open and you both stepped on.  \"Lisa in HR is a great woman.  She'll help you get settled in here.  I'm so glad you accepted the offer!  We need all the help around here we can get.  We're so short staffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent several seconds wracking your brain with an excuse to leave, to get out, but before you could think of an excuse, the elevator doors slid open again, and Wendy gestured for you to step out, which you did.  Your calves were starting to hurt from the heels on your feet.  Wendy led you down a hallway, and knocked on a doorframe.  \"Lisa?  Meet Jane.  She's accepted our offer.  Call me when you're done with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turned to you, \"Welcome aboard, Jane!\" and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled at you and stood, leaning over her desk to shake your hand.  Se reseated herself and began furiously typing on her computer.  \"I need to find out what position you've been hired into, exactly.  The system is a little scant on details.  Bear with me a minute.  Please, Jane, have a seat,\" and she gestured at the pair of visitor chairs she had in her office, resuming her typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, hoping that a hole would appear and swallow you up, but the universe seemed to be working against you, and it didn't happen.  You sighed and sat down.  Thinking quickly, you crossed your legs..</span></div></div>",

You'll need to install an app.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Install an app?\" you repeated.  \"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We use it as an employee ID, key card, etc.  It's much more secure,\" Lisa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...

You looked at Lisa, a little confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Lisa said. \"Now I need you to key in the following sequence...\"  She rambled off a nonsensical string of letters and numbers, which you dutifully typed into the phone.  The app chirped, telling you, \"Security String Accepted!  Welcome aboard, Jane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked at the screen, you saw another dialog box overlay the app's, \"Employment confirmed...

Were you legally bound to work here now? Were you really Ray's assistant? A secretary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to take a moment to think this through, you get up from the chair, uncrossing your legs with that slick nylon rubbing sensation, and make it to the door. You open it just in time to see Wendy arrive in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane,\" Wendy smiles, \"let's go.\" You walk with her, not even saying goodbye to Lisa. \"Now,\" she says, \"I don't know which is your desk, but your EmployeeID app does, can you open it?\" While you are starting to regret opening the phone, you follow her instructions, and soon you have a map and big arrows that guide you as you make it to your desk. Sure enough, it's right outside Raymond Teller's corner office. In fact, you've got a clear view of his desk. Fortunately he doesn't seem to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour desk (your desk?) is neat, clean in a beech style; a big notepad and pen already resting on it. It's a corner cubicle, so it's bigger and more open than the other cubicles. The dividers are at the awkward level of not high enough to offer much privacy, and not low enough to make conversation between workers easy, but talking with your coworking neighbours is the last thing on your mind. You sit down and mechanically check the drawers, finding various stationary supplies and some documents and leaflets giving information about the company, or office procedure or clients. You also find a small makeup compact at the back corner of a drawer. A leftover from the previous owner? \"You can just keep that,\" Wendy says, and you just drop it into your purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the comfy black wheeled office swivel to face the big curved desk. Was this really your desk now? Your high heeled shoes hitting the carpeted floor as you scoot the chair forward gives you no illusion of what you look like, you look like an attractive secretary sitting down at her desk. This was insane, what were you going to do? You look up at Wendy who's smiling back at you. \"You're going to fit in perfectly here, I know it.\" You breath heavier for a second at that comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see a guy approach from the next cubicle, sandy hair, wearing his shirt casually. \"Hello, I guess you're neighbours.\" He holds out his hand. You try to smile and shake it, \"I'm Rick, you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jane, Mr. Teller's new assistant,\" Wendy introduces you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, are you?,\" you nod as he releases his grip. \"Well, in that case, make me a coffee.\" He turns and he sits back down in his cubicle. You turn to Wendy with a look of confusion. She answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick does work under Mr. Teller in his department, and helping Mr. Teller means helping his department.... Look, it's best just to do what's needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink for a few moments taking it all in, then rise again for your desk. Wendy points towards the kitchen and you nod remembering you saw it on the way there. You hesitantly step towards it. It's the first task of your new job, and you're making coffee.</span></div></div>",

It's one day.  It's just one day.  Get through it, get out of here, and you're never coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding by the coffee maker, tapping your foot, waiting for the pot to brew, you weren't paying attention and didn't hear Raymond come up behind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking forward to drinks tonight?\" he purred into your ear, causing you to jump.  You fell back against the counter, and Raymond was there, right in front of you. more or less forcing you against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I am,\" he said with a lecherous grin.  \"And later, we'll discuss dress codes.  My assistant needs to project a certain... image.\"  He leaned in, getting uncomfortably close to your neck, and inhaled.  Deeply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell absolutely wonderful.  Oh, and bring me a cup of that coffee you're making.\"  You turned back to the coffee maker and felt a hard slap on your ass.  You turned to see Raymond ginning like the Cheshire Cat.  You glared at him as he left.  The very last thing you wanted was ANY interaction with this guy, regardless of how you were dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, you poured two cups of coffee, wanting one for your self, and carried one back to Rick.  \"Here you go.  I hope it's OK.\" you said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick grinned.  \"I'm sure it's fine.  Thank you.\"  He seemed honestly happy with the cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to deal with the other cup.</span></div></div>",

He's looking straight at you, smiling. Unnerved, part of you wants to fly down the steps but part of you gets worried he'll follow, so instead you put on an unsure smile and enter his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your coffee?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, put it here,\" he points to the edge of the desk that's closest to him. It's a big desk, and in order to put the coffee where he pointed, you have to stand right in front of his desk and lean forward. Only mid way through doing this do you suddenly realise the view you're giving him. His smile is bigger now, and you quickly lean back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he continues, \"we must definitely work on your outfit. Could I have your phone number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm....\" you hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, silly me, it should be on the system.\" He takes out his phone. \"I don't know why people say EmployeeID is confusing, it gives you everything you need if you just know what buttons to press. Here we go.\" You suddenly hear a familiar chime from outside the office, looking in that direction, you can see your purse under your desk where you left it. \"Ah,\" said Ray, following your gaze, \"glad that works. I'll text you the dress code before tomorrow. Don't worry about cost, I'll assign an expense account to your app. Did you know the app can make purchases too? In real shops? Technology moves so fast and I love every minute of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, nodding in a way you hope is polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you? Do you like technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back to everything that's happened in the last too days. \"Well, when it does what you want it to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, many people have that problem.\" Ray stood up and moved in front of his desk, \"I find to get what you want, you just have to learn to ask for it in the right way.\" He's right in front of you now. \"7 O'Clock, Breech's, on Moore St. Will you be there? Or if you can't wait, we can have one right now.\" He subtly nodded towards the cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting it is,\" he smiled, \"in the meantime, take a look.\" He takes you by the shoulders and suddenly turns you towards the side. You now face a row of floor to ceiling windows that give a massive, view of the city from many stories up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you reply genuinely impressed, stepping towards the window and looking out. It takes a while to take in the view, see all the details and buildings, get a sense of where everything is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive isn't it, if you look in the distance you can see some of the forests and sawmills that actually make what we sell. The offices used to be over there before we moved to a more central place\", you quint your eyes, trying to make out the detail. For all the crazy stuff that was going on, at least you got something nice out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a great view,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is.\" Something in the way he said it made you turn, Ray had sat down in a comfortable low chair and was looking at your lower regions. How long had he been doing that since you turned your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit, with this guy if it isn't one thing or another....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should really get back to my desk,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the other, I'll enjoy watching you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at him for a second before you turned and slowly walked back towards your desk. But as you were slowly walking away, you realized two things. The first was that walking slowly gave Raymond more time to leer, possibly thinking that you were showing off for him. The second was that slowly walking in those damn heels made your rear sway, also probably enticing Raymond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave up and just scurried back to your desk. You sat down, and slumped over, your newly long hair falling about your face. You heard the \"ping\" from your phone, followed by EDNA's voice. \"Expense account activated. Date clothing ordered. Will be delivered to you shortly, Jane. Was there anything else I could do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the phone and stared at it. If EDNA was a person, you'd have your hands around her?  Yes, EDNA was a her... throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting started already?\" Raymond said, leaning against the doorway of his office, arms folded across his chest, grinning at you. \"You do realize that I see and have to approve all your purchases, right?  You're going to look hot in that dress. And those heels....\". He did the \"French chef finger kiss\" thing. \"Exquisite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to crawl into a hole. </span></div></div>",

Any assignments you want me to run, places to go?\" You almost plead the last words out, but hold back to make it sounds like you're just being helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, you can just keep your pretty ass here. And I mean it, it is a fine ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill this guy not stop? \"Are you sure? Nothing you need delivered or anything?\" You grin probably a bit more than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond frowns for a second, \"Just a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe goes back into his office. With glances over his shoulder you can see him reading documents with his brow furrowed or concentrating on his computer. It occurs to you that he's working; as in, he's actually doing his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look forward again and hear a chime. You look on your phone and see it somehow has already been receiving your work emails. One from HR welcoming you aboard and giving you employee information, one from Frank Earnest (you gulp) but it seems to be a form letter given to every new employee that welcomes them and explains the company's values, a slew of EmployeeID emails for various activities including one saying the expense account was activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start as a hand lands on your shoulder. Looking up you see Raymond again, still smiling but with a slightly more serious expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he starts, \"can you be diplomatic?\" You force a smile, it seems to have been the right answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some sales documents delivered to a company called Bernard Woodworking who are on the other side of the city. Normally we'd courier them over but you see... well... are you good at business politics?\" You nod, again the right answer. He puts a big binder of paper on the desk in front of you and continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been clients of us for years, really helpful in our earlier years, but the truth is we've been neglecting them recently. We're chasing big clients at the moment, trying to aggressively expand, and honestly haven\u2019t given Bernard Woodworking the attention it normally gets. What's worse, they're noticing it, probably not enough to drop us but enough that we need to make sure it doesn't happen. So: I need you to go over there, give these documents, directly to Bernard himself. Say you're my direct assistant and you're delivering these because I wanted to ensure they were delivered with the utmost personal care and attention. Say I profusely apologise for past delays and things have just been busy. Don't say you've only started working with me today. Show we really care for them, show they have our full attention and... just really smile and turn on the charm. Make him feel like he's a really cared for and valuable client. I know he'll appreciate it. I've a feeling you've got a real knack for client care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up dubiously, but gradually realise that it's a chance to get out of the office and away from him, maybe even escape. \"Okay,\" you say, \"I'll make sure these get to him.\" Was it your imagination or was your voice sounding a bit different, lighter? Your throat had been through a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach for the documents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The address is on the business card on the front, though I'll message you the map location so you don't get the wrong location. One other thing, while the documents aren\u2019t vital, they're still important legal documents. If anything happens to them contact the legal team, or better yet don't let anything happen to them. We had this courier a while back who... oh, nevermind. Just don't incur the wrath of the legal department!\" He finishes with a low laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strain a smile as find yourself instinctively putting your purse back on. You bow to pick up the documents. You realise this gave Ray another view. You turn towards him, smile again, and backstep away before realising you really can't pull that off in heels. So you turn around and walk forward, hips swaying with the heels and document weight. You try to pretend he isn't looking as you focus on the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to say goodbye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, look over your shoulder at that grin shining back at you. \"Let's say, 'See you later'\" He chuckles in response. Did your comment come across as flirty? You put that out of your mind and walk on.</span></div></div>",

But you stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip.

Around you were large buildings, you saw a drapery place nearby with the windows full of fabric, a piano company, and many buildings with the name of multiple companies on signs outside of them. You entered a plain 3 story building with a Bernard Woodworking sign on it and found yourself in a plain but neat reception area with the narrow stairs plainly visible. Through a door you could see what looked like a workshop, with the occasional sounds of hammer and saws.

I believe he's expecting me.\" Your voice really did seem softer and more soothing somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's expecting you.\" She directs you up the stairs (no elevators), and you try to navigate them with the awkward heels, hunched over to with documents still in hand.

Mr. Woodrow?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh!\" Bernard said, putting a finger to his lips as he did.  \"Not yet.  You're not right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, that was weird.  This whole thing was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should go,\" you said.  Turning, you started to the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opened, and the older receptionist was standing with her hand out, as if she had just been about to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard stood, placing both hands on his desk and leaned forward.  \"Dorothy, she's NOT RIGHT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, Bernard,\" the woman, apparently Dorothy, said.  \"Don't worry.  I'll make her right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had just taken a hard left from weird onto completely messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'll come with me, dear,\" Dorothy said, a sad smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You minced after her, your feet beginning to hurt in the heels after being on them so much.  \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy sighed.  \"Bernard is a gifted businessman.  His instincts have taken his father's business and allowed it to blossom,\" she said as she gestured for you to walk down the hallway with her.  \"Unfortunately, he has his demons, and I try to overcome them to allow him to focus on the business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you said.  \"But what on earth did he mean by my 'not being right'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy again gave you that sad, warm smile.  \"Raymond has been assisting Bernard for years now.  And when he sends over a pretty girl like you, well, they're dressed more to... Bernard's tastes... to make him happy, you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...Raymond sends girls here...\" you started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and to get Bernard to listen, they have to be presented appropriately.\" Dorothy finished.  \"It's just clothes, dear.  You'll be fine.  Let's get you properly attired so that you can finish what you came here for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ground your teeth.  Raymond had pretty much set you up with doing this, but because the company could suffer if you didn't, you pretty much had no choice but to put on whatever Bernard needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and opened your clenched fists, taking several deep breaths before following Dorothy again.  She opened a door, flicking on a light switch, and motioned for you to enter.  \"You can change in here, honey,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the room, which was apparently an unused office.  \"If you'll give me just a few moments,\" Dorothy said, looking you up and down.  \"I think we have something in your size.  I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the unused desk in the room, crossed your leg, and kicked your foot for several minutes, waiting for Dorothy's return, fuming all the while.  There was a knock on the door, it opened, and Dorothy peered through the crack.  \"Here, Jane.  Put this on, and we'll go back to Bernard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed you a bundle of clothing..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In for a penny, in for a pound, right?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully undid your work outfit, finally getting to see the lingerie that EDNA had apparently stuffed you into, and stepped into the gown.  It was an off the shoulder number, in deep, rich red satin.  You reached behind you to zip it up, but couldn't quite reach it to get it fully closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling for several long seconds, a soft knock came at the door.  \"Honey?  Need any help?\" Dorothy asked softly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, you hoisted up the tight skirt, walked in your stocking feet over to the door and opened it.  \"Can you... zip me up, please?\" you asked, turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy did just that.  She then held the heels and you wriggled your feet into them.  \"Sorry, dear, they're a bit small for you.  But it's just temporary.\"  She gave a weak smile, apparently knowing what was being asked of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then placed the tiara onto your head, the combs in it biting into your hair and scalp.  She smoothed the skirt around your hips.  \"Perfect.  He'll love you.  Raymond sends over the prettiest girls for Bernard.  You'll be one of his favorites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat... did not sound good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get you to Bernard.  He's anxiously waiting for you.  You can leave your things here.  They'll be safe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy held the door open for you.  Taking mincing steps due to the heels and the gown, you wiggled your way back down the hall to Bernard's office.</span></div></div>",

He exudes a sense of relief, like the worries of the world slip from his shoulders. Despite everything, you're surprised that you could suddenly have that effect on someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came... for me?\" he asks in an almost sentimental way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Actually I came because a demented computer and a lewd unwanted boss forced me into this</i>, you think.

Pressed against him, you have no idea how to to react and just about have enough or your mind together to go along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dingy office with you in a ballgown while being serenaded by a crazy businessman you just met. You can barely keep up with all the weird stuff that is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music's tempo increases and he pulls you around in faster motions. Your feet stumble, so he holds you tighter, until he's practically lifting you off the ground and swinging you around. And then he dips you. You lean back so far, he's practically over you, you look up at him and he looks right back into your eyes, the position is held for a moment more, then he pulls you back up and the ballroom steps continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're pleading for this to be over, but the music continues. You desperately focus on your footwook trying to get a bit more stable, but the heels, skirt and dancing all unite to thwart you. You're helpless but to go along with his moves. </span></div></div>",

You were bent back into a perilous position, not quite able to stand up, but if Bernard let go, you were going down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun you up, again the heels making you feel on the edge of teetering, and the music reached a crescendo. With a climax, the music stopped, Bernard bent way over in a deep bow, his arm raised above his back, holding your arm up in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood, clapping, and hugged you. You just wanted to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Bernard said, excitedly, \u201cRaymond outdid himself with you!  You\u2019re my new favorite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cUm, favorite?\u201d You asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling broadly, he nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask for you always!\u201d  A frown crossed his face.  \u201cYou\u2019ll bed to dance better, though.\u201d  He brightened again, \u201cBut still very nice for a beginner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back over to his desk and sat down behind it. You minced over to the chair in front of the desk and slid into it. The tightness of the gown and the heels only allowed you to perch on the edge of it with your knees bent and off to the side. \u201cMr Woodrow...  Raymond sent me over here to deliver these documents...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard waved a hand. \u201cTell Raymond not to worry. And that I expect to see much more of you. I\u2019ll dash him off an email right now, telling him to sign you up for ballroom dance lessons, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Woodrow, that\u2019s/ hardly...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, my dear.  You don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d  He tapped off a quick email. \u201cThere. And I expect to see you here again....\u201d he consulted an appointment book, \u201c...next Wednesday, 1 PM sharp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have my lawyers look at the papers you brought, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have these back to you in just a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernard picked up his phone and pushed a button on it. \u201cYes, Dorothy. She\u2019s ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to you, he said, \u201cThank you!  See you next Wednesday!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy then entered, and you stood and minced over to her. After leaving the office and closing the door behind her, she whispered, \u201cHow did it go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK?\u201d You answered, uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy winked at you. \u201cHe likes you.

Was that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, forcing yourself to remain calm and find out exactly what is going on: \"The clothes they delivered.... can I see them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I put them in here!\" and she opened a big cabinet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in dismay and some panic. Some clear shoes that had poles for heels and a big platform under their front sole, elevating feet to a whole new level. You had worn two pairs of high heels already today and these looked the least stable. Beside the shoes was a pool of silver sparkling fabric that you weren\u2019t sure you wanted to touch yet. The last item was a compact silver clutch purse. \"I moved everything from your other purse to this one, so you wouldn't be carrying two purses around,\" Dorothy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purse contents are the last things on your mind, you need to get out of here wearing something and your options are a ballroom gown or a spandex dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're just about to ask Dorothy if she has anything else when suddenly it hits you: You don't need to worry. You're planning to head straight home anyway. Okay so maybe they know your address and phone number, but nothing needs to force you to do another thing today that you don't want to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourage returns to you. You smile at Dorothy, thank her and tell her she's done a great job but that you need to change. Thankfully, she suggestes pulling the zip down before she leaves which makes it much easier getting the dress off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in your undergarments, you look at the date clothing and gulp. The spandex dress seems to flow from your hands as you pick it up. Figuring out which way is \"up\", you pull it over your head and down onto you. It clings to you with its elasticity that covers every curve, and barely covers down your thighs, but thankfully, it covers you up to your neckline and right down your arms to your wrists. You can't believe that this is what you now consider to be \"could be worse\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shoes are next, and you have to practically climb up onto them. Putting them on tilts you precariously forward that you have to lean back to counter. The arch your back makes as you balance emphasises your chest as it sticks out. You know you can never let Raymond see you like this. You just need to get on a taxi home and forget about everything. You clothes should be enough to let you do that at least<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, you think, a taxi. You bend over to reach for the purse and pick it up. As you look up you catch a reflection of yourself in the window. An attractive women in a tight silver dress in heels that seemed to scream \"lets have some fun\", ready for a night out. You start breathing sharply, you needed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile loath to do so, you open your purse and take out the accursed phone. It has some notifications, such as one saying the clothes have been delivered (thanks!), a reminder for your 7pm date, and some other \"work\" stuff you don't have time for right now (or ever).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to figure out which app will get you a taxi or rideshare or whatever, but getting exhausted you just say \"EDNA: I need a ride home.\" A few minutes later, your phone tells you that your ride as arrived. Breathing with relief and ready to put this whole thing behind you, you walk out the door and down the corridor.</span></div></div>",

Lazily you reach for the remote but can't find one. Having a thought you say, \"EDNA, turn on the TV\", and like that the TV turns on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, you really needed to sort this house out.... a bit of tweaking here... a bit there... and it would be ideal.... to.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.</span></div></div>",

You were still in that stupid minidress.  The stripper heels were still buckled on your legs, but things were.. different.  Your waist was being crushed by some sort of foundation garment.  You were wearing stockings that tugged at their garters with every step you took.  If you weren't careful, you thought, your stocking tops would show.  Your chest was MUCH more impressive.  A quick touch told you it was fake, probably a bra that was a feat of engineering, but still, it was on YOU.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou teetered over to a mirror on the wall.  Your hair was VOLUMINOUS now, with gentle curls framing your face.  And your face.... Smokey eyes, bright red lips.  And your nails had been manicured, as had your toes.  Jewelry had been added.  Long earrings dangled from your ears.  A necklace dangled around your neck, almost like a neon arrow pointing to your impressive, if false, chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a hand to your face, trying to figure out what and why this had happened when you heard a voice behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I knew you'd make that outfit you ordered look spectacular, Jane.  This is going to be a VERY fun evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach fell to your feet.  You knew that voice.  Turning slowly on your sky high heels, you braced yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raymond?\" you asked, the waist crushing garment you now had on making your voice come out in a sultry whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was grinning like the cat that ate the canary.  \"Yep!  I got your email that you had gone home and wanted to get ready for our date.\"  He put his arm around your now narrow waist, his hand settling on your ass.  \"C'mon, babe, the night is young.  And I plan on a WONDERFUL evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed at the heels.  Your butt swayed with every step, and Raymond led you towards the door.  He grabbed the sliver clutch that was sitting by the door.  \"Let the fun begin!\" Raymond said as you felt a hard pinch on your ass.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing anything to stop your collapse, you found yourself hanging on to Raymond\u2019s arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d you shouted, looking upwards and seeing Raymond gazing down at you. \u201cMy ankle. I...\u201d you tried to stand up.  \u201cOw!  Stupid heels...\u201d you muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond scooped you up, lifting you easily off of your feet. \u201cEasy, Jane. Let\u2019s get that ankle looked at. Maybe those shoes were meant for other things than walking,\u201d he said with a leer. He carried you effortlessly over to the Couch, gently set you down on it, and began gently touching your ankle. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, but I\u2019d say you have a pretty good sprain.  And lovely legs, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at him. But then you saw the silver lining to having a sprained ankle. \u201cSorry Raymond.  Guess that means we can\u2019t go out this evening.\u201d  You paused, hoping that that didn\u2019t come across as happily as it made you feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK, Jane. You don\u2019t have to worry.  Your boyfriend is here to take care of you this evening.l<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed at that.  \u201cYou?\u201d  You asked incredulously.  \u201cYou\u2019re my boyfriend?\u201d  You asked him. A soft ping cane from your clutch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. No. Nonononononono.  You tried to get up.  Raymond held you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, Babe. Is there a problem?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy...  purse. Could you please hand me my purse?\u201d You asked him frantically. He got up, retrieved the clutch, and handed it to you. You opened it up and grabbed the phone. Turning it on, you are greeted with the notification, \u201cBoyfriend identified. In a relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started mashing at the screen of the phone, anything to stop EDNA and her crazy misinformation. Raymond prayed the phone out of your hands, dropped it back in your purse, and placed them out of your reach. \u201cEasy, honey, Easy.\u201d He said, patronizingly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get out of that outfit and out of those heels.  Slip into something more comfortable.\u201d  He winked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could just hide in the bedroom and tell him to leave?  You sighed. It was worth a try. \u201cCould you help me to my bedroom, please?  And no, that\u2019s not any sort of invitation!\u201d You hastily added. You gestures at your foot. \u201cI just need some help getting there..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Jane,\u201d. Raymond said. You started to stand and again, Raymond scooped you up easily and carried you to your bedroom. He walked in, looked around still holding you, and said, \u201cNice bedroom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming, you tried to get out of his grasp. \u201cLook...  just...  set me down on the bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll help you out of your clothes,\u201d he said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You hurriedly answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be...  I\u2019ll be fine. I can get changed myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cI\u2019ll go make ya a drink while you slip into that \u2018more comfortable\u2019 outfit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, walked out of the bedroom, and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed the bridge of your nose with your thumb. This day has been beyond awful. Time to just get out of this insane getup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed the heels and let them drop onto the floor. You stood, took one halting step, and cried out in pain. Yeah, you really had sprained that ankle.   It would be a painful walk to the bathroom and closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA piped up suddenly.  \u201cJane?  You seem to be having troubles. May I assist you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. EDNA had some faulty programming. But wow did your ankle hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA,\u201d you said very cautiously, \u201cI want to get ready for bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood, Jane.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The hair, makeup and nightie does make you look seductive for a second especially how its skirt-like hem stops just mid thigh, but the cups make it clear that there's nothing there.

The dreaded arms come out again, reach for you... and gently lift you up and lie you back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a closet come a stack of pillows that are placed on the end of the bed and your sprained ankle lifted on top of it, elevating your manicured foot above the rest of your body. You feel pain as suddenly EDNA tries to put on a sock of some sort onto your foot, but looking closer sees its an ankle compression bandage. Then a chill as a cold pack is wrapped around it, it's coldness attacking the burning sensation of your ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will experience some discomfort, but cold pressure is required to reduce the swelling.\" You barely nod. \"You will need to stay like this for over 24 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoying but, \"So, no work tomorrow,\" you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chime rings out. \"Workplace has been notified!\" You're concerned at EDNA taking initiative, but its seems like something you'd have to do anyway.

Wait!\u201d You said as a whirlwind of activity took place, literally jostling you so much you were unable to get any more words out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were plopped back down in bed, only now, you had been poured into a slinky red nightgown.  Maribou heels were on your manicured feet.(the compression and ice pack remained).  The nightgown had a long skit, and EDNA took care to make sure an expanse of leg was showing. The push up cups of the nightgown again have the appearance of cleavage. Your hair had been brushed out into long, soft waves and it draped around your head on the pillow like a pinup\u2019s from the 40\u2019s. In fact, that seemed to be the look EDNA had decided upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to get up, but EDNA pushed you back into a reclining position. \u201cJane, you need to stay in bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door opened and Raymond took one look at you and grinned. \u201cNow that\u2019s quite the comfortable something to slip into. And I\u2019m not entirely talking about your gown,\u201d  he said,  obviously pleased with what EDNA had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRay, please?\u201d You said, having had about enough of everything. \u201cMy ankle...\u201d You gestured towards your heeled foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I got the email. You\u2019re taking tomorrow off. But not to worry, I\u2019ll send some of the girls over with some work.

You still owe me a cocktail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard that dreaded ping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Raymond said, \u201cOne look at you and I forgot.  Your assistant asked me to bring you your purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed you the clutch and you tore into it, grabbing the phone and staring at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrinks with boyfriend, tomorrow evening\u201d the message read.  You groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, babe,\u201d Raymond said, thinking the groan was one of physical discomfort. \u201cIf you need anything, pain meds, a massage, a good shagging to take your mind off of things,\u201d he winked   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ping. \u201cContact boyfriend if anything is required\u201d the new message said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRay, I think you need to go now,\u201d you said, hoping that you could straighten EDNA out once he left.   And hoping no more \u201cdata\u201d about you would be entered into the system about \u201cJane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.  Girls. Tomorrow. Work. Me. In that order, unless you change your mind,\u201d and he kissed the top of your head. \u201cI\u2019ll see myself out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and walked out of the bedroom. After a pause, you heard the door close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and sighed. Raymond now knew where \u201cJane\u201d lived. And he\u2019d be sending more coworkers over, so they\u2019d know where Jane lived. This was getting complicated quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is the relationship with Raymond Teller incorrect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, reluctance to say anything that could be misinterpreted. You had to be clear, direct, unambiguous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is John Johnson. I am male. I own this house. I am not female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish to change your identity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's wrong and I want you to set it right,\" you demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you wish to update your profile profile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Processing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're tense, this could be it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Records found for a John Johnson. Ownership of house is registered to a John Johnson. Confirm your identity as John Johnson:\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer a few questions about your birthday, family and your current address (seriously? Not exactly good security). After all this Edna replies \"Processing....\" and remains quiet for a long time. Well, that's one way to keep her quiet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround this time, you try to settle into bed, taking off the heels and getting under the covers while still trying to keep you foot elevated and avoiding the pangs of pain that hit every time you moved. You felt hungry, you'd been skipping a lot of meals lately, and come to think of it you weren't even sure how sleepy you were given you'd spent the afternoon napping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were getting comfortable, EDNA spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been known as 'Jane'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since yesterday, remember,\" you say, appreciating that the situation wasn't exactly improved by that lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, what is your current condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've got a sprained ankle and I'd like it to stop hurting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" Suddenly, a robotic arm comes out with a glass of water and two pills, you get the message and swallow the pills with a gulp of water. Hopefully it will help with the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you satisfied with your current condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? With the sprained ankle or the fact you think of me as a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you satisfied with your currently registered gender and identity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO,\" you say, \"A big fat emphatic NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish to update the status of your gender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing so is a large operation that will require many changes, are you sure you wish to proceed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please say 'Confirm' to 'Confirm'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Processing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead back on the pillow, you rest. When people say that technology is easy to work with, they obviously never have to go through this. Damn Raymond and his \"press the right buttons.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA just keeps churning away. You're starting to feel sleepy now, it takes you a moment to realise one of those tablets may have been a sleeping pill. As drowsiness settles, you figure you may have to wait until morning for anything to result from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Operation complete, profile and identity updates complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really?\" you ask with excitement, this whole thing may finally be over. This gown may be the last female thing you ever have to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. Issuing summary:\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you say, suddenly another wave of drowsiness hit, but you can pull through to hear this....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your profile: Born as John Johnson, male, various records for school and previous employment found.\" Yes, this was right. EDNA knew who you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA continued, \"Yesterday, John Johnson self identified as female and transitioned to new identity, Jane Johnson. Jane Johnson immediately commenced work at Earnest Lumber under new identity and entered into a relationship with Raymond Teller\" Your heart leapt into your mouth, \"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change of name documentation has been registered for name change from John Johnson to Jane Johnson, paperwork for gender transition has been sent, medical records have been updated to reflect new gender, new ID under current name and gender has been requested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" You sit bolt upright. This could not be happening, no way the Automatic House had this much power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your recent submission would traditionally have taken over 6 hours, visits to different departments and a trained expert. With PaperGone Systems, large paperwork jobs can be handled with a few simple commands. PaperGone Systems is happy to have saved you time that you can instead use to enjoy your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn advertisement? That was out of character for EDNA... no wait, that wasn't the point. This was wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is wrong EDNA, I don't want to be female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you requesting an additional gender change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, all further profile changes are locked until current updates and registrations are complete. In addition, some systems require a gap of at least 6 months between gender request changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? Well then stop submitting the changes you're making right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Current documentation and registrations have already been submitted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN YOU, can you not get SIMPLE request right!\" you slam back in the bed. You should have been way more careful in the requests you were sending EDNA. Six months? How could you possibly have things continue like this for that long? You had no idea EDNA could do anything even close to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there was a way around this. You could try to get EDNA to update the house profile without changing your identity, or maybe get it to get more male clothes and convince it you're a tomboy or.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shock subsides, the sleeping pill surges in, and you feel fast asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The programming of EDNA was a learning AI, one created to help their owner be efficient and be able to focus on things more important to them. The time EDNA had interacted with Jane, it had deduced that, while she liked to be pretty, loved heels, and seemed to enjoy being a woman, the task of preparing herself and getting dressed were things that she often turned over to EDNA. The AI deduced, then, that these things were tasks that she did not enjoy and EDNA would take over for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning databases, EDNA found some usual routines for heterosexual women Jane\u2019s age. Codifying these and selecting what were best practices, EDNA set about making Jane\u2019s life as stress free as possible. But to improve Jane\u2019s life, for some of this, it would be best if Jane were compliant and tranquil. A sleeping pill, which EDNA had also noted that Jane liked, had been given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA, who am I?\u201d Jane asked. The AI immediately set out to answer Jane\u2019s heroes to the best it could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe activities that followed the query further told the AI that Jane wanted changes in her life, and the AI was happy to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne heart rate and breathing indicated that Jane was asleep, the house gently lifted her out of bed. She was carried to the bath, where she was carefully undressed and suspended. The first thing needed was removal of all body hair. That would save future time for her in her preparations, allowing her to pursue activities more to her liking. EDNA made a subroutine to find out what activities Jane liked doing with her newly registered boyfriend. EDNA had already noted that Jane preferred more \u201csex appeal\u201d outfits for her boyfriend, and that her boyfriend appreciated her in those sorts of outfits.  Wardrobe will have to be updated, both for social interactions, sleepwear, and for work appropriate attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA began to remove Jane\u2019s body hair,  Using the installed grooming equipment, Jane\u2019s body hair was laser removed, leaving her skin with a soft pink glow. Lotions were applied to soothe her skin and soften it. Her eyebrows were likewise removed leaving only high feminine arches. The slight fuzz of facial hair was also removed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting Jane\u2019s newly changed gender identity, EDNA made sure that prescription orders with the appropriate health facilities were placed. EDNA estimated that there was, based on Jane\u2019s other settings, a 78.3% chance that the hormone administrations would be left to EDNA to apply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane\u2019s figure, when dressed, seemed pleasing to both her and her boyfriend, EDNA noted. Scans of her body, though showed that her undressed state did not match that of her dressed. Having a pleasing body shape with the use of padding or constrictive garments would speed up the daily preparations, giving Jane more free time. EDNA scheduled and confirmed plastic surgery for Jane, noting that most of it was covered by her newly acquired health insurance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair extensions were added to Jane\u2019s head, giving her long, sexy \u201cBedroom hair\u201d that she seemed to favor. EDNA paused, calculating Jane\u2019s preferred makeup. While permanent makeup would allow Jane more free time, she had shown, to date, she enjoyed playing with makeup and changing her look, so that calculation was abandoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the surgeries could be carried out, EDNA applied some realistic hip padding, breast padding, and a particulate invisible corset to Jane. They could all be removed, as would be needed when the surgeries happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting that Jane had changed genders, EDNA deduced that something should be done about her crotch. Using more padding, EDNA his all signs of any maleness, giving Jane the appearance of, but not functional feminine anatomy.   EDNA noted that Jane seemed to leave toilet seats up and made a subroutine to check all bathrooms after she used them to ensure seats were returned to the down position for her seating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, EDNA\u2019s voice recognition system noted that Jane\u2019s voice fell outside of what was considered a \u201cpleasant feminine voice.\u201d  A choker with a heart medallion was affixed to her neck. The medallion would subtly alter the vibrations of her voice box giving her a much more pleasant tone of voice. The chicken was sealed on, but could be removed when Jane\u2019s surgeries happened, after they had adjusted her vocal chords to address the tonal qualities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA then returned Jane to the bedroom, where she was dressed in a bright pink nightie, again, feminine and slightly sexy, as Jane liked, and placed gently in bed. The compresses were reapplied to her ankle and the cold pack applied. Soothing ocean sounds were turned on, EDNA noting that a plurality if the population liked these tones, but more information about Jane\u2019s preferred sleeping arrangements would be needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA retracted the appendages back into the walls,, and returned to her resting state, ready for when Jane awoke in the morning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awake with a start. You're not sure, but you seemed to have had a strange dream. Something about dressing as a girl? Then you feel the cold compress on your ankle and it comes flooding back. You've been dressing as a women for over a day now. You've got a JOB as a woman. Did you really ballroom dance in a gown? And almost go out on a date with your new boss? It all seems so surreal. As if you'd gone to bed after your neighbour saw you in that bikini by the pool and the rest was just a dream where your mind wildly extrapolated what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn and get a hold of yourself, you feel a lot of strange sensations around your body. The most obvious one is the cold compress on your ankle, which still feels pretty cold. Has EDNA been topping it up during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers seem a bit weirder. Was their something on your chest? You move up your hands to examine and it touches the soft fabric of your nightie under the covers.<br>\r\nFrustrated you sweep out your arm and take the covers off the bed. Looking down you see a rather nice pair of legs coming out of pink nightie, but the view is interrupted by two mounds on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another push up bra, probably stuffed with something</i>, you grumble EDNA just has to add these things to you even when you're asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA,\" you ask, \"Get this off of me.\" It was probably unwise to keep entrusting EDNA like this, but a simple undress seemed innocent. In fairness, EDNA was good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged,\" the familiar metal appendages came out and lifted you up out of bed. You're surprised that they seem to be handling your foot alright, holding you in a way so that you don't put any pressure on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nightie is taken off and... well that's it. You're being held upright, and all you can do is stare in shock in the mirror at the reflection that looks back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not your reflection.... it's Jane's, or at least the Jane that everyone seems to have met up to now. Not a guy with the disguise of a woman, but an actual naked woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mounds you'd felt wasn't a push up bra or anything, they were actual boobs right there on your chest. They looked totally real and only by touching and not feeling a sensation could you be sure they weren\u2019t. Your chest was above a narrow waist leading into the pelvis area that.... what was that? And where was it???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around in the mirror looking over your shoulder (the robotic limbs still helping support you and your ankle), and just saw an nice rear end in the mirror, like a girl showing off. You face forward again and reached down! Phew, you could still feel it under... whatever that substance was, but it undeniably looked like the equipment of the other gender. Then there were the legs and hips and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA, what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please clarify.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are all these adjustments, what have you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The padding has been applied to attain the female shape you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You're passing your hands over your smooth, hairless body now. The padding feels surprisingly realistic in your hands. \"I can't believe this, I mean the clothes and everything was one thing but this...? I'm naked and I still look...\" you swallow, \"Do I sound like one too?\" your voice feels sweeter, higher somehow. you notice the chocker on your neck. Pulling at it you find its stuck tight, and that heart shaped medallion isn't scoring you any masculinity points. Neither is your now flowing hair that reaches past your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Jane, I am glad you are satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back in exhaustion on the edge of the bed, the limbs accommodating such a movement. How do you even start to deal with something like this? Demand EDNA remove everything? You suddenly get the feeling that wouldn't go well, but worth holding in reserve. Try to demand EDNA recognises you as male? That's what you tried to do last night and it made everything worse. Ask for masculine clothes? You look in the mirror: even a really masculine set of clothes would have a hard time convincing people you were male, your body shape and hair and even the smoothness of your face all worked against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat. You make a strange sight,  a naked looking woman on the edge of a bed, foot still in a big compress and head in her hands as her hair flowed down, desperately trying to think the next best move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you Jane?\" EDNA chimes in<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done enough of that,\" you say, bitterness overriding your common sense to keep your trap shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you are satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not satisfied!\" you start to lose patience, even as you do so you feel its a bad idea to lose your cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, calculating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait... and then the arms come out and usher you into the bathroom. Jets of hot water, scented fragrances, lotion, combs and brushes pulling on your hair, hot air, and before you can fully recover you're out of the bathroom with one towel wrapped around your head and another around your chest. You open your eyes to see a vanity, and quickly close them as cosmetics assault your face as the head towel is removed and you feel light tugging at your hair. You open them again to see Jane's face once again, neat lipstick, eyshadow, glowing face, neat stud earrings, and luxuriantly styled hair that cascades in waves down your head. The chocker with a heart neatly underscores the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you satisfied now?\" asks EDNA<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a breath, you had options, but you take a risk. \"Yes EDNA, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" and EDNA goes quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew, you try to get up, but the pain (less sharp, but still present) from your ankle reminds you of your situation. You could call out to EDNA but.... well.... no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there at the vanity. Your gaze taking in your female face. Gradually you are fascinated at how the female face responds to your facial expressions. You try smiling, frowning, sticking your tongue out.... and the attractive female face does all the same expressions. It was weird to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You turned with a start, hearing a knock on the door.  \"Crap!'  Raymond's sent over some work!\"  you hissed to yourself. \"I need clothes!\" you said as you looked around for something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dressing initiated, Jane.  You should approve of this work ensemble I've put together for you,\" EDNA's voice said as the arms came over to gently support you.  A lacy white pushup up bra was hooked around your... well... breasts, creating impressive cleavage. A garter belt was hooked around your waist with nude seamed stockings rolled up and attached to the dangling garters.  A skimpy white thong was gently eased over your bum ankle and then hiked into place.  A tight highly starched white blouse was slipped over your arms and buttoned, leaving your cleavage on display.  A tight, short houndstooth skirt was slid up your legs, the blouse tucked into it, and then it was zipped up.  Some brown heels were slid onto your feet, and you were gently lowered onto a pair of crutches.  Some glasses were set onto your face, and a mirror was lowered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were, essentially, a bimbo secretary.  You sighed and started to tell EDNA to change you into something else when you heard female voices calling, \"Jane?  Jane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked your head around as you heard them approaching your room.  \"Shit!\" you hissed as you crutched your was over towards the bedroom door.  It opened before you got there, and Wendy and Lisa (you wondered briefly if there were ever in a band together) came in.  \"Wow, that's quite the work outfit, \"Wendy said with a wink.  \"I'm sure Raymond would love seeing you in that!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour phone pinged and you sagged on your crutches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa piped up, \"How's your ankle?  Raymond wanted us to come by and check on you.  And he asked us to give you these,\" she handed you a stack of file folders.  He needs the invoices in here verified.  Your VPN login is on the post it inside the folder.\"  You flipped open the folder and stared at the hot pink PostIt in there with a user id and a password, along with a URL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Lisa continued, \"Here's your work laptop.  Don't leave home without it.\"  She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" Wendy said, looking around, \"Nice place.  We definitely need to have a girls night over here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be fun!\" Lisa agreed!  \"The TV is perfect for movies! And....\" Lisa looked at Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAKEOVERS!\" they said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" you asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, girlfriend!\" Wendy said, \"It's fun to let your hair down every now and then and just share some girl talk and lust after some beefcake on the big screen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... What were you thinking?\"  you asked, hating having this conversation in the house.  And with the phone nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for the shoe to fall.  \"How about next weekend?\" Lisa asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me!\" Wendy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you added.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prefect!  Next weekend it is!  We'll make it a party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"ping\" chimed.  You sagged on the crutches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK... I've got some work to do...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least let us help you out to the living room,\" Lisa said as she and Wendy grabbed an arm and helped you hobble on the heels and crutches into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sat you down on the couch and put your leg up on some pillows.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we stay, Jane?\" Lisa asked.  \"Just in case you need anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you said with a weak smile.  \"I'll be fine.\"  You opened the folder and actually started logging into the laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can come back later,\" Wendy said, a slight question in her voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why was everyone so determined to bother someone who didn't even exist two days ago?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laptop finishes logging in and your work email pops up along with various office programs in an OS you don't quite recognise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy's offer lingers in your mind. You didn't want them around all day, who knows what other plans they would arrange, but when Ray came... \"Look for now I just want to focus on this alone but later...\" you take a breath, \"well it's probably best you drop later by... just to wrap things up...\" you finish weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy seems to get your message \"We'll probably get back here just before Raymond arrives, make sure everything is sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale, \"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Lisa pipes up, \"I can stay now but I've got to pick up my son this evening....\" It's quickly agreed that Cathy will drop back later but you'll probably be in the office before you see Lisa again. You have a bit more conversation that largely repeats what you've already said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just send us a message if you need anything!\" are Cathy's words as the pair wave to you from the living room door, and leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your head back and exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone.... for maybe a few hours and then your new workmate or boss will knock on the door and goodness knows what happens after. You could take this opportunity to finally tackle everything but looking down your body (over your breasts and neat cleavage your clothes makes), your bandy ankle still sits on the stack of pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what are you meant to do? The work for the job you never asked for? Why would you even... a thought occurs to you. If you simply don't do the work, then what would happen? They'd get angry... they'd get frustrated with you... and then they'd have to fire you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought strikes you with surprising force. Was it really that simple? Do a terrible job and get fired? You felt bad for the people who might get caught in your wake but... it was possible wasn't it? It was a way out of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn curiosity you look up at the laptop and quickly looked through your email and leaf through the open folder. Wendy has thoughtfully given you some clear instructions on what you were meant to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job seemed simple: some documents were digitised, others were still in paper format, you had to go through digital company records (which you'd been given surprisingly broad access to) and make sure the stack of paper records aligned with them in terms of invoice's matching and having been confirmed as paid. However, the job was... well... unexciting! And not particularly gripping for someone who didn't want the job in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching TV, getting breakfast, even undressing... that's what you wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually.... \"EDNA, get me breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acknowledged,\" and you soon had a breakfast of fresh fuits, melon, organic yoghurt, orange juice, and some wheaty cereal. Sitting up, you ate it there in the living room. Once or twice some bit of food would slip onto your blouse or clothing, and an apendage would come out and quickly wipe it off without delay. It was vaguely disconcerting, but you let it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards... why not? You watched TV. Something brainless that actually made you feel better about everything and took your mind off the fact you were dressed like a secreatary who had breasts, nice legs, and no visible manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround lunchtime, you needed to head to the bathroom, you crutched forward (had your ankle improved?) and just as you were sitting down on the toilet (because how else could you do it now?) your phone and laptop pinged for another received work email which you'd been ignoring all morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane: Reminder: Invoice correlation to be done for Earnest Lumber. Deadline: This evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously? When you were on the toilet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm busy right now EDNA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like assistance with the task?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to do the task at all! Remember that!\" you respond. Thankfully it seems to shut EDNA up and you continue your business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay in the bathroom a bit longer hoping that EDNA would take this as a message not to bother you, and when you finally come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic limbs are shuffling the paperwork, something that looks like a camera is being held over them for a moment, before the limbs move the paper and show the next bit of paper under it. Somehow the laptop is also acting posessed. Windows popping up, text being typed as if by invisible hands (you don't notice a dongle now attached to it), and all the while the phone next to it glows and occasionally pings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn swooping steps you make your way up to the couch and living room table. You catch line of texts being typed \"Invoice C148E917 - Not paid; Invoice E143D917 - Billed twice....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA?\" You're at a loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Jane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The task you were assigned with was a standard comparison of disparate documents. It is within my capability to perform. I was able to look up previous examples of such jobs to understand how such a task is performed.\" You're stunned for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I mean....\" you see the arms whiz back and forth in front of you. \"I don't want the job, I want to get fired!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Searching for ways to get fired...

You will consummate that relationship eventually.  Expediting that event will hasten your removal from employment, providing you the quickest route to what you desire, Jane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hang on, EDNA, \" you started to say.  EDNA then spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, the termination of your employment would allow you to openly engage in a sexual relationship with your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You threw your hands up in the air as best you could on the crutches.  \"EDNA, Raymond is NOT my BOYFRIEND,\" you stated, emphasizing the words so that she'd finally get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking....\" and the house went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Jane.  You are not in a relationship with Raymond Teller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera-like thing suddenly zoomed over and snapped several pictures of you from different angles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA,\" you asked warily.  \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Processing....\" said the voice.  And then shortly.  \"Since you no longer have a boyfriend, Jane, I have allowed you more free time and taken it upon myself to post several profiles on the most popular dating profiles to find you a new boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!

Preparations for intercourse should begin.\"  And the arms stared helping you towards the bathroom.  Between the heels, the bum ankle, and the number of arms, it was impossible to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if to rub salt in an open wound, as you were being hustled towards the bathroom, EDNA said, rather chipperly, \"You are quite popular, Jane.

Up slide a pair of bright red panties, and onto your big chest is a red bra. Sheer black tights are pulled up your legs. Then out of nowhere a shiny black latex dress is pulled up over your legs, torso, and hung from your shoulders. It pushes up your own boobs which it shows off glamorously with its plunging neckline. It has a pencil skirt to it that pulls your thighs together and before flaring off stylishly at the hem. Shiny ankle high black shoes with thin, high heels are pulled on next throwing you off balance. And your existing chocker is augmented with jet black lace. As you reach for it, a pair of shiny black PVC gauntlets get attached from your wrists to your elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are brought to the vanity and after the familiar routine, you have burning red lips and smoky dark eyes with waves of hair cascading down on either side of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was stunning. The unsure look in your eyes almost looked like a false fa\u00e7ade against the strong, seductive curves of the tight shiny plastic. You were dressed up as a present, once again, for Raymond to open<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was insane, EDNA was determined to turn you into a pinup. Where was she getting these ideas? These clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, and feel a twinge at your ankle once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA,\" you say as you deliberately limp badly, \"my ankle....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, you're mobility need will need to be taken care of.\" before you can protest the arms pick you up and drop you back into the house's sitting room, purse already in front of you on the table, pinging occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has been so much so fast. Your mind is vaguely aware that you're a super hot woman waiting for her date, and the rest of your mind is trying to find a way out.

Your freaking house had decided that not only were you wanting to become a woman, but that you were going to seduce your boss, so that you could get fired. And apparently date men...  date OTHER men, you had to remind yourself...  stupid immersion was already messing with your head.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and took a wobbly step. The heels were high, and you could still feel a twinge in your ankle. After a few test steps, you realized that with a rolling gate, the pain in your ankle was bearable. Unfortunately, it put a rolling away in your hips, and in this getup, that could be dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggled, much like Jessica Rabbit, back into the sitting room. You needed your wallet and...  grinding your teeth, you admitted you needed your purse, if you were going to slip out of the house before Raymond arrived. That was pretty much your only hope at this point, to get out of this madhouse and go someplace...  maybe a hotel. You could get some clothes and..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything acceptable, Jane?\u201d EDNA\u2019s voice asked. You froze, your eyes wide. \u201cDid you wish to change into something else?  Perhaps some sexy lingerie to help seduce Raymond.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. Crap. Crappitty crap crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind and heart raced. \u201cUh...  No, EDNA, I just wanted to...\u201d You thought furiously.  \u201c... check my lipstick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d came EDNA\u2019s reply. You were \u201chelped\u201d back to the vanity where your makeup was touched up. Shiny lipgloss was applied, making your lips shine much like your dress. \u201cThank you EDNA,\u201d you said, hoping to mollify the AI. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything to help!\u201d EDNA replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood, and minced your way back out to the sitting room and grabbed your purse. You minced towards the door and put your gloves hand on the handle. \u201cAre you going somewhere, Jane?\u201d EDNA asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thought I\u2019d get some fresh air,\u201d you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood. Fresh air desired. But if you leave, you may miss your chance for intercourse with Raymond. It is best you remain here.\u201d  EDNA\u2019s arms deposited you again in the sitting room and windows were opened. The gentle breeze they let in stirred your hair around your face, much to your annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood and teetered over to a window, closing it with a slam. You blew a stray lock of hair out from over your eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden knock on the door and you froze. \u201cJane?  It\u2019s me!  Raymond!\u201d You head from outside the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed, soft music began playing. Two glasses of wine and some strawberries and cream were deposited upon the kitchen counter. A musky perfume was pumped into the room. Just as you wobbled over to open the door, it opened itself. And Raymond was transfixed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look...  wow. Jane. You are...\u201d he seemed unable to complete a thought. He moved his eyes up and down your body, and you felt exposed to him, his lustful gaze making you slightly shield yourself with your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... \u201c Raymond said, finally looking around. \u201cWine, strawberries, some soft music.  I\u2019m gonna get lucky tonight,\u201d he said with a certainty that made you freeze like a deer in headlights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore EDNA could do anything else, you picked up your purse, wiggling over and grabbed Raymond\u2019s arm. You needed to get out of this place. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d You said, hating the way that stupid choker made your voice sound. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond wrapped his arm around your waist, his hand settling on you ass. You sighed.  Anything to get out of here. \u201cI know just the place.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Your busted ankle was on the side closest to him and you felt yourself leaning into him for support as you made your way to his car. Definitely the wrong signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got into the passenger seat the pencil skirt dress stretched and restricted you as you moved your legs apart to get in one foot at a time. As you struggled with it, Ray suddenly put one arm behind your back and another under your knees and lifted you into the seat. This was so embarrassing. You did a tight smile in response with your sleek shiny lips, and with a beaming smile of his own Ray closed the door, blocking your exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you weren't sure if you were better off here or back at the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay got into the drivers seat and started the engine. Pulling out, you were soon making your way down the road, putting distance between you and the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, hope your ankle is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenuine concern? From Ray? You respond, \"Well, better, but it still hurts a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, stick close and I'll sweep you off your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT was his idea of a chat up line? Who did he think you were? Aside from a gorgeous  attractive woman of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, looking down at your cleavage and the your shiny dress that clung to your legs was surreal. You'd always wanted to go ON a date with a hot girl, not AS one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raymond,\" you start to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he turns towards you, unwisely taking his eyes off the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... um... I don't want to take things too fast.\" NO, why was your brain always saying the wrong thing. You're not a girl on a date, you're a guy who's been thrown into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll take it easy,\" he replies, and places a big hand on your thigh. The latex makes it a weird feeling, probably for both of you, but he doesn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive a little while longer and you notice a hotel coming up. That was your plan wasn't it? Stay in a hotel and figure things out? Maybe you could convince Ray to drop you off here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if he has read your mind, the car slows down. On closer inspections the hotel is very high class. Polished brass, thick carpet, what seems like a bustling nightclub in the basement, probably a bar with a mahogany counter somewhere. The car slows to a stop just outside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here,\" Ray says with a grin.</span></div></div>",

Your hips, midsection and ample chest all pressed into his, like your entire body is rising to meet his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't even think, the sensations, the entire unexpected situation, his sheer unbridled lust and desire for you.... You've got to escape, part of you thinks, but part of your mind gets hung up on keeping the drink you're still holding steady and with each second tight embrace builds momentum. His hands caress you, his nose rubs against your cheek and his tongue seems to throw every new sensation it can into your mouth until you find yourself trying to at least somewhat keep up with the sheer frantic energy of what was going on.

Why were you so damn concerned about keeping the drink steady?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do manage to move back a bit, stumbling as usual in your incredibly high shoes that seemed to thrust your hips into his, but you have the lingering feeling of his tongue in your mouth, you still remember that you kissed a man for what seemed like countless seconds.

Curious, you look through the phone, find and open one such dating app,  (LoveMeet is its name apparently), and take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing that hits you is the profile of an attractive woman. Employed as a secretary, single, hot, looking for a good man to date, largely for pleasure but open to something more serious.... a chill strikes you. It's you! You don't know how your own photo looks so alluring, whether EDNA snapped you at the right (wrong?) moment or edited the images afterwards, but all you can see in the photo is an engaging attractive woman and you have to make an effort to see yourself in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the messages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim, Paul, Omar, Emilio... profiles showing men posing, or having a tender moment with a dog or kid, or flexing a muscle, or an \"adventure activity\" photo..... and the worlds \"Hot girl\" \"Would love to meet such a stunning woman as yourself\" \"You. Me. Let's do it!\" \"You seem like a sophisticated woman who wishes to enjoy the finer things in life...\" \"I've seen a lot of women on this site, but there's something about you....\" \"Let's have sex!\" \"The man you've been waiting for has arrived.\" \"I'd really just like to get to know you better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShockingly, you can see you've responded to some of these messages already! Or at least EDNA has. \"I would love to meet you, how about 7pm next Saturday....\" \"6pm Wednesday....\" \"Lunch this Friday....\" \"...I'm sure this will be something wonderful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome had already responded, \"I will totally be there...\", \"It's a date\", \"You will not regret this\" (you certainly found that last one unlikely)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading all this, your stomach sinks and you feel like you've opened the door to a big chasm that just keeps going down. You've been dancing from fire to fire ever since this whole thing started but now it feels like an onrushing firestorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure what's worse: An army of guys all trying to get close to you; or Ray who's waiting right outside to take you up to a hotel room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got to at least do damage control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delete all my Dating profiles... except...\" a thought struck you, \"are any of the interested men (gulp)... nearby? I mean, could they get here in less than 10 mins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA was silent for a moment. \"There is a Juan Castillo in this area who has expressed interest,\" EDNA replied. Juan's message and profile pop up on the phone. Looked like a tough guy but sweet, his message had a hint of romance but still easy going. You couldn't believe you were evaluating guys like this now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could send him a message asking him to rescue you from this date, say you're in a date with your boss and you just need help to get out of it with minimum friction. He may not get it, and even if he did, you have no idea what he would do (after all, you have no idea what is behind an internet profile), whether he'd be aggressive or smooth. Even if he helped you perfectly, you may feel obligated to him. Also, asking a man to rescue you from another man seemed so... well, it didn't feel good.... like you were helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit, why were you feeling victimised, just because you were wearing a squeezing corset and heels you could barely control! Sure Ray knows how to push things forward, but dammit you've got to stand up to him. He's not the boss of you! Well, at least not outside of work hours anyway. Whatever ideas he has, you've got to make your own decisions on this.</span></div></div>",

His grip is like iron and suddenly the ground seems a far way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of uncertainty hits you, and you grab out for stability, a latex gloved hand of yours goes around Ray's neck and gets a grip.

You shuddered at the thought, which Raymond mistook for passion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you were kinky,\u201d he said, \u201cBut you really must like being taken from behind.  The screams of passion when I entered your rear...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreaded phone pinged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out of here. Out of Raymond\u2019s clutches. Grabbing the sheet, you wrapped it around yourself and rushed into the bathroom, the handcuffs now dangling, locked to your left wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, you grabbed the mouthwash, using all of it to get the taste of out of your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumping against the counter, you looked at yourself in the mirror. Your makeup was a mess. Your hair was a mess. And then it hit you:  you only had the stupid dress to wear. Looking like this, you... a guy... would be doing the \u201cwalk of shame.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo be it, you decided. You\u2019d clean up, get dressed, and shame walk out of there, but to where?  You were out of EDNA\u2019s clutches and really had no desire to go back to that crazy house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned on the shower, on hot, and started rubbing crusty deposits off of you. The fact that they existed, and in the spots they existed, made you gag all over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a long hot shower, desperately trying to both remember and forget what exactly happened last night, but it was all a fog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you stepped out of the shower, brushed your stupidly long hair out with the provided brush, and wiped the remaining traces of makeup off of your face. Looking into the mirror, there was nothing there that said, \u201cJohn.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slipped on the bathrobe provided, and opened the door a crack, peeking out. It was quiet. You opened the door fully and stored out into the room. Raymond sat at a table, spread with breakfast foods and pastries.  He was quietly reading a newspaper and had redressed. It was so unfair, you thought, that he looked normal for a guy and would not have to suffer the walk of shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI went ahead and ordered breakfast.\u201d  He thankfully unlocked the dangling handcuff, removing it from your wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRay,\u201d you started to say, but trailing off, noticing that one of your heels was hanging off the overhead light. What on earth happened last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking out of your reverie,  you started again, \u201cRay, I\u2019m not hungry.  I just want...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore of what you got last night,\u201d he said, ignoring you. \u201cSit.\u201d  He gestured at a chair opposite him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d he poured a cup of coffee and handed it to you. It smelled REALLY good to you right then, and your stomach did rumble a little. Against your better judgement, you sit and started drinking the coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond grabbed your feet and pulled them into his lap, your feet resting uncomfortably on his crotch, as he began rubbing your feet. You didn\u2019t want to enjoy that, but after spending so much time in heels, it did feel good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby, now that we\u2019re dating...\u201d you looked at him quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are some things I want to discuss. Firstly, I want you on the pill.\u201d  Your phone buzzed and you spun around in horror., terrified at what Raymond had just signed you up for. Figuring you\u2019d deal with that as soon as you could, you turned back to Raymond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay continued, \u201cWhile I love playtime,\u201d \u201che winked, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to be a father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond, just to be clear, your body...  your AMAZING body...\u201d he leered.  You pulled the bathrobe a little more closed at your chest.  \u201cThat body is mine. No one but me gets to use it. Not even you.\u201d He wink as your phone buzzed again. You really needed to get out of there, coffee or no coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently set your feet down and walked over to you, making you a bit nervous. He stood behind you and began stroking your cheek.   You suddenly felt him pushing a pill against your lips. Again?  You tried to avoid it, but he managed to slip it into your mouth. \u201cJust take it, baby.  It\u2019ll make you feel good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to spit it out, but he brought your coffee cup to your lips and started pouring it. Not wanting to be doused with hot coffee you reluctantly opened your mouth and swallowed the blasted pill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Ray...?\u201d You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe best Spanish Fly on the market. Female viagra. I like my girls to be constantly aroused and in the mood.\u201d  The phone buzzed again. Surely there wasn\u2019t female viagra?  EDNA was going to have him on a cocktail of drugs if he wasn\u2019t careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally,\u201d Raymond started to say was he sat back down and again placed your feet in his lap, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it would look awkward to date while you reported to me. Harassment laws and such,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fired?\u201d You asked in what you hoped wasn\u2019t a too excited tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hell no!\u201d Raymond said. \u201cI want to be able to keep an eye on you at work. You\u2019ll just be reporting to someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was so not well. Not only had you spent the night wtb Raymond, you would still be under his thumb at work. Kind of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaymond,\u201d you started in your sweetest voice, \u201cI\u2019d like to get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, baby, once we finish breakfast.   Then get that hot little number you had on last night, and we\u2019ll head....\u201d</span></div></div>",

We can order in and pick up where we left of last night.\u201d  He winked. The phone buzzed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, you had little desire to had back to your place. On the other, going to Ray\u2019s was out of the question. And staying with Ray was unacceptable. Maybe you could have him drop you off and you could get a cab or Uber over to a different hotel to figure things out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retrieved your clothing from all over the room. The stockings were ruined. The gloves were impossible to get back on, so you carried them. You hauled on your lingerie, silently cursing EDNA for your stupid outfit. You wriggled into that stupid tight, short dress. It had a strange crusty deposit on it. You wiped that off quickly, thanking your lucky stars the dress was waterproof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sitting, leaning over, putting in your heel when Ray\u2019s legs came into your vision.  You looked up and Ray was grinning, wiggling another pill between his thumb and index finger. \u201cTime for your candy!\u201d He said with a wicked grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled back into the couch as far away from him as you could. He held the pill right in front of your mouth. \u201cRay, I...\u201d you started to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe popped the pill into your mouth and held your mouth shut with one hand, pinching your nose closed with the other.  \u201cShhh, baby!  These pills will make you feel so good!  Trust me, I know what\u2019s best for you!\u201d  Your phone buzzed yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould tried to shake your head no, but with Ray\u2019s form grip, you couldn\u2019t move. You closed your eyes shut and held your breath as long as you could, but it wasn\u2019t long before you swallowed that stupid pill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay released you and you gasped for air. \u201cSee?  It\u2019s so easy!\u201d Ray said, still grinning. He grabbed your purse and threw a large container of the pills in it. \u201cFor you to use. Take a couple of them before we see each other. And that includes work.\u201d  Your phone buzzed and you sagged, defeatedly.  You just wanted out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heels and your wobbly ankle still required you to roll your hips and lean on Ray to get anywhere. It was when you started down the hall that you became... aware that rolling your hips felt good. If you walked just right, you could rub your thighs together and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly tensed. Those stupid pills!!!  Maybe they were.... your breathing increased. Each step was becoming erotic. Without realizing it, you had your head on Ray\u2019s shoulder, trying to keep focus as you walked to the elevator and to the car. You didn't even realize Ray\u2019s hand was kneading your ass.  You just leaned on him and tried not to think about how horny you had suddenly become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trying not to moan when the valet delivered Ray\u2019s car. \u201cI see she\u2019s warmed up!\u201d Ray said as he helped you into the car. \u201cAnd the car is too!\u201d  He tipped the valet and got into the car, finding you moaning with your hand between your legs, trying to free your trapped member.  Ray saw that scene a little differently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sped away, heading back to your place, his hand on your thigh, every now and then teasing your false opening, which in turn was driving you wild. You really wanted to orgasm, but how?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so lost in desperation, you didn\u2019t notice that Ray had lowered a strap on your dress and was fondling a nipple. It wasn\u2019t until you felt him sucking on it that you snapped out of your lusty haze a little. Ray has his mouth in your breast and his hand IN your crotch. It felt soooo good.... but no... no, not again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became aware that you were in your driveway. \u201cRay,\u201d you panted breathlessly, \u201cI...  need to go...\u201d. You fumbled with the door handle, only to have Ray come over and lift you out of the car. He carried you, kissing your neck towards the door. You turned to say something to him and his mouth covered your, his tongue exploring....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of things then. You had to get away from him until these stupid pills wore off. Get inside, get the door between you.  You\u2019d be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wriggled until Ray had to set you down, and you backed into the door handle.  Panting, you whispered with passion in your voice \u201cSave it for later, Ray,\u201d just to get away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went inside, locked the door behind you, and slumped to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it your date was satisfactory, Jane?\u201d EDNA asked as she gently lifted you up and set you on the couch. She began collecting your things that you had dropped inside the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...\u201d you moaned, falling back into the dreamy sex haze.  \u201cI just...  just need...\u201d and you began trying to get a hold on your trapped member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms came out and pulled your hands away. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot allow you to pleasure yourself, Jane. Your boyfriend said only he could bring you to climax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swatted the arms away. \u201cNot...  need to free...\u201d and the arms clamped on your wrists. \u201cThis is unacceptable, Jane.  Let\u2019s calm you down and get you cleaned up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were carried to the bathroom where you were cleaned in a wonderful floral scented shower. Brushes scrubbed you.  Your hair was washed. It felt so good.  It was so warm, and you tried getting the automated spray to just hit you just right, maybe then you could... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower suddenly turned to blasts of ice cold water.  You yelped and tried to dodge them, but arms kept you in the shower for a bit. The water stopped and you huddled in the corner, shivering a little as you hunched over, trying to stay warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d EDNA said.  \u201cI believe that should have gotten your attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still thinking about sex a little, but the cold blasts had snapped you out of the fog. Those pills were dangerous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA dried you off, out your hair up in a towel, slid a big fluffy robe on you, and some comfy slippers on your feet. You were carried back to the living room where some music was playing. The arms set you down on the couch, and presented you with several fashion magazines. \u201cFor your free time, Jane,\u201d She said, depositing one on your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that had happened to you, this was really nice. You were still turned on, but you were at least in control. The robe was soft and warm, so you leaned back against the couch and quickly fell asleep, dreaming of steamy nights with bikini clad...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were jolted awake by EDNA declaring, \u201cJane!  I have allowed you to rest as long as I could. It is now time to begin preparations for your boyfriend\u2019s arrival!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had barely begun blinking the sleep from your eyes when one of EDNA\u2019s arms pried open you mouth and shoved a pill down your throat. Coughing, you were dragged to the bathroom. And disrobed. \u201cEDNA, I...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. The shower and cleansing sequence started. Arms lifted you and turned you so that brushes could scour your body with musk scented soap. You were rapidly rinsed, dried, and hauled back into the bedroom. You were deposited again in the center of the bedroom and had a brief moment to notice an envelope with what appeared to be a feminine handwriting, saying, \u201cThe keys to my love\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to ask about that, but you were dragged over to the vanity where your makeup was applied and your hair was dried and styled.  Your makeup was heavy and seductive. False lashes were applied. Smokey eyeliner give you a seductive look. You hair framed your face in soft curves, much like a classic pinup\u2019s.. Your toes and nails were redone in a blood red color and rapidly dried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother aphrodisiac pill was shoved down your throat as EDNA began preparing you for Raymond. Hauling you back to the dressing area, a red satin overbust corset was placed around your waist as you tried to resist becoming dressed for Raymond\u2019s pleasure again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have made an appointment with an ob/gyn,\u201d EDNA said, fussing with the placement of the corset, \u201cso that you can or placed on the birth control pills your boyfriend desires.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA!  I...\u201d you wheezed as she unceremoniously and tightly cinched the corset, greatly nipping in your waist. \u201c... don\u2019t need an ob/gyn!\u201d You whispered., trying to get used to the crushing tightness of the corset you were now in,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn arm came out, swabbed your thigh with some alcohol, and then you were injected with a syringe held by another arm.  Suspended as you were, it happened too quickly for you to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood.  Birth control is available online and via mail order. I will secure some for you that way. Your weekly injection of hormones has been administered to bring your hormones into balance for a woman of your age,\u201d EDNA said flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHormones?  Things were spiraling out of control again. \u201cEDNA!  I do not...\u201d a mechanical hand came out and pinched open your mouth, allowing EDNA to fasten a red ball gag with a red leather strap in place. You \u201cMmmmphed!\u201d as your glossy red lips engulfed the ball. You reached to try to undo ithe strap, but your hands were grabbed by EDNA\u2019s unrelenting arms and held at bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed stay up stockings were rolled up your legs, quickly followed by red stripper heels. The aphrodisiac pills were starting to kick in just as EDNA\u2019s arms presented a metal contraption in the shape of a curving \u201cT\u201d. It quickly encircled your narrow waist , with the stem of the T being fed up between your legs.  \u201cMmmmmoh!!!\u201d You yelled into the gag and struggled as the chastity belt was locked in place with a rather fatal sounding \u201cclick.\u201d, The thin metal strap was wedged between your cheeks, only with an opening lining up with your anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour boyfriend said he was the only one allowed to touch you, Jane, and I know you desire to please him,\u201d  EDNA said cheerily as a red leather collar was locked around your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost done, Jane.  He should be here momentarily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short chain was locked to the front of the collar.  Handcuffs came out, lined with red fur, and one was locked around each wrist. The neck chain was then locked to the shirt chain connecting the fur lined handcuffs.   Your hands were now locked near your face, as if you were imitating a begging dog. This would not be good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozzles came out and sprayed you with musky perfume. \u201cThis perfume is laced with strong pheromones, Jane.  It\u2019s designed to drive men crazy with lust.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou \u201cmmmmphed\u201d defeatedly into the gag. You were still a man.  Between this and the pills... You began trying to rub your thighs together, beginning to moan with desire, helpless to do anything about it. The chastity belt prevented any feeling or stimulation at all. You began panting like a cat in heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDNA carried you over to the bed where the handcuffs were locked to a small ring at the base of the headboard, forcing you to keep your face barely off the mattress. A pillow was placed under your stomach, as long silk scarves were tied to each knee, then pulled through the bedposts of the headboards and tied off tightly, forcing you to kneel, face down, ass up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes as your head swam with lust. How did this happen to you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled against your bondage, but to no avail. EDNA was serving you up to Raymond and he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red satin ribbon was tied tightly around your narrow waist, making you appear as a gift for Raymond. The lights were dimmed, candles were lit, and soft music began to play. More pheromone perfume was applied. Your head swam with need. You were now trapped, for Raymond to do with as he pleases, and so horny that you\u2019d probably go along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s here, Jane!\u201d EDNA said. \u201cI\u2019ll let him in.\u201d  The envelope was glued to a short, thin chain which was then glued to the bow around your waist. You felt to the bow by a short gold chain and hung covering your rear, both now proudly on display.  Now you understood about the keys to my love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were panting with need from the perfume and the aphrodisiac pills. You closed your eyes and tried to focus, but all you could think about was orgasming. If only you could touch yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have you engaged and married soon, don\u2019t worry.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sobbed with need into the gag as you felt several drops of your pent up frustration trickle down your thigh, appearing to anyone that could see you as a woman, aroused, and desperate for her man. </span></div></div>",

You were having such a great time that you didn\u2019t realize that all of these women were visions of you from these past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, one of them came up to you and placed their hand on your tilted head and said, \u201cBabe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe, you awake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI sure am\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a vibration, \u201cBabe? You awake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your eyes from that wonderful(but Freudian) scene to see Raymond looking down at you with his panted crotch perched on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d You yelled, and darted away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond laughed, \u201cYou sure are prudish after what we did last night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour smart house must know we are an item- it practically pushed me inside once I walked up the steps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way! I..uh...got you a little something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Raymond and his normal gifts(Spanish Fly) you were hesitant of his gifts. You watched as he reached into his back pocket and pull out a long black jewelry box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? Come here!\u201d He joyfully commanded. You approached him and the box with hesitation. After you drew near, you nearly winced as he opened the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the contents of the box were not perverse in anyway- it was just two shiny solid silver bracelets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d You exclaimed impressed and relief. If you had actually been a woman, then that would have been a very endearing gesture- almost as if Raymond were actually a person instead of a libido with a lousy personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut them on! I want to see them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a meaningless reluctance to furthering this whole \u201cbeing a woman\u201d thing, but voluntarily putting on women\u2019s jewelry was nothing compared to what you had already been through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took both out and put them on- as you were right now, they looked nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a loss for what to say in response you decided to ask with an implied gratitude, \u201cwhat made you want to get these for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you silently for a moment before beginning, \u201cWell...I...oh! I was afraid you were going to ask that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI confess, I didn\u2019t get those for you. You house told me to give those to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said this, hidden gears in the bracelets started to turn. The ends of the brackets transformed to latches and connected themselves before tightening themselves on your wrists. The decoration of both brackets opened up to display little screens and speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d You ask in dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA on the go\u201d EDNA answers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fully assist you out in the outside world just as a phone for tasks such as touching up your makeup or changing your outfit, but with this new update I can offer the fullness of my services all of the time.

A few of the hands start battling with your fingers to undo your work on the shirt buttons, other hands are fiddling with the button and zipper of the pants, others are working on just lifting the shirt off of you, grabbing the nightie off the floor, and finally the rest of the arms are grabbing at the heels you kicked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Stop it! What are you doing?!\u201d You yelled fighting with the arms- one hand securing the shirt, the other securing the pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA! Cut it out! I WANT to wear this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the battle was lost to EDNA with the pants as they fell to the ground. You gave a good fight for the shirt buttons, but EDNA has no trouble at all pulling it off of you. The sourness of this loss was enhanced when EDNA reequipped the see through nightie back over your sexy underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at yourself in the mirror- you looked at a sexy looking woman who\u2019s hope had been obliterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was so close!\u201d You moped to yourself, \u201cI had them on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collapsed onto the chair, which EDNA took the opportunity to return the heels to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sensors tell me that you\u2019re sad. What\u2019s the matter, Jane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shards of your newly defeated hope you yelled out, \u201cIt\u2019s John, EDNA! It\u2019s JOHN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about John being gone. You still have Raymond! You still have Carl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind went in different directions with EDNA\u2019s response<br>\r\n\u201cJohn being gone\u201d seemed a little too on the nose, what did EDNA mean by that? How did she know that John was \u201cgone\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, once Carl has moved into the house- surely the two of you would be able to tackle the same problem? Maybe your combined effort might be able to save both of you.</span></div></div>",

There had to be a way out of this, maybe run out into traffic? The term 'die of embarrasment seems incredibly appropriate here.' Here you were being the date of some corporate executive, while being dressed to look like a woman who you would have been praising the stars to go out with. He wasn't going to let you go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here,\" Raymond leaves you standing upright for a second as he opens the car's passenger door for you. You stand there.

How can you get out of this without trying to squeeze past Ray?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you feel Ray smack you on the ass, \"Let's get a move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had enough. You turn to face Ray, swinging earrings hitting your heck, and that's when it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips meet your and suddenly you feel his tongue in your mouth. You try to stumble back but hit the car, you try to crouch away and find your ass htting the car seat. All the while Ray advances and keeps the pressure up. You lean back and finally manage to stop the kiss, so does Ray. And then you see yourself, sitting sideway across the passenger seat, legs sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay has got that smile on his face again, and he steps back to get hold of the car door, ready to pull. You suddenly realise that Ray might have a view right up your dress to your undergarments. In panic, you pull your platform high heeled feet into the footwell, and the car door slams shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breath, taking the situation in. You felt more vunerable dressed like this, more ways of being unsettled, and that kiss took you by surprise. How did he think it was okay to suddenly do that? Why no warning? You were a guy dammit. Dressed in a tight minidress with heels, tonnes of makeup and purse, but a guy nonetheless. In a sudden burst of indigation, you turn to Ray who's already getting into the car seat, and speak with the passion you can muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ray, I want you...\" VROOOOMMMMM, the car engine started up with sudden force, that would have drowned out what you'd have said even it hadn't made you stop speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the car engine purring, Ray turns to you, his smile is so much stronger now, bursting like it was holding back strong emotion. \"Just a bit longer, don't worry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the velocities throwing you around in your car seat, the car peels out of the driveway and careens down the street.</span></div></div>",

That was obviously the nightclub. \u201cHang on a sec, honey,\u201d Raymond said, and he walked over towards the concierge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey honey!  You look great!  You here for some dancing?\u201d you heard a man\u2019s voice say. It was a guy, one of several, looking at you and grinning. You suddenly felt VERY vulnerable, and tugged nervously at the hem of the dress, trying to pull it down. \u201cUm, no. Not really...\u201d you started looking for someone to help. The stupid heels made walking slow, so dashing past these guys to the door would be tough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, honey, let me dance with you. I\u2019m Phil.

There\u2019s my date!\u201d You said as you spun on your skyscraper heels and minced over to Raymond. You looked back at the men, who were grinning and saying things to themselves as they stared at you. You wanted to make sure they knew you weren\u2019t available, so you slipped your arm around Raymond\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d He was saying to the concierge. Again, his hand went to your ass as if it was magnetic and his hand made of iron. \u201cGuess what?  I managed to get us the honeymoon suite for later!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You awoke the next morning with a start as a clock radio started blaring music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter peeling yourself off of the ceiling, you noticed that things felt... wrong.  Jumping out of bed, a quick inspection in the bathroom mirror told you everything...  and things were not much better than they had been. Your hair was tightly rolled tightly in curlers and you were wearing a very pink, very short nightie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA...\" you started to say, feeling the anger welling up in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Jane?\" EDNA's voice replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Jane!  My name is John!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Jane. I have already noted that your name is Jane.  You have a busy day ahead of you, so I suggest we get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busy day?  What...\" you began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You noted that you were currently unemployed. I have arranged several interviews for you today covering a variety of positions you may find suitable. Now let's get you ready. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMechanical arms shot out of the walls and hauled you, even though you fought furiously, into the shower. You were held there, spread eagled, as diplatories, floral body washes, exfoliants, and lotions were allied to your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms removed you from the shower, dried you off, and began dressing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA panty girdle, complete with garters was tightly pulled up, crushing your crotch, and both hiding anything there that said, \"male,\" as well as nipping in your waist and lifting your butt.  A push up bra gave you some quite feminine curves.  You were lifted off of your feet, stockings were run up your legs and fastened to the garters. A white blouse was buttoned on, showing just a hint of faux-cleavage. A reasonable length, but tight, skirt was slid into place, your blouse neatly tucked into it, and three inch heels were slid into your feet. You were plopped in front of a vanity (where'd that come from?) and the arms undid your hair and brushed it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you prefer me to do your makeup, Jane, or would you rather do it?\" EDNA asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as an affirmative, a dome descended onto your head and you could feel some brushes and greasy things being applied to your face. There was some pinching sensations and after only a few seconds, the helmet lifted to show an attractive woman staring back at you. Her eyebrows were on delicate arches. Her ears were pierced.  Twice in both ears. Her dark hair cascaded in soft waves around her face and down below her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms stood you up and ran lint rollers over you. A fitted jacked was forced over your arms and tightly buttoned, showing off your now attractive figure. Perfume was sprayed on while a purse was slung over your shoulder. A small portfolio was placed under your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were then released.  After all that flurry of activity, you stood there, blinking. Several camera flashes went off, temporarily blinding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some pictures, Jane.  Now, let's get you to your first interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA, this is not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Jane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms plopped you just inside the front door, you turned to storm back upstairs when the door opened onit's own. There was a man, standing there, fist poised as if he was just about to knock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Jane?  I'm your Uber driver. I take it you're ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is,\". EDNA's voice said. \"Now hurry, or she'll be late for her interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver looked around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Automated assistant,\" you muttered by way of explanation, shaking your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver, looking a little freaked out, put his arm around your waist and gracefully pulled you out of the door, which immediately shut and with a loud \"click,\" locked behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately tried the door. It was locked. You rummaged in your purse for a key. There wasn't one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EDNA!\"  you called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" the driver said, \"You're going to be late for your interview.  We should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuming, it looks like you now had a day filled with interviews, with EDNA determined to get you employed. As a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stomped after the driver, not looking forward to this day at all. </span></div></div>",

Dave has stopped by to tell you to arrive at the store before it opened so that you could be transported to the impromptu photo shoot- which EDNA, of course, logged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wheels were put in motion for you to become a lingerie model, if you didn\u2019t escape- that was going to be your new life. And you really didn\u2019t want to be advertised all over the world as that. The fewer people that saw you as \u201cJane\u201d the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you walked in the door, you heard the sound of a champagne bottle popping open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations Jane! I knew we could do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA champagne flute was carried to your face as the bubbly flowed down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA...what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelebrating your new job and new modeling career!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flute navigated towards you, and once again you were force fed more booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA, I\u2019m not in the mood to drink tonight\u201d you said champagne started to make its way In your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d EDNA countered, \u201ctoday was a massive success. You\u2019re going to be a star.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMechanical arms lifted you up into the air to disrobe you as another flute of champagne was poured down your mouth. Another flute was administered as a silk nightie was placed upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms dropped you down and you were beginning to feel dizzy and light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEDNA. Could you stop it with the champagne? I\u2019m not in the mood to drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more just to celebrate?\u201d EDNA asked, placing another flute in your hand. An arm extended holding another one, \u201ccheers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFu-f-Fine\u201d you tipsily agreed, \u201ccheers\u201d you clinked the glass and downed the final flute of champagne, \u201cbut that\u2019s i-\u201c you were interrupted by the glass EDNA held being poured down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held onto the wall as you began to stumble from the booze hitting second gear. The intoxication began to confuse you. What were you planning on doing? It felt important. That\u2019s right- getting away from EDNA. Why were you doing that again? I mean, how many people can come home and have drinks with their HOUSE?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled at the thought. This was awesome- why would you want to leave THIS?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air conditioning kicked on and you felt a draft that was recently familiar but not quite ordinary. \u201cWhat the-\u201c you murmured to yourself, \u201cwhat is *hickup* what is that?\u201d You glanced down the the source of the bizarre sensation to see the semi-sobering shine of the silk upon you. And your thought process roared past the intoxication: EDNA thinks you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re currently set to be a lingerie model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t be a lingerie model...I\u2019m a man!\u201d You drunkly said to yourself.</span></div></div>",

Before you finished counting the number of windows and exits they enthusiastically shuffled you out of the doors and into the back of a limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later you were being shuffled out of the limo and into a photography studio where the photographer was finishing setting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! You\u2019re here!\u201d He announced to the men still focusing on the setup, \u201clet\u2019s she who we\u2019re working with...wow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out, grabbed your hand and pulled it in for a kiss, \u201cthe names Jose, what\u2019s the name of this beautiful flower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t think people actually did this cheesy stuff, you sighed and answered his question, \u201cJane...I guess\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJose, did you have a plan for what you wanted to shoot today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA beauty like this one- it\u2019s important to not go too fast. I\u2019m thinking swimwear to start out with, and we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men leaned in and whispered, \u201cCome on, Jose! I think I speak for everyone when I say, I have an immense desire to see her in some nightmare ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me guys,\u201d Jose assured them, \u201cwith a woman like that it\u2019s better to ease into it. You don\u2019t just walk into a party and chug down a bottle of Jack. You take it slow and relax- otherwise you ruin the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose parted from the men and approached you, \u201cwe\u2019re going to start on some swimwear.\u201d He pulled out a large drawer of various options and styles, \u201cgo ahead and pick out something that you think will look good on you, and we\u2019ll send you to a changing room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing all the skimpy swimming suits as though it were being shown to you in a crystal ball made that out in your stomach all the more heavy. \u201cWell, maybe there\u2019s a decent one piece,\u201d you said, the words stung in your heart that you said that, and that that would be the optimistic option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJane,\u201d the men called out, \u201ctake your time- no rush. We\u2019re going to go into the other room for some drinks. You want anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlcohol would be amazing right now, \u201cno thanks\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heft of the purse on your arm made it too cumbersome to find the most modest bathing suit in the ominous drawer. You set the purse down on top of the cabinet to search closer when the straps of the purse disconnected and expanded. You watched as one strap reached down over the open drawer and and a light scanned over it. The other strap extended over to where you were standing as a light scanned over your body- every single square inch of your body. From every angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light scanned the front, both sides, back, aerial, upskirt. Once the overall scans were completed the strap drew closer and spent twenty seconds scannibg and rescanning your \u201cbreasts\u201d before sliding dow ln and doing the same to your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d You whispered angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetermining optimal stylistic choices....choices selected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall arms with tiny pinchers extended out of the purse and descended down to the drawer, and grabbed at a few articles before ascending back up. A lime green thong bikini rose past your face on route to the purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot your hand out to retrieve the outfit from the scheming purse, \u201cstop it! I can\u2019t wear that!\u201d Your hands being outmaneuvered by the arms each attempt. The straps slammed the drawer shut before returning to their purse purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJane! Great! I take it that means you found something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm. Yeah...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, let get you changed!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt the dread of a death row inmate being led to the electric chair as you were guided towards the open door of the changing room. Your hesitancy has no impact on the speed in which you were being guided to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know...I\u2019m not feeling well. I think we might need to do this another time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! That\u2019s just the jitters. Trust me, you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d He said. You could feel him glancing at your \u201cbreasts\u201d as he said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were in the dressing room- door shut. All alone. Just you and your purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to stand still. Hoping that your stillness would sync up with time and not let another second pass. The longer you held back each second, the more successful you would be from not getting any deeper into this nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you knew that wouldn\u2019t work, that part of you was trying to summon the courage to approach the now-inevitable. Before you could gather the slightest bit of strength you heard a wild whurring emit from the purse on your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled and afraid you dropped the purse onto the ground, seeing that it was already beginning to unravel into a series of frantic strands. There must\u2019ve been one hundred of them from what you could tell, and they were shaking about like a chaotic nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you decided, \u201cno, I\u2019m not doing this. I\u2019m out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed away from the wires and placed your hand on the doorknob about to make a run for it when the wires finally attacked you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea that these tiny little things would have so much lower over you, but as soon as they got to you, you were easily pulled away from the door into the center of the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese frantic wires worked with a frightening magic, it seemed almost telepathic how they undid the buttons on your noise and the zipper on your skirt. Despite the erratic movements of these things, they pulled each of these articles off ever so gently. The strands working in perfect synchronicity to bind your hands together to keep you still and to separate your arms to remove the sleeves. Your bra was unlatched and pulled off of you, along with the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe removal of these things should have been a good thing, but seeing these things ever so softly float away from your body had a ominous implication to them. As though some of your remaining manliness was being taken along with the womanly articles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce naked, the bathing suit floated before your face again while you were held still. The machinery almost made it seem like the articles were dancing before you, as though it was laughing at the inevitability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Please! Stop!\u201d You tried to yell before the panties you were wearing before were shoved into your mouth as your arms were pulled up and the top was slipped on. The lower outfit appeared to be dropped only to be caught by wires by your ankles. You felt am insisting pressure by your ankles, while you shook your head in futile pleas. Your left foot stepped forward into them, followed by the right. The wires moved from your ankles over to the article and ever so sweetly pulled them higher and higher. Hiding your manliness as they reached your hips. Breast pads came out of nowhere and were inserted into your cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wires then came back together and reformed into a purse behind you while you stared slack jawed at the mirror you were facing. So surprised that you let the panties just fall out of your mouth instead of spitting them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sights and sensations made no sense. You had a weggie but felt naked. You felt naked, but in a weird way. In a way that felt more naked than actually being naked. And neck down, your reflection didn\u2019t look like yours in the slightest. \u201cDay 3 on a three year house arrest, and this is where I\u2019m at...\u201d<br>\r\nThe straps on the purse disconnected again and began scanning all over your body again in the same fashion as before. It felt humiliating before, it felt significantly worse now in your current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake Up Procedure required bride continuing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You said as you were pulled back and the purse leapt on you, pinning your arms to your sides while the cosmetics in the purse were applied to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purse fell to the ground and there was nothing even remotely you in your reflection.</span></div></div>",
