It made sense that the family would live a bit removed from the others but this seemed to be a bended land the family settled on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki pulled his hair back in a ponytail and moved his bag to block the front of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to suffer another protective earth bending parent or a crotch-kicking \"stranger danger\" shouting child. This time, he was prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand stood a couple of feet away from the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked his wrist as three pebbles hit the front door and shouted, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" A man said, standing behind him. The member of the White Lotus nearly jumped out of his skin at the voice, and turned to see a man standing with a boulder in his hand. \"Been a while since we had visitors! What can I do you for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I hear that you have been having some problems with your child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problems? Oh, the village elders sent you?\" The father's face fell a bit, \"I thought that moving the house a bit further away from them was all they wanted but no, I was right. They want us gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why?\" Asuki asked, unable to stop his eyebrows. The previous child was simply a terror. He needed to make sure this child was a terror because of uncontrolled powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made deer soup the other day and-- honey?\" the man called, walking toward the house. \"The councilman is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not exactly the village councilman--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we'd moved far enough away from the village?\" His wife called from the kitchen once they entered the house. \"At least far enough that when Peng sneezes that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sshh!\" the man stressed before forcing a laugh, \"I guess some water dropped onto the kitchen fire there. I have to fix that leak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, haha,\" the wife forced, \"Yes the leak. And well, maybe fixing how close we are to the river will fix that leak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could get a word in edgewise--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not. With the councilman here, it seems we'll have to pack up and actually move this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't go to the city-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your problem a leaky roof or your child?\" Asuki blurted out. The small family looked at him with unblinking eyes before Asuki caught himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am dreadfully sorry. You see, I work in particular childcare. There is a certain care I give for particular children that seem to give whole villages trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! A childcare worker!\" The parents sighed in relief, \"Well, you should go down the river to the Li Cheng's house,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband started nodded profusely as she continued, \"They have a delightful but really kind of awful little boy named For--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I couldn't forget such a meeting.\" Asuki sighed, moving his bag of items again. \"No, no.... I actually deal with teaching bending styles for children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a bender also--\" the father started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes dear.\" Mother simply pushed him into the kitchen and told him to grab the things to serve tea, \"Now, what kind of bending styles do you teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Asuki asked, surprised at the question. Most parents don't ask for specifics and it would be a bit odd to suggest anything but Earthbending in the earth kingdom outright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bending. What kind? I know there are different styles of earth bending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH!\" Asuki breathed, \"Yes, plenty... I know them all, actually, but there is another wisdom to it that I am too old to pursue.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking for an apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There can be added skill in an Earthbender learning the styles of other elements.\" His hint was heavy and was not lost on the discerning mother. \"But again, there are only certain children with certain, village sized issues, that can take and succeed in this training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother was silent for a few moments. She watched the straight brow of the guest as her husband set and poured tea in the silence of the room. When the tea was finished pouring, they each took a sip and she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could one know that the child can succeed in this particular training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A test for the child can be given.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if the child does not take the test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there will be, somewhere, a child that had unfathomable power like the Avatar... nearly.... who may very well become the evil in the world the Avatar must defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is the test given?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The child chooses a specific item. This will determine their ability to be trained by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What item is this?\" Asuki smiled at this. Either the mother is an evil being attempting to block him from getting to the avatar or she intended to give the test to her child herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ancient item that is one of it's kind and only in the possession of those who train the avatar. But I happen to have their copies. The results are less accurate but still worthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if the child fails the test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you can go about your normal lives. No one need know your child took, let alone failed, this very special test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I lie, kill you and take the test from your bag? I presume it is in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki blinked at this before he chuckled and put the tea cup back down. \"You will never know the results and time will tell of your foolishness in either training unskillfully or not training an intense potential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the table was finished being set, she looked to her husband and nodded her head. She stood and cleared the table, returning to the kitchen while here husband took over the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me take you to the woods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The father lead Asuki into the woods behind the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki eyeballed the kitchen as he left, hoping he hadn't just drank poison in the tea he was offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife is very protective. She knew that someone would come to find our child but neither of us know to trust you yet.\" The father stomped, spreading his arms apart and the ground opened up underneath Asuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki fell into the opened fault, but caught himself by putting his hands on either wall. The father pulled more earth out of the ground to snatch the bag off of Asuki, but the man dodged each attack with deft agility. Rolling against the wall horizontally, he coated his waist and covered the bag in a large earth belt before grabbing some rocks and thrusting himself up and out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the air, Asuki flew too high for the father to keep him in his eyesight. Blocking the sunlight, Asuki laid a leg across his knee and still all of the moving earth in place. Gravity took over, pulling everything--even what the father was trying to shoot at Asuki-- back to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki jumped from rock to rock until he made it safely onto the ground beside the father who immediately went for hand-to-hand combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father's boxer jabs and punches were again, dodged skillfully with smooth sidesteps and redirected blows. Asuki wasn't even fighting, he was letting the man tire himself out. Which he did, quiet quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still!\" the father grunted in growing frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy?\" a small voice called from a nearby tree. At that moment, Asuki slipped under the father's arm and bended earth stocks to trap his hands, feet, and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, I'll help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki stood, beside the now trapped father and watched the child who had immediately dropped into a horse stance--ready to earth bend Asuki away. The problem was, instead of a small rock about the size of the child hovering in aim of Asuki's head, this was a boulder the size of a Buffalofrog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for Asuki to keep his composer, but his amazement was pretty well concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what did Daddy say to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a deep breath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get momma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can help you, daddy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" the dad choked out but he was too late. The child stomped and swiped his hands apart, charging at Asuki with a ground swell and releasing Asuki's bag from his earthbelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki slowed the swell and trapped the child in his own creation before picking up his bag again. <br>\r\n\"That's it. I'm leaving. This town has been nothing but trouble for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your protection.\" he said, turning to the father, \"You have a lovely family.... but if your child is only an Earthbender, like yourself, you do not need to fight me to protect him. I'm not interested in taking care of a normal or even skilled earthbending child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait,\" the father grunted uncomfortably..... \"Using other bending styles.... is that what you were doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Asuki started cleaning up the evidence of their fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which... which style was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This family asks a lot of questions-- \" Asuki sighed for at least a minute before he found himself answering the question truthfully. \"I focused on learning airbending style first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I learn it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's supposedly the hardest for earthbenders because it is an opposing element but the air nomads are more than willing to teach and continuously patient. Unlike me. Good bye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki started to walk back to the village when the father scoffed to himself, \"Airbending style probably would've kept me from getting trapped like this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you care? Your child is living a normal life. Your family will be fine with your guidance and protection and apparent willingness to learn. I am not needed here.\" Asuki freed the man a bit so they could escape later but was not willing to make it easy enough to start another fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wife is protective for good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, what do you want?\" Asuki muttered under his strained breath as he trudged back up the hill and to the father's trapped face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our son.... he's really not normal like you say. I won't be able to help him much farther than earthbending. He needs healthy guidance and training..... All we've gotten from this village is--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rock flew from the direction of the house and hit Asuki on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooo! Yeah! Go mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for fighting my family!\" the mother yelled from down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" the father called again, \"Free me, and I'll fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki found himself sitting cross legged in front of each of them and spreading out the items before the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents sat in silence behind their son with their backs turned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here in the middle of the woods the avatar was found.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see him!\" the parents gestured to the child that was now chewing on Brother Tan's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand your plight--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intense plight!\" The father inserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...uh... yes.\" Asuki refused to look at Brother Tan as the woman attempted to remove the child from her person. \"We understand, but our services are for child nuisances that cause whole villages issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The neighbors hate her! Just ask them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, we shall see.\" Asuki bowed before quickly exiting the house. Brother Tan was right behind him, creating a wall of air between the child and herself to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of steps away from the house, Brother Tan looked at her traveling partner and sighed, \"You could've warned me that the kick was going to kick me in the nether region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize. I honestly didn't know it hurt women the same way it hurts men.\" Tan trapped Asuki's foot in an air bubble and he fell onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think falling would hurt men as it did women.\" Tan smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Grand Lotus is rubbing off on you in the worst ways possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I love my husband.\" Brother Tan smiled and walked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought air nomads were peaceful and hated confrontation.\" Brother Asuki muttered under his breath before pulling the earth beneath Tan's feet. Before Tan took her step, she cushioned the air beneath her and continued forward. Asuki's plan to trip her was foiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are. We also know when to share wisdom. We may feel pain differently but pain is still as it is.\" Tan eyed her friend still on the ground. \"Will you get up?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrother Asuki stood and dusted himself off. \"You are right, as always, Brother Tan. I should have warned you about the child I've never met before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two made it to the last house of the day, they checked their appearances before knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" A man said, from behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of the White Lotus nearly jumped out of their skins at the voice and turned to see a man standing with groceries in his hand. \"Been a while since we had visitors! What can I do you for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... We hear that you have been having some problems with your child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problems? Oh, the village elders sent you?\" The father's face fell a bit, \"I thought that moving the house a bit further away from them was all they wanted but no, I was right. They want us gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why?\" Asuki asked, unable to stop his eyebrows. The previous child was simply a terror. He needed to make sure this child was a terror because of uncontrolled powers. For Tan's sake and his future sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I made deer soup the other day and-- honey?\" the man called, walking toward the house. \"The councilmen are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not exactly the village councilmen--\" Brother Tan started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we'd moved far enough away from the village?\" His wife called from the kitchen once they entered the house. \"At least far enough that when Park sneezes that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sshh!\" the man stressed before forcing a laugh, \"I guess some water dropped onto the kitchen fire there. I have to fix that leak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, haha,\" the wife forced, \"Yes the leak. And well, maybe fixing how close we are to the river will fix that leak? Could you move the house again, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we could get a word in edgewise--\" Brother Asuki started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not. With the councilmen here, it seems we'll have to pack up and actually move this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't go to the city-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your problem a leaky roof or your child?\" Asuki blurted out. The small family looked at him with unblinking eyes before Tan stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry to interrupt. You see, we work in a particular childcare. There is a certain care we can give for particular children that seem to give whole villages elemental trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! A childcare worker!\" The parents sighed in relief, \"Well, you should go down the river to the Li Cheng's house,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband started nodded profusely as she continued, \"They have a delightful but really kind of awful little girl,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chewing problem? I believe we've met her.\" Tan nodded. \"We work with young benders who have powers a bit stronger than normal at their age. Does your child show skill with bending any of the four elements, like their father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, extraordinary skill\" the father agreed before going to the back, \"They both do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both?\" Asuki asked the wife, who simply nodded in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father brought out his twin toddlers, both sleeping at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Li Mei, she is oldest, and Park, our first son.\" The pride of the father's face was joy-filling for the entire room but Asuki and Tan were uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever before has there been more than one child in the avatar's household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must have the wrong house,\" Asuki whispered, but Tan was already preparing the items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may have the wrong house, but we still must test the children.\" Tan whispered back, then, turning to the parents, \"Our services...\" Brother Asuki stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you believe your children need extra help with their elemental control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am a non-bender and their father only bends earth.\" The mother started, grabbing one of the children as she started to wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet our children.... they have intense emotions that seem to channel other elements. It has become quite hard for anyone in the village to deal with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Park has horrible allergies--\" the mother added, standing to go back to the kitchen. She took her child with her, trying to decide whether she should wake the sleeping babe or leave him resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Li Mei cries in the oddest way...\" Just then, Li Mei struggled against her father's arms, waking. \"Mei-Mei, say hi to the guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child took a sleepy look at Tan and Asuki and attempted to turn back into her father's arms and back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, honey.\" The mother said, coming back into the room with pepper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait--\" Tan said before the parents could upset their children to showcase their skills. The parents stopped and Asuki finished her thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is not need to showcase their talents. We have a test of our own. If the children require training, we have teachers we can send to you but first wee must make sure they... qualify for our services.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this going to cost us anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing monetarily.\" Tan sighed and Asuki rolled out the empty mats. \"The price, however, is that one child may have to leave home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they are twins, we should test them together. I would not want one child's choices to affect the other's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wisdom always prepares.\" Tan handed her bag to Asuki, who prepared the second test on the opposite end of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot take my children.\" The father started but the mother put her hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the avatar's test, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn silence, Asuki set the second test while Brother Tan looked at the parents with softness and gave the slightest nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a great danger in keeping the avatar without training. Unfortunately, our services would attract too much attention in this small town-- we were already able to find you so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki was finished preparing the mats and returned to his space beside Tan.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey sat on their knees in front of the door they'd entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo empty mats to their right and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pile of toys in the middle of the living room floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pile of toys, there were two that represented each element-- one set being the spare prepared Tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your children will choose... You must not guide an indecisive child.\" Brother Tan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuki's face did not give anything away. The children needed to choose four specific toys. It is better if the parents did not understand what was necessary to identify the children. For now, however, they must wait for the babes to wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n-</span></div></div>",
