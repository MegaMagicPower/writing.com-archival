You say to your mother, \"how much longer i'm tired and i want to go home\" \"Just a little bit further dear\" said your mother. \"Yes just a bit further\" said your father. <br>\r\nYou sigh and keep walking. finally you stop walking and your mother say, \"look a golden necklace would you go get it for me dear\" your mother says, \"i knew you left something behind on our last trip here\" she smiled. <br>\r\nYou sigh and think parents a so weird and walk over to the spot you mother pointed out and looked around seeing nothing on the ground \u201cwhere is it?\u201d then suddenly.....<br>\r\nYou are in a net in the air. you yell \u201cwhat happened, what\u2019s going on\u201d you look down and realize you really high from the ground and is scared stiff and then you see your parents looking sad \u201ci\u2019m sorry honey, but you know the town rule at least one sacrifice has to be made\u201d said your mother \u201cand we choose you i\u2019m sorry\u201d said your father. <br>\r\nBut before they could leave you hear loud thumping on the ground and gently shakes the net you look up and there you see a male giant taller than forty men put together and you finally realize that you are no more than five inches compared to him the giant. <br>\r\nThe giant sits down Indian style and looks at you and you can see his huge, round belly hanging over his tight pants and shirt was too small for him to wear over his belly. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he boomed grabbing the net to look at you closer. The giants eyes was as tall as you as the giant looks at you from head to toe. You gulp.  <br>\r\nThen he lets go of the net looks at your parent frozen at the spot, \u201cthis is not a meal of my liking it is too scrawny to full my belly,\u201d he said. Suddenly you hear a loud rubble coming from the giant. The giant looks down at his huge belly and pats it gently. \u201cWell sounds like my stomach agrees\u201d said the giant. He looks at you and then your parents. Licking his lips he says, \u201dwell I guess I\u2019m going to have to you eat you too\u201d your parents\u2026</span></div></div>",

You watch as the giant tastes them very carefully so to savor the flavor. He lifts his head and then swallows. You see the a huge lump in the giant\u2019s throat knowing your parents are slowly going to their deaths. <br>\r\nThe giant uses his finger to trace where your parents are. The lump disappears, but the giant traces your parents pass his chest and into his stomach once there he pats his belly and rubs it gently. You look at the giants belly knowing that your parents are now the sacrifices. <br>\r\nThe giant lets out a satisfied belch. \"buuurp!\" \u201cAhh, they really hit the spot\u201d said the giant patting his now bigger belly and then looks at you with hunger in his eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d you plead, \u201cplease let me go, you had two sacrifices from this town that\u2019s one to many, please let me go.\u201d Giant thinks for a moment then says, \u201cno, I don\u2019t think so, after having your parent as a meal,\" he said licking his lips, \"you shall be my desert\u201d  he pulls out a pocket knife from his back pocket and cuts the net at the top, puts a hand under you, he then grabs the other side of the net letting you roll out of the opening and on to his hand trembling. <br>\r\nYou stare at the giant and you say once again to that hungry look in his eyes pleading you say, \u201cplease I beg of you let me go, please don\u2019t do this, please don\u2019t eat me.\u201d The giant smiles and says, \u201cbut you'll be with your parents again and till the very end of your life and theirs,\u201d <br>\r\nYou look at the giant\u2019s belly and you can see signs of a struggle in from within the giant\u2019s belly \u201cOh\u201d you say \u201cI\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Finally you stop rolling and everything is still then the giant lifts his head and swallows you. You head for the back of the throat you try to struggle free, but to no avail you are pushed down the throat and finally land in the stomach it\u2019s wet and very humid you turn around to see your parents passed out on the stomach walls you run to the walls and beat the stomach walls as hard as you can. The giant rubs his belly and belches loudly \u201cbuuuuuurp!!! Mmmmm you taste better than your parents did\u201d the giant said and patted his belly and the giant laid down on his back with one hand gently rubbing his belly as he fell asleep. You later pass out from lack of oxygen lie next to your parents as the three of you get digested together<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
