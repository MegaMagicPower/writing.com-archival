Plus it would probly help you fight ghosts.\" Sam whispers as Danny, herself, and Tucker make their way through the crowded hall between classes.<br>\r\n\"She has a point Danny, your ghost powers can only help you so much in your daily life. You can't use them all the time. Plus it might help with the fact that Dash has been seriosly on your case man.\" Tucker helpfully points out.<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. You've been giving me this lecture for about a week now! I told you that between my normal life, and ghost fighting I don't have the time.\"<br>\r\n\"I could organize your schedule.\" Offers Tuck.<br>\r\n\"And, I could be your health instructer,\" chimed Sam. <br>\r\n\"I told you, I'm not going to-OOF!\" Being so preoccupied with Sam and Tuckers nagging, Danny failed to notice where he was walking. And, walked right into Dash's fist.<br>\r\n\"What have we here? A homing nerd?\" Dash crows as he pulls Danny off the ground by his shirt coller. He then easily lifts Danny above his head, winding back for a clean punch to the gut. All eyes are now on Danny and Dash.<br>\r\n'Man, if only I could use my powers without getting caught. Or steal Dash's streangth so he couldn't beat on me.' Danny thinks as he reaches up to grab Dash's wrist in an atempt to escape before the punch connected. A sudden bright green flash fills the hall, knocking Danny and Dash into opposing walls.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Danny mumbles as he rubs his head. He then regesters the screaming. \"Uh-oh. I-I can explaine!* But it doesn't matter, cuase floating in front of him is none other than the -.<br>\r\n\"BEWARE!!\" Boxghost yells, and floats off.<br>\r\nThrough the panic Danny can hear another voice from the other side of the hall.<br>\r\n\"Fenton! You and me! The Guys Locker Room after school. Be there or else.\" Dash runs off.<br>\r\nTucker and Sam help Danny up. \"Dude what just happened? There was that flash, and then the Boxghost showed up. Was that flash him?\"<br>\r\n\"More importantly, are you ok Danny?\" Sam asks, shooting Tucker a glare for not being more concerned.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. A matter of fact I feel better then I did before I touched Dash.\" Danny looks at himself. \"Do I look different to you?\"<br>\r\n\"Weelllll...\" Both look him over. \"Not really, but your clothes look a little small for you now.\"<br>\r\nDanny smirks, \"That's all I needed to hear. Guys I think that flash was me, and bet I'm going to enjoy meetting Dash after school today.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny stood before the door to the boys\u2019 locker room, a bit nervous about what he was going to do. Or, at least try to do. Sam and Tucker stood on either side of him, both looking just as nervous as Danny felt. He couldn't get past the fact that ghost fighting almost came naturally to him these days, and it no longer scared him the rest of the way to death. But Dash scared him more than any of those ghosts did, and he didn't know why. At least.... He had a general idea why. Mainly the fact that he couldn't use his powers openly with out getting caught; or it could be that he was constantly tempted to take that step over the edge to actually do something. And, he knew he could do it too. But now was different. Now he could use his powers for something he really wanted, and if he was careful still not get caught.<br>\r\n\"You ready for this Danny? You know you don't really have to go through with this.\"<br>\r\n\"No Sam, actually I do.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"I can't say, but I just do. You guys will wait for me out here right?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing man, I've got the first aid kit right here ready to go.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I hope I won\u2019t need it.\" He takes a step towards the door. A hand reaches out to grab him.<br>\r\n\"Danny, whatever you\u2019re planning, be careful.\"<br>\r\n\"I will Sam.\" 'Shesh, how do they always know something\u2019s up.' \"Don\u2019t worry about me.\" He sighs, and tries to smile. Sam lets go, reassured. Danny finishes moving towards the door, pushes it open and enters. Inside, the doors silently close behind him; a musky wet smell fills the room from the last gym class. The lights aren't all on, and a shower head can be heard dripping in the back. 'Well I'll give Dash points on the evil scale for the scenery.' He makes his way towards the back; trying not to breath and break the looming silence. He thinks he sees something move out of the corner of his eye, and knows the familiar feeling he gets from Skalker when he\u2019s being hunted happening right now. His hair on the back of his neck starts to stand up. \u2018I\u2019m not going to jump, I\u2019m not going to ju-!\u2019<br>\r\n\u201cLook who decided to show up! Fenturd, all by his lone some.\u201d Dash crows from behind, as Danny jumps in the air from shock. \u201cWhat shall we do with him boys?\u201d<br>\r\n\u2018Boys? I thought it was going to just be the two of us?\u2019 \u201cDash, it was just you and me.\u201d Starting to get ticked about forgetting that jerks don\u2019t play fare.<br>\r\n\u201cPlans change dweb. Grab \u2018im guys.\u201d These two big teammates step out and slam Danny into the wall; though one could have held him. They both stood to the side so Dash could have a clean punch.<br>\r\nRage filled Danny at this point. \u2018These thugs lied to me again! They never fight fair!\u2019 another voice seems to chime up. Sneering \u2018What did you expect? An apology? You have the power. USE IT!\u2019 The voice thundered these words into Danny; his rage building. He struggled to control himself, trying to think of any other way out as Dash came closer. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny decided he wasn't going to hold back anymore. He started to use his power. He started taking muscle. Dash swung his fist forward into Danny's mouth, but when his fist got there, there was no muscle left on Dash's arm. <br>\r\n\"What the?\" cried Dash, shocked to only see a bony arm, with his fist on the end of it. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dash's muscle had transferred onto Danny's arm!<br>\r\n\"Well Dash,\u201d the muscular-armed Danny said, \"It seems you've lost some muscle there. You look pretty uneven, with one huge arm and one puny bony one.<br>\r\nHow about I take care of that for you?\"<br>\r\nInstantly, Dash's arm shriveled to nothing but skin-and-bone, and Danny's arm rose with the new muscle, his bicep nearly 22 inches with his and Dash's muscle. Dash speechlessly looked at his other arm and was shocked to find nothing. Dash's two jock friends stared, jaws dropped, at what they saw. <br>\r\n\"Well, Dash, looks like you've got no remaining muscle in your arms. However, I look pretty strange with these huge arms and no developed chest or abs. <br>\r\nMind if I borrow yours?\"<br>\r\nDash started to run, and he got halfway to the door, but Danny took all the muscle in his legs, and Dash fell over. Danny quickly took the muscle from the other two jocks' legs, and they fell over as well. <br>\r\n\"You're not thinking, Dash, you aren't cooperating. Just for that, I'm taking every pound of muscle off your body!\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" screamed Dash, but it was no use. Soon, he felt his muscular 8 pack melt away onto Danny's body. His once gigantic pecs, disappearing, shrinking into Danny's body, and off of his. His muscular Neck and shoulders? You guessed it. Danny had taken everything off of Dash. 200 pounds of Dash's muscle, which rivaled that of a NFL football player, now belonged to Danny, leaving Dash a 90-pound weakling.<br>\r\nDanny turned to the other two jocks, who were just slightly smaller than Dash; grabbed them in his two hands, and sucked every pound of what was left of them, and their height as well. Danny grew taller, and more muscular. His chest became thicker and thicker, his pecs blocking his view of the ground, his abs destroying logic, being a solid 12 pack set of abs, with fit his new 8 foot stature perfectly.<br>\r\nHis muscular chest soon quickly ripped through the shirt, tearing it to shreds, his jeans in tatters on the floor. Luckily, his boxers held tight. <br>\r\nHe left the two jocks 90 pounds, just like Dash, shriveled and weak. Danny, who was a pathetic 140 pounds before today, now weighed in at 720 pounds of sheer muscle, Danny looked down at his body, and laughed in his new, unbelievably deep voice. He dropped one of the puny jocks in his hands, to look for clothes. He ripped open each locker, his new obscene muscle not making it a problem, until he found an extra stretchy sweatshirt. He put it on, although the sleeves only came down to his 35 inch biceps. He also found some extra large jeans an obese kid wore, and put these on, fitting tightly on his bulging muscular legs. He picked up one jock, and threw him across the room. He grabbed the other jock with his other hand, and Danny went over to Dash, who was lying on the floor, physically unable to move. Danny picked his skinny, pathetic body with one hand, and said, <br>\r\n\"Well Dash, I think things are gonna be different around here from now on.\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think it's paid off, don't you think?\" replied Danny, giving his bicep a flex, which practically tore the shirt he now wore. \"Now I think I'll 'work out' some more on the rest of the jocks, let them know who the REAL man is in this school now. But don't worry, I don't hurt anyone, just make sure those soon-to-be-weak jocks get a taste of their own medicine, than I might...spread the love around with some of the geeks, let them have a bit of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jocks weren't hard to find, they were waiting just outside the school to congratulate Dash on a 'job' well done, and then go do jock-ish things. Unfortunately, what they obviously hadn't expected was a much larger Danny walking through the doors, his head almost hitting the doorframe, and his shoulders practically touching the sides. All of which was placed under Danny's head, the same one who they knew as the school shrimp (seriously, even some freshman seemed more muscular than him); now though, he was bigger, stronger, and very, very mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-C-Come on guys! He may be bigger, but we outnumber him! He can't take us all on at once!\" shakily said one of the jocks, which was enough to rouse his comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group surrounded Danny on all sides, Sam and Tucker decided to hide, mostly wanting to see how exactly Danny had gotten so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok guys, on the count of 3, jump him!\" said another jock who then counted down and then they jumped on Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny only pretended to be overburdened, he could have easily lifted and tossed them away like nothing, but he wanted to be sure that the muscle he was about to gain was of top quality. At the bottom of the dogpile, Danny focused on all of the jocks on him, and slowly took their muscle away. It took the jocks a minute to realize that they were being pushed away by Danny, even though he wasn't moving. After taking pretty much all of their muscle, Danny stood up, and up, and a bit more up after that. The jocks watched this as well, not realizing that most of their now-oversized clothes had fallen off of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny couldn't believe how big he was, all of that jock muscle gave him such a feeling of power, it was almost more than he thought he could handle. He picked up one of the ex-'jocks' and held him there. He couldn't believe he was scared of such small people now. He took off the wimps jacket and shirt, and picked up a pair of shoes and pants, then took the quivering person over towards where Tucker and Sam were hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tucker, come over here. I know that you're here.\" said Danny in a demanding tone. Tucker came out shaking like a leaf from his hiding spot, though Sam decided to stay there. \"Tucker, put on these clothes and give your clothes to him.\" Tucker did as he was asked, looking at the ex-jock, who was now his size without all of his muscle. Tuckers clothes practically fit like a glove, though the ex-jocks clothes weren't quite the same on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then set down the jock, but told him to stay put, and then picked up Tucker, still rather scared of his massive friend. Danny concentrated on his tiny friend and then after a bit of a green flash, Tucker then stood like one of the old jocks; stronger, taller, faster. Nowhere near Danny's extreme size (who hadn't gotten any smaller from the transfer), but Tucker now knew what it was like to be big. He flexed his bicep and watched as a ball formed on his arm and pushed the fabric almost to tearing. He pulled up his pant leg and watched as a massive calf looking like a big heart slapped behind his shin, and he couldn't even get it high enough to see his thigh. He could feel the power of his rock-hard six pack through his new shirt and flexed them hard, making them even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting him down, Danny was curious as to what to do next. He had knocked down all the jocks from their pedastal, and it appears that he could even make others stronger, though he didn't seem to lose any muscle in the process. It was certainly interesting to the massive muscle teen. But then again, why stop at the jocks? Certainly there were many more people to steal muscle from, not like anyone ever really helped him. He was a hero, he deserved a bit of a reward, even if no one realized it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hard choices we have to make in life.\" Danny thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Danny struggled in vain with his captors and the voice in his mind.<br>\r\n'Is what they're doing to you right? Give them what they deserve; use your power! You don't have to take it all, just enough to not be hurt.'<br>\r\n'But, I-'<br>\r\n'Isn't that what you were planning in the first place?' Dash pulls back to strike, 'Just DO IT!'<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything seems to come into focus as Danny realized that this voice is right. He had planned to steal Dash's strength, now he can just do it to two other jerks as well. Immediately he starts pulling what he needs from the two holding him. A single word flowing through his mind; armor. Soon as he thought this he could feel the changes begin inside of himself and the two jocks. He could feel the power in their chests and stomachs flowing into him. The definition and size of their muscles decreasing while his grew; he tried with all his self control to compact that power as tight as possible so no one could see him growing. <br>\r\nWithin the time it took Dash to swing his fist into Danny's stomach; Danny had stolen two fifths of each of the two jocks abs and chest muscle. And, even though he hardly felt anything through his now rock hard stomach he screamed as painfully as possible. Dash smirked; leaving his fist pressed into Danny for emphasis and the sheer pleasure.<br>\r\n'That's it you jerk, practically give me your strength.' Danny thinks while smirking inwardly. He immediately starts pulling from Dash's physic. Before Dash could pull away Danny had taken two fifths of Dash's pecs and abs as well. Danny now having the strength of 1.1 football players packed tightly into his now well developed chest and stomach. Dash pulled away, grabbing his head, and feeling a little dizzy.<br>\r\n'Now for the rest.'<br>\r\nDanny began pulling from the rest of his three 'tormentors' bodies.<br>\r\n'First some height,' Danny thought as he took a total of three inches from each jock; resulting in a growth spurt of nine inches. He noted with pleasure that the three nitwits became dizzy from this for a moment. And due to this, their low IQ, and the dim light, none of them noticed that Danny stood at eye level with Dash.<br>\r\n'Next the legs and feet.' He almost felt like whistling as he felt his feet grow three sizes in his shoes. His calves tightened into diamonds while his thighs thickened, and his butt ballooned into a large bubble of fat and muscle.<br>\r\n'This feels great.' He thought, almost forgetting he was being bullied. 'Now for the back, shoulders, and neck.'<br>\r\nOnce again he took two fifths from each, feeling the power flowing through him, and his clothes fitting a little differently. Other than that he could feel his back and neck problems disappearing.<br>\r\n'Next the arms, and then the heart and lungs.' His arms tightened, thickened, balled, striated with blood vessels as he felt the power flowing through him, and the grip of the two jocks weakened as he went. Finally he went inward, pulling away the size of the jocks lungs and heart. He could feel his breaths getting deeper and hear his heart beat in his ears as these vital organs grew. He could see Dash getting winded thanks to this, and knew it was time to beg.<br>\r\n\"Please Dash, stop. I-I'm sorry, just stop.\" Danny sobbed, and whimpered trying to sound like he was really in pain. Dash stood there breathing heavily from the workout.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's enough learning for today Fentonie,\" Dash spoke normally, trying to hide how tired he felt, \"We'll continue your lesson tomorrow,\" to add emphasis he punched his fists together. \"Now get!\"<br>\r\nThe two jocks let go of Danny, and he hobbled towards the door ,\"Thank-You Dash!\" He pushed his way out, and turned to see Sam and Tucker waiting.<br>\r\n\"You all right man?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah Tuck I'm fine.<br>\r\n\"You wanna get something at the Nasty Burger?\" Sam asked, placing her hand on his shoulder. She noticed that something felt..... different, she just couldn't tell what.<br>\r\n\"Well, I-</span></div></div>",

He sees him already asleep. 'Perfect.' he thinks. He then takes off his shirt and uses the mirror in front of him to monitor his progress. \"Everywhere, but slowly.\" he says.

Danny, who had been practically on watch 24/7 for ghosts was glad to have some off time.  Usually he was fighting during his free time and even when he was in the middle of something important.  In his \"off\" time Danny spent his time hanging with his friends, relaxing, and most of all eating.<br>\r\n   There was a reason Nastey burger was called that, the orignal owner of the franchise named it after himself, Al Nastey.  But that didn't hide the fact that the burgers were served with a thick layer of atery clogging grease that no adult could stomach over their health issues despite their tastocity.  So who could possibly pay for these fatty chunks of meat.  The answer is obvious, teens with no concern over their weight and that's where Danny was every day since he was on vacation from ghost hunting.  He'd always buy his usual, a nastey burger, medium fries, and a drink.  As time passed he began ordering two burgers a day then three and four and five and so on.  His fries grew to medium large, mega large and then multiplied like the burgers.  The drink kept going up in size too before changing to a shake, which was just as fattening as chugging a cup of bacon fat.<br>\r\n   His friends started becoming a little concerned too as his shirt was becoming tight and quite dirty as he started inhaling the food practically in one bite, grease dripping on his clothes that he'd lick up later.</span></div></div>",

His belly was now 5 feet around and his belly button alone looked like an open sewer hole. His man-boobs were now a size double B and blocked almost his entire view of things. His flabby arms were so packed with blubber, they were weighing down the couch's rests while his legs and butt were crushing the poor furniture. So Danny spend an hour sitting and eating a jumbo-sized potato chips. His parents were off looking for camps he could join to shred his pounds while his friends were forbidden to see him by their parents, due to them believing he's a bad influence. His sister, Jazz, tried some talking to him, but he shrugged her off. She gave up trying 4 days ago and decided to look into colleges instead. Danny spend the begining of his day alone in his house. He could care less. He just wanted food and his brain grew hazy. Suddenly, something important (to Danny at least) happened.</span></div></div>",

I just thought I would like to have some fun playing with that useless fat ghost boy now that I got him. I can do this video shooting another day.\" She exclaimed with folding arms. \"You are saying something against that, boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one wanted to put a 'but' in their boss' agreement. Besides, it was her enemy she was talking about. She was more happier with that success than anyhing else right now. \"Fine, we will finish the video shooting when I order you to.\" She took her guitar, which she used as a floating board, and got up on it. \"See ya later, bunch of losers!\" And with that, she dissapeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she called us a 'bunch of losers'?\" exclaimed one of her bandmates, confused at the exclaimation, while looking at the other guys of the crew and the band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n\"Damn, you are SO heavy!\" She was panting at the moment she was pushing Danny through her temporal home in Amity Park. He just stood there, unconscious, while she was ripping his clothes off, devealing the mass of blob he had transformed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like Ember has never seen a fat man's nude torso ever in her life and afterlife, but it was just a growing curiousity that her number one enemy in the entire world and Ghost Zone combined looked like... that. She looked somehow embarrassed, but in some kind of way... he reminded her that past lover she once had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone assumed that Ember was into skinny kinda supermodel guys, but her past lover... wasn't exactly like that. In fact, the guy she talked about in 'Remember' was not even close to this. He was an average built guy, and he had a beer belly of sorts. She didn't mind the fact, but she expressed her concerns about his weight back when they were dating, and he respected her opinion. But... if Danny's new build was meaning something, if she could have had the opportunity... her ex would have been much more bigger than he originally was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting excited about that whole feeling... so she started touching him. She rubbed his belly, squeezed his manboobs, and also rubbed his forearms. Ember could have kissed that double-chinned teenager if she wanted, their faces where so close... so close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Danny opened his eyes, watching how the singer was getting closer to his face. \"WHOA, WHOA there, Ember!\" He launched an ectoplasmic ray out of his hands, directed at her, whom he launched several feet away from him. She fell down to the floor and screamed to him: \"What is WRONG with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what is WRONG with YOU?! What are... what...\" He took a look of his ripped clothes in the floor and horrorized exclaimed: \"What were you DOING?! To me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GEE, Phantom! It's not like I was doing something WRONG, you know?!\" She also exclaimed, cleaning of the dirt she got from the floor. \"I call this a truce, before you get me into a sue of some place I HAD to rent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A truce?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I call this a truce, between you and me.\" The blue flamed hair girl told him. \"Well, what thing happened that you want to do a truce with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... none of your business! Really.\" She was just looking at the flab he was hanging out. \"You are... wow, you most look at you! You look like a big butterball who barely fits into his clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I got fat, so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hun'... if you could respect the opinion of one of your enemies, I wouldn't say that there isn't anything wrong with you being fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this little video we have of you would severely affect your popularity... I can imagine the headlines talking about a certain local hero getting completely huge, and useless... or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Danny looked down to his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is this one thing that I want you to do for me.\" She sit alongside him and rubbed his belly, while looking at him. \"I've become interested in your fattening self... so...\"</span></div></div>",

It's not my concern, but aren't you a rock star who depends on her image to sell your dumb music to people?!\" Danny was warming up to the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who CARES about it! These guys LOVE my music just by listening to it. I'm not like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half ghost was just laughing about the whole thing.

Especially if he could use it for his own benefit, too. But, maaaaaan, he was ridiculously hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me be clear, you will make me fat. And I will make you fat, too. Right?\" He closed his eyes while ordering the information he was dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" She answered while standing up, and didn't wanted to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you say that you are not going to care about the excess of weight, either?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! I'm not going to repeat myself again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny kept laughing for a while until he decided. \"Okay, Ember. I will make you fatter, IF you are completely okay with making me bigger, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... a deal is a deal?\" The rocker offered her hand to Danny's. She couldn't stop noticing how his hands were getting pudgier. \"It's a deal...\" His stomach started growling and was making echoes in the room they were in. It was incredibly awkward for Danny... because if Ember was still an enemy, and a ghost by that... she was also a woman, and it made it look awfully embarrassing. She didn't really looked bothered, but she was laughing because of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...SOOOOOOOO, I know where we can start on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome moments later, Ember tried to cover herself to not look eeriely strange to other people on Amity Park, especially given that the people knew who she was. She got Danny a new wardrobe as well, which was tight, but it was meant to show how fat he has gotten. His belly was hanging out and his buttoned shirt looked like it was going to explode. It looked like both were on a date... which in some sort of terms it was really just that.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"There's this place that you would completely love.

I really hope you can eat all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope YOU have a great appetite too, dip...\" The halfa looked at her, kinda irritated. \"...Danny...\"</span></div></div>",

After being led to a table, he went to the buffet and started loading a plate. It didn\u2019t take long for Danny to set into a pattern of devouring a plate\u2019s contents at an impressive pace, going back for another while drinking a steady supply of sodas that were given to him by a very cute Asian girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSesame chicken, Mongolian beef, fried rice, lo mein, dumplings, sushi, and various other foods all made their way into Danny\u2019s growing stomach. Over 30 minuets later, Danny was done after having consumed a dozen plates. His belly had enlarged and caused his shirt to ride up completely. The sides and sleeves were ripping from his billowing arms and love handles. Danny didn\u2019t notice any of this because he was too busy being in a state of stuffed euphoria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minuets later, his waitress came by. \u201cAll done?\u201d she asked and Danny nodded yes. Her eyes then went to his enlarged gut. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t hurt yourself from eating too much,\u201d she said in a seductive voice and began giving Danny\u2019s bare gut a slow belly rub. This caused Danny to let out a moan of pleasure.

She pulled out a tray with three pies on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stayed close to Melissa and when she took out the pies, their smell hit his nose and caused a dreamy look appear on his eyes. While he was in a daze, Melissa brought the pies to her kitchen table and began cutting them into pieces and adding whipped cream.

Sam then climbed Danny's giant body, and then leaned into his face and gave him a big kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they parted, Danny went ghost and flew out of the airport, carrying Sam on his soft back. Sam just cuddled into Danny's fat, enjoying the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--One year later...--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Danny were just cuddling, looking at the beautiful sunset. They had their parents buy them a farm in Texas, where Sam kept Danny well fed and gave him plenty of room to grow. Danny was now 1,000,000 pounds of jiggling, gelatinous flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a beautiful sunset.\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is.\" Sam said, in pure bliss when cuddling with Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam?\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Yes Danny?\" Sam said, not in frustration but rather in euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have desert?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Sam said. \"We can't have your beautiful body getting smaller, can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then ten trucks filled with various deserts drove up.

Danny loked around and saw that it was Desiree, causing mayhem with people's wishes once again. He then went ghost and flew after Desiree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to her, he said \"Hey genie girl, why don't you get back in your bottle?\" Desiree turned around, and stood (or rather floated) aghast at the eight-ton Danny. She was shocked, yet also turned on by seeing this much flab on one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook that thought out of her head and said \"Yeah? Or what, you'll sit on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that's not a bad idea.\" Danny said. Danny then flew above Desiree and changed back to human form, falling on Desiree who was still too shocked by Danny's new form to go intangible. When he landed on the ground, he caused a big tremor and cracked the pavement. \"Yeah! How do you feel now genie girl!\" He said, bragging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm in heaven...' Desiree thought to herself. In life, Desiree had always been attracted to big, overweight men because she loved how soft they were. Now that she was under eight tons of young boy flesh, she was about ready to have an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny felt uncofortable being on the street, trapped between two cars digging into his flesh. \"Man this city's too small! I wish I could go somewhere where I can just eat and grow all day.\" Danny said absent mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesiree's ears pricked up when she heard that wish. She was so excited she almost lost herself and didn't say her catchphrase before granting his wish. She then just calmed down and said \"So you have wished it, so shall it be.\" and in a large cloud of green smoke, both her and Danny were gone.</span></div></div>",

I've always had a thing for overweight men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well if that isn't the understatement of the century...'

Alright!\" Danny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Desiree began to feed Danny many, many, many different foods conjured up by her genie powers. Soon Danny's weight grew from eight tons to ten, then fifteen, then thirty. As Danny got bigger, so did his appetite, and so did Desiree's carnal attraction to him. Desiree kept using her magic to make him even hungrier, so that his growth would continue uninterrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Danny's weight reached fifty tons, Desiree fell down on Danny's flab. \"Huh? Why did you stop?\" Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wiped out.\" Desiree said. \"I'll need some time before my powers can recharge. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's okay.\" Danny said, getting a sly look on his face. \"I was in the mood for a different taste anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then shook his body in such a way that Desiree fell onto Dany's face, locking lips with him. Desiree was euphoric; she had never felt anything so wonderful in her life, or even her afterlife. They kissed for a long time before parting to breathe, and then they kissed again. Without thinking, Desiree crammed her tongue into Danny's mouth, and began to wrestle with his tongue. This continued for hours before Desiree parted from his face entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, my beautiful blob, I'm in the mood for a different taste too.\" Desiree said, before going intengible and flying down to Danny's forbidden area...</span></div></div>",

He even recognized he was getting fat and he knew that as soon as a ghost attacked he will recover his fit and athletic self. They were just having a well-deserved rest and they needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, he also recognized that his appetite was getting bigger as far as time passed. He didn't know the reason, but he didn't bothered too much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides... Danny felt quite good with that extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his meal, he just licked his fingers, and put his hands over his belly. \"But, guys, this feeling is kinda good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you succumb to lazyness and no exercise, I see where you are going on.\" commented Tucker while thinking in that same sentence. \"If I got fat, bro... oof, and I eat quite a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam?\" Sam fold her arms and didn't want to answer that, while distracting her look to another corner of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny, you know that girls don't really want to think in fat itself. Also, we are talking about Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them laughed at it, thinking about a fatter Sam just for a second, eating all kind of food and dishes around. \"You guys disgust me a lot.\" Sam looked at them with a really disgusting look and stood up, taking her purse. \"I'm leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did we do?!\" Reclaimed Danny. \"You both not worrying about the whole thing!\" As Sam got off their sight, she shut the entrance door so noisily that the clients that were entering were clearly scared about the mood of the goth girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, man, you made her angry. Again.\" Tuck laughed while grabbing some of the fries that Danny left in the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Danny was worried about Sam, since it wasn't his intention to make her leave, but he didn't know what to do to go after her and try to resolve the problem he got himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other hand, Sam was completely angry about how stupid and dumb her best friends can be, and she was way much more worried about Danny's gaining weight problem. However she didn't really notice that this wasn't the only trouble that would bother them...</span></div></div>",

She was so frustrated that she just wanted to go home and relax in her own way without worrying too much about the 'little' scene she made with her friends at the Nasty Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, she was still worried about Danny. He wasn't the most healthiest boy in Amity Park, but still... his sudden appetite increase in the last month made her think that there was something odd. Of course, she would just try to explain it at something just simple as 'they weren't hunting ghosts anymore' but it was so strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to look for her house's keys when she sudden reminded that last comment Tucker made about her. Yes, she didn't think in gaining weight as a 'good thing', since she was still too conscious about her self image. But... the simple thought of letting herself go...? She rested her head on the door a bit, while not escaping that image:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slender Sam, sitting in a large table with tons and tons of food, and suddenly, she jumps at the dishes and starts eating them. As soon as she goes, her corporal mass starts being thicker and thicker, and soon, Sam is dripping fat on her sides, a round belly was starting to form in front of her. Sudenly, she starts getting slower, being a colossal mass of blob while catching food in her pudgy hands to introduce them in her gargantual mouth, completely uncontrolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, she just remember she is in the front door of her home and opens it with the keys she found out inside her purse. Laughing, she thought to herself that 'Nah, as if that could happen!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't noticed that something was spying on her for quite a while ago. and oh, boy, she was the perfect target for it. A ghost was feeling empathic with the anger that the goth was having, but it was also quite aware of what was going on on the local hero of Amity Park. and it was quite amused that what it was doing was coming completely perfect. Perhaps, it could use Sam for its further plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost phased inside the house and found Sam resting on her room, reading a health book that she could give to Danny for further notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was you, I would completely leave the ghost boy being fatter.\" The ghost, clearly female, spoke to her. It took Sam by surprise, while she was trying to reach for a Fenton Thermos she had for emergences. The ghost was clearly invisible and shot her a n ectoplasmic ray to the hand that was reaching the artifact. \"Nuh-uh, that is going to be pretty useless, little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" She exclaimed while grabbing her recently harmed hand. \"Well, it's better to do a nice presentation! My name is Gorgora!\" The ghost made herself a presence, a female ghost who was a bit classy, but also quite plump. Heck, she was quite fat! \"My special skills involve indulging apettite, and little by little make them fatter!\" She introduced herself. \"I was the responsible for making the ghost boy to be addicted to food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it was you?!\" Reclaimed Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes. I enjoy making people getting fatter. And they little to nothing worry about it as a big trouble, and it makes them happy. You looked how happy he was, isn't it?\" Sam just stayed in silence, while looking down to the book she was reading. \"And, by the way that I have been thinking... you really would like him to be just like he wants to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want him to get fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deep inside you, you want him to be bigger. Oh, hush, honey... I know you want to. I also know you want to be fat, too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam deeply blushed in red. \"What are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to prove your friends they are wrong. That you wouldn't worry to be fat, either.\" She hushed her, with a finger in her mouth. \"And I will get you get bigger. And I will get your friends get bigger. You will be my perfect host.\" Gorgora proceeded to take over Sam's body. She was trying to fight it, but couldn't, and eventually she started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my dear, dear Sam... You will know how good it is getting fatter, and in the process, you will enjoy how your 'little boyfriend' will get fatter, too.\" She laughed manically, while preparing herself to go to the house' fridge and give her a 'little' pig out.</span></div></div>",

At first she had just had a light snack when she finished her homework, but now she was rushing home every day after school to veg out with a feast of meat-free junk food (doughnuts, potato chips, and soda) and trashy TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight gain was hardly noticable, but she had developed a fuller look, especially around her hips and thighs.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Sunday, and Sam had slept in, something that she had grown accustomed to lately. She had set her alarm to go off at noon, slept through it without even noticing the noise, and finally opened her eyes at 3:30 pm. She seriously considered going back to sleep for a few hours, but she felt a nagging hunger pain that forced her to slowly pull herself out of bed and stumble down to the kitchen. As she made her journey, she noticed that no one was home. Her parents were probably out doing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting her growling stomach, Sam stepped into the kitchen and started searching for her favorite treats. What she found was too horrible for her to imagine: they were out of food! She checked and rechecked every pantry, shelf, and drawer, and couldn't find a single edible thing. Then again, there had been a box of baking soda in the fridge...was she really that hungry? Another loud stomach gurgle made it clear that yes, she was, and she dove for the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lifted the baking soda to her mouth, Sam spied two packages of tofu dogs. How had she missed those? She honestly thought she had eaten the last of the tofu dogs days ago. She happily grabbed and tore open one of the packages, and placed one of the dogs in her mouth, slowly chewing it as it slid down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was different about these dogs...they were delicious! So full of flavor. She would have to remind her mother to buy this brand again. Lately her parents had indulged her behavior completely, which Sam took as a sign that they were accepting her for who she was. Actually, her parents simply thought that pigging out and watching television was a \"normal\" thing to do, and that this might trigger a change in their skinny, gothic daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping another sausage into her mouth, Sam took a seat by the television. She grabbed the remote, leaned back, and turned it on. The screen lit up to show a rerun of some old reality TV show. Sam knew it was stupid and pointless, but she couldn't take her eyes off of it. She gazed upon the screen with all the attention that her blank stare allowed, rhythmically shoving the tofu dogs into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the commercial break came up a few minutes later, she was completely out of food. \"I'm still so hungry...must be all the hard work I've been doing. Good thing I saved the other package.\" She took a moment to tear herself away from the TV, and shuffled over to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaped to the fridge was a handwritten note that she hadn't noticed while tearing the kitchen apart earlier. She stared dumbfounded as she tried to make sense of what she was reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Sam,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWent grocery shopping. Don't touch the hot dogs in the fridge, they're for your dad and his friends tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was completely shocked. She opened the fridge and looked at the package: they weren't tofu dogs, they were generic brand hot dogs. Her worst fears had come true: She had killed an animal for food. Her mind raced as she imagined all of the things in that hot dog. Cow. Pig. Intestines. Dog. Rat? Maybe even skunk? She wanted to throw up, but, as disgusted as she was, she couldn't help but remember how great they tasted. She could feel her willpower starting to waver...</span></div></div>",

Danny looked out at the empty parking lot as cars began to pass by, the traffic was getting heavier, the lunch hour rush would soon be pulling in and his boss would be watching to make sure he could handle it. Danny adjusted his small paper hat for the fifth time in an hour and made sure his name tag was still straight since the last time he looked five minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny patted the counter as a car or two pulled into the parking lot, but rather than park and come inside they pulled around to the side to the drive through. Danny looked over at Diana, the girl working the window, she'd been working here for 8 months and didn't look nearly as nervous as Danny. Danny let out a long sigh trying to calm down, this job meant a lot to him. He could finally buy something to impress Paulina that his normal allowance didn't really have a budget for, or even afford a nice date, minimum wage wasn't much but at 190 dollars every two weeks after taxes he could certainly afford a very nice candle lit dinner. Yeah Paulina would sure be impressed, he mused to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"or Sam...\" His subconscious murmured in the back of his mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shook his head \"Sam.. just a friend\" he thought back. Danny looked up at the ceiling \"It's not like I got this job to impress HER, I mean she's rich, just because it would be a really romantic gesture to ask her out and pay for everything rather than split the bill like we normally do... she might find that sweet... wonder if she'd kiss me...\" He began to whisper. Danny choked nervously, was he saying that out loud!? Danny looked around wildly to make sure no one heard him, he sighed with relief when he saw no one was close enough and rested his back against the counter to clam himself down. Suddenly a voice from behind him shook him not only back to reality but also scared him half to death, it was Sam herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Danny!\" She said as cheerfully as she would get, the happy sweet girl voice not really her thing but she managed one every now and then when speaking to Danny. \"How's the first day going so far? Make any big mistakes yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, heh, hey Sam. M-mistakes? What makes you think I'm messing up?\" Danny worried getting slightly defensive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa calm down Danny\" Sam cautioned him \"I was only kidding, I'm sure you're doing fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, kidding... heh heh\" he nervously laughed \"Sorry first day jitters you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Danny looked at each other quietly for several moments before Sam cut into the awkward stare<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she asked him quizzically<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what?\" Danny asked suddenly worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well.... aren't you going to take my order?\" Sam asked him with a sarcastic tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! uh sorry... you're making me nervous\" Danny said with a sigh as Sam shot him a questionable look \"Er, I mean not you making me nervous, but just the situation, you're my first real customer, the boss is watching and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, say no more, lets just pretend you gave me the stupid Nasty Burger greeting your corporate puppet masters force on you, I didn't want to hear you reciting that stupid line anyway, you'd sound like a tool.\" Sam joked \"Ok I'll have...\" Sam began scanning the menu \"3 nasty burger cheese burgers, 2 orders of fries and a large chocolate milkshake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok 'miss' coming right up\" Danny announced trying to sound professional as he hopelessly hunted for the cheeseburger button on the reregister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny... you taking me seriously?\" Sam laughed \"You must be freaking out about this job, you know I'm a Vegetarian, well technically a Vegan... but Nasty burger's options are limited and I can live with eating a vegetarian's lunch, after all I couldn't see you if I was going to be picky about your menu's options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right\" Danny chuckled, Sam's joke wasn't helping, his palms were dripping with sweat and his knees were beginning to shake, he was sure his boss was behind him watching him mess up. \"Um, we have a new veggie burger you know, tofu and everything you guys like\" Danny tried to continue, picking up a paper stand up ad for the burger off the counter and reading the quotes as if Sam couldn't \"Try out new Veggie burger! Now even you meat hating tree huggers can have some nasty in you burg-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam yanked the ad from his hand before he could finish and threw it behind her, Danny leaned on the cash register trying to grab the ad before it was thrown out of his reach, he pushed several buttons. \"No Danny I don't want one of those cheap attempts to profit off the green crowd. Besides those things contain very little tofu, they are mostly fatty grease and processed Fat to simulate the beef taste, they are worse than the real burgers. Look just give me a large salad and a small order of fries\" Sam said trying to make things simple for Danny. \"And no receipt, I don't want to kill trees so I can have a paper reminder of what I ate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok\" Danny sweated hunting keys again. He had trouble remembering what all the abbreviations on the keys meant, before he was done Danny had entered 2 large orders of fries and a bowl of ice cream covered in cookie bits. And covered in chocolate in addition to the other buttons he had hit earlier. Danny looked at the total, 12.35 \"that can't be right\" he thought, Danny assumed the register was messing up and added up the order of a larger salad and a small fry in his head. \"That will be 4.24, your order is number 97a\" Danny said at last and began to wait for the fry cook to slide the tray through with her order on it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny tapped his fingers on the counter nervously smiling at Sam who seemed to be finding the whole situation down right comical poking fun at Danny a few times while the waited by telling him his hat was on backwards or his name tag was upside down, every time Danny freaked out and checked she'd burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order 97a up!\" came a voice from behind the wall of equipment and a tray covered in far more food than they were expecting slid through the small opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny\" Sam exclaimed \"just what did you order me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I must have hit the wrong buttons\" Danny nervously told her as he moved the tray to the counter so they could inspect the order. \"I wasn't sure what buttons were which but I know I didn't hit this many!\" Danny tried to explain and checked the receipt on the tray to make sure it was the same order number, to his dismay it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny you ordered me 2 of these greasy veggie burgers?! With cheese? 2 orders of large fries? An apple pie? A chocolate fudge sundae with cookie bits? Danny do you want me to spit on my vegan ideals and ruin my diet?! Sam scolded him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know how...\" Danny started before he heard something that made his blood run cold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager clear his throat and stepped in behind Danny, \"Is there a problem here...?\" He asked glaring down at Danny. \"Did you mess this young lady's order up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I mean I...\" Danny stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he did not sir\" Sam dove into the conversation and saved Danny \"I was just asking him to help me check the order, to make sure it was right, but he forgot my... um my...\" Sam searched for a reason she'd be yelling at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her milkshake!\" Danny jumped back in \"She wanted a big Milkshake and I forgot to prepare one for her! Sorry Sir and Ma'am, its my first day you know...\" He said looking sheepish<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Sam said shooting Danny a dirty look before the manager turned back to her \"My... milkshake... a big... chocolatey.... calorie filled.... milk... shake. I was yelling because I mistook his inexperience as an attempt to cheat me out of my full order, I am over sensitive about that stuff...\" She finished with a nervous smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well... my apologies miss\" the manager said and fetched her the milkshake quickly \"But if you'll excuse me... I'll be watching to make sure you eat all of it, I'd hate to find out this young man couldn't even handle his first order and needed a customer to cover for him\" The manager said menacingly and glaring down at Danny again who practically melted in his shoes from the stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked to Danny as well for help about what she was going to do with all this food. Danny however was sweating bullets as the manager checked Danny's uniform and gave him a stern reminder on the \"Nasty Burger image\". Sam took her tray and looked at the mountain of food, She wondered if Danny could take a break soon and help her eat some of it, but just as the manager took his leave a crowd of customers pushed past her and the lunch rush began, Danny was to busy to talk to. Sam simply found a seat and tried to manage to eat her feast of fattening foods knowing the manager could be watching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt DID felt like someone was watching...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam stared at the greasy burger in her hands, it was even colored to look like a real burger. Sam's stomach churned thinking about the animals that died so their fat could be used to flavor a tofu burger. Sam looked towards the counter again to check if the manager really was watching. No one but Danny was back there, maybe she could just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sam began to place the burger back in the tray to throw this garbage where it belonged when something caught her eye. Looking up Sam could see a camera inside one of the dark domes hanging from the ceiling meant to hide which way the camera was facing. The light was catching it just right, Sam could see one of the cameras meant to watch the side door was turning to face her, no doubt the manager was keeping an eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for you Danny...\" Sam grimaced and took a bite out of one of the burgers. The juices melted in her mouth, Sam winced her eyes as she chewed but it was only because she was eating something she swore she never would, in reality the burger tasted amazing. Sam was torn she didn't know what she hated more, the fact she was eating meat by products, or the fact they tasted so great...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is wrong, this cow wasn't born so it could die and be my meal!\" Sam tried to reason herself. However the burger's taste beckoned her, no matter what reason she gave to say no, the burger would just say yes. Sam closed her eyes and shoved the burger in taking a larger bite. Sam moaned softly and leaned her head back feeling the amazing sensation from having something so flavorful on her taste buds. Sam just turned off her consciousness to end the nagging battle over the morality of meat eating and slipped into a trance just taking a bite and savoring every bit of the taste. Soon she had finished the burger and couldn't get the second one open fast enough, Sam was acting on impulse trying not to think about what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street a young woman dressed like a goth punk and bright blue hair done up in a pony tail was watching Sam with increasing interest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well well what a little piggy you are Samantha Manson\" Ember said watching Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing just far enough away from the Nasty Burger that Danny's ghost sense didn't pick her up, she didn't want him to interfere until her plan was in full motion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ember, can you like, place that song again?\" Asked a spacey eyed teen behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber turned to face five teens dressed in similar gothic or punk like attire. There was four of them were guys and two were girls, and all had blank doll like eyes looking back at her but not seeming to focus on anything in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course my pet\" Ember smiled \"I've followed that ghost boy long enough to learn all I need to know about him and his friends, and what's more his dear little girlfriend has given me a delicious ideas...\" Ember began to laugh manically and flipped the guitar off her back around into her hands. Ember started walking down the street plucking the strings. Ember's mindless toys followed her happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This song is so.... awesome\" one of the boys said dreamily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Added one of the girls also detached from reality<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"come along my little ones\" Ember cooed \"It's time I prepare you to keep that mettlesome ghost boy busy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam leaned back in her booth seat and groaned. She has plowed through the entire meal with wreakless abandon. What had begun as a plot to keep from facing herself for eating meat had lead Sam to just trance herself for the full feast. Sam was afraid to face herself for eating the burgers, because it went against her ideals, because it was wrong, because she liked it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I thinking...\" Sam moaned. She didn't know what made her think as long as she was shoving food in her mouth then she'd be free from the moral responsibilities for her actions. \"Karma is going to get me for this I know it...\" Sam cried clutching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam!\" Danny happily greeted her sitting across from her \"I think the manager is mad at me...\" Danny told her placing a tray with two hamburgers and large order of fries \"I got though most of the lunch rush without messing up to much but I started getting nervous when he came to watch me and... I kinda messed up a big order...\" Danny sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam groaned and clutched her gut as she tried to sit up a little to face Danny better, luckily Danny was busy unwrapping his burger and didn't see the trouble she was having<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So *urp* what happened Danny?\" Sam asked trying to get her mind away from the meat issue in the back of her mind. However Sam couldn't stop looking at the second burger, she was stuffed full unable to eat another bite, but that burger looked so good. Sam's mouth waters and her stomach began to hurt slightly as it strained to stretch and make room for one more as her appetite grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... you know... He started looking over my shoulder and I got nervous. I ordered the customer 2 burgers to many and an extra order of fries... He got upset and told me to just go take a break and let him finish the rush. He gave me the extra burgers and fries to eat for my lunch but I think he's deducting them from my paycheck, if this keeps up I'll end up owing HIM money by pay day...\" Danny explained upset \"This can't be good for my performance review...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam barely focused on what Danny said, she was disgusted with herself for it but all she could think about was trying that burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you managed to trash that food without the manager seeing huh?\" Danny tried to smile looking for a new subject and took notice of Sam's empty tray \"Sorry for making you cover for me. Do you want this?\" Danny offered meaning the fries, Sam however only heard what she wanted and assumed her meant the burger, without even hesitating she agreed and snatched up the double cheese burger with bacon and tore off the wrapper greedily licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam no that's meat!\" Danny called out to late to stop Sam from taking a big juicy bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sam said with a mouthful of meat. She quickly swallowed the mouthful and placed the burger back on the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam you ate meat!\" Danny was shocked \"I'm sorry I should have warned you sooner these aren't tofu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" Sam stammered quickly getting up \"it's o-ok, I should go now, karma and stuff you know? gotta cleanse my soul of this and stuff!\" Sam lied and hurried out the door leaving Danny sitting stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rushed town the sidewalk walking quickly clutching her stuffed belly as she did. The taste of that meat haunted her mind. Her taste buds kept replaying the taste over and over taunting her. Sam didn't know what to think...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Just stand still and let them enter your bodies my pretty little puppets\" Ember sighed pre-occupied with the rhythm she was playing on her guitar. The hypnotized teens stood motionless with empty smiles on their faces in the center of the abandoned warehouse Ember had led them to. Ember was propped up on near by crate playing a dark foreboding melody on her guitar as the shadows in the corners of the warehouse seemed to grow and inch towards the teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now is the dark age, here is the shadows\" Ember methodically sang \"Arise young ethereals, embrace the darkness\" Ember stood and began to play faster \"These are your bodies these are your hosts, enter them now! Bind to their ghosts!\" Ember slammed her fist across her guitar and the shadows exploded from their places around the room and engulfed the teens standing idly in the center of the room. Ember took a step back and frowned upon the swirling black mass waiting for it to subside. Slowly the darkness began to ebb away as the teens now stood with dark grins on their faces. Their eyes were black with a dark haze arising from them and the teen's seemed to project a haunting shadow aura around their bodies. Ember placed her hand on her hip and looked at them with an unimpressed stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for giving us these new forms little she ghost\" One of the dark beings spoke his words seeming to slip in and out of phase with existence in a dark rhythm \"Since you gave us new life we will serve you for as long as you require\". The former teens all cackled in agreement and looked around at the world they now inhabited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stow it you little shadow twerp\" Ember spat unhappily \"First off I don't like your kind, I'm not a nice girl but I'm not  pure evil like you. Frankly if I hadn't found these kids wasting their life on drugs and worthless existence I'd have never taken them to use in this ritual. Second I only summoned you things because I need something strong enough to keep a certain dweeb ghost busy while I wreak havoc on his life, after that I'm putting you right back in the shadows where you belong!\" Ember declared with a wave of her arm and looked at the dark eyes of the teens with a stern glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark being all let out a soft chuckle as if they didn't care. \"We will see little ghost youngling, we will see\" One of the dark forms spoke. \"We have lived countless millennia and served many different masters, unlike your pitiful time as a ethereal being which is less than a few years we have the experience of the ages, We'll outlast you just like all the others... Who knows? Maybe we'll even convert you into one of us\" Another one chimed in and ran his finger under the chin of one of the girls to emphasize Ember wouldn't be the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Ember snorted and narrowed her eye's \"We'll see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny pushed the door into the customer dinning area open with his backside and pulled a mop and bucket through. The Nasty Burger was getting ready to close for the night and not being experienced enough to clean the  cookware or trusted enough yet to remove and count the cash from the registers his job was to mob the floors and clean the restrooms. Danny grunted as he lifted the bucket over the threshold of the doorway to keep it from tipping over and put it back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid manager\" Danny mumbled \"Sam could have needed help, I still had 20 minuets left in my break why did he have to yell at me and embarrass me like that in from of the entire lunch crowd..\" Danny murmured still angry over the incident earlier when he tried to follow after Sam and the manager had to chase him down and pull him back into the restaurant. \"Geez, like I was really trying to escape or something\" Danny gritted his teeth both mad as his boss and worried about Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a real tool\" Someone behind him said in a weird tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he... huh?\" Danny almost responded but turned to the source of the voice and saw a young man enveloped in a dark glow standing behind him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" the teen spoke before shoving Danny backwards in a pale flash sending Danny flying across the restaurant slamming him into several tables before hitting the wall hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Who are you?!\" Danny demanded shaking a broken chair off his back and standing only to see the spot where the attacker had stood was now empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" The voice came again but this time from his left \"I'm just a shadow\" The being explained and gave Danny a firm upper cut to the side of his jaw before Danny could turn to face him. Danny flew up and away from the creature into the ceiling tiles and got hung up on a steel support rafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghosts?\" Danny grunted trying to regain his balance as he hung awkwardly upside down \"But my ghost sense..\" Danny tried to wonder when the dark form attacked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ghost sense doesn't do jack when the thing attacking you is made of shadows and not some pathetic ghost!\" The being shrieked before grabbing Danny by the collar  and throwing him down into the floor again. Floor tiles flew up and dust erupted from the impact as the shadow laughed manically. However the dark form's laugher was cut short as a flash of light burst from the dust and Danny flew up in his ghost form catching the shadow off guard and plowed into him with his right fist throwing the shadow form back onto the floor and bounced several times before rolling to a stop at the feet of a second shadow form, The first shadow being just wheezed and tried to stand back up. Danny glanced to the counter to make sure no one has seen him go into the floor and a phantom come out, luckily there was no one but Danny didn't remember hearing anyone scream and terror before running away, Before Danny could wonder anymore about it the second form spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's true, you really do have ghost powers\" He said and turned to his companion \"And you Ru'gol, How foolish you were to openly attack him like that, you know our powers will take some time to fully return to us, now you've gone and exhausted yourself without barely damaging him.\" The shadow looked back to Danny with an stare of indifference \"I'm sure that little vixen summoned us with this in mind, that we run ourselfs out fighting him so that she won't have to deal with him. I'd rather not lose to a ghost, and I'd really hate to be beaten by some half-ling who's still part human...\" The shadow growled some malice entering his voice. Meanwhile his companion Ru'gol slumped on the floor and his dark twisting form subsided to reveal the human body her was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these guys...\" Danny gasped seeing the shadow turn into a human before blocking a shadow claw swung at him from his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=======================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was standing in line at a Greasy Greg's Hamburgers, lost in her own hunger. Sam had wandered around the town for hours trying to push the thought of meat out of her head. She didn't dare go home where her parents had tried to get her to try a normal meal for years and at the moment she was afraid they may just succeed. Sam had been forcing herself to steer away from many restaurants as the smells from them beckoned to her. However after hours of licking the air dreaming of that meat taste she finally broke down while passing Greasy Greg's when the smell of burgers being char broiled assaulted her senses and pulled her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was to lost in the cravings to notice the girl behind the counter jump slightly as Sam stepped up and a soft blue glow filled the cashier's eyes. Sam scanned the menu not noticing the odd grin the cashier suddenly looked at her with, to Sam's dismay, everything looked amazingly good tonight, especially the hamburgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I'll have...\" Sam stammered wanting a burger so badly she could jump the counter and grab one off the grill \"Oh... I want...\" Sam indecisively moaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi and welcome to Greasy Greg's Hun! Home of the Barn Lard Burger!\" The overly perky cashier bubbled as if excited to wait on Sam. \"You're our 100th customer of the night, you get a free meal!\" The girl exclaimed getting a confused look from the cashier beside her. \"Just have a seat and I'll bring you your meal!\" She smiled broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh ok...\" Sam trailed off still drooling over the smell of beef cooking. Sam moved for her table but kept looking past the girl at the fry cook flipping burgers. Sam sat down but felt lost, she wanted her food now, what was this 100th customer stuff and how long before she got something to eat? Sam squirmed in her seat for what felt like an eternity but was only a minute The girl came out with a tray loaded with food and placed it before Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was feeling the shock of reality return to her as she looked at the pile of food before her. 5 or 6 thick greasy hamburgers loaded with condiments, several cartons of fries pile ontop one another, a bucket of fried chicken to the side and a very large bowl of ice cream. Sam's jaw slacked as if to say no way but her eyes were filled with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber exited the cashier girl and crept behind Sam in her intangible form to prevent being seen. The poor cashier girl looked confused and wondered how she got there. She looked to Sam for an answer but Sam's world seemed to revolve around the food before her and the girl was left to find her own answer which came from her manager yelling angrily to get her butt back behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's mind was in war between hunger and reality and poor Sam was stuck in the middle. Ember giggled at the sight and moved in next to Sam's ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat...\" She spoke softer than the wind so that Same couldn't tell the difference between another voice or her own thoughts \"Eat it...\" Ember spoke again. Sam's eyes weakened and she inched forward still holding herself back, her mouth flooded with drool and it built up behind her lower lip cresting over the top just barely holding back. \"It's soooo good\" Ember moaned into Sam's ear causing Sam to slip forward more to within less than a foot of her gluttonous feast, Sam's drool bulged forward and threatened to dribble down her chin and onto the table. Sam's eyes were dead set on the greasy burger on the top of the pile dripping with Lard and Ketchup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smiled and phased her head into Sam's, She didn't posses Sam's mind but she did sync up with it enough to place her mouth where Sam's was and make Same lick her lips influencing Sam to taste a burst of flavor from nowhere when she did. Sam's will shattered in a blind rush and Sam nearly slammed her head into the pile of food tearing away from Ember's hold and cramming the burger into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was shoving the burger against her teeth as hard as she could, she didn't even pull it away she only pushed more in as she chewed what she had already eaten. Sam's eyes lost all focus and seemed to fade out as her body went into auto pilot shoving the food into her mouth as fast as it could as Sam gave up all modesty and made a spectical of herself in the restaurant, Sam moaned in pleasure at the tastes of it all and sounded like she was having an orgasm from the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/3126/samstory1zs6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/3126/...</a> ))<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber smiled wickedly at the sight, she almost wished she hadn't pushed Sam into it just to see how long the little piggy could have lasted on her own. Sam moaned in delight as she shoved the last bit of the burger into her mouth as hard as she could making her cheeks puff out into two taunt spheres on either side of her mouth and chewed as fast as she could as she lined up two hand fulls of fries behind it. Ember could only imagine what thoughts were going through Sam's mind as she ate. Sam was acting like a wild animal starving for food. Ember decided to test her theory out and ghosted into Sam's body to watch the sight from a closer view as well as hear Sam's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber slipped into Sam's body and was assaulted by raw hunger. There was no thoughts to listen to and there was no resisting Sam's movements for more food. An instinctive urge to eat dominated Sam's being and bombarded Ember's mind as Sam's sole purpose in life seemed to be to eat this meal and Ember's spirit was having a hard time staying separate form Sam's wild and untamed urges. Sam just Grabbed the next Burger and treated both herself and Ember to the greatest tasting hamburger either of them had ever had.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny turned around to see Sam and Tucker standing there, holding hands. They had started to date almost two months ago after Danny had turned Sam down when she had asked him out. Originally Danny had just thought that Sam had gone to Tucker on the rebound, but since they were still going strong and their relationship just seemed to be getting stronger, that maybe Sam really did care a lot for Tucker. That was fine with him. He liked Sam as a friend and all, but he just couldn't date her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardy-har-har Tuck.\" Danny replied since Tucker had been the one to make the comment. Tucker grinned and Sam elbowed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be nice Tucker.\" she growled. Tucker rubbed his ribs where she had elbowed him, not apologizing but flashing Danny an apologetic grin. Danny just grinned back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you two up to?\" Danny asked, feeling a little guilty knowing that he had been blowing them off a bit for the past week because he was working so much and actually spending a lot of his free time eating. His appetite had really improved since he had started to work at Nasty Burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're on our way to the movies to go watch that new movie that just came out.\" Tucker replied. Sam grinned viciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screaming Souls: The Rise of the Reaper.\" Sam cackled evilly, imitating the commercial. Tucker shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that!\" he whined. Danny laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are going to go see a horror movie about ghosts? Don't you get enough of me fighting them?\" he asked. Sam and Tucker grinned at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really anymore. Ever since your parents shut down the portal, you've been fighting ghosts less and less.\" Sam pointed out. Tucker nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man. Either that or you just stopped calling us. I mean, you haven't called us in over a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny blinked in surprised and thought back to the last time he had fought any ghosts. The last time he had fought a ghost was three days before he started his job at Nasty Burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I hadn't realized how long it's been since I fought any ghosts.\" he laughed, scratching the back of his head. Suddenly his watched beeped, making him jump a little. \"Oh, sorry guys but I gotta go. I got to go deposit my check in the bank before it closes then I gotta get back to work.\" he explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still working on a Saturday?\" Sam asked, blinking in surprise. \"I thought you only had to work a couple hours during the weekdays.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny grinned. \"One of the other guys quit so they have me working weekdays from 4 to 10, which is closing now, by the way, and on weekends I work from 3 to closing. They also gave me a raise since I'm working extra hours too.\" he explained proudly. Tucker whistled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow man. I'm still just working four hours at the computer store stocking the shelves.\" Sam kissed him on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My working man.\" Tucker blushed. Both he and Danny knew that Sam would never have to work a day of her life since her family was so rich, but she still supported Tucker and Danny in getting jobs and had even applied a couple of places, but she never got calls back or never made it through the interview because of how she dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I best be going. See you guys!\" Danny said, starting to jog towards the bank. Sam and Tucker waved as well, then continued walking towards the movie theater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny hadn't even jogged halfway down the block before he started to get winded. Sweat started to form on his brow and once he was out of sight of Tucker and Sam, he stopped, bending down with his hands on his knees, catching his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Doy! Why am I running?' Danny smacked his head when he remembered that he had ghost powers. He went and ducked behind a dumpster, turning ghost. He then blinked in surprise as he looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still skinny as Danny Phantom! Now that was strange! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking away his shock, he turned invisible and began to fly quickly to the bank. When he got there, he ducked behind some bushes and then walked inside to deposit his check. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny groaned as he finished off another burger, making notes on how different it had tasted from the last one he had eaten only an hour prior. They had started bringing him different kinds of burgers throughout the hour, repeating a different variation of each burger when the new hour hit. In reality, rather than eating the one burger an hour that he had started out with, he was now eating 5 burgers an hour, which meant that on weekdays he ate 30 burgers a day, and on weekends he ate 35 burgers a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[The grilled variation with honey bbq sauce tastes better than the grilled variation with soy sauce, but not as good as the grilled variation with seasoning and regular bbq sauce.] Danny wrote down in the log book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back he sighed once more, reaching over to grab his Mega-Glug cup of soda pop. He drank the last fourth of it before setting the container back down. He then began to rub his swollen belly, a satisfied smile on his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved this. Whoever's idea it was to create a taste tester job should be given the Nobel prize, Danny decided. After all, it was because of that person that this was all happening to him, and he was loving it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Danny,\" a voice came from the door of his office. Danny blushed, having been caught rubbing his belly and relaxing. He sat back up straight and saw that it was his boss standing in the doorway. Blushing even more, Danny stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robert. What's up?\" he asked, fighting down his embarrassment. Robert walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit back down, Danny. I just want to talk with you.\" he said, shutting the door behind him. Danny sat down, feeling nervous. What did he want to talk about? And why was he closing the door? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" Danny said, moving his Mega-Glug cup a little further out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny, do you know why Andrew quit?\" Robert asked as he came over and sat down. Danny remembered that Andrew had been the other taste tester but had left two weeks after he had started. He and Andrew had never met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no. What does his quitting have anything to do with this?\" Danny asked. Robert sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew quit because of all the weight he gained. He signed a form, the same form you signed, saying that any weight gains or health problems caused by weight gain from the job is not our fault. Andrew is now attempting to sue us. I just wanted to talk to you about your weight gain that I've noticed-\" Robert began. Danny smiled and laughed, interrupting Robert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my weight gain is very much wanted, I assure you. I have no problem with gaining weight.\" Danny assured him. Robert blinked in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he asked. Danny nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean, well, I wanted to get bigger because, you know, I get picked on at school a lot, and I figured, hey, if I get bigger then they can't pick on me so much, you know?\" Danny informed him in a jumbled, embarrassed manner. Robert laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was the same for me back when I was in high school. I got picked on a lot so I started gaining a lot of weight and bulking up so they couldn't pick on me. I understand how it is.\" Robert explained. Danny blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, that explains why his arms are huge and as hard as rocks while his stomach's a little pudgy.' Danny thought to himself. Robert was in his late twenties, about 28, and he enjoyed working at Nasty Burger. He was a nice guy with good looks, someone who could easily land a date with a pretty girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't have a problem with gaining weight?\" Robert asked just to make sure. Danny shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I don't have a problem with gaining weight. Bring it on!\" he joked, laughing. Robert laughed as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I was just checking.\" There was a knock at the door. \"Oh, looks like your next burger's here.\" Robert said, standing up. \"Speaking of burgers, I was now wondering if you would like to now be fed 20 more burgers in an hour. If you do, i will pay you 100 dollars extra and you will have on weekdays you would eat 150 burgers and on weekends you would eat 175 burgers.\" Danny immediately said \"I would love to. I really don't care about how much weight i gain and plus now i am hungry all the time. Keep on stuffing me up! I need it for school!\" Danny said. \"Good,\" the manager said. Then He looked at Danny's Mega-Glug cup that was empty and chuckled, picking it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to fill this up for you since I'm up?\" he asked. Danny grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'd me great.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha drinkin'?\" Robert asked, heading towards the door, letting Carol, one of the girls on grill duty today, in with the next burger that Danny had to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Mountain Dew. Might as well change things up a bit.\" Danny replied, taking the burger from Carol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then.\" Robert said, disappearing through the door. Danny then turned to Carol, who was grinning at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This burger has wasabi and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stretched as he walked out of Nasty Burger, saying goodbye to the remaining other three employees who were stuck with closing. He was so glad that his job didn't entail closing duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put his arms down, Danny noticed that his stomach was so swollen that his shirt was resting on the top of his stomach. He grinned, rubbing his swollen belly. It then gave a rather loud rumble, shocking and amusing Danny at the same time. He loved the fact that he could eat more and more now. He didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright baby, I'll get you some food.\" Danny murmured to his growling stomach, caressing it like a pregnant woman would rub her belly. \"Alright, where's open?\" Danny thought for a minute then remembered that the pizza parlor was still upon for an hour after Nasty Burger closed. The bad part was that the pizza parlor was on the other side of town. How would he make-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghost powers! Duh!\" Danny said, grinning again. Making sure that no one was around to see, he went ghost and took off zooming for the pizza parlor. When he landed behind the pizza parlor, he marveled once again at how thin he was in his ghost form. Before he had started his job at Nasty Burger, his ghost form and his human form had been the same weight. It was a little shocking to see just how much weight he had gained in just a month from taste testing burgers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then turned back into his human form, he pulled his shirt as far as he could over his stomach before walking in. Looking up at the ordering board, his stomach began to growl incessantly, making it hard for him to concentrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" the girl behind the counter asked. Danny sighed before smiling at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd like five large pizzas with sausage and olives. To take home.\" he informed her. She put down his order. He paid her as she told him the estimated time it would take for them to finish his order, so shrugging, he went over to one of the boots to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored, Danny started to look around. He then noticed Dash and Paulina walking past the pizza parlor. Paulina was laughing at something, most likely something that Dash had said, and Dash was grinning like he had just scored a touch down or something. Danny sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had used to wish that Paulina would look at him and laugh like that at things he said, but last year, after his 16th birthday, Danny had finally realized just how much of an airhead she really was. It had taken about six months for his crush to die after he realized just how shallow and uninteresting she really was. He had just been so caught up in her beauty he hadn't seen the rest of the package. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your pizzas, sir.\" a voice chirped next to him. He jumped and turned to see the girl who had taken his order standing next to him with all five of his pizzas in their boxes. He smiled as he took them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" he told her, standing up. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome sir. Enjoy your pizzas.\" She glanced down at his stomach before meeting his eyes again, giving him a knowing smile. Blinking in surprise, Danny watched as she turned around and returned behind the counter, from where she winked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked at him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, feeling confused, Danny turned and left the pizza parlor, ducking behind the parlor once more before going ghost and flying home with all five of his pizzas. Once he got him, by flying in through his open window, Danny sat on his bed and began to plow through the pizzas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first one, Danny groaned and unbuttoned and unzipped his pants. His stomach gushed forwards and plopped down, swollen and heavy with food. Rubbing his stomach a bit, Danny began on his second pizza, caressing his stomach between each slice as it grew larger and tauter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the third pizza, Danny groaned and took off his shirt, feeling like it was getting too tight. His man boob jiggled with each breath he heaved, a little flushed and out of breath from his vigorous eating. He then pulled off his pants, feeling better as the restricting denim was finally removed. He then began to finish off the last two boxes in just his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished the last pizza, barely though because he felt so full, Danny realized just how thirsty he was. He debated about whether or not he should pull on a pair of pajama pants or not, before deciding not to. It was like anyone else was home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz was off at college, having a blast. Ever since she had left, their parents had started to spend more and more time down in the basement working on their inventions. They had closed off the portal, concentrating more on inventions on how to capture and imprison ghosts rather than kill. They had said that the portal wasn't something that they had wanted to concentrate on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen about four months ago, about four months after Jazz had gone off to college, they had started getting letters requesting them to come speak at science conventions and such. They were gone all the time, and during the rare time when they were home, they were always down in the basement. Danny rarely ever saw them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, they were away at another convention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Danny padded downstairs in just his socks and boxers, his large belly and man boobs jiggling with every step he took. He made his way to the kitchen and got into the fridge. He dug around before he found a two liter of pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom always made sure that there was food in the house for him, going so far as to have this delivery service stock the kitchen every week. His parents didn't even know that he had a job at Nasty Burger, so they were unaware of what he did with most of his spare time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny opened the two liter and began to chug it then and there with the fridge still open. He drank greedily, ignoring as some rivulets managed to escape and make their way down his cheeks, man boobs and swollen belly. He kept drinking until the plastic bottle was empty. Then he drank two more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then let out a tremendous belch, making his belly jiggle.  Chuckling, Danny closed the fridge and threw away the bottles before making his way back upstairs, his belly larger and a loud sloshing could be heard as he walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning as he walked into his room, Danny shoved thepizza boxes onto the floor before crashing on his bed and going to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny woke a couple of hours later to the phone ringing. Groaning and muttering dark curses, Danny pulled himself, quit reluctantly, out of bed and stumbled down the hall to where the phone was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Danny managed to growl, swiping a hand over his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi honey!\" a cheerful female voice came over the phone. His brow furrowed as it took his tired mind a couple of minutes to recognize the voice of his mother's voice. \"Danny honey, are you still there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Mom, do you know what time it is?\" Danny demanded with another grumpy, sleep filled growl. He leaned against the wall, sliding down it until he was sitting on the phone, the phone still pressed firmly against his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do sweety! It's four in the afternoon!\" Maddie chirped in reply. \"Are you feeling well? You sound kind of funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny blinked as he peered at the clock down the hall, somehow managing to read that it was two in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, it's two in the morning here at home. You woke me up.\" Danny mumbled, considering going back to bed when his stomach suddenly gave off a fierce rumble. That surprised Danny and he blinked down at his stomach that was still quite swollen from his dinner earlier. He was hungry so soon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny? Are you still there?\" Maddie demanded, her tone sounding worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, what? Oh, yeah mom, I'm still here. Sorry, I think I just dozed off a little there.\" Danny replied sheepishly, standing up, huffing with the exertion of hauling his heavy frame from up off of the floor. He then began to make his way down the hall towards the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny, the reason why I'm calling is to tell you that your father and I won't be able to return home for the next month, maybe two. We were asked to help with a study here in Tokyo, and well, your father was just so excited and the information that could result from this could open an entirely new field of study for ghosts. But to be quite honest, I don't think it'll be more than a month or two.\" Maddie explained hurriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny had just entered the kitchen and flicked on the lights, groaning as the lights burned his retina's. He rubbed his eyes then peered at the calendar. He blinked a couple of times, reading the day's date. April 17th. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you guys are going to miss-\" Danny began before all of a sudden his dad's voice came blaring over the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Dan-o! Your mother and I are still going to keep sending you plenty of money. In fact, your mother just two days ago opened up a bank account just for you and we'll deposit a weekly allowance in there for you to go do things with Sam and Tuck, buy new clothes, pay the bills, and all that junk. Gotta go, Dan-o! Our rides here!\" Jack boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We love you sweety. Stay safe and do well in school! Bye!\" came Maddie's voice before the line went dead. A little stunned, Danny turned off the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom and dad were going to miss his graduation. And all because of their ghost obsession! Why did his life always take a back seat to their ghost obsession? Jazz's life never had been forced to be put on hold by their paranormal jobs! It wasn't fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then chucked the cordless phone, ignoring the load crash as it hit the wall and shattered. His stomach gave another angry gurgle, as if agreeing with him that his parents were being unjust and that they should deal with the anger and the hurt by consuming large quantities of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe them!\" Danny seethed as he went about digging in the fridge, pulling out a six pack of pop, sandwich ingredients and then went and started to make him some sandwiches, using up two loaves of bread in order to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of his sandwiches were made, he stood there at the counter, looking back on all the injustices that he felt that his parents had ever inflicted upon him. He was so caught up in his memories that when he went to reach for another sandwich, he discovered that he had already eaten them all and that he had also finished off the entire six pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hungry and angry, Danny pulled a couple of frozen pizzas from the freezer and popped one in the over. He then dug around the fridge until he came up with a gallon of orange juice. He then dug around in the cupboards, pulling out bags of chips, cookies, snack packs, puddings, and cans of ready to go pasta and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a couple bowls and a can opener. He opened up all the cans of raviolis, beef stroganoff, spaghetti-ohs, meat noodles, and spaghetti. He poured each can into the bowls and then placed them in the microwave, not caring enough to look at how long that should actually be in the microwave. He then started on the bags of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I'm their son! Don't they care about me at all? Really, what kind of parents miss their kid's graduation?\" he demanded, angrily pulling the safety seal on the orange juice before quickly twisting off the cap and bringing the mouth of the jug to his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began to chug it, ignoring the fact that two streams of orange juice was leaking from the corners of his mouth, leaving down his cheeks and neck, down his fleshy chest and ample belly, down his belly and then soaking into his boxers. He listened to the soft 'glug-glug-glug' as he gulped down the rushing orange liquid before he finally felt the urge to burp. He set the container back down, wiping his mouth with his arm, letting out a tremendous belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, rubbing his sloshing stomach before his anger towards his parents returned. He then grabbed the bag of chips that he had been eating out of and began to crunch them furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went to Jazz's graduation! Do they just not want to come to mine just because I'm not valedictorian? Or is it because they know that I'm a failure? A screw up?\" he whispered the last part, depression washing over him. He then noticed that he was out of chips. He wiped his greasy hand off on his boxers before grabbing some of the pudding packs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault that I'm not smart like Jazz. I don't know if anyone can be as smart as Jazz!\" Danny cried, cramming a spoonful of chocolate pudding into his mouth. \"Why do mom and dad love Jazz and not me?\" Danny demanded sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to eat his pudding cups in silence, thinking back to all the things that his parents had ever done for Jazz. Attending her school plays, her recitals when she was in ballet before she quit when she was ten. They had gone to her elementary school graduation, her middle school graduation and her high school graduation. They had even driven her to college despite the fact that her college had offered to send her airline tickets and she could have her belongings sent to her. His parents had done a lot more things for Jazz than they had ever done for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the time Jazz had stopped eating for a week, stressing over her paper, his parents had noticed and forced her to stop, eat and took her to see a psychologist for a little while. They hadn't even noticed how he was stealing their ghost hunting tools and how Danny Phantom appeared and used them to defeat his ghostly opponents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate my parents.\" Danny muttered angrily. He then went about eating the rest of everything that he had pulled out, cooking all of the pizzas and eating them as well, drinking all of the orange juice in the fridge, the gallon of milk, and then some kool-aid mix that he had found and used to make kool-aid with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, Danny just left everything in the sink before turning and returning upstairs to bed, ignoring the fact that it was now 6 in the morning. His stomach hurt from all the food he had eaten and he was still feeling angry and depressed about his parents and their obvious neglect of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny grimaced, dodging beam after beam of spectral energy fired by his ghostly opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine his surprise when, at Nasty Burger of all places, his ghost sense had began going off. It was only a few minutes later when the ghostly form of an obese, blond male, clad only in a soiled tank top, coupled with a bib, and shorts far, far too tight appeared, and with an ethereal fork grasped in each hand, began causing chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't run forever, you scrawny thing!\" the ghost, who had identified himself as the Glutton, shouted, his speed and accuracy belying his size as he stopped his assault momentarily to stuff a handful of onion rings into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny snorted. And this was supposed to have been a normal, family outing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the chaos of the rapidly becoming destroyed Nasty Burger, only his sister and parents remained among the clutter of upturned tables and chairs and abandoned food. His parents, unorganized as usual, were rummaging through his father's many pockets for one of their ghost-battling contraptions. His sister, in a surprising turn of events, sat boredly in the remnants of a booth, filing her nails. The other patrons, as any sane person would, had fled once the Glutton had began to rampage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I doubt that!\" Danny taunted, somersalting in midair to avoid another of the Glutton's attacks. Wincing, Danny noticed that this time, the Glutton had sent a brigade of flaming hamburger patties at him. Apparently, this ghost, like the Lunch Lady, could also manipulate food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could deal with that. That is, as so long as he wasn't able to form a 30 foot tall meat monster. Those, he might have trouble with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been lucky up to this point in time: He had avoided every attack sent at him so far. Strategy, as Sam would say, by gauging the enemie's strengths and weaknesses by observing their battle patterns. So far, he had been able to surmise several things: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The Glutton was, by no means, slow. For a ghost the size of a whale, he had the speed and reaction rates of an Omlypic sprinter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The Glutton's powers seemed food-oriented, much like the Lunch Lady's, although Danny was still unsure of any effects, if any, the Glutton's golden energy beams would have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. True to his name, the Glutton seemed to love food even in the afterlife. He would stop every few minutes during the battle to hastily swallow something or another - usually dripping with grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's eyes widened, a smirk coming to his lips as that last piece of information hit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. The Glutton was vulnerable whenever he paused to eat. So then, perhaps if the Glutton was tempted enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning in midair, Danny dodged another energy beam and quickly sped a confused Glutton, and into the somewhat smoldering kitchens of the Nasty Burger. Concentrating, he was then able to conjure up a ghostly whirlwind, hamburger patties, buns, and toppings all spinning in the wind from where they had been abandoned upon griddles and countertops. With a flick of his wrist, Danny combined all of the ingredients until he was left with a good three dozen hamburgers floating in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the Glutton, Danny smiled impishly to see that the gargantuan ghoulie had a glazed look on his face and was licking his blue lips hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking one of the burgers up, Danny began to tease his opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, these look really good, if I do say so myself...\" Danny called slowly, inhaling the scent of one of the burgers as he held it up to his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith abandon, Danny then tore into the burger, stuffing it into his mouth and swallowing it as quickly as he could - not only to avoid choking, but to make the burger seem incredibly delicious as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want one?\" Danny asked playfully, rubbing his stomach for emphasis. \"They're so good, I might eat them all up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that tore it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scream of hunger and rage, the Glutton lunged towards the cloud of hamburgers and began to devour them, stuffing them two at a time into his colossal mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Danny quickly whipped out the Fenton thermous. The Glutton had dropped all of his defenses. This fight was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, that was what Danny thought when an erratic blue light, and excruciating pain, suddenly enveloped him as well as the Glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny! Mom, Dad stop! What are you doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around as his vision began to fade to black, Danny saw that Jazz had abandoned her spot in the booth and was rushing toward her parents, the latter of which had fired a beam of sorts at him and the Glutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Jack, that's not the Fenton Ghost-B-Gone! That's the...the...what is that thing anyway?!\" Danny's mother, Maddie, exclaimed as she watched the Glutton and the \"ghost boy\" fall to the floor in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I could have sworn that this was the Fenton Spectorshooter...\" his father, Jack replied, as he scratched his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! You idiot! That's the Fenton...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's eyes close as his sister's voice slowly becomes eclipsed by darkness, pierced only by the Glutton's gasps as the titan of a ghost beside him deflates and disappeaers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny groaned, slowly opening his eyes, but quick to close them as they were inundated by light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis world consisted of, well, let's see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain, evil light, an evil beeping sound, pain, and...pain. Yes, that was a good summary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes again to find the light less agressive, Danny realized that he was on a table covered by a blanket. The offesive light, apparently, was coming from a lamp suspended directly over his head. And the beeping...sounded like the beeping the machinery in his parents' lab made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny? Danny, are you awake?\" a concerned voice asked from his left, and Danny turned to see his sister, a worried expression claiming her features as she rolled over to his position (She was sitting in a rolling chair, of course) from her former spot by a computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jazz? Jazz...what happened? I remember being at the Nasty Burger when Mom and Dad hit me with that thing and then the Glutton...\" Danny muttered, and then gasped as he realized that he wasn't in his phantom mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to Jazz urgently, she waved her hand in dismissal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry; Mom and Dad didn't see you change. After they hit you with that thing, I shouted that I saw a ghost go down into the Nasty Burger's basement, and they went running, like the methodical scientists they are.\" Jazz assured him with a roll of her eyes. \"They're probably still there. I did take the car home, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny smirked. Luckily for his parents, the Nasty Burger was only a few blocks away from his house. His parents would have a walk ahead of them, especially his father, but they would be home soon enough, when they were finished playing \"Ghost Hunter\" at least. His sister, for all of her nagging sometimes, he was actually happy had found out about his secret. It's saved him a lot of headaches with his parents on more than one occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I did lock the basement door just in case.\" Jazz said, rolling back over to the computer to begin typing on and eyeing the device critically. \"I can't have them coming in until I'm done testing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing me?\" Danny asked, and realized, with a sudden shiver, that his shirt had been pulled off and that several transistors had been attached to his chest, stomach, and arms. \"Jazz! What is this? What are you trying to do, turn me into Frankenghost?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz only her narrowed her eyes, continuing to look at the computer, which Danny noticed held a virtual representation of himself, along with several statistics both human and ghostly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That device Dad hit you with? That was the Fenton Splicer.\" she said, as if she was teaching a preschooler their ABC's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah......yeah. And that means?\" Danny asked as he sat up and crossed his arms, both out of displeasure and of coldness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still wonder why Mom and Dad even created it. They usually stick to inventions that destroy or entrap ghosts, or ones that protect humans from them.\" Jazz stated as she scratched her head in thought and turned to Danny. \"The Fenton Splicer, on the other hand, is supposed to merge two ghosts into one ethereal entity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Don't tell me. Me and the Glutton..?\" Danny asked fearfully, a cold feeling slowly spreading throughout him from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that had been why the Glutton had disappeared like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz nodded grimly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if the Fenton Splicer worked like it's supposed to, you and the Glutton are now one entity. You, being the stonger ghost, literally absorbed him. However...\" Jazz trailed off as she held a finger to her mouth, biting the nail nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However?\" Danny prompted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. Your appearance is the same, and your vitals as well as every other internal function seems to be the same...so far.\" Jazz muttered and sighed heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...that's good isn't it? Their doohicky backfired then?\" Danny asked, giving himself a once over and breathing a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment there, Jazz had had him worried that he was going to end up as big as the broad side of a barn. Danny was relieved to find his body the same; toned and lithe from almost a year of battling ghosts. Of course, he wasn't beefy like any of the jocks at school, but Danny had been happy to had finally NOT been scrawny for the first time in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it appears that way. You know as well as I do that Mom and Dad don't always invent the most failproof of devices. The Fenton Splicer could have literally just emmitted a laser of which the Glutton perished and of which you survived.\" Jazz clarified. \"I still wanted to run you through these tests though, just to be sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning in response, Danny ripped off the transistors, and bounded off of the table, earning a startles look from his sister. Opening his arms and turning, Danny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think that's necessary.\" he said brightly, \"I'm still a beanpole, luckily enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then felt a pang of hunger in his stomach and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit of a hungry beanpole, actually. I'm off to grab a snack. Thanks for the check-up, Sis!\" Danny shouted, and like a bolt of lightning was up the stairs and gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny! Wait a minute! We still have several tests to run through!\" Jazz called after her brother, running over to the base of the stairs in the basement-lab and stamping her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine Colleen Fenton! You will get up here this instant and explain to your father and I why we should not turn you in for Grand Theft Auto!\" Maddie suddenly exclaimed, her voice heralded by the slamming of the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSqueeking and junping a bit, Jasmine abandoned all thoughts of her brother as she quickly shut the computer down, all the while coming up with a possible alibi as to why she had taken the car back home and had abandoned her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father was a boob, and although she loved him, she could easily fool him. Her mother...was a different story entirely, the mother and daughter being far too much like each other for Jazz to easily fool Madeline Fenton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Jazz ascended the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in for a battle, alright...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her mother's voice into the family room, Jazz didn't notice Danny standing at the refrigerator. Licking away a stray dollop of mayonaise, Danny begin making his second bolougna sandwich...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Other ghouls made their existence known to Danny, and like all before them, they were vanquished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, the scourge of all adolescents, school, in it's melancholic way, forced both Fenton children to focus their attention on Algebra, On Demand Writing, History, Science, and in Jazz's case, applying for colleges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her senior year, after all, but I digress; Danny and Jazz were soon whisked away by their lives, and soon enough, even Maddie and Jack had forgotten of the ghost named the Glutton that had appeared at the Nasty Burger so many moons ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, all of the Fentons had been caught within a whirlpool of activity: Jack and Maddie, as always, were enraptured within their field of the Supernatural, although the two had apparently discovered a breakthrough; the Fenton Rescusitator was a device they were working on that could actually bring souls back from the beyond, or so they said, if the situation was the right one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, as the elder Fentons poured more and more time into their work, Chinese takeout and greasy pizzas became all the more common in the Fenton household. Junk food was stocked more often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Maddie, devoured by their work as they were, and Jazz, a slave to her school work and to her college preparations, therefore didn't notice as the youngest Fenton changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturdays once spent outside with friends became days spent lazing about in his pajamas. Afternoons once spent skate boarding had become times when Danny found himself glued to the computer, something to munch always on hand. Even monotnous days at school soon found Danny Fenton picking up an extra pack of fries one day or another slice of pizza the next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all truth, young Danny Fenton had fallen into the sin of gluttony. With it had come sloth and each day finds Danny digging himself further and further into his new lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever is our protagonist to do? Is he doomed, or, perhaps, is there a hidden diamond in this apparent curse? All paths diverge from all paths infinitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime begins to slow again, as the Fenton family is able to convene for what seems to be the first time in ages...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nSeveral Months After \"The Glutton\" Incident<br>\r\nEarly to Mid February<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning found the three eldest Fentons worse for the ware. Jack and Maddie had pulled yet another all-nighter in their quest to perfect the Fenton Rescusitator. They were close, they both knew. A scent few variables, a tiny twink here and there and they would have it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz had faced an all-nighter the previous night as well, having spent the whole night rewriting an essay for one of her many college applications. She hadn't yielded to sleep until she had been happy with her work, which unfortunately, had come only after she had rewritten her essay for the fifth time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three had pitched in to make the first real breakfast they'd had in ages. Although, even Jack seemed to using a mug of black coffee as a crutch this morning, only meagerly picking at the bacon and egges on his plate whereas Maddie and Jazz hadn't taken their eyes off of the caffeinated miracle worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the coffee pot percolating reigned in the Fenton kitchen, none of the three wishing to break the peace of the morning, and yet they all glanced at the fourth seat at the kitchen table, each of them wonder the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where is Danny?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Danny say up in the tangle of sheets that was his bed, finally yielding to the sunlight that was adamant in that he get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor February, the sunlight streaming through the youngest Fenton's windows had felt like a gift from July. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmelling the sweet, salty scent of bacon in the morning air, Danny licked his lips, and proceeded to walk over a floor cluttered with dity clothes, textbooks, and candy wrappers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing happily, Danny stetched as he slowly trundled down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhosts in recent months hadn't been as plentiful as they usually were, leaving Danny alone for the many Autumn and Winter Holidays- Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas- and Danny had enjoyed them all. He had even scored a new wardrobe and the latest gaming system for Christmas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmbling into the kitchen, Danny began to fill a plate high with bacon and eggs, though not before cringing as the disheveled state of his parents and sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't we all look chipper this morning?\" Danny asked brightly as he began to voraciously tear into his breakfast. The comment would earn him glares from both of his parents while his sister fiercely resisted the urge to be barbaric and flip her brother off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother, of course, was the first to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny, dear...have you been eating well?\" Maddie asked as she regretfully relinquished her coffeee to scrutinize her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's face...looked rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was certain of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny! Since when do you have a double chin?\" Maddie asked her soon with a tint of anger to her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stopped eating for a moment and looked at her cluelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz, who had begun to scrutinize her brother as well, suddenly became very pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bee sting!\" Jazz suddenly elicited, jumping up from the table in one quick motion and startling everyone else at the table, \"A bee stung Danny...yesterday! On his face! The poor guy, it's all swollen up, too...I know! I'll put some....some ointment on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her family knew what she was doing, Jazz had ushered Danny up out of his seat, and, breakfast in hand, the siblings had went into the lab in the basement. Seconds after, the clicking sound of a lock was heard and Maddie and Jack were left alone at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack...have you ever thought that out children were odd?\" Maddie asked with a sigh as she picked up her coffee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, really! They get it from your side of the family!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~-~-~-~-~-~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was yanked down the stairs, Danny was surprised as his sister uttered an uncharacteristic string of curses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jazz. Whatever it is, I didn't do it.\" Danny quipped as he muched on a piece of bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz turned on him as if he was a lioness, but suddenly was overcome by a knowing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't even realize it, do you?\" Jazz asked, more to herself than Danny. \"It's been Autumn and Winter, so you've been wearing layers...that's fooled everyone else. Not to mention the new clothes you got at Christmas are probably bigger, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jazz? Earth to Jazz? Hellooooo?\" Danny attempted to catch his sister's attention by waving a strip of bacon in front of her face before he promptly devoured it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her brother, Jazz smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danny, how much do you weigh?\" his sister asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, Danny though for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...around 130 pounds I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz then led Danny over to a scale in a corner of the room. Taking his plate of food away from him, she pushed him onto it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look down, Danny. Tell me what you see.\" Jazz ordered blandly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Danny drew in a sharp intake of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"160 pounds?!\" he shouted incredulously, stepping off. \"Jazz, this scale is broken!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz face-palmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boob....you are a BOOOOOOOOB! Just like Dad!\" Jazz yelled in exasperation. \"How could anyone but a boob not notice they were getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Danny asked, utterly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST DO IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny rushed to comply with his insane sister, she ushered him over to one of the reflective surfaces present on many of the machines in the basement lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him was not the svelte youth he had thought he had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Danny was staring at a fat boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's stomach, once flat, was now a generous belly of flab that thundered over the waistband of his pajama pants with gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face, like his mother had noticed, had rounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his chest. While Danny had never had anything remotely like pecs, exhibited only on jocks like Dash, his chest was now two soft mounds that would soon become breasts - the male equivalent of which deemed \"moobs\" by many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, several things made sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward looks Sam and Tucker had shot each other in recent months, the giggle he would receive from Paulina when he tried to talk to her, and even the questionable looks he had received from Dash and the other jocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had all suspected it, if they weren't aware of it already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...how...?\" Danny uttered, speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJazz sighed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the Glutton? And how your genes were supposedly spliced with his? I'm guessing that was what led to this.\" Jazz explained. \"That or you became my lazy, chubby brother on your own. Which could be possible considering, you didn't even realize that you'd gained thrity pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shook his head morosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know why I didn't either! It's like I was just so caught up in eating and stuffing myself that I didn't care what I looked like.\" Danny concluded, taking one of his stomach rolls into his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like it could have possibly been an effect of the Glutton...\" Jazz muttered thoughtfully before gesturing for Danny to a machine. \"In any case, we have tests to run. And no running away this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Danny nodded glumly, noticing for the first time how he now shook when he walked. It was as if he had been in a trance; Cursed to eat and to never see the effect it was taking on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, Danny was sure of one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it ever became fact that he had gained weight at school, his live would become a living hell. </span></div></div>",

He had lead the football team to victory, had gotten respect from both students and teachers, and was the most popular boy in school. The long string of hook ups he'd have in the last few months proved that. Plus, Danny had began to workout woth his new body. Combining this with his new, sports heavy, life style, Danny had grown even bigger. He was now 300 pounds of pure sexy muscle. He had biceps as big as basketballs and pecs like boulders. He strutted through school, showing off to his adoring fans with a flex of his arms, a wink from his sexy, angular face, and a pec pop.<br>\r\n'Damn' Danny thought 'Life is sweet!'<br>\r\nDanny was so busy showing off his new body he didn't see the muscled man until he was almost in front of him, and when Danny did see him, he almost didn't recognize him.<br>\r\n\"Tuck?\" Danny said I shock. The guy infront of hom had Tucker's face, but it was more angular. His hair was in dreadlocks that went down his neck. His body was really shocking though. Tucker was ripped! He was wearing a tight black tank top that showed off his 18 inch biceps and right new pecs that jutted out from his chest. <br>\r\n\"You know it Danny! Check me out! I started working out with Kwan, and now I'm finally got a bod good enough to get the ladies\" Tucker said cockily. He winked at a brown haired cheerleader that let out a giggle before Turing away.<br>\r\n\"Damn dude. That rules!\" Danny and Tucker chest bumped and walked down the hall. Danny noticed most of the nerds and skinnier guys had muscled up. Wes was almost as big as Danny, and Mikey was big enough to play for the football team (which he soon would)<br>\r\n'hum' Danny thought 'all the nerds are becoming jocks.' Danny saw two muscle-nerds talking about DnD, Kwan listening intently. 'while, maybe not entirely. Still, it cool to see everyone trying new stuff.'<br>\r\nDanny strutted down the hall to his next class, taking in the amazing ng new dynamic he had created.</span></div></div>",

A few months ago I was the weakest guy in school. Now me and my 300 pounds of sexy muscle are leading the fucking football team to victory.\" He smiled at Mr. Lancer \"And I know that you wanna know how I did it. It's gotta be frustrating, watching all your students reach there physical prime well you just stay the same year after year... I can show you how to get a body like mine.\" He offered<br>\r\nMr Lancer looked skeptical \"... You would do that for me? Why?\"<br>\r\nDanny shrugged \"What can I say, I like watching guys grow. It's been a blast watching all the weaker guys in the school get stronger. Plus, I figured that you've always looked out for me. I should return the favor. So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\nMr Lancer thought on it for a minute... And then stood up \"I'm in.\"<br>\r\nDanny smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later, Students were hang out in the hallway. Kwan and Mikey were tossing around a football, Dash was discussing workout techniques with Tucker, Wes was flexing his biceps for a few adoring fans. Everyone's heads turned as the doors opened. A 6'1\" stud walked through the door. Broad, sexy shoulders, pecs that jutted out like a bookcase, tan arms, covered in thick black hair, with 22\" biceps that strained the fabric on his impeccable 3 piece suit. Strong legs, thick like a tree trunk, with a noticeable bulge in his pants. An angular face with a fashionably trimmed goatee, complete with a shiny bald head and a knowing smirk.<br>\r\n\"Mr. Lancer?!\" Dash said, shock reverberating from his voice<br>\r\nThe new Mr Lancer smirked \"That's Mr. L to you sport. Now, stop gawking and get to class.\" Mr. Lancer confidently strode to class, girls and female staff fawning over the new office hottie. <br>\r\nDanny smirked, proud of his work.
