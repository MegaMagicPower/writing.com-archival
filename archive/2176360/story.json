She noticed that the sex drive was calming down but the pregnancy belly was already appearing to be 7 months pregnant and still growing. She saw blue and red glowing orbs flying around her. She belly surged out more until it was perfectly rounded. She grabbed her phone and tried to call 911 but her phone froze when those three numbers were dialed, then the phone shut off. She waddled to the door and trief to unlock it but the entire door got covered in a shadow like material. Her belly soon got too heavy for her and she collapsed, and finally the growing stopped. But that means another problem is gonna start. Jess felt a warm liquid in between her legs,and then a horrific pain was felt and movement in the belly increased</span></div></div>",

She currently had almost her entire arm inside of the laboring beast. Feeling around for the stuck baby inside. The on staff zoo vet was busy dealing with another birth in the neighboring lion exhibit. The other zoo staff also rushing from place to place as almost all of the animals on sight were going into labor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day was just getting weirder and weirder for all of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting her hand inside of the female rhinos birth canal she finally got the babies leg unstuck. A gush of fluids pouring form the mother as her heavy contraction pushed the baby finally past her cervix and into the canal proper. Pulling away Rebecca stripped off the plastic shoulder length glove. Hands on her hips she watched for a few more moments confident the rhino could make it through the rest of her labor. It was to busy for her to stay and monitor the beast as she rushed off to go help another straining mother to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Leaving this one completely open for everyone until I can come up with a few scenarios.)</span></div></div>",

Odd as that was it was even more concerning that not a single one had been pregnant the night before. The zoo closely monitored such events and did not have any explanation for why the lions and almost every single female animal was in labor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting Rebecca opening the rear door that connected a hidden room behind the enclosure. It was where staff could go to observe or work on animals outside of the public eye. As the heavy steel door opened she gasped in horror. The first thing that hit her was the smell of birthing fluids. All of the female lions were in labor here in one room. What shocked her was not the females lions but what the male was doing. Braced against the wall Jenny the local vet was struggling. The large dominate male of the pride was tearing at her but she wasn't being eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's powerful front paws were wrapped around the brunettes slim waist. Her long work pants were torn and ripped. Exposing her lower half to the beasts thrusts. It's spine covered cock was slamming into her. Making the women scream as it plunged deeper and deeper. With a roar the lions legs tensed. Flexing as it hilted itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca took a step back a hand covering her mouth. \"Help me!\" Jenny screamed finally noticing the other women. \"It's....ahhh....it's cumming!\" she sobbed clutching her belly. The lion remained locked against her it's furry testicles pulsing as they poured there virile load deep into the women warm folds. The tip of it's cock pressed against her cervix spraying thick globs of beast cum directly into her womb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebeccas had to make a choice what would she do. The shock was wearing off would she help? Run? Slam the door?</span></div></div>",
