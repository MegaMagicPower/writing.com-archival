So, for today at least, if she wanted something done she'd have to do it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busty blonde Hokage made her way through the forest around the village until she found the small cave entrance, seemingly carved in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trader sent from Gaara stumbled across this odd cave. Neither he nor Tsunade were familiar with it, so Tsunade decided to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her was down in through the entryway, a torch in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her feet, feeling something there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked, sending a few spiders cascading off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross...\" She snarled as she kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, the cave turned from dirt to stone, and opened up to a large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was, for the most part, empty. With one exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of the room stood some sort of altar. On it, a statue. Or rather, three statues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue in the middle was a man standing, arms crossed, a smile on his face. To his left and right, though, were two naked women, bowing down to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked it over and sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down. At the base of the statue was a sort of tray, and on it, an ancient looking necklace. A golden choker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade bent down and picked it up, looking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decent taste in jewelry though.\" She shrugged. She looked down again, seeing text carved into the tray. But it was in an ancient language. One Tsunade certainly couldn't read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll send someone to read this later\" she said to herself, still looking at the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... May as well. I deserve a reward for all this\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered her bedroom that night after her shower, dressed in only a nightgown, she saw the necklace, which she had placed on her bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she looked it over. Running her fingers up and down it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Now that I have a mirror...\" She pondered, putting the necklace on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it latched, she had only a few seconds to appreciate it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes rolled back in her head and she collapsed sideways onto her bed. Her body began to shake, making her giant tits and ample ass wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must obey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My purpose is to serve\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do as I am told\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chanted these words over and over. For minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her body settled, and her chanting stopped. Tsunade lay there, asleep, until morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade stepped out of her home the next day. She was going into work, but only briefly. The festival began in a few short hours. And so she made her way to her office. But little did she know what today had in store for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Tsunade, she could not read that ancient text carved in the basin where she got the necklace. If she had, she never would have put it on. As the text read;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be wary, traveler. The dark magic cast on this golden accessory is highly dangerous. The weather will be unable to remove it of their own will, and from the moment they wear it, they will be unable to refuse any request or demand. If you see this, please turn back and never return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Tsunade had no idea... And her new life of servitude was just about to begin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had always fascinated him. However until today he had never had a real chance to show it off, his only prior practice being on his sister Hana, his mom Tsume, and trying it on his dog Akamaru. And none of it really worked all that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonoha was having a bit of a feastival, and Kiba was granted permission to set up a small stage for a hypnosis show. He was going to get SOMEONE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the festival kicked off, Kiba found himself alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody had flocked to his stage. Nobody had shown up to participate. Nobody even around to watch. Just an empty stage in the back corner of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed, looking for anything. AnyONE. Then eventually she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura Haruno, the pink-haired cutie was strolling around town. Thankfully without her then boyfriend Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had always had a bit of a secret crush on Sakura, but never really acted on it. But today would change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Sakura!\" He called out, getting her attention. She approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hey Kiba. What's up? This some kind of show?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It's my hypnosis show. But nobody came to watch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... If you were actually doing hypnosis maybe they would\" she joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I'd need a volunteer... Wait a second!\" He said, an idea popping into his brain \"Sakura! Help me out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's eyes widened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me?! Wait! I didnt-- I mean I can't... Kiba I'm not... Erm...\" She stammered. Kiba had never seen her flustered before. It was honestly kind of cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! You said it yourself! I need to actually put on a show and I need a participant for that! Please?\" He begged <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura felt bad. She didn't particularly WANT to be hypnotized but... This was sort of her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh fine!\" She grumbled. Kiba pumped his fist in victory as she slowly made her way on to the stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba pulled out a sparkily watch and dangled it before her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Isn't this a little cliche Kiba?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Just watch it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura relented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds passed. Then minutes. Kiba began to worry that maybe he wouldn't be able to do it. Maybe he would fail. But then he noticed it. Sakura's eye lids began to flutter, eventually slowly closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood before him, slack and relaxed. Breathing deeply and calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe danced around the stage happily... Only to realize a few people had gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had an audience!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... He needed to entertain them somehow! What would he do?!</span></div></div>",

Her job, and her life, were seemingly going nowhere. And all because Krillin, the only man who had ever really been for her, ran off with someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman Marron blamed for all of her problems. An angry, overly-serious blonde named \"18\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarron hated her from the bottom of her heart. Though she did have to admit, 18 WAS hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Marron had come up with a bit of a plan. A way to get back at 18 for stealing Krillin away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarron had been spending the past few weeks learning about hypnosis. The best and most efficient methods. The way it worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eventually she came to her decision as to how she would control 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day while Krillin, 18, and their daughter; whose name still infuriated Marron, were away, the blue-haired beauty snuck into Krillin's home and lined the bedroom with small speakers. These speakers would broadcast subliminal hypnotic programming to 18 while she slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sure, she could use these on Krillin too, and force him to come back to her. But she wanted him to come back of his own choice. So she specified in the subliminals that only 18 is to obey them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks passed, and every night 18's brain was unknowingly assaulted by Marrons hypnotic programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking enough time had elapsed, and seeing Krillin head to work and his daughter go to school, she knocked on the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18 answered, dressed in her normal black and purple long sleeved shirt and denim Jeans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you with.. oh. You.\" She hissed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi 18! Is Krillin home?\" Marron giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He isn't. And I wouldn't tell you if he was. I'd say it was nice seeing you, but it wasn't. Now goodbye\" 18 huffed as she started closing the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obedient Barbie!\" Marron chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, the light left 18's eyes. They glassed over and her arms fell limply to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It works!\" Marron cheered, hopping up and down playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to invite me in?\" She teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...please come in...\" 18 droned drowsily as she stepped aside, allowing Marron to enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarron flopped down onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Come over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18 closed the door and shuffled into the center of the room, waiting for further instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarron looked her over before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

Training, classes, exams, and the occasional argument with Weiss. Usually Yang could just put it aside and not let it get to her. But tonight was not one such night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed and turned in bed. She couldn't sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11PM became midnight. Midnight became 1. 1 became 2. And still, no sleep came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, tired, and desperate, Yang went to her Scroll and searched online for a solution. And soon after, she struck one. Hypnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't really believe in hypnosis. She thought it was all made up. Something people did on stage with actors. But at this point she was willing to try basically anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another quick search, she came up with more than a few hypnosis videos. She looked some over. Most had some kind of alternative use to them. Hypnosis to quit smoking. Hypnosis for weight loss. Hypnosis for birthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need a normal hypnosis video\" she whispered to herself in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she found one simply titled \"Intro to Hypnosis: your first trance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally\" she sighed \"Sounds like this will just be sleeping\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang popped her earbuds in and began to listen. The soft spoken voice of a man came on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. Welcome to the intro to our hypnosis series. In this first video I'll be guiding you down into a nice, deep slumber\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I need\" Yang said as she snuggled into her pillows, trying her best to get into a relaxed state to let the hypnosis take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get nice and comfortable. Remove all distractions. No pets. No TV. Just you and your device. You and my voice. Listen to it soothe you. Listen to it take you deeper and deeper. Let your guard down. I know that may be hard, but for this to work, you need to accept my words. Trust me.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrust him? Yang didn't know this guy but at the same time... it was a video online. Not a person actually in front of her. She was willing to give a pre-recorded voice a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buxom blonde let her guard down, taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now. Follow my voice deeper. Deeper. Deeper. Relax.... relax... relax... breathe in.... aaaand out... and in... aaand out...\" the voice cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang followed. In. Out. In. Out. Was this all it took? Breathing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last thought she had before she dropped. The trance taking her. Yang had gotten what she wanted. She was in a trance. Asleep. However... there was more to this video than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she wanted was a quick and easy way to fall asleep... what she got was a playlist of hypnosis videos for the hypno fetishist with a bit of a humiliation kink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video continued on, slowly chipping away at her mind and programming her. Until eventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on when you go to bed, you'll open up your phone and pull up one of my videos. You'll select at random. At the beginning of that video you'll hear 'Time to obey, little one' and when you do, you'll fall back into a trance for new programming. But for tonight, go ahead and open your eyes. But remain in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's eyelids slowly lifted as she stared blankly upwards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now pick a random video from my playlist. Let it program you.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang scrolled a moment before tapping the screen at random. A new video booted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to obey, little one\" it said, and her eyes closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning broke, Yang stretched and hopped out of bed. She walked across the room, her bare feet dragging along the floor as she went to her dresser and grabbed her clothes for the day. She went into the bathroom to shower. But little did she know that in that bathroom her first programming would kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang managed to get out of her clothes. However, her phone chimed as she sat her clothes in a pile. As it did, a trigger hit her, as Yang began to act according to her programming; all thanks to the video she clicked on last night, titled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: Whatever the video was titled will determine her actions and triggers through the day)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
