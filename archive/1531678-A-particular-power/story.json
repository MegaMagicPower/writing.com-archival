It crashed to the surface in a mountain range and was shortly thereafter engulfed by a glacier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust last month, the ice in which the particle was encased melted and it flowed with the water only to be taken and placed in a bottle of 'natural glacier water'. It was that bottle of water that you had purchased one lunch hour in your high school cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Robert Bennet. You are 18 and have two siblings. Your Eldest sibling's name is Paul at the age of 25. Your youngest sibling is Maria at the age of 17. You get along well with both of them. Your main interests include computers and physics. While not extremely athletic you are reasonably fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the cafeteria, you were about to sit down when Victoria Wilson, head of the school swim team, walked over to you. While you had had a crush on Victoria for quite some time, you had never gotten together the courage to ask her out. Little did you know but Victoria also had a crush on you and was too shy to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of Victoria you felt like your legs were going to collapse. As it turns out she was just as nervous as you were although she didn't show it quite as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if i take a sip from your water bottle?\" she asked, looking your right in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duhhhh... Sure,\" you stutter, completely embarassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria then opens the bottle and takes a quick sip before turning around and walking off. Although you can't see it, she was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing to happen was for you to sit down and take a sip from the bottle yourself. It was lucky that you did as just as you put down the bottle Hank the school bully snatched the bottle from your hands and drank what was left of the water. He then laughed and tossed the bottle across the room. As the bottle flew through the air, a final drop of water flew out and landed on Miss Hillary Turner's lips. Miss Turner was the school's librairian and had seemed to grow fond of you and your group of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question now is, who drank the particle and gained mysterious powers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Instead of standing in line, waiting to pay for a water bottle, you find yourself sitting down, looking at a smooth grey metal door. Wondering what just happened you tilt your head to one side and are shocked by the appearance of long, straight, black hair falling into your field of view. Lifting up your hand you give the hair a tug and cringe as pain sears through your head where, it seems, the hair is firmly attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice that your hands did not brush your glasses when you had grabbed at the strange hair. Feeling the skin around your eyes you confirm that you are not wearing glasses. Wondering how you can see, you lower your hand a bit. As your index finger slides down an unusually fine and delicate nose you close your eyes in panic. Your fingers then reach something even less expected. They touch a smooth, glossy surface where your lips should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling an itch on your ear you go to brush it away and encounter more of what you presume to be hair. At your ear you encounter another unexpected surprise. You find what seems to be some sort of metal bead firmly attached to your earlobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping your hand down the side of your neck in surprise you are shocked to encounter bare skin on your shoulder. Not only is the skin bare but it is unusually smooth. Suddenly wondering something, you move your other hand up to your face. The skin is smoother than normal there as well. Running your hand up, over your face you confirm the strange smoothness everywhere. Running it through your hair you notice that not only has it changed colour and length but it has also gotten much smoother as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting your hand slide off your shoulder, your fingertips brush down you bare arm. Confused by all the strange sensations you open your eyes again but continue to stare blankly forwards, at the grey door. Letting your elbow go loose, your hand drops to your knee which you find bare as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping your other arm, you hold your hand against your chest. Confused by a strange mound like obstruction on your chest your fingers finally find cloth and dip beneath it. They now found themselves confronted with another piece of cloth. Beneath that, much silkier, piece of cloth they find two squishy and rather sensitive mounds. The mere presences of your fingers causes the mounds to send ripples of foreign sensations through your body while at the same time the harder somewhat. Retreating out from behind the cloth you let your hand drop onto your other knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour right hand then slides inwards, towards your crotch area where you found the strangest thing yet. The first thing your hand found was a pair of lip like forms. Farther inwards you found an extremely sensitive bump along with a strange cavity. Suddenly feeling very excited in a way you'd never felt before you slide one of your fingers just inside the rim of the cavity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally too curious to hold off any longer you look down. What you see is a distinctly female body, dressed in a black tank top and with a skirt wrapped around its ankles, seated on a toilet with one hand between its legs and in what you now realize is its vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your hand out from between your legs you wonder how you came to have this perspective and be able to control this body which definitely did not belong to you. Realizing at last that you are in a bathroom stall you look around in panic. Grabbing some toilet paper you ginger brush away at your groin, relieving a mild most sensation you'd been ignoring until then. You then bend forward to grab at the skirt and, \"Oh my!!!\", thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly bringing the thong up your legs and into position you blush, embarrassed that you, a teenaged man, are wearing a thong. You then remember that you are most certainly not currently inhabiting your normal male body and blush again, embarrassed by your stupid mistake. While pulling up the skirt you realize that you had essentially felt up some unknown woman. This causes you to blush once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to stand up is your next challenge as, you had just discovered, you were wearing high heels on your feet. Not just any high heels like those one inch ones you'd seen Victoria wear from time to time but full 3 inch high heels. Holding yourself steady with the help of the cubicle walls you manage to make it to your feet. Looking down you realize that there was a purse sitting on the floor by the toilet. This meant that you had to bend over to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" you say in an oddly familiar voice as you fall to the ground, landing with one arm pinned beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying still for a moment you try and remember where you'd heard that voice before. Unable to figure it out you pull yourself back upright and tug at the thong as it crawls into your butt-crack. Opening the stall door you look up and into the reflection of Grace Beaufield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Grace,\" you say, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grace's reflection mimics you you finally realize that you were in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Fuck!!!!\" you shout, falling back onto your/Grace's ass. After a moment of shocked silence you say to yourself in Grace's luscious voice, \"I'm Grace Beaufiled! Holy fuck! I <b>am</b> Grace Beaufiled! <b>The</b> Grace Beaufield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUneasily returning to your feet you smile into the mirror, showing off your new perfect teeth. You then clear your voice, shake as much nervousness out of yourself as you can, look straight ahead, smile in the way that Grace does when she wants to melt boys' hearts and say, \"Hello, my name is Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning you leave you take one last glance in the mirror at your new gorgeous body before walking out of the bathroom. The thoughts running through your mind went somewhere along the lines of...</span></div></div>",

Secondly, the skin on the front of your chest was experiencing this strange bobbing sensation, nevermind the fact that it felt as though it was swollen somehow. The next odd thing was that you felt as though you were slightly taller. Also your legs felt firmer and far more fit than they normally were. They also seemed to be mostly bare. Your face also felt different. Without reaching up to feel it you had this feeling that it was a different shape than normal. Your eyesight was also different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason you were unsure of you had continued walking. Maybe it was because you liked the stealthy power your legs seemed to be displaying. Once out of the cafeteria you turned the corner abruptly and a bunch of silky brown hair flew into your field of view. By the mild tugging on top of your head it felt as though the hair was yours. While the sight of brown hair was not strange for you, the length was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking slightly you speed up and are soon outside. Now that you are outside you stop in shock as a slew of new sensations ripple over your body thanks to your good friend, the wind.

Reaching up with a distinctly non-masculine hand you brush the right breast like mound and confirm your fears. A panicked look on your face, you move towards a nearby parked car. Looking in the car mirror you see an unexpected reflection.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then I heard somebody moving around down the hall.  You hoped it was Sharon's Mom.  (She only worked half days, so she was usually home in the afternoons.)  Then there came the sound of footsteps coming down the hall. You braced yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon's Mom came around the corner and gave you a pleasant smile.  \u201cHi honey.  How was your day?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood question!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was okay, Mom.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just smiled and continued on towards the kitchen.  \u201cYou\u2019re home early today. They didn\u2019t you have volleyball practice today?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said, \u201cI guess \u2026Sh\u2026Sharon forgot!  You hope you did\u2019t get in trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom frowned and said, \u201cYour father and I have already talked to you about this.  Being a volleyball player isn\u2019t just about being little Ms. Popular.  You actually have to work at it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Mom.  I\u2019ll do better.  I promise.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom started rattling pans and said, \u201cI hope so.  I\u2019d hate to see you get kicked off the volleyball squad or the cheerleading squad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, wouldn\u2019t that be a total loss\u2026not!  you really hoped you weren\u2019t still Sharon by the time Friday rolled around whether you had to cheer at a pep rally or not<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom seemed to be done with me, so you walked on down the hall to the bathroom.  you really needed to go, but you didn\u2019t want to face this final truth.  You knew what you were going to find when you pulled Sharon's volleyball shorts down (or maybe up?  Who knows?)  you entered the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou was still stunned to see this totally beautiful girl staring back at you.  You touched your face and Sharon's beautiful reflection did the same.  You hoped you wouldn\u2019t be this way long enough for it to be normal.  You smile when you sees her black volleyball shorts  tighten her new butt. You grab it and can't beleive how firm it is. You also notices the way you're now looking at it too with a big grin on your face. Sharon's reflection in the mirror blushes. Now you think to yourself that you can check it out whenever you wanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counter top, which normally is fairly free of any debris, was covered with a dizzying array of cosmetics and associated shit.  You picked up a few items; foundation, mascara, eye shadow, lipstick.  All this crap had to be yours.  What in hell you were supposed to do with it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t stand the suspense any longer.  After locking the bathroom door, you took off your sleevless shirt off, and dropped your black shorts to the floor.  You stood there for a minute or two, just staring at the girl in the mirror wearing only a bra and panties.  You found yourself lusting for that girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached behind your back and fumbled for a bit trying to unfasten the bra.   It was one of those bras like girls at the gym wore. You reached behind to undo it, so that you could finally have your way with Sharon's body, but as much as you fumbled around, you couldn't find where it fastened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, you just pulled it off of you, over the top. Later, you would realize that sports bras didn't close in back like normal bras. They were made differently to give you proper support while playing sports. But that was too far out of your mind, because now, you were staring at Sharon's boobs or should we say your own perfect pair of boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe! You had big ones! They were full and firm. Slightly up-pointed, with big nipples, and large dark areloas. You would have been *so* aroused by them, if you were still in *your* body. But you were in a girl's body now quite different from a man's body, and these boobs were yours! It was so mind-blowing. You gently touched them, and shivered from how it felt. They were more sensitive than you would have ever guessed. You cupped them in your hands, and just gaped at yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still got your shoes to take off. You went over and down on the floor, then watched in the mirror as the brunette then went down over and kneeled down in front of yourself, opening the shoelace as you took out your beautiful female feet out of the white patent leather low-heeled court shoes made for sports, then you Lift your right foot and did the same. You took your foot and slipped out of the shoes---it was tight and it dug into your heel but otherwise it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mirror, there was a brunette pulled into a ponytail and tied with a piece of pink ribbon. The brunette only wearing a white pair of panties and white socks that wraped it's self around her knees, on top of the socks she had gorgeous long tanned legs as you cupped her boobs as she moans. You knew what you needed to do now. You reached down, and felt your boobs sag down just a bit as you let them go. You reached down, and pulled off the white cotton panties you had on hanging on your ankles. Now you could see yourself down there. You had a small, perfectly shaved rectangle of hair there, just like you loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the naked girl in the mirror, you wanted to do her. But you *were* her! She was you! You so much regretted her body. You had to get out of this body! you could not stand her smooth soft skin! You couldn't handle the fact that your manhood was gone, and you had a pussy now! You had curves for crying out loud! You didn't want to be a girl any longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, supper is ready\" called out the girl's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had to get dressed for dinner. What should you do? you turned around, and noticed that an outfit was on the floor, all set up to wear. You went to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was a sports bra, which you hurriedly put on. As much as you hated how you looked in a bra, it was somehow worse to see your bare boobs! you fumbled around with your arms behind you, trying to get the stupid thing in place. And you thought they were hard to take *off* a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you got it. you pulled up your matching pair of panties on your leg. Then you grabbed the volleyball shorts, which you pulled on next. You felt *awful* in them, the way they made your legs look even sexier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sleeveless shirt you pulled it on, and it seemed to make your boobs look even bigger. You guess that the sports bra had kind of squished them down, but this bra you had on now even enhanced your bust, making your chest even more sexy than it was. You almost wanted to cry when you saw Sharon in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped into the volleyball shoes that were laid out, and took a few tentative steps as you adjusted to having a bit of heel. You opened up the door and walked around as you decided to run your finger in a circle motion over a nipple.  You couldn\u2019t believe the sensation you felt!  The nipple started standing erect. It felt really good.  You never got this reaction when you did this as a boy!  You began to rub the other nipple and it responded the same.  You felt sensations all over. You stopped and put your hands down on your hips.  What were you doing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still needed to relieve yourself, so, you turned back into the bathroom and locked the door.  You didn't care the least about dinner. You really didn\u2019t want to pull your panties down.  You closed your  eyes and pulled the panties down.  The shifting weight of your boobs greatly bothered you. You tried to keep your eyes closed, but you couldn\u2019t stand it.  You opened your eyes and looked.  Crap!  You couldn\u2019t see anything because the mirror just didn\u2019t show that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly slid your hand down to where I\u2019d normally find Mr. Happy.  But Mr. Happy was no where to be found.  Just some hair and \u2026and\u2026  my God!  A pussy!  You couldn't deny it now. You are a girl. You were totally, one hundred percent girl.  Then you remembered your urgent need to pee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned towards the toilet and lifted the seat and...  Crap!  You're a girl, you thought. You can't do this while standing any more.  You put the seat down and sat down and did your business.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done, you gathered up your bag. You looked up and down the hallway to see if it was clear, and then hurried down towards your bedroom. Once inside, you shut the door and locked it. You turned around to toss the bag on the floor and stopped short.  Oh my God, you said yet again to myself.  Before you stood a canopy bed, with a pink canopy and the bedspread and sheets were pink.  There were pillows and stuffed animals scattered across the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the walls were posters of guys mostly.  Various male celebrities and bands, a unicorn, Kermit the Frog and some of those stupid painted ceramic masks.  One wall had a vanity dresser with a large mirror.  The mirror had pictures stuck on it all around its perimeter.   You took a quick glance at the pictures. You almost choked when you looked at them. There were pictures of girlfriends and boyfriends and you in various poses like sitting or walking and one disturbing one of you kissing.  There were also pictures of them in cheerleader uniforms and volleyball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rummaged through the dresser.  There were panties, bras, nightgowns, pantyhose and everything you\u2019d expect to see in a teen girl\u2019s dresser.  Nothing in it was familiar.  You half expected some of her clothes to still be there, but maybe in a female style.  But there was nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bottom drawer, you found a red covered book with a clasp holding it closed.  Printed in white was a drawing of a heart with words written in script saying \u201cMy Diary\u201d.  Holy crap!  Inside this diary would be the loopy writings of a teen age girl.  Only it would presumably be written by Sharon.  You set the diary on top of the dresser.  You really didn\u2019t want to open it, but you thought it might give you clues as to who you are now.  You decided to look at it later.  You really didn\u2019t think you could handle it at that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the closet and opened the door.  On the floor was a jumble of shoes.  Hanging in the closet were various pants, tops, and dresses.  And of course, there it was; your cheerleader uniform.  Oh, the humanity! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on the bed, wondering just what kind of person you are.  You always considered yourself to basically be a good guy.  You stayed out of trouble, you didn\u2019t mistreat people, you kept your grades up.  You were stereotypical person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d had some dates, and had kissed some girls, but the sudden realization that you haven\u2019t had sex with a girl yet, overwhelmed you with depression.  You were shy and I always thought you\u2019d have time for that when you were ready.  You looked down at your round and firm boobs hanging there covered by a bra.  Now\u2026now\u2026hell, now you can\u2019t!  Even if you find a lesbian, it\u2019s not going to be the same.  You fell on your back on the bed and stared at the canopy overhead.  This was a disaster! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there for one minutes, feeling extremely sorry for yourself.  You had an itch and your hand drifted down to your crotch.  Curiosity finally got the best of you and you started to slid your female hands under your panties to explore the inner folds of your new womenhood.  As  you slid your fingers along the length of your pussy, an odd feeling began to grow within you. Your finger slid further into your womenhood and began to massage it back and forth.  Then your finger hit something (a G-spot?) and oh my God\u2026  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had found your clit.  It was incredible. You pushed on it gently repeatedly and you had to stifle a groan. Your fingers finally slid inside and continued to slide them in and out.  Holy shit!  An indescribable feeling began to swell inside you. You started rubbing a breast at the same time and felt the nipple tighten like hard diamonds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraight out.  It was like watching a movie and you could only stare in awe. You watched this gorgeous sex creature masturbating and had the benefit of feeling every sensation!  If she climaxed it would be your  first female orgasm, you came flooded with female juice that filled an entire hand. The Brunette cried out with a scream.  A sexy scream at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued with increasing intensity until\u2026Shit!  You couldn\u2019t hold back the groan as a pleasure you never experienced before reverberated throughout your body. You continued massaging until it began to hurt and then you dropped your hands and just lay there, shaking and sweating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to feel spasms, body convulsed as what you guess could only be described as an orgasm. Your ass and hips lifted in the air as you felt a wierd rush, Sharon's juices didn't just leek out of the pussy like most girls... it squirted all on the chest of this natural body. You felt supprisingly good considering the whole situation hadn't hit you yet.When her semen sprayed up into the air, her whole world spun around several times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey looks like you got Sharon's squirting ability her cum launched from my vulva. It landed all over my new stomach and lovely tits. Strangly enough you kind of<br>\r\nloved it. Holding your crotch area in order to drip the girl's cum.  Your inner thighs were slick with the girl's come and sweat.  You went over to sit on the bed.<br>\r\nWhen you sat on the edge, you gently fingered and thumbed your clit.  Again, her sexual desire heightened!  You used your free hand to squeeze your right<br>\r\ntit, basking in the sensations it caused the female pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your cum sprayed up into the air, her whole world spun around several times along with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt embarrassed by what you had done and Sharon's cum that had now coated your hands and you spread them around along your inner theighs and stomach. Your theighs and breasts were coated with this sticky milky substance. You didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my God, that was an incredible experience!  Maybe being a girl wasn\u2019t so bad after all.  You sniffed your finger and laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d  as you put your finger in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of laying on the bed, you sat up slowly looking at the mirror exposing your beautiful legs almost to the tops of her socks once more. It was a sexy sight to see the girl's cum leaking out of her sex drooling it's way down to your inner theighs down to your legs, now making the knee-high socks cum soaked, too bad that no one was around to enjoy. Again you were annoyed at the shifting weight of Sharon's boobs.  You hoped you would get used to that soon.  You fumbled through the clothes you'd tossed on the bed and found your cum soaked panties.  You held the panties for a second and looked at the smooth nylon underwear.  There were baby blue in color with a lace looking strip along the top of the waistband.  On the waistband in the front (you were guessing it was the front, was a little blue bow sewn on.  Finally you stood up and slid them up your legs.  Seconds after her waiting cunt, cum explodes into the panties. She moans and gasps until finally it's you moaning and gasping. You're in Sharon's body right now, and it feels great. Her pussy feels like it's been freshly fucked and her nipples are as hard as diamonds. You smirk and slide a hand down to her blue underwear. Feeling around, you pull your hand away sticky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up the bra.  It also was a baby blue.  You held it up and studied it a moment.  You slid your arms through the straps and brought the cups up against your boobs.  You grabbed the ends of the big strap and pulled the ends behind your back.  After several tries, you gave up trying to figure out how to fasten the ends together.  You turned the bra around, and clasped it together from the front. You rotated it back around pulled the straps up over your shoulders.  You didn't know if that was the right way or not, but at least it was on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had finished dressing when Sharon's Mom called through the door.  \u201cHoney!  Dinner's on the table!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stepped back into your cum soaked Sketchers you said, \u201cI'll be right there, Mom!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her usual response to male advances was to knee them in the groin until they dropped to the ground, writhing in pain. A few months ago she had adopted one more deterrent. She had taken to smoking.

In addition to the change in view, you felt a heavy weight on your nose and the distinct tang of nicotine in the air around you. You bring your right hand up to your face and feel greasy hair hanging in front of what seems like a pair of oversized glasses. Breathing in you start to choke and cough. Your chest heaving you feel something drop from your lips and onto the ground. Your pulling the hair out of your face you tuck it behind your ear and look around at your surroundings. The strange thing was that everything was slightly blurry. You slowly remove the glasses from your face and realize that without them, the world is even blurrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to easily see what is around you, you turn your attention downwards. You are dressed in the baggy shirt, torn jeans and mismatched shoes you had noticed Melissa wearing just moments before. At your feet a still burning cigarette lay where it had fallen during your coughing fit. Putting it out with your sneaker wearing foot you cringe as the tip of the cigarette touches your bare skin through the ratty sole of the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally putting out the cigarette with your other foot you lean against the wall behind you to examine your now damaged foot.

While you are unsure of its suitability you decide to take it and a pair of black sweatpants just in case. You then go into the changing rooms and put down the clothes you had brought with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then paused for a second, your shyness interrupting you just before you were about to take off Melissa's clothes. In one way you felt like you were stripping in front of a complete stranger and in another way it felt like you were invading Melissa's privacy by peeling away that which she used to hide from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that maintaining your own personal levels of hygiene was more important than the concerns of someone who was no longer in your current body, you start to undress. The first things to go were the shoes. Next you tried to take off the jeans and were slightly surprised when they ripped in two and fell down around your ankles. Sitting down you take off the hole filled socks on your feet and then start to wriggle out of the T-shirt. Once out of the t-shirt you discover that Melissa was not wearing a bra. Standing up once more you pull down the panties, somewhat surprised to find dried vaginal fluid sticking it to your distinctly non-male privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off Melissa's glasses you go into a shower stall and turn on the water. As the hot water fell on your head and flowed down your body you marvel at the sensations it causes in your/Melissa's Breasts. Taking some soap in your hand you lather it up and start to scrub yourself clean. Beginning with your head you wet your/Melissa's hair and, with the help of shampoo, cleanse it of grease, dirt and other sorts of grime. You then move on to your neck and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next area to cover is your torso. As your hands bring the soapy foam of cleansing to your impressive upper assets you are met with newer and more extreme sensations. Slightly surprised you stop for a moment before continuing. Once past you chest you move on to your thin feminine arms and then on to Melissa's firm stomach and thin waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving your arms up and down Melissa's long, slender legs you dispel the dirt and grime that, according to your work so far, seemed to have been present on her skin for quite some time. Your final area to cover was Melissa's crotch. You gingerly started to rub away the grime and such but as the strangely pleasing sensations over came your body you moved faster and harder.

You then go back to the restroom and smooth your hair with your hand, hoping that you did a reasonable job. You then spot a discarded srunchy on the ground and use it to tie Melissa's unruly hair into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting at your new reflection in the mirror you decide that you'd done a good job at cleaning up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Victoria is one of the last students to shuffle their way into Mr. Halverson's math class that afternoon. Needing to compose herself from the flurry of emotions after \"Robert\" swept her off her feet in a passionate, wet-lipped embrace. Stepping quietly into class and taking her seat at a desk across from Sharon, who is still fighting the male hormones raging throughout her new body. Mr. Halverson, the pudgy, septuagenarian doddard that he is, none the wiser about the three body-swapped students in class. Like most days, he turns his back to the students and scrawls formulas, equations, and notes on the board for students to copy verbatim... or not, he couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel determined to reform Melissa's reputation and sit dutifully in front, after borrowing a few sheets of paper and a pencil from a bewildered, nerdy boy also sitting next to her.  The boy silently thanking whatever God could hear him that <i>Melissa Shank</i> was sitting next to him with those big, creamy breasts barely restrained in a tight-fitting top and satin skirt barely covering her smooth thighs. Revealing way more tattooed skin than she usually does, and why doesn't she smell like grime and smoke like usual? The only thing preventing the confused nerd from reaching out to her was her unwavering commitment to beating the daylights out of anybody who even looked in her direction. Better to just give her some paper and pencil and leave her alone, the nerd concludes, shifting in his seat to hide his growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the real Melissa sits hunched over in Sharon Winterly's cheerleader uniform, staring dull-eyed at the board with beautiful, un-spectacled eyes. Beneath her desk, she spreads her new, sinewy legs wide apart, her panties on show to anybody who cares to look. <i>Look at Sharon, that teacher's pet</i>, Melissa thinks to herself, mistakenly thinking Sharon had swapped with her instead of you. <i>What the hell has that uptight, goody two-shoes dressed me in?</i> Melissa relieves an itch on her perky boobs and yawns loudly. If Sharon wants to change her reputation, then two can play at that game. A positively devilish thought crossing her mind to hook Sharon's body on cigarettes much like she had done with her old body. <i>And this preppy cheer uniform definitely needs a downgrade.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon, believing that Robert is still occupying her body, watches hungrily as her real body cups its boobs and spreads its legs shamelessly in class. <i>How dare he do that in public!</i> As infuriating as the sight of her body feeling itself up appears, however, Sharon also feels another foreign thought forcing its way into her brain. <i>That's... that's also kind of... kind of hot.</i> Finding herself succumbing to the sex drive of a teenage boy, she adjusts the raging hard-on in her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria breaks her concentration on her math notes and looks longingly at Robert. Observing his frustrated expression and tracing his vision-path to Sharon, who is all but fingering herself at this point. If that isn't enough, Victoria sees Melissa sitting in front of the class -- not just attending class for once, but feverishly jotting down notes too! Wearing her hair in a ponytail and dressed in a... tank top and skirt? Victoria frowns. What is going on with everyone today?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-way through the class, Mr. Halverson finally turns around and asks, \"Would anyone like to come up and solve this problem?\" Gesturing toward a system of equations on one end of the chalkboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral students raise their hands, but the teacher's union had advised Mr. Halverson to call on students who don't normally volunteer themselves. He scanned the room with wrinkled eyes and saw a tattooed arm right in front of him. At first, he doesn't recognize the girl, but through her cleaner complexion (and unmistakably melon-sized tits) he connects face with name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa, why don't you try to solve this for the class?\" He clears his throat. The entire class nearly falling out of its collective seat as the bad-girl loner stands up and does as the teacher says. The real Melissa leaving scratch marks in Sharon's desk, trying to control her fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a straightforward problem, you realize as you work through the problem using the method Mr. Halverson had just explained in class. Gripping a piece of chalk in Melissa's slender, sooty fingers, hoping that you don't spill out of the tank top in front of everyone. Finished, you turn around and briefly explain your process. The girls in class glaring at you and the boys in class lustfully drinking in your appearance. Several of them training their eyes on Melissa's bra-less \"high beams\" jutting out from the tank top's thin fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Melissa. That is correct.\" Concludes Mr. Halverson, erasing the problem and resuming his drone-like lecture. You sit down again and try to ignore those students still viewing you with perplexed, open-mouthed expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharon can't get the image of Melissa's nipples out of her testosterone-drenched mind and blows her load all over your pants. Shuddering to herself and drawing chuckles from the guys sitting near her, she ducks out of class without the teacher noticing. Thankful to sit in the back of class today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Sharon's friends, another cheerleader, taps Melissa on the shoulder to get her attention and scoffs quietly. \"Can you believe what she's wearing, Sharon? Looks like Melissa Shank wants to become Melissa <i>Skank</i>. Ugh, what a slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Melissa grunts through gritted teeth. She takes one of Sharon's heeled pumps and jams them onto the other girl's foot. Causing her to yelp silently. \"Don't talk shit about people you don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stands up and hobbles for the exit, also leaving class without the teacher noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much else happens for the rest of the class. Victoria did not see \"Robert\" leave class and naively wonders what happened to him. Melissa formulates a plan for the quickest, most effective way to trash Sharon's reputation, and thinks of the various flunkies she could bum a cigarette off of after class. Realizing that nobody who runs in her rather limited social circle would help a narc like Sharon unless sex was involved. Loathing the need to objectify herself as she avoided so much when she was in her own body. Not to satisfy some feminist agenda or anything, but because it was so much <i>work</i> to look pretty even given her natural beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of class, you begin to feel an odd craving. A kind of nervous, dry pressure welling up from your chest and mouth. Regretting that you didn't finish Melissa's cigarette, you discover your new body's intense need for nicotine. Even though the psychological need isn't there, your body very much telling you what it wants. Asserting a physical craving to take a drag from the pack you had thrown away before class. Not letting it distract you from note taking... at least not until the bell rings ten minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudents gather their bags and pour out of the classroom. Since Melissa didn't come to school with a bag anyway, you return the pencil back to the nerd, fold up your handwritten notes and place them in the hem of your skirt. The paper poking out slightly into your midriff. You gaze at Victoria who seems to look past you in search of someone else. Brushing by you without so much as a hello, but you wouldn't expect her to notice you now, sadly. The first thing you do is rush to the trash bin outside the school and recover Melissa's cigarette pack and lighter, still lying at the top of the heap. Placing a filter in your mouth, you light the other end and inhale carefully and slowly. Finding that the smoke goes down into your new lungs easily. You breathe out and see smoke coming out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nervous jitters dying down at least. You suck on the cigarette quietly for a few minutes until the final class of the day is about to begin. You have no idea what class Melissa is supposed to go to. Normally disappearing from school grounds this late in the day, education not really her thing. But then what is? If you're going to improve her image from the inside <i>and</i> outside, then you need to know what's wrong with her inside. Meaning: her interests, her friends, family, hobbies, if she has any. In short, her <i>personality</i>. Maybe she had a rough upbringing? Who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From your point of view, you saw that you were wearing a forest green vest over a clean, long sleeved white shirt. On your legs you saw a pair of Dark green dress pants. The vest and shirt seemed to have a bit of a bulge outwards to them while at the same time you felt a strange and mildly painful squeezing sensation on your chest. Your stomach appeared flat and by the way the pants creased you guessed that your legs were relatively thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear the bell ring, signalling the start of the next class. Standing up you look back down at where you had been sitting and notice a small book bag, it's main pocket open. You pick up the bag and are about to put the book you had found on your new lap in it when you are pushed into class by a group of students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside you take a seat. You are still uncertain what exactly happened so you decide to resume looking over you body. Looking down again you notice that your hands are thinner and smaller than your old ones. You then Notice that you are wearing some sort of simple metal necklace. Slipping it up over your head you bring it close to your face and see that it has a small crucifix as the only adornment on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the necklace down on the desk and decide to start looking through the book bag. The first thing you find is the book you'd had on your lap earlier. Looking at its cover you see that it is a Bible. Placing it on the desk you then come across some papers, pencils, erasers and a small coiled notebook. Examining the notebook you see, written in shining gold letters, \"My Diary\". The next and last thing you find is a very small mirror. Deciding that either the mirror or diary could let you know whose body you seem to now be inhabiting you...</span></div></div>",

Not being able to find any landmarks you recognize you lean against the lamp post lean your head back in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" you think to yourself when you realize that you are not wearing any glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking straight ahead you realize that despite not wearing glasses you seemed to have 20-20 vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried now you steal a quick look downwards and see the same female body you had seen back in the school. You bite your lip, scared as to what is happening. You close your eyes and lift each of your hands up in front of your chest. You then bring them towards your chest and clasp two mounds of cloth covered flesh. Opening your eyes you look down and see a pair of feminine hands grasping the breasts that seem to now be your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your hands off of the breasts (you are still not ready to consider them <u>your</u> breasts) and look around, hoping no one saw what you just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a bit more time to examine your surroundings you wonder where you are. From the looks of the buildings you seem to be in a light industrial area. The realization of this confused you as the nearest such area to school was 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I just ran that far!\" you say in shock. You then wonder where you had heard that voice before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching one of the trucks parked along the street you look in the side mirror, hoping to see what you look like now. You a somewhat surprised to see the reflection of Mika Lu, your younger sister Maria's best friend, staring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mika?\" you ask the reflection, it mimics your motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart starts racing again. Unsure what to do you start running again. As you run, you wonder what you are going to do. Thinking back to your grasping of what you now realize are Mika's breasts causes you to blush and then worry what Maria would do to you for essentially fondling her best friend. You then realize that she would think that <u>you</u> were her best friend. You then wonder if Mika is in your body now or if you somehow overwrote her consciousness with your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these and other thoughts race through your mind, you pay little attention to where you are going. When you finally come to a stop you find yourself out in the country side. Panicking some more from all that has happened so far, you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you pick yourself up off the ground and pray that all that had happened was just a bad dream. Closing your eyes you are unsure you want to look down. Finally building up the necessary courage you look down and confirm that you are still in the body of Mika Lu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully disoriented, you wonder which way to go in order to get back to town. Sitting down in the grass next to a telephone pole you brush some dirt off of your/Mika's clothes. Leaning your head against the pole you relax and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Hank had taken your water bottle you had sat in glum silence. Suffice it to say that you were rather surprised when you suddenly found yourself sitting on the exact opposite side of the cafeteria. The sudden change caused you to jump. Your jump led to a series of strange sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky? You alright?\" asked a girl sitting beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her you recognize her as Betty, Victoria's best friend and your next door neighbour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had turned your head, one of the earlier sensations had repeated itself. That sensation was a strange brushing sensation on the back of your neck. The next thing you noticed was that you were no longer wearing glasses but could still see perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask but then stop, wondering why Victoria had spoken and you had not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around frantically you try and figure out where Victoria was. For you to have heard her so clearly she must have been right next to you. While you were spinning your head, looking for her, you noticed something that didn't make any sense. What you saw was a lock of blonde hair that had fallen into your left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching up towards it with your left hand you wonder what is going on. before you can move any further you notice that the hand in front of your face is most definitely not your own. It was far too feminine to be your hand. On top of that, it had painted fingernails and was wearing a bracelet on its wrist. You then have your eyes follow the length of the arm before you, a shocked look on you face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Vicky?\" asks Betty again, rest her hand on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes reach your shoulder where you see that you seem to be wearing a T-shirt with slightly frilly ended sleeves. Reaching across with your right hand you feel the fabric. It is smooth, almost silky. It was certainly not the shirt you had put on when you woke up. Besides, you distinctly remember having put on a red, long sleeved shirt today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then noticed your right hand. Like the left it was far daintier and feminine than your hand had any right to be. As you start to follow that arm across to your other should you finally spot the two mounds pushing out the front of the light pink T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost mechanically you bring you right hand across your torso, very lightly brushing the two mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a slight tingling sensation runs through your body, Betty says once more, \"Vicky? Can you hear me? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then lean forward slightly, trying to see past the odd mounds. Below them you see a pair of legs dressed in a very tight pair of blue jeans. Another puzzling thing is that the legs, their outline clear thanks to the jeans, are very different from your own. Straightening out your legs you see those dressed in the jeans do as you had instructed. At the bottom of the blue jeans you see a pair of distinctly non-male feet wearing sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggle your toes. The toes on the feet wiggle. You part your legs. The jean dressed legs part. You touch your forehead with your right hand. The manicured right hand touches your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide and you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky! Where are you going?\" asks Betty, standing up with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to look at her. Her sky blue eyes are filled with worry. Her kind and gentle face seems to be pleading for you to do or say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery mechanically you turn and walk out of the cafeteria. After a short pause you hear betty following close behind you. Biting your lip you turn the corner and proceed towards the gymnasium. As you walk, you feel a bouncing sensation coming from the two mounds you are beginning to suspect are breasts. What you believe to be hair continues to brush the back of your neck. Going into the gym, you can tell from the sounds behind you that Betty isn't moving as fast as you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face the change room doors you walk up to and enter the mens change room. As it turns out it is empty. Going around a corner towards the sinks you come face to face with Victoria. After a moment of silence you realize that it is only a reflection of Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally realize what has happened! You fell asleep and are having a very strange dream. Deciding to try and wake up you slap yourself on the cheek. Victoria's reflection does the same. Only when the stinging sensation persists do you realize the actual truth. Somehow and without any explanation you had swapped bodies with Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God!\" you say in Victoria's voice, a voice that still seemed to be able to cause your knees to weaken at its sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize that it may not have been a swap. Starting to worry you bring your hands to your head and grasp Victoria's fine blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if my mind has simply been copied into her body! If that is the case then I will never be able to return to my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded so strange to hear Victoria's voice when you spoke. You couldn't bear the thought that Victoria's mind was now gone and that you now inhabited both her body and your own. Deciding that you need to find out if her mind still exists you wonder how to do so without embarrassing Victoria in the process. After all, if you were stuck in her body (or just out of basic principle), you didn't want to ruin her reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realized that you were currently in the men's change room. Somewhere the Victoria certainly would not go under anything resembling normal circumstances. Going over to the door you peer out into the gym, checking to see if anyone is there. Stepping out of the change room you tiptoe your way out of the gym and off to...</span></div></div>",

Looking around you fail to spot your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to where Victoria had been sitting you sit down and look over the food at that location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuna sandwich and ceasar salad?\" you whisper to yourself, \"I guess it'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the sandwich you take a bite. While eating the sandwich you look around at those still in the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a strong masculine voice say behind you, \"Hello Victoria.

But you were still curious, so you asked away. \"And why is that?\" You ajusted your shirt slightly, feeling a bit stuffy. \"Because of the dance babe! The lights, the girl!\" He takes a deep breath \"Nothing ever beats that!\" You cringe inward. Makes sense why the term, 'Jock' Gets thrown his way alot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you looked to the entrance of the lunchroom, and saw your body skid to a halt before running again...in your direction!

You feel awkward seeing yourself walk into the class, Betty gives you a glance and a small smile before being interrupted by the teacher. \"Swapping habits with Betty, Victoria?\" He jokes, oblivious to how accurate he maybe. Betty picks up on that fact and jokes along with it. \"Sure am!\" she exclaims with a big smile on her face. You take notice for once of how beautiful you are or maybe it's just how Betty makes you look. The lightly placed pink lip gloss and dazzling bright eyes with just enough mascara to really make them pop out in a phenomenal way. Betty seats herself and tosses some of her gentle wavy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave your attention on Betty, who now seems to be writing something down. \"Is she diligently studying because she has my body?\" You ask yourself. A moment later, Betty lifts her head and gleams a big smile and lifts up a piece of a paper with a over-glamorized \"This is SO cool\" written on it. You smile in a jest but give a heartfelt nod, as you also felt this situation is interesting at the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head towards the window, a very transparent reflection of Betty's face staring back at you. You then turn towards Betty, who is seated at the opposite back corner of the room. You look at her for awhile before looking down at yourself, finding the dark outfit that Betty wore well represented on your very altered person. '<i>Betty always makes me jealous of her, even when she is me, I find she makes my own body more attractive than I ever made it look, despite all the styles and appearance being what I did when I woke up this morning. Betty just glows of sexy. She's always been my backbone...</i>' You think to yourself, happy to know that even as each other your places haven't changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, answer the questions on pages 176 and 177 and you're done for the day. You can pair up with a partner if you want.\" The teacher declares. Betty smiles and brings herself and belongings with her. She places the desk in front of you against yours and sits down, wearing a big grin. \"This is sooooo cool!\" She voices in person this time. You giggle slightly and nod. \"It's certainly interesting, I guess.\" You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing, everyone's calling me Victoria and treating me like you. It's so totally awesome!\" She exclaims in an excited gambit. \"Yeah... you make me look amazing, way better than I ever looked.\" You pout in self-pity as you sink in your seat. Betty curls her lip and pats you on the hand. \"Not this again, come on Victoria. You know everyone sees us as the classic blonde versus brunette debate. Half of the people like you better than me and vis-versa.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" You sigh. \"And hey, we're reversed now. I'm the blonde and you're the brunette, so stop being jealous over nothing, you're Betty Jinus right now. If you really think I'm sexier than you, flaunt your stuff while you're me, I don't mind. I personally-- and I know I always say this when you bring this up but I think you're at least 5x better looking than me.\" She defines the situation again for you but you can't help but blush at her comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! I am not better looking than you.\" You thrash back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm experiencing it first hand. You so are, Victoria.\" She says with a glimmering smile. You merely glance away in embarrassment but she just takes it as a surrender and laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctant but obliged, you both begin to actually do the assignment. A previous thought passes your mind as you near the end of the page. \"Betty--\" You begin but find that the other people in the room have silenced down enough for them to over hear. \"I mean Victoria... how did the thing with Robert go?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that.\" She pipes up, thrilled to be off the focus of the assignment. \"I did find him, he didn't tell me much about what happened but I did try to make myself available. He seemed mildly happy-- however, he seemed way too embarrassed about what happened to say anything about wanting to go out with yo-- me.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I wish I knew what happened to him it looked like he... well...\" You blush as the memory resurfaces of Robert's pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two talkin' about Robert Bennet?\" Josh Hampton asks. You both nod in succession, allowing him to continue. \"I hear the kid fuckin' spewed his pants in the middle of the cafeteria. Literally just cummed his pants in the middle of eating. That must of been a fuckin' good burger.\" He jests in a spurts of chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, really, that's what happened?\" Betty bolsters up, laughing out loud at the statement. \"I didn't think it was THAT, I thought he wet himself a little or something.\" She laughs again which begins to irk your composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop laughing at him!\" You shout and erupt from your chair. Betty sulks a bit from your reaction, realizing she must have been irritating you. Josh just looks at you for a moment, pleasing you by discarding his distasteful expression. \"Sorry. Vic, I take it your friend has a thing for this kid?\" He asks. You blush but in your risen state begin to reply \"Of course I d---\" Betty jumps from her seat and clamps your mouth shout. \"Ha ha... one moment, she can get a bit bizarre when she's like this.\" She says trying her best to remedy your near mistake. She soon clamps her face next to yours and lectures you on matters you are now aware of. \"Listen <i>Betty</i>, you're me right now. You can't go saying you have feelings for Robert or it will make everyone think that <i>I</i> have feelings for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and mumble \"I know.\" as best you can from your covered mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the bells about to ring. Hand in your papers.\" The teacher says. You both do just that and once the papers are down, the bell rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your books back into Betty's locker. Once closed, Betty hands you a purse which you grab out of curiosity. \"Here. I forgot to give this to you earlier.\" She says. You glance over the black purse, knowing full well this isn't yours and in-fact Betty's. \"This is yours though.\" You state. She sighs and places a hand on her hips, the other holding up the pink purse which is yours. \"No, it's yours and this pink one is mine. Look, I'll admit I was a bit ecstatic when this first happened because I thought being you would be cool and it is but... after seeing you almost let out false knowledge to the entire school that I like Robert, it dawned on me that we need to be careful about this.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. So what should we do?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're each other, we need to act like each other a bit more. That's why you get my purse because you're me right now. I also think we shouldn't do any drastic changes in appearance, in other words, you need to dress like me and I'll do the same. Regretfully, we have no idea how this happened or know a way back, so I think we should get used to calling each other by each others names. So, I'm going to call you Betty every time, all the time unless you tell me not to and you call me Victoria every time, all the time, O.K.?\" She elaborates more as you both head towards the buses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" You sigh with a drooping head, your eyes focused on your dark attire that perhaps you may grow sick of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright what?\" She asks with a stomp of her foot and a goofy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, V--Victoria.\" You say in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, hopefully this will end soon enough but we'll just have to get used to this for now, Betty.\" She reassures you but points you in a direction you had no intention on going. \"What?\" you ask instinctively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't your bus that way <i>Betty</i>?\" She chuckles. You realize soon enough what she means and once again sigh. \"I guess there is no choice, I can't really walk into my house as you and live there. Oh well, I like your house anyways.\" You say. She nods in agreement and runs off towards your bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb aboard your new temporary bus and take a seat near the back, only a few acquaintances making up the cabinet of people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Betty.\" Says quite a people on the bus which only leads you to smile awkwardly. \"I guess they are more than acquaintances now... hah...\" You joke as you contort your head away from them for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You say. A lot of them seem to be underclassmen, a few you have talked to when you have taken Betty's bus to her house before but in no way formed a legitimate conversation. Speaking of her, you hear a buzz from your now dark purse and take out Betty's Cellphone which has a text from her saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell the spiky haired kid that you'll let him grope your breasts for 20$, I bet he gives you 20 bucks.\" You are shocked by what Betty is suggesting, more so on why she would want you to do such a thing, especially with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" You text back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it. He's a rich kid and a little too hormonally driven.\" Betty texts back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want some random kid touching my brea-- THESE AREN'T EVEN MINE!\" You text back with an increased ferocity in your press. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it. I give you permission.\" Is the reply. You take a deep breath and decide to do it just to see why she wants you to do it so bad. \"H--hey kid.\" You say. He turns around with a grin on his face already which makes you distance yourself a bit. \"I'll umm... g--give me 20 bucks and I'll let you grope my breasts.\" You say, resisting all urges to cover your face in shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty! Don't tempt me again!\" He says, lifting himself out of his seat to sit next to you. He hands you a 20 which you take in discouragement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, Brad is going to try and touch Betty's breasts again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He never really does it, he's a wimp but still pays money to try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a bit relieved from the commentary of the others but feel a small finger press against the side of your chest for only a moment, looking back to see the kid already hiding in his seat. \"What kind of weird bus is this...?\" You whisper to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He only poked it didn't he?\" Is the next text you get from Betty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze Betty, How much money have you gotten off of him for that? You're on your way to being a hooker.\" A kid with glasses says to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!? I am not a hooker nor will I ever be!\" You retort. Ironically finding the situation fun, despite it being something you wouldn't normally find yourself doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he did only touch it. How bizarre is your bus?\" You text back to Betty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, it's your stop!\" A kid shouts. You jump to your feet and scurry off the bus to the front door of your new temporary home. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The small breeze wraps itself around your legs, gently fanning your skirt. You grab the handle to the large white door and inhale deeply. You open the door as you exhale and walk into Betty's home. Not since having first set foot in her home have you been this nervous entering her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop your shoes off and head into the kitchen, finding the lack of communication stellar in it's refinement. It only takes a few more steps to find Betty's mother Rachel on the coach watching T.V. \"Oh, hi Betty.\" She says with only a quick glance. You were expecting to be in a more awkward situation and feel almost disappointed from the lack of attention. \"Umm... Hey Mom.\" You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was school?\" She asks, placing herself slightly upright. \"Interesting.\" You reply but she merely responds with \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed by the attention you turn around and follow along the wall to the staircase. You walk up the stairs, sifting your hands along the polished rails. You pass Betty's room and head into the bathroom for some much needed relief. \"Seems I was tense for nothing.\" you say to your reflection before sitting down on the chilly plates of the toilet. You take another deep breath to try and relax; heightening your posture. A calm expression being worn, you continually stare at your reflection in the mirror, the droplets of urine doing little to affect your long stare. Betty's parted bangs falling short above your eye, furthered bangs falling gently to your cheeks, the back of her hair falling just barely to the bottom of your neck. Your thin eyes now rising from your high cheeks, giving the illusion as if they arced upwards in the same powerful and beautiful way that Betty's always looked. You place two fingers to your forehead and close your eyes in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to stop falling into a trance every time I see my reflection.\" you say as you clean yourself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering Betty's room you place Betty's purse down at her desk and take a seat on her bed. You have been in her room thousands of times but never viewed it as your <i>own</i> until now. You walked up to her closet and opened it up to find quite a lot of clothes to choose from, more than you remember her having. A lot of them not even in dark colors despite Betty preferring to wear dark. You siphon through them for a few minutes before sitting down on her desk chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit bored, you turn her computer on. The moment it boots up you feel as if you're invading her privacy, more so does that feeling incur when you see the display name \"Betty\" on the MSN window which started and logged in on it's own. Curiosity getting the best of you, you go to Myspace.com only to see that as you assumed, you're auto-signed in as Betty. \"I don't like this one bit.\" You say. A few messages pop up from people you don't know and as such you ignore them. \"Maybe I'll just not use her computer...\" You suggest to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door rumbles for a moment before opening to reveal Betty's little brother Mathew. He's 7 years old you think, has short blonde hair and is usually quite energetic-- as boys often are. \"Bethy! Can you help me with my school stuffs?\" He asks. You'd seldom disagree to help a child so you agree. Quite the opposite of what you assumed, you find yourself building some sort of diorama of pilgrims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to say you helped finish it, you prepare to leave Mathew's room, gratified to help <i>your</i> little brother. '<i>I've never had a little anything before. It's cool.</i>' you think with a smile. Before exiting, your new mother calls you down to dinner along with Mathew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about the absence of Betty's father you bring it up to his wife. \"So umm... where's dad?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does little to bottle up her anger as she stabs a fork into the steak. \"Who knows!\" She roars. Regretting bringing it up, you sink your head down and just continue to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner your offer to help clean up is surprisingly taken in by Betty's mother but she declines your offer regardless. \"I guess Betty doesn't clean up much.\" You say as you head back upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you have a responsibility to uphold, you do Betty's homework to the best of your abilities. You wonder if she would of even done it if this didn't happen, as she often \"forgets.\" On a similar note you wonder if Betty plans on doing <i>your</i> homework. Keeping with the advice from Betty about acting like each other, you call her up to remind her to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be-- Victoria?\" You say as the ringing ceases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Betty. What's up?\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really-- hey, I was wondering if you have done my homework.\" You say, a disgruntled \"Errr...\" heard from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was I supposed to?\" She asks in a jest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Betty! I mean... Victoria! You're the one who said to be like each other. I always do my homework since I always do so poor on tests, I need the score from 100% homework.\" You whine at her. She seems despondent about your guilty way of making her actually do homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! I'll do it but you have to at least do min--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I finished yours.\" You say in snobbish superiority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsh... Fine! Fine! I'll do it now, bye.\" She grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hang up the phone with glee from your successful attempt at getting her to do your homework. You outstretch your arms and yawn, deciding that an early sleep might be a good idea. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awake the next morning, rested up to the highest degree. The second thought of why you are in Betty's room only lasts for a moment as you swiftly recall the unreal events of yesterday. You stretch with a smile, delighted with how satisfying your sleep was. Jumping out of bed you head over to Betty's closet to find something to wear for the day. Motioning for a nice imitation you pick out a dark green, knee length skirt and a brown top with a open black denim vest to go over it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the room towards the bathroom, finding that the house is still quiet; the lack of opened doors indicating that you are the first to rise. You undress with little enthusiasm, averting your eyes away from Betty's naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water does good for diverting your attention away from the fact you are in-fact washing Betty's body. Regardless, you do find yourself forced to examine Betty's naked exterior from first person. As expected, you are overall impressed with her figure, you feel the only aspect about you that one ups her is your superior breast size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish up, burdened very little at styling Betty's hair as you have helped her do so on many occasions-- though the altered perspective does prove to be more of a challenge. Your stomach begins to rumble as you finish up examining all angles of Betty's face to insure your success in making her look like herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally used to your mother making you breakfast, you are a bit shaken to make yourself something at this early in the morning. \"I guess her mom doesn't get up until she has to get Mathew to school.\" You assume as you gobble down some toast, snagging the small amount of money placed on the counter which you can only assume is for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus arrives shortly; a place of distant desire in your mind. The spiky haired boy is indeed present and seems to be gazing at your chest as you walk down the isle. Resisting any urges to scold him or cover your chest, you walk in stride to your seat near the back. The underclassmen seem to do little to force conversation on you unless you present yourself which at least makes the bus ride tolerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk into school you look about for Betty. Your eyes lock on her once you spot her; she is walking casually in this direction. Her attire is very similar to yesterday, replacing the jeans with a pink skirt, perhaps relishing in the fact bright colors now suit her. Blond locks, parting dead center with bangs that tower high before falling by her cheeks, the same slight waves being present. \"Hey Betty.\" She says with a glimmering smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You reply, purposely leaving out her name-- as it would be your own, a continually awkward assignment to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good job maintaining my image.\" She says. You nod and say \"Likewise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few steps together you wonder about your request last night and can't help but ask. \"Did you do my homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... it was boring!\" She cries out in recollection of doing it. \"At least I got to enjoy a nice breakfast this morning.\" She gloats, a smirk taken on her face as she stares at you, relishing in the knowledge that you didn't get one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\" You reply. As you walk around the halls, you wonder if you should discuss with Betty about how this happened, you are curious to know. That thought quickly dissipates as Robert comes into your sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look, it's Robert.\" Betty says-- as if you didn't know already. \"S--should I go talk to him?\" You ask but look down at yourself in dismay as you realize your current state. \"Oh crap-- I can't go like this! Y--you go!\" You cry in a demanding maneuver. Betty looks hesitant but quickly agrees, under the condition that you come as well. You both place yourselves behind Robert, who is placing and displacing a few books in his locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robert.\" Betty says. Robert turns a bit, a bright smile taking form on his face as he looks at Betty. \"Hey Victoria, hey Betty.\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling any better since yesterday?\" Betty chimes as she places an arm around Robert in a friendly way that you can't even imagine doing so non-challant. You notice Robert's face is distorted and a quick grin goes across his face. \"Y--yeah. Thanks for umm... the uhh.. concern.\" He stutters out as he puts his back to his locker, shielding his shoulder from Betty's grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you two doing?\" He asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Betty says with a smile, from a outside perspective, you can clearly see that Robert may indeed have feelings for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, fine.\" You say, your attention more focused on the third person perspective on yours and Robert's conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have class together first today right?\" Betty asks Robert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Gym.\" He replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, I could use a good run and...\" Betty says, your mind merely drifts out as you listen to them talk so casually. Part of you is so envious of Betty, you wish you could talk so naturally to Robert another part wishes Betty had to deal with the same shy and nervous personality traits that you get stuck with so often around Robert. You smile to yourself in disappointment as you feel no increase in confidence while Betty continues to speak as casually as ever to Robert. More so than that, they have walked off to class together, leaving you in the dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and begin your way towards your first class of the day. The small bit of anger and jealously fade fast as you realize this is what you asked of Betty in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the classroom for English, speedily are you brought face to face with Josh Hampton. \"Hey.\" He says, sounding very assertive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, hi.\" You stutter, a bit out of place by the sudden conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see in that kid?\" He asks suddenly. The unsharpened question makes you stumble on coming up with an answer. \"See in who...?\" You inevitably ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way you acted yesterday-- you have feelings for that Robert kid, how come?\" He asks once more, carrying a bit of information over this time. While you realize you, yourself have feelings for Robert, you can't go saying that you do when you're Betty. \"Umm, sorry but I really don't have feel---\" You start but he quickly calls you a liar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't.\" You spout once more. He shrugs it off and with his tall stature and big appearance, towers over you, placing himself near your ear. \"Well none of that really matters anyways. Look... umm-- well, you're Vic's best friend right?\" He asks. You nod and say \"Yes.\" despite it being technically incorrect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have any advice on well-- how to ask her out?\" He whispers. You jettison away from him with a spastic jump and a demented expression on your face. \"Y-y-you like m-- Victoria?\" You whisper back, despite the greater distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He says, looking away while scratching his cheek. You are pleased to hear the teacher say class is starting and part ways with Josh, even if only by a few feet and a class obligation to stay quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay your head in your hands and wonder what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... I'm Betty right now so-- do I want to go out with Josh? Do I want to help him ask the fake me out? What about Robert... but Josh is kind of hot-- really hot... but I know little about him. Argh...I should say no, I really should.\" You argue to yourself in unspoken pulses of your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class is fairly quiet so you take out your cellphone and begin texting Betty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty! Josh just asked me-- as you if you-- ok...\"<br>\r\n\"Josh asked me for help on how to ask you as me out. What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou send both texts and await responses. It takes a few minutes but sure enough Betty does respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? He asked me out or you? I'm confused.\" It reads. Frustrated but understanding you resend a message with a better description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's tough. You have been waiting for--\"<br>\r\n\"Robert for awhile but Josh is hot but who kno--<br>\r\n\"knows how much he likes you. I'm not sure--\"<br>\r\n\"who to pick.\" She texts in 4 separate messages. The lack of advice or opinion really irks you as you ravage your hair in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'll ___________________\"</span></div></div>",

On the same subject, you wonder how to break it to Josh that \"Victoria\" isn't interested in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation comes full circle as the class ends and Josh meets up with you on your exit. \"So?\" He asks. You kick your feet in discomfort and tug on your skirt a little. \"Umm... I don't think Victoria has feelings for you.\" You weasel out. You look up at him, he doesn't seem too upset but clearly hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Is all he says before he leaves the class.

To your surprise but unfortunate delight, Robert is sitting at the table as well. \"H--hey Robert.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Betty.\" He replies. You grab Betty close and whisper into her ear. \"W--why today? I needed to talk to you in private about something.\" You stream into her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I thought you wanted me to get close to him. I've been talking to him a lot today.\" She responds.

Please don't think I don't like you-- please sit with us on any oth--\" You go on a tangent of quick talking and apologies but Robert eventually interrupts you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, Betty it's fine. I understand, I'll sit here tomorrow. See ya.\" He says as he leaves the table, going back to his normal group of friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel horrible for that...\" You say with your body outstretched on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always find your nervous speed talking fun.\" Betty teases with a laugh. You give her a glare for only a moment but it quickly turns to a agreeable sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you want to talk about? Did you pick Josh now or what? You got choices girl-- lucky thing.\" She says. You sit back up in your chair and take a sip of your milk before replying. \"I told Josh that I didn't have feelings for him.

I felt bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty puts a hand on your shoulder and smiles. \"Don't worry about it, it's for his own good.\" She reassures you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks-- but anyways. All these third person relationship things got me thinking, we haven't discussed at all about <i>how</i> we switched bodies.\" You say. Betty folds her arms in thought for a moment before responding to your concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I honestly don't know what to think of it. It was about this time, you ran after Robert but stopped once you got outside the Cafeteria. I lectured you on your cold feet and why you should go after him-- next thing I knew I was staring at myself. Really not much evidence on <i>how</i> it happened from my perspective, what about you?\" She explains. Your hand moves to your now short hair once more, sliding through the smooth placements of hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, it's about the same for me.

You claw at your scalp in frustration as no amount of remembrance resurfaces your spontaneous request. \"It's the same thing. You were lecturing me and then the next thing I know I have my hand on my hip staring at myself.\" You say in shame despite of being unable to provide any wisdom. Betty merely folds her arms loosely at her waist and recedes to the back of her chair. \"Well that doesn't help. Seems we have no clues at all.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be something!\" You spit back at her. She curls her lip and thinks for a moment before blurting out. \"Not that I can think of!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press your hand into the table and thrash back once more. \"This can't just happen out of the blue-- maybe someone did this to us somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty just smirks at your insight. \"Who would want to switch us around? No one~\" Replying in a sing-song debunking of your idea. You fold your arms and grumble at Betty's unhelpful teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need to find a way back. This kind of thing-- while interesting, can't be permanent.\" You poke back once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with finding a way back... but how do you suggest we start? It's not everyday that people switch bodies.\" She responds, looking actually a bit concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" You sigh. You feel a hand on your shoulder and a bright smile in your vision. \"Well, let's just take it one step at a time. I feel a bit bizarre being you but it's a good kind of bizarre-- I know you're disliking your position as me so I'll definitely help thinking of ways to switch back.\" She explains. You know what she said is false and fight back. \"I--I don't dislike being you.. I just don't want t-- well, it's hard to be myself like this.\" You cry out in a somber whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can think of this as permanent if you want. You can go out with boys as me if you want to--\" She begins but you jab at her proposal very quickly. \"No! I don't want to think this is permanent. It's only been a day, it's way too soon to give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's just continue as is. Should we meet up after school for idea planning on how to swap back?\" She asks. You nod. Betty seems a bit displeased with you for whatever reason suddenly-- her small hands soon clamping both your cheeks in a forced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop frowning! Make my pearly whites shine!\" She demands in a amusing display. \"L--Leegoo!\" You squirm out, her hands ceasing to grasp you, a relieved bit of laughter escaping your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" She says with glee, the cafeteria bell foreshadowing her voice. You both get up in discouragement, realizing you both did little to appease any amount of hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll see you after-- well in Biology now that I think about it.\" You say to Betty, a quick nod and wave being her response before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to your next class which is Gym, a class you have not gotten to experience while being Betty yet. You head quickly to Betty's gym locker, a few girls greeting you but not much else. You take off your shirt but a bizarre sense of self-consciousness deems on you as an unexpected insult is heard from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting fat as all hell Betty.\" you hear. You turn hesitantly to see Sharon Winterly. In a natural reaction you look yourself over, finding Betty's tight belly anything but fat. Despite the obvious being obvious, a few girls laugh at your reaction. \"What do you want Sharon?\" You ask. Never once have you been assaulted by Sharon in such a way, though you recall her having a bit of a hatred for Betty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your pee-sized breasts to be covered by a shirt and a correct sized bra, finish changing you disgusting slut.\" She jolts, her hands waving in your direction. You are once more aware that Betty's body in no way has pee-sized breasts-- triple B, a few sizes smaller than your own. Regretfully you become irritated and place the white baggy T-shirt over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks at your obvious discomfort and turns around in satisfaction, her motion carrying her long pale brown hair gracefully. You find her tight short blue shorts and similarly tight white T-shit a sure sign that she has no intention of playing with much enthusiasm and is more worried about her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrked in composure you...</span></div></div>",

Melissa being a very quiet, reserved but easily flustered girl, her mentality is the first in your mind as a living representation of how you want Sharon to act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour frustration later dies as you head out to the gymnasium towards the rest of the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Betty.\" Someone says, a shifting eye revealing Tim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You reply. You both follow the teachers commands for stretches. Your eyes drift to Sharon for whatever reason, noticing she is continually tugging on her short shorts and tight T-shirt with a disconcerting look on her face. You chuckle at the sight as it seems to appear like she is embarrassed, an out of place feeling for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou play basketball throughout Gym, continually making small talk with Tim as he often approaches you to speak. You feel as if you're making Betty look nonathletic with your poor display of physical prowess but at the very least no one takes notice. Sharon, whom you have been looking at fairly often for some reason today, is playing in spurts of enthusiasm unlike her usual approach of walking casually along the court. You never knew why but she leaves all her physical abilities to her volleyball and cheer leading practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in and out of the locker room with minimal interference from Sharon who now seems uninterested in communicating with you or her friends. Once back in the gym, Tim approaches you fairly quickly; an unusual grasp of your hand taking place. You follow him as he leads you to the uncrowded area of the Gym. \"Umm...what is it?\" You ask. He looks away for a moment, his face taking the color of an apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty? Would you go out with me?\" He cowers out between his shaking hands and dislocating eyes. You wish that you had dreamed that but his face remains stern, awaiting an answer. You scratch your head in confusion. \"Umm... C--can I have time to think about it?\" You ask of him. He seems hurt already by your lack of enthusiasm towards his request. \"Sure, you can think about it as long as you want.\" He assures you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I--I'll see you later then.\" You reply before walking passed him with your head down. The bell rings as you head to the exit. Free of Tim's sight, you increase your pace towards your next class to discuss the current situation with Betty. '<i>Why now? Why are people asking people out so much today!? It was even my first time being asked out... well, directly.</i>' you scream in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelighted to see the fake blond seated in your seat on time for class you tap her back in enthusiasm. \"Hey.\" You say. She responds with a smile and a response. \"Hey.\" You rudely take the seat in-front of her for the time being and place your face close to her. \"We got problems. Tim asked me-- well technically you out.\" You tell her. She seems a bit shocked, a mild touch of her face accompanying her contorted expression. \"Tim... Nighana?\" She asks. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I barely even know him. He's not really my type-- kind of amazed he'd ask me out, I'm usually kind of rude to him.\" She answers. You find it appropriate and respond in agreement to her choice. \"Alright, that's fine but why-- why do I have to tell two people in one day that I'm not interested in them!?\" You cry out in dismay to your unlucky position between all the eager chains of relationships. Betty wears a bright smile and brushes her pretty blond hair. \"That's just your luck, <i>Betty</i>\" She teases. You wear a sour lip and glare at her but she merely laughs at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... can I have my seat?\" A young boy asks, who you don't seem to recall the name for despite him sitting in front of you-- well when you were yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm sorry.\" You respond. Bowing your head in a apologetic fashion, dispersing yourself to your seat, opposite your normal position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class drifts by as a faded memory. You bid adieus to Betty and head towards your last class-- History. About now you realize how annoying it is to have an early lunch wave, yesterday's later wave made the day seem much shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the classroom, taken off guard by Robert's presence despite knowing he is in this class with you. Your seat directly behind his which you take in an eager hop. \"Hey Robert.\" You say. He turns with a smile and greets you as well. \"Hey Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you?\" The generic continuation enough to make you smile with satisfaction. \"Fine, you?\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" You reply. The basics gone, you find yourself a bit somber that you have no conversation left to pursue-- at least that comes to mind. He returns to his normal position; you lean back in your chair in thought on what to say. Part of you wonders if you should abuse your position as Betty and ask Robert something personal about yourself. </span></div></div>",

Skeptical and nervous about pursuing the conversation, you ponder for a moment what words you could say to not sound overly nosy-- but perhaps that is how Betty would do it. Trying hard to act like Betty you lean forward in your chair and quietly ask \"So... when do you plan to ask out Victoria?\" Robert's posture straightens and he turns to you with a faulty grin. \"W-what?\" He asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow your pride and continue your charade as Betty. \"W--well, you like her don't you?\" You ask of him. He stalls for time with uneasy to appeal hands and the repetitive stuttering of a sentence. \"I uhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She...likes you.\" You tell him. Awed by your confession you almost cover your face in disbelief. Robert feeling a similar taste of awe is looking at you with a similar expression. \"Really!?\" He blurts out. You nod slowly and look at the small speck on the tiled floor; desperate for something other than Robert to look at out of stress. \"Yeah, she is just waiting for you to ask her out. So... get on that...\" You say, exceedingly quiet with the furthered demand. You feel like crying at the moment. The inability to tell Robert how you feel until now-- with a voice that isn't yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Betty. I've had feelings for Victoria for... a long time. I had no idea she felt the same. I'll ask her out soon then.\" He says. You smile as he reveals his feelings for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is a dumb thing to ask her best friend but... do you know where I should take her out to?\" He asks. You fiddle your fingers in and out, the speed at which they move a clear indicator of your emotional state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A--anywhere is fine. I'm sure she'll love it regardless.\" You tell him. He seems happy to hear that and thanks you once again. The conversation finally dies and you lay your head into your arms as you place them onto the desk. A few tears escaping in a confusing mess of emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed through the class and vacate the school as quickly as you can, leaving Betty uninformed that she may or not be asked out by Robert. You place yourself in your bed, relieved to be out of school for the weekend. \"It's fine, all I did was push Robert to go out with me. Only problem is... the me he is going to ask out isn't me.\" You punish yourself, beating yourself in the head repeatably for ever abusing your position as Betty. You feel nothing but remorse for knowing that you may very well not get to go on your own first date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M--maybe he won't ask me out for a few days. Maybe I have time to find a way to switch back.\" You chime in a desperate attempt to grasp hope. The small hum emitting from Betty's fan broken by her cellphone song. You answer it, finding Betty on the other line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey-- are you O.K.? You seemed kind of down after school and weren't we supposed to meet up and think of ways to go back to normal?\" She says. You recall saying that you should meet up and apologize for blowing her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where would we start?\" You ask, ringing exceptionally apathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr, stop being depressed-- screw finding a way back today. We have light left, let's go have some fun or something!\" She screams out. </span></div></div>",

You think it's a good idea and decide to go with it. You agree to meet her at the school's swimming pool in several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuff Betty's black two piece into her backpack and run down the stairs, giving only a simple wave to your current blood mother. You hop on Betty's bike and try your best to maintain a good speed to the pool. You see Betty waving you in as you cut the last corner to the school. \"Heeey~\" She shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park your bike inside the school grounds to repel thieves and head to the changing rooms. You feel a bit awkward as you walk out, revealing so much of a body you're not used to. You find it continually odd that you still feel nervous about such things when you know how good Betty looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoff at Betty who is wearing your school's swim team one piece. She smiles with superiority, both hands parallel at her hips. \"I'm the head of the swim team now!\" She jests. You push her to the pool, revealing 3 members of your swim team and a few other students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria! Bullet your way through the water!\" Jessica Hutchinson shouts. She is a quick girl in the pool and one of the best on your team, far as appearance goes she is a bit lacking in her figure but she has a cute face. You grin at Betty as she takes in all the undeserved fame of being the so-called head of the swimming team. She waves her hand and rubs the back of her thighs with a twinkling smile of both enjoyment and embarrassment. \"I can't really go fast today, my thighs are throbbing from a long run I took. I'm just here to relax.\" She replies, feigning false exhaustion or perhaps not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really go for a run?\" You ask in a sly, inspecting manner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little one...hehe.\" She replies with a grin. You stretch your arms and run towards the pool, jumping into a smooth dive. The lovely feeling of water around you makes you smile as you careen through it. You have always enjoying the water and swimming is one of the few athletic talents you excel at; while Betty is usually energetic and is good at most. You kick off the other end of the pool and swim back to the other side. A part of you feeling as if you're going faster than you have ever gone before. The feeling is brought more to your mind as you reach the end and come to an alert halt. The shouts about your speed and agility finally getting to your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooow! That's amazing Betty! You're just as fast as Victoria-- maybe faster! Why haven't you joined the swim team!?\" Jessica screams out in compliments. You can't resist smiling as you get out of the water, sitting at the pool's rim. \"Was it really that fast?\" You ask. Betty assures you that she has never seen you go quite that fast before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait, Betty. Let me time you.\" Jessica demand as she scurries off to get her phone. Eager to actually know your time you agree and go when she tells you to. The second time feels even better as you feel yourself pulling more fluently than you ever had before. Jessica erupts in jumps of joy as you reach the end shouting that you beat \"Victoria's\" time by 2 seconds, which is a lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R--really!?\" You bounce back at her. She nods in hype and shows you the time on her phone. You can't help but feel amazed that you beat your old time by so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beeeetty! Join the team!\" She begs of you. You paw your face and smile. \"I'll think about it.\" You reply. You get up and close the distance between Betty and yourself. \"Do you workout or something?\" You ask. Betty places a hand on her hip and glances up in a trance. \"Umm.. I go for runs a lot but I don't really go to the gym or anything.\" She answers. You wipe some of your diluted brown hair out of your face and say \"Not sure why but I felt a lot lighter than normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because you don't have these.\" She spouts as she gropes your breasts or her's perhaps as they are currently attached to her. You jab your hand at her and call foul on her assumptions. \"No way! Your breasts are only a couple sizes smaller than mine and you're only like 3 inches shorter than me.\" You debate to her but she merely smirks with delight. \"3 inches less water resistance and 2 sizes more weight.\" She jokes which you take too far by pushing her into the pool. She resurfaces, her full bangs now falling almost flat to her face, her beautiful blond color now diluted to a color she may find more reminiscent. Little other descriptions are given time as you are pulled into the water, laughing upon the retrieval of oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you wake up, eager to go out with Betty once more to have some more fun and perhaps look into the switching issue. You call her up and she tells you she is...</span></div></div>",

I figured you wanted me to say yes, so now I have a date with him today.\" She tells you with a significantly dampened tone, perhaps feeling guilty about doing something so personal for you.

I want to go out with Robert even if I'm not myself right now so please go for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!

Nails ravage your head as you claw at your scalp. \"Aaargh! How am I supposed to be O.K. with this!?\" You shout. The door to your room soon opens by a curious father whom you have only recently gotten acquainted with; at least while wearing Betty's character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, honey?\" He asks as he enters the room, a bit bashful to his own daughter. You have honestly never seen much of Betty's father as he often works late but from your meeting of him today it seems like he is quite nice-- at least towards his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...

Despite being tempted to feign being Betty, you decide upon a common friend between both of you whom you usually hang out with when Betty is not available. You press send and wait in hope that the other line will pick up to free you from your detestable focus on things you have no control over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Betty.\" You hear, delighted to attend Andrea Johnson's voice and hopefully remove yourself from your thoughts. \"Hey!\" You reply in a peppy hue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" She replies in common pong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... nothing really. Want to do something-- anything?\" You answer, sounding horribly lonely-- which you may very well be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I was going to go buy this cute skirt I saw a week ago at the mall.

She says \"Alright.\" and hangs up shortly after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take Betty's bike to the mall which is luckily only a few minutes from her house. You wander about for awhile before finding Andrea a few steps from the place she wishes to purchase whatever piece of clothing she wanted. The short cutesy girl waves to you from beside another acquaintance of yours; Cindy Cowl, a somewhat quiet girl but is quite tall and has her hair always in a large braid. \"Hey Betty.\" They both say in similar ways, perhaps from being best friends for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" You respond in short before being taken into the store. Andrea is walking in a spastic display of joy, her short sandy hair jumping along with her. \"I've wanted this skirt since the moment I layed eyes on it! It's super cute.\" She appraises for you with a brief turn of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see...\" Cindy says in quite the monotone; a hand tugging lightly on her dark green sweatshirt. You merely glance back and forth between the two as they exchange conversation about things you have little interest in unfortunately. You find that Cindy's calm and conservative nature is a great balance for Andrea's rather childish set of energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light colored skirt with floral imprints you find a bit too childish to ever wear yourself but when you look at Andrea a bit more you do find that it may in-fact look good on her. You both wait for Andrea to change into it, taking seats on a near-by bench. You sigh in dismay as the thoughts come back to you once more but you shake them off. You notice Cindy eying you but only turns away when you look at her. You rest your head in your hands, Betty's soft hair placing itself loosely around your fingers. \"I can't even pretend to be interested in this right now...\" You whisper to yourself. You gaze at Cindy for a moment before turning your attention to Andrea who jumps out of the changing room in delight. Cindy showers Andrea with compliments, you give a few but more so than anything you find yourself wondering... </span></div></div>",

You feel a push from behind but it quickly fades. The lighting changes and you shield your eyes for only a moment to adjust to the bright lights of the gymnasium. You pause for only a moment before shrugging it off. '<i>I must of blanked out for a minute there, I really don't remember walking out into the gym though.</i>' You reassure yourself. You begin to walk towards the rest of the class for warm-up exercises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya Sharon.\" Trisha-- another cheerleader says to you as she takes position by your side. \"Umm... hi.\" You stutter for a moment, instinctively replacing her name for you to \"Betty.\" You and all the students quickly turn towards the door to the girl's locker room when a loud scream is heard. A few loud footsteps and a door soaring open is the only time you get to wonder what happened before Betty comes running out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B--Betty!?\" You stammer. She fastens herself before you, snatching your hand in a rude gesture. \"What the hell did yo--\" She begins before examining the fellow observers. You are pulled away to the girl's locker room and into the girl's bathroom where Betty resumes her banter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell-- the fuck did you do to me!? Why do I look like you!?\" She screams at you. You shrug and take a small step back out of confusion. \"W-what do you mean, Betty?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-d-d-on't you dare call me that! I'm Sharon you dumb bitch and you know it.\" She declares, stuttering under the strain of her heightened confusion and anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharon?\" You respond, a bit bewildered by the unexpected twist. The angry expression on Betty's face is something you have seen only on a few occasions but never at you. \"Yes you id-- give me my body back!\" She demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDim-witted, you were under the impression you were back to your own body since she came running out of the locker room but with curiosity in mind, you turn your head to the mirror which has been present in this bathroom from the beginning. You wave your hand, seeing Sharon's reflection mimic you flawlessly. \"Woah...\" You say in shock, moving closer to the mirror to inspect yourself further. You strain your fingers through Sharon's long hair, contorting your changed body to the desired positions to really accentuate Sharon's large breasts and butt. \"Wow.\" You mindlessly say. Betty's visage only gets more frustrated and slaps you in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S--stop admiring my figure! Give me my body back!\" She yells out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few realizations hit you. This time the words of wishing the same situation would dawn on Sharon is clear in your mind. Recalling further, you even remember wishing Betty could go talk to Robert for you. Curious but not sure you...</span></div></div>",

You're stuck as me for the rest of the day.\" You state, hopefully not under false claims of ability. Sharon clenches her fists in agitation and begins to shout in objection. \"No way! Fuck that! I'm not being you-- never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean in close to her with a smile, placing both hands calmly on your projecting hips. \"I can make this situation a lot worse you know. Go through the rest of the day pretending to be me or I'll make you regret it. Alright, <i>Betty</i>?\" You threaten. Having coped with this situation previously, you have an edge over Sharon who is looking at you, distorted and saddened expressions interchanging upon her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... I'll go through the rest of the day as you but so help me if I am not myself when I wake up tomorrow-- I'll make your life a living hell.\" She portends, an ill dislike of her altered stature clear in her voice. She walks out of the bathroom, you shortly follow with a sigh of relief. You hate pretending to be mean but you realize already that it is a good choice to feign this as your doing-- again perhaps not you wonder. After class you plan to find out if you really did cause this to happen. Regardless if this is your doing or not, switching with Sharon would be nothing but complicated if she realized that you had no clear idea on how this happened. She would surely make a fool out of Betty-- something you would never wish to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out into the gymnasium, you are greeted by a few curious stares from the other students and faculty from Sharon's previous outburst. You can only depict that she also came under similar stares as she exited the locker room. The teachers don't seem to interfere about what it was about which you find a relief. While you want to take your place away from any else to avoid any awkward conversations, Sharon's popularity precedes you as Trisha and a few other girls join around you. \"What was that about?\" Trisha questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, forget about it.\" You reply. The ditsy, short girl doesn't seem appeased by the response and pushes it further. \"Come on, I want to know.\" She nearly pouts out. Still a bit irked by Sharon, you decide to take a more pronounced stature. \"Drop it, you little twerp.\" You tell her. Perhaps not mean by anyone else's standards you already begin to feel a snip bad but the small girl doesn't seem taken back by it but she does drop the subject. Up until your experience as Betty, Sharon has always been quite nice to you-- you begin to feel that maybe she is mean to most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about that Victoria girl?\" You blurt out with a twitchy smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" Trisha responds. Her legs fully outstretched as she bends downward in a remarkable display of flexibility as her chest hits the floor with ease. \"Only thing I know about her is her best friend is that bitchy girl Betty and she is a pretty blond who you want to join the team.\" She furthers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" is all you reply with. Ceasing your stretch you bring a finger to your lip and think for a moment. You do recall Sharon asking you a couple times about joining the cheerleaders. <i>Is she nice to me because she wants me to join the team?</i>' You ponder, a bit pleased that you learned something new-- if not a bit curious as to if her attitude towards you would alter once you joined the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of gym goes fairly normal. The fan girls who follow you about are a bit surprised by \"Sharon's\" urge to actually participate in gym. You also go out of your way to lecture the real Sharon about acting more like Betty, I.E. participating. She is frustrated by the request but does her best, which is surprisingly well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings as you exclude yourself from the gymnasium, an all too ominous glare from Sharon given to you as she watches you walk off with her body. Unsure at all about where Sharon's next class is, you disregard it and try to find Betty. </span></div></div>",

A frown of disgust written on her face for a moment before fading to an obvious fake smile. \"What is it, Sharon?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me for a minute.\" You order, trying to drag her away but she is abstinent about budging. \"Sorry, my class is right here.\" She replies. A bit annoyed that your identity isn't know to your very best friend, you drag her close and whisper into her ear. \"It's me, Victoria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth is gaping and a endless eight of blinks define her eyes. You try to drag her off, now more cooperative, she follows along willingly. You go into the bathroom, feigning a desire to need to go until all the other girls inside leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both exit your stalls. Betty gazes at you as if trying to tell if you're really Victoria. \"Despite this face, voice and direct hairstyle, I am Victoria, Betty.\" You tell her. She takes a step towards you, eying you up and down; later playing with her wavy blond bangs. \"How though? Why are you Sharon?\" She questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twiddle your fingers together and try to cover your smile. \"Well I'm not sure but... I think <i>I</i> may be the cause of these swaps.\" You unveil to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How?\" She asks out of curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure but I feel like if I wish for it to happen it does.\" You respond, blushing out of the stupidity of the verbalization. She curls her lip and places a hand on her hip. \"Really now? So you wished for us to switch bodies in the first place-- why?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no... I wanted to swap with you because I wanted you to go in my place to chase Robert, I didn't know it would actually happen. I didn't remember that until I swapped with Sharon, she was irritating me and I wanted her to experience how great it is to be you so she would learn that you're not a bitch. Next thing I knew I was in her body. I feel like it's too good a coincidence to not be my fault.\" You explain to her. She thinks for a moment, garnering some sort of reply to this unprecedented conversation topic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... have you tried to swap with anyone else yet?\" She asks. Shaking your head in response you tell her that you want test it with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it.\" She says with a smile. You take a deep breath and wish that you were in your own body again. A similar feeling immersing itself as a push from behind is given but in only a instant you are now looking out of your own eyes again, looking at Sharon's body. Her face glows as she looks at you, more so as she gazes at her reflection in the mirror. \"Oh my god-- I'm Sharon! It worke-- you can really swap bodies.\" She screams in hype to the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take position next to her. You grab all your hair and fluff it, the lovely feelings of your fine hair tingling the back of your neck. \"It feels a bit weird being myself even after only a day of being out of it.\" You say. Betty alters her awed gander from her new reflection to you with a bright smile upon her well-defined face. \"This is SO cool!\" She restates her feelings from the previous swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can you do other things?\" She asks. You think about it for a moment but don't recall doing anything but body swaps to people. \"I don't think so.. umm.. I wish a million dollars would appear in this bathroom.\" You say in a jest, a small part of you thinking it may actually happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem like it...\" You conclude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can only swap bodies with people?\" She asks. You fold your arms and think once more on it but again only body swapping has seemed to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What <i>a particular power</i>!\" Betty divulges. You smile and nod in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, think of the possibilities! If you can really swap with anyone you could be anyone you wanted!\" She notifies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I can't go abusing this. Besides, I need to swap you back... I wonder if I can swap people other than myself.\" You tell her. She seems unimpressed by your priorities over good and evil but smiles over your unchanged ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's fine but leave me as Sharon for a little bit. I want to have a little fun as this bitchy cheerleader.\" She declares.</span></div></div>",

You begin to feel that maybe having a little bit of fun couldn't hurt too much. Recalling Sharon's previous response to being altered, you begin to wonder how she would mind being you, as she seems to treat you fairly nicely in comparison to Betty. Dying to see if she would still be angry about losing her body or thrilled, you make the thought a reality and wish to swap with Sharon once again. Shoved once more, you straighten your posture in response as you find yourself in the hallway, only a few paces from the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hustle back to the bathroom. You peer around the corner to see what Sharon is up to. Not too surprising that you find her studying her reflection in a bit of confusion. You wonder now how you should go about introducing yourself, a innocent victim seems to dawn on you as a much more fun role to play than the doer of this. You grin from excitement and the tidbit of guilty thrill but take a deep breath to relax and hopefully harness some acting lessons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run around the corner in a spastic motion, your long coffee-colored hair swaying in a ballet of movement. Sharon turns to greet you, a bit shocked once more to see herself. You place yourself in front of her, hands in delicate fists placed in dainty outstretched mannerisms. \"W--what did you do to me-- why do you look like me?\" You yell at her. You draw your eyes to your reflection and feign astonishment. \"Oh my--\" you cry out. You disperse your vision from the mirror and back towards Sharon, who is a bit thrown off by your lack of knowledge of the situation. She averts her eyes towards the mirror and then back at you before revealing a large grin. She rests one of her hands deep in her new blond locks and another hand on her hip; an expression drenched in a expression of superiority. \"Sorry but if you won't join the Cheerleaders yourself-- I'll do it for you.\" She declares with a snotty laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if you'll excuse me. I-- Victoria Wilson need to go sign up for Cheer leading.\" She says as she walks around you, removing her well placed hands in a sly motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle as she leaves, finding it immensely humorous how different her reaction of being you is towards being Betty. \"Smart girl though, pretending she did this like that but I wonder how she really feels. Anyways, I can't have her signing me up for cheer leading so...\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow outside the bathroom at about the same distance but in your own body, you head off to the class you're supposed to be at. You feel a bit annoyed that the teacher will most likely be down your throat about being almost 20 minutes late and hope he will be in a very laid back mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the room to Biology, the teacher almost completely ignores you and merely says \"Thanks for coming.\" in a uncaring manner. You shrug it off and take it is as a lucky break. You sit in your seat, now near the door you entered where it originally was. You get a few angry glares from Betty but merely smile at her, she returns the gesture with a small bit of enthusiasm.</span></div></div>",

You have a good idea of what she is referring and merely chuckle a bit in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do?\" Betty asks. You place the unneeded books into your locker and shut it, with Betty's face no longer hidden behind a gray door you respond. \"I have swim practice today, it's Friday, always do.\" She turns away in protest. \"Well... boo! I wanted to experiment with your power more.\" She complains to you. You shrug it off with a mild smile and begin towards the gym and your bathing attire.

It doesn't have to be all bad stuff-- why not do something that benefits you? Swap with Robert or something.\" She suggests to you.

He isn't making any moves on you, I can so find out why.\" She declares with a wink before running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiraling water around you is always a soft embrace as you swim across the pool. About 15 minutes into your practice, the conversation from your fellow teammates dies and you begin to think about Betty's suggestion.

You do finally call it quits and head out of the pool, walking towards the changing room still dripping wet from head to toe, a towel loosely around your neck. The chime of a whistle rings in your ear as you turn around to meet the noise you see Robert staring at you with a villainous smile. \"God you look hot, you sexy goddess~\" He sings to you. You blush feverishly, motioning to cover up your bare legs with your hands, your mind discarding the knowledge or feel of the towel around your neck. \"I--I uhh... t...thanks.\" You stammer out. Robert merely begins laughing and pats you on the back in a gesture you've never seen him do before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Betty you dolt.\" He-- she says, you realize only now after your embarrassing display. You cover your face and scream into your hands. \"Aaargh, I thought it was really him! I'm so stupid.\" You shout. She places a hand on her hip and wears a somber frown. \"Sorry. I didn't mean to excite you.\" She says. You uncover your eyes slowly, still blushing as you look at Betty-- now possessing Robert's exterior. A dark green T-shirt, a pair of tanned shorts and some fairly simple sneakers make up Robert's attire. Regardless of knowing that it is in-fact Betty you can't maintain yourself in front of Robert's body but by all means pretend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S--so... umm, what's up?\" You say.

Pretty normal.\" She jests in a sarcastic bout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th--that so...\" You say in a faded voice, nervously rubbing your legs and feet. Your head still sinking away from eye contact. Robert's face is soon right near yours as he-- she peers up at you in frustration. You jump away from the close encounter, letting out a small yelp. Betty curls her lip which you think looks intolerably cute on Robert's face. \"Yeesh, I know I have the body of a boy you like but come on. It's no wonder he hasn't asked you out, you're so fidgety.\" She reveals to you which makes you feel a bit pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but... anyways, let me get changed.\" You say as you head off to the changing room. You find yourself trying your best to fix your wet and messy hair as best you can. You stop yourself in disgust at how pathetic you are right now. \"It's not even the real Robert yet I can't stand not looking 100% in front of even his body. Maybe this is a good idea after all... if I learn to be more natural in front of him I may make him more comfortable as well.\" You reason. You exit the room and give your thoughts to Betty who seems a bit happy that you finally understand the purpose to her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this'll be good for both of you. Though I am a bit nervous on what Robert may do with my body.\" She says. You quickly interject that Robert would do no such filthy things with her body but she remains skeptic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever. I don't care, if he does something like that to me I'll do the same to him.\" She says with a sly grin of anticipation. You would normally scold her for something so dastardly but merely blush as you think of Robert... pleasuring himself. As your eyes continually focus and defocus on Betty she begins to place a hand on her hip and a scowl on her face. \"Hmm, you find my attractive right now huh?\" She asks, morbid curiosity riddled throughout her now lowered tone. You shake as many limbs as you can in disagreement and whimper out \"N--no! Of course not! Th--that's gross, you're my best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to deny it. Amazingly enough, having a male body has actually made me feel a bit.. more intimate about my own gender... such as yourself.\" She says as she pushes a hand against her crotch, you can clearly see her penis moving beneath.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the first time in your life another pair of lips are pressed against yours, to your delight it's the same pair you wanted them to be but in the nature of karma, they aren't wielded by the correct person. You feel hands placed tightly on your butt, pushing and grabbing them in interest. You are confused but continue to kiss her back despite knowing it's not the real Robert. <i>What do I do, what do I do?</i> You scream in your head. The girl who has always been your best friend and your backbone for anything is now in a boy's body and kissing you, you can't comprehend what the right thing to do is. Your lack of decision making eventually leads to instincts as you wrap your arms around Betty and deepen the kiss further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss eventually subsides and you both look at each for a moment in disbelief. \"We...we shouldn't.\" You say finally. Betty looks away in a bashful way that you have never seen her emit until now. The cute display of sudden shyness only makes you desire her more as she makes Robert look so very appealing. You yell at yourself for how wrong you are right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S--sorry but I couldn't help myself. I didn't... dislike it though, so you know.\" She says and you instantly kiss her, using more of the steam that drives this situation. You both walk slowly back in kiss towards the changing room. Betty releases her kiss and begins to drag down your pink skirt. \"I guess I should play fair\" She says as she takes off her shorts in turn. You swallow hard under the pressure of the situation, still in your mind debating the authenticity of the situation. \"Do... do we really want this?\" You ask of her. She shakes her head in uncertainty but debates out loud \"I'm not sure. I've always thought you were beautiful and had a wonderful personality but now-- with this body, I feel so much more.\" She declares as she helps you take off your shirt, in turn once more taking off her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind you being my first, Victoria.\" She says. You smile a bit, unsure if you're smiling because it's Robert's voice saying that or if you're truly enjoying Betty being the one you are with. She unstraps your bra and slowly lowers your panties, you grasp her boxers and reveal an aspect you have never gotten a real life look at. You blush but Betty caresses her fingers through your wet hair and begs for a kiss. You both moan in delight as Betty uses her borrowed genetics to fill you. You are overly amazed at how much better it feels than just masturbating. The pleasure continues as she rubs your breasts in the right ways and makes you feel fantastic on all counts. You can't help but smile in delight despite the guilt and pressure you are experiencing morally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay next to each other on the changing rooms small bench in satisfaction. \"Being a man is... cool.\" Betty says, using a joke context in her description. \"Being a woman isn't bad either.\" You tell her. Morally confused on what should happen from this point you..</span></div></div>",

She doesn't respond but merely nods slightly, joining you in the retrieval of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'll swap you back now, just let me get a bit away first.\" You say as you scurry out the room which now in-cases a lot of feelings you may never fully understand. You get off the school grounds before swapping Betty back with Robert. Under normal circumstances you would call for a ride from your mother but figuring that you could very well use the time alone, you decide to walk the mile and half back to your house. You keep your head down as you walk, lost in thought, the slates of the sidewalk passing by one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Do I like Betty that way? Was it just because it was Robert's body? How did Robert handle suddenly being Betty? Will he think it was all a dream? Do I like Betty or... Robert?</i>' All questions you wish you had an answer to chime in your head, each one carrying it's own voice as if a crowd of people were all wishing to speak to you. The questions stay with you the rest of the day, remaining as your primary focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo calls from Betty are received during the evening. You can only assume that despite Betty's upbeat medium that even she is struggling to comprehend the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have quite a lot of trouble drifting to sleep even knowing that you at least don't have school tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning is unsatisfying as you find your \"sleep on it\" plan had no effect. You sigh but drag yourself out of bed despite the continual confusion in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water from the shower hits your face it only resurfaces the images from yesterday. The feeling of Robert's lips against yours... the feeling of being pleasured by him-- if only. \"If only it was really him, this wouldn't be so complicated.\" You cry out in a somber drop of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about 10:00 A.M. you are shocked to find the name \"Betty\" written on your cellphone as it rings. In hesitant animosity you answer the phone with a weak \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think we need to talk. Mind coming to my house? No one is home right now.\" She informs you, questioning your attendance. You agree and hang up. You go to retrieve your bike when you find yourself looking in mirror, a bit self-conscious about your chosen attire; the black harnessed boots and long, black slim belted skirt and a hazy blue tight fitting tube top. You fix your hair, double-- triple checking yourself in full scan. You widen your eyes for a moment before pounding your head in disgust. \"I--I'm dressing a bit like Betty and... I can't stop thinking if I look O.K. I never care if Betty sees me at my best or my worst... until now.\" You admit to your lonesome. You hop on your bike and ride off to Betty's home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nerves scratch and maul your body as you knock on Betty's door. She opens it with a smile, which you would be relieved to see if it held any true emotion behind it. \"Hey.\" She says. You reply in a similar fashion as you enter her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice boots.\" She compliments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" You respond with a gay smile. \"So... I think we should discuss <i>that</i> despite it being awkward.\" You tell her, she agrees. Betty looks about in a nervous charade or so you would believe under normal circumstances but you can tell despite it's rarity that Betty for once is truly nervous. \"Can... can I kiss you?\" She asks in an adorable tilt of her head. You back away in shock to her sudden request. \"I know it's strange but I just... I'm really confused. I just want to see if even as a girl if I'll...\" You drifts off in her defense but slowly walks towards you. She perks her shimmering lips and gently places them against your own.</span></div></div>",

She eventually stops her episode and takes a deep breath with a gentle hand on her chest. \"That's a relief.\" She says as she opens her eyes, a radiant smile accompanying her as she turns towards you. You merely blink in confusion but at the same time feel a bit relieved by Betty's sudden reversal to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for kissing you. I just wanted to see... well, if I really did like you in that way. I don't think I do which is ni-- erm... do you feel the same?\" She questions, her ecstatic explanation turning to concern from your unchanging face of discomfort. You shake your head to wake up your body's sudden ill responses to your relief. \"O-oh, Sorry. I was still a bit shocked. I uhh... don't think I have feelings for you either.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! I was a bit scared this may have only been one sided.\" She says in repeated relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to say it's not.\" You assure her with a smile. She suddenly begins to eye you, a bitchy grin taking place of her delighted smile. \"So what's with the dark outfit?\" She asks, waving a finger at your character. You stumble over a response and just shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From my <i>personal</i> experience as you, I can assure you that you should stick with your bright colors. They bring out your blue eyes and bright, perfect-- I wish I had it, Hair.\" She says to you. You giggle and take her opinion to heart. \"Alright, alright, I guess your one day as me is enough to make you an expert at being me.\" You comply in a sarcastic avert. You strain your fingers through your hair, a bit of you taking her compliment to heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I get any advice?\" She catapults at you in response to your sarcasm. You think for a moment a finger taking place upon your lip. \"Maybe umm... Y--you're perfect as is.\" You tell her, lacking the ability for formulate any flaw about her. She sighs and straddles herself into a seat, a hand enveloped into her hair and legs split, revealing her ironic pink panties beneath her dark skirt. \"Well if I was perfect, I wouldn't have felt more attractive when I was you.\" She states, serious but maintaining a smile after her acting display of discourtesy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle at her display but blush at her admiration. You take a seat with her at the kitchen table, folding your hands loosely over your legs. \"So... I know it's kind over but... why did you kiss me-- yesterday I mean.\" You ask her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expressions fades to a more serious outlook as she spirals to face you. \"I... well... O.K., I admit that when I was a boy I <i>did</i> find you attractive, I noticed it when I saw you at the pool but I never felt like I couldn't control myself until... later. I'm not sure what happened but all of the sudden Robert's... you know-- well it felt like I was going to cum and I just couldn't resist anymore and decided to go after you. At the time I thought I just had feelings for you but now I think it was just Robert's body. I don't get it though, I was fine for awhile-- I had an er..ection far before I even whistled at you but it just suddenly got so hard to control.\" She explains in an emotional twister of indescribable feelings you are sure as even Betty feels uncomfortable reliving it. You place a hand on hers as it rests on the table and smile. \"It looks like being a man is a bit too much for us girls to handle in such short strides.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... but I don't like how you phrased it. Makes it seem like being a man is harder than being a woman.\" She argues. You shrug. \"Who knows, maybe it is. We'll never know for sure.\" You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curls her lip and retrieves her hand from beneath yours. \"Everyone but you that is-- Ms. Body Switcher.\" She grumbles. You tilt your head and give a forced laugh and awkward smile. Suddenly Betty's eyes light up as she rises from her chair, looking through the world directly at what looks like an idea forming in her small head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god~ I have a great idea.\" She says with a risen voice. \"I--it doesn't involve my unknown power does it?\" You ask out of predictable patterns that have been forming lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does.\" She says bluntly. You force a laugh and shake your head. \"Didn't you learn anything? I shouldn't abuse this sudden... gift.\" You retort before her idea is even placed on the table. She shakes her hand but remains lit by her idea. \"I know, I know but... think about it. You could make a living with your power.\" She states. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit thrown off by her idea as it is far from what you expected to hear, you ask \"How so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think about it. Psychologists and stuff help couples with their problems sometimes. You have the ultimate psychological ability ever! You could swap the couples around and let them see how tough it is to be the other. Truly understanding one another and what not or you know, something similar to that. You could even just have people pay money to be someone else for whatever amount of time. No school or education required for this kind of job just a completely out of this world ability that develops on it's own.\" She explains. </span></div></div>",

It's a good idea.\" She says, amplifying your own thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm worried, people may mess with each others lives or something.\" You say. Betty shrugs. \"Well, put a clause saying you're not responsible for that sort of stuff.\" She replies. You fold your arms under your bust and think about it, a better idea soon springing from your conscience. \"Better yet, this needs to be more a beneficial cause. I think we should only swap with the consent of both people.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, not as fun but I guess that would work better.

I happened to have a friend who has quite a bit of costumes. You look like a sexy fortune teller.\" She replies in a rude quip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do--\" You begin before lowering the mask over your face. \"It's hard to speak in this thing-- anyways, you do too.\" You finish. You can't tell if she is smiling but you see her brows raise. \"So what's with the choice of buildings?\" You ask as you look around at the wooden cabin you're occupying, a table and  large leather chair present. She lowers her mask as well and places her hands outright in protest. \"Come on! We're 18, we don't exactly own any housing. This cabin is just a little ways into the woods and a cousin of mine built it but only as some child showing of skill, he never goes here. Besides, there is a road going here at least and it's not far from my house.\" She responds. You shrug it off and sit back down at your over-emphasized chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is going to come to some random little wooden cabin in the woods for something as stupid as \"body swapping?\"\" You ask, your head relaxing in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I sent out a few of the papers we made but with the prices I'm sure not too many people may show-- well no, I'm sure someone will.\" She says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10$ dollars for every hour or 150$ for every 24 hours or 500$ for every week.\" You quote as you lift up one of the same papers Betty sent out to god-knows where. \"Body swapping, had I not obtained this random power I may not have believed in such a thing, I imagine most people feel this is a weird hoax.\" You analyze in a somber bout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only takes one-- well two in this case!\" Betty chimes in from behind you, a finger symbolizing her vocals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But will two come is the question?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd pay for an hour to see if it actually worked. Once whoever that is comes in, he'll tell his friends and boom, business! Besides, I say we look pretty legit from these forms you have to fill out!\" Betty claims. You give an invisible smile and shrug at her response. \"Guess I'll wait a little longer.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock is eventually heard from outside along with the screaming of a young girl. \"Let go of me!\" you hear as the door opens. You see a bald, well stature man in a business suit come in, an older woman who you believe looks to be in her 50s entering from behind him whom you assume to be his wife. She has her hair up in a bun and is wearing a quite expensive looking golden colored dress. You and Betty can't help but look at each other in amazement or perhaps uncontrollable delight as you both chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" You holler out, a bit nervous to be a store owner, though you find the mask helps quite a bit in diminishing your emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some sort of hoax or the real deal?\" The man asks as he enters the room. You follow his arm to reveal a girl about 5'2, one you recognize no less; it's Trisha, a cheerleader you talked to previously when you became Sharon. The young girl typically has a foul look on her face, she has dull blond hair that goes to about her chin, her leveled bangs only increasing her very easy hairstyle. Unsurprisingly, she is also wearing her cheer leading outfit, you do recall them practicing on Saturdays. \"Daddy, let go of my arm!\" She screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty steps forward and bows in quite a polite gesture on her part. \"Welcome, I assure you this is indeed 100% real and legit. I'm sure the unpronounced ambiance must speak the opposite but I assure you this is real.\" She breaks down for them, demonstrating her clearly natural acting ability. You are impressed and can't help but smile despite Betty being unable to see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" The lady says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O--oh!\" You stutter and stand up, motioning for them to sit down. \"Please have a seat.\" You offer, which they take in quite a bit of courtesy with the exception of Trisha who writhes in rejection to the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" You say in confusion. You wonder if they know what is going on more than you do. \"Ah, yes. I hear you only offer up to a week but I will give you 1,500$ for a month-- assuming this works.\" The man says, leaving you and Betty completely baffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F--fifteen thousand!?\" You both blurt out. The man reaffirms his offer. You take a deep breath to try and pick up on the fact this is really happening. \"So... you would like to, switch with... your wife?\" You question. The couple laughs at the remark and replies that that is not the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beautiful wife here would like to swap with our daughter.\" He says. You look at Trisha in a slow tilt of your head. She blows her hands up in rejection. \"Dad! That's gross, I do not want to be mom. Hmph, not like it matters, switching bodies-- how stupid.\" She confirms as she folders her arms and legs in a convinced mindset. Despite wanting to prove her wrong, you decide to stick with your policy. \"I'm sorry but our paper clearly says we only accept two willing applicants.\" You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband shifts himself a bit which actually makes you a bit nervous considering his quite huge muscles. \"I understand that but I would like for an exception. You see... our daughter here is failing school, hanging around friends who do little to add to her person and overall not living in a very efficient way. I do not want to see our child have to come to depend on us in the future. That is why I want my wife to help our daughter change, even if it is cruel.\" He explains his situation to you which you actually find quite noble act by the parents-- granted a unique method to try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you dad! I like my friends just because they aren't as boring and stupid as you doesn't mean they aren't my friends!\" Trisha screams as she struggles to get away. \"O--one moment.\" You say as you divert yourself to Betty who leans down next to you. \"What do you think?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Trisha is failing school in quite a spectacular way, almost straight Fs. She also bitches out her teachers and everyone else as well. I'm quite amazed she isn't kicked off the cheer leading team either. I say do it, she could use the forced aid.\" Betty elaborates in her divulged opinion. As you often do, you take her choice as your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" The woman says. Trisha just groans at how \"lame\" this is. You move a paper in front of them and ask them to fill them out. \"Mary Hillsburry...\" you quote as she writes her name under the transferee #1 request. \"I would like umm... your daughter's signature but she seems rather unwilling. You can just write her name for her. I would like you to put your name on here as well Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert.\" He finishes for you and does as you ask. They fill out the rest of the common place things such as address, phone number and the like. He places the money down on the table which you are surprised to find in cash. \"Y--you're quite rich, aren't you?\" You joke at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" Mary says with a grin of confidence and superiority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two ready?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we need to do anything special?\" She asks. You shake your head in response. \"No, I'll do it right now.\" You assure them but Trisha just cocks her head and mumbles \"How stupid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish Mary Hillsburry and Trisha Hillsburry switched bodies.</i> You wish to yourself. It doesn't take long for the mother to be all over her daughter's body in astonishment or long for Trisha to find that she is now 50 or so years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck! I--i--it really worked!? G--give me my body back!\" Trisha screams, a most eery dislike forming on her face as she speaks using her mother's voice. Mary however seems quite pleased with her daughter's rather iffy appearance or so you assume as you watch her fluff her cheerleader skirt with a smile and enthusiasm. \"Oh my~ dear it worked!\" She says as she tilts her head high to get an eyes view of her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really in there, honey?\" He asks. She nods in a lot of excitement but does turn her attention towards you, thanking you repeatably. \"Y--your welcome.\" You say out of obligation, truthfully a bit mixed on if you did the right thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, in 30 days you will be switched back. If you need to swap back before then, you need to contact us in someway.\" Betty refers to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to swap back right fucking now!\" Trisha screams. The husband grabs his Trisha and drags her off, the now young wife skipping eagerly to follow. \"Thank you very much. I'll make sure Trisha is quite at home in my wife's body.\" He says as he closes the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief and heavy yourself in your chair. \"Ugh, that was intense.\" You complain. Betty however eagerly picks up the money and smiles. \"1,500$ dollars in less than a couple hours after waiting. Amazing.\" She says in a somewhat anticipated hype. \"I love you, Victoria!\" You screams as she hugs you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R--right.\" You say. </span></div></div>",

You just made 1,500$!\" She says towards you. You lower your head and adjust some of your quite baggy robes. \"How can I be? I don't feel like I did the right thing at all! More over-- what kind of family goes to a cabin for something so silly?\" You jibe with a raised arm, the velvety robes falling down your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kind of family.\" She responds. The blunt reply doing anything but answering your question. \"They seemed nice, a bit overly open-minded granted but nice. Maybe they thought it would be fun? Some people like strange experiences even if it's a hoax.\" She elaborates. You shrug and nod out of your inability to form any argument against her claims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 15 minutes later the leaning door to your cabin opens once more. Small hands grasping the wooden handle, you notice a young boy with black short hair, behind him a small girl with similarly colored hair, though much longer. The both deem bright smiles as they look at you two. \"Wow, real wizards!\" The young boy spouts. You rub your eyes in an instinctive response to his hilarious assumption.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, young travelers.\" Betty shouts out. You can't help but chuckle at her enthusiasm as you turn your head towards her with a covered smile. The two young children scatter around you two, tugging on your robes with minor strength. \"Can you really do magic!?\" The young girl asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I can do what the paper says, body swapping.\" You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha' does tha' mean?\" The boy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, if I swapped you with your sister. You'd look just like her and she would look like you-- you'd be each other.\" You explain to their eager minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! So I'd be my big brother?\" The girl lightens up in a question of reconfirmation. \"Umm... y-yes.\" You answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... but we have no money, sis!\" The boy cries out. Both of them seem to pout which makes you feel a bad. \"Umm, I can swap you two for a few minutes just so you can experience it, I guess.\" You tell them, they lighten up once more and spam thank yous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about swapping them but find it quite difficult to focus without names to give their faces. \"Umm, what are your names?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimberly Gerlance.\" She says.<br>\r\n\"Jeffery Gerlance.\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish once more them to swap, names in place of the loose descriptions you had given them previously. They look at each other before brimming smiles and dashing around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm my brother~\" Kim shouts as she scurries around the room. Jeff follows with similar reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two live near the woods, I've met them before.\" Betty tells you as she situates herself next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch them play for a few minutes before switching them back. They seem disappointed upon returning to normal but thank you regardless and leave. \"Can we go now?\" You say as you raise from your chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I can live with 1,500$.\" She says. You look around the room before sighing in disgust from the lack of storage. \"I don't want to walk home carrying these robes, people may suspect us or something.\" You say to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, the only good part about this cabin is this...\" She begins as she kneels down to a plank of wood which she pulls away to reveal a hole in the ground, plated with metal barriers. \"we can put everything in here.\" she finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your robes and put them in the small storage space, Betty follows similar actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both return to your rightful homes. The next morning you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A hand of his ravages his nicely laid hair as he steps forward cautiously. \"H--hey, is this sort of thing for real?\" He asks as he takes a seat across from you. You merely stare at him from behind your cowl in awe before being awakened by Betty's oddly chosen Irish accent. \"It is indeed real but we usually don't offer free trials.\" She tells him as she nudges your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A--ah! H--how can we help-- be of service?\" You struggle to say between your nervous stutters. You watch him diligently, enveloped with each of his nervous glances around the room as he mumbles random mismatched sentences. \"How do I put this? There's this girl I like...\" He claims which raise your eyes higher than they've ever been with a record in heartbeats to match. \"And you want to swap with her?\" Betty assumes but before he is allowed to answer such a question you press your hands against the table and ask a more personal question... \"Who is it!?\" The eagerness of the question seems to put him off but after a moments hesitation her does begin to answer... \"I guess you'd probably need to know that anyways. Her name's Victoria and she's...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you cannot hear what descriptions her provides for you due to his dampening volume, you're left absolutely speechless as despite your inkling that Robert may like you, you never thought you would really hear it. You sink into your chair with a sigh of delight, Betty's chuckles of enthusiasm only sinking the truth in further. You can't believe it but Robert really did just say that he likes you, in person, right in front of you and if not for the cowl masking your face, he would be saying it to you knowingly. \"Um... is something wrong?\" He asks as he peers over the small desk which has now surpassed your view point from your sliding. \"Oh, no, nothing.\" You bark with a chipper echo as you sit yourself back up straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds of mute stares leave you fumbling for what to do before Betty asks her question yet again... \"So you want to swap with her?\" He chuckles and bashfully tugs at his cheeks, you can't help but be intoxicated by his cuteness. \"I-- I can't even imagine that but uh... the thing I sort of want to know if she likes me too. I think swapping with her directly would bad-- err... be bad, it may she just make her think I'm creepy or something.\" He explains but in truth, you'd love the proposal simply because you know he wants it-- though you must admit the idea of being a man is far too out there for you. \"Anyways, yesterday I had the strangest experience where I was in Victoria's best friends body. It was so odd and I had no idea what was going on but it did give me an idea.\" He continues but as he reaches such a point, Betty chimes in yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To test this we were swapping students at a nearby school, it's possible you were involved.\" She informs him which leaves a pleasant smile along his lips. \"Really? So that was real? It-- it sure felt real...\" He tells you as a few of his fingers press against his chest for just long enough to give you a hint at what he means. You turn to Betty, finding her eye contact fading as she nervously scratches at the base of neck. \"So...\" Robert begins, not providing you time to relish in Betty's nervous disposition. \"I was thinking that if I swapped with Betty I co-- Betty's the name of her best friend by the way. I could figure out if she likes me pretty easily. Is that... possible?\" He finishes with the proposal which leaves Betty and you gesturing with each other with only your eyes. \"One moment.\" You say as you huddle in the back with Betty. \"What do we do?\" You ask but what you really want to know is if Betty is alright with it. Sure you're a little put off that Robert really is too shy to just ask you directly with some confidence but at least you know he's willing to do quite a lot for you. \"You want me to swap with him? Even if I do, if we do it right now it'll be a problem.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but we have to tell him something. Just tell me if you want to do it or not. If you don't we can just tell him the real rules-- in other words, that he needs your consent.\" You say towards Betty who's eyes whisk away as she makes a decision.</span></div></div>",

You meet his poorness with cruel eyes, crushing it dastardly with a soft smile and a non-existent 'special... \"Love is involved so let's just call this a free special we're having.\" You tell him as you lean across the desk between you, your long sleeves gliding around the papers along it. \"Really? Thank you!\" He exclaims as he pounds his fist into his hand several times; the excitement illuminating his energy while Betty remains starved of such a thing as you hear her cries from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how does this work?\" He asks as his fists settle to a stop and his eyes docile to a captivating innocence. You didn't really think much about how to swap him with Betty but thankfully Betty herself seems to have as she steps closer. \"Normally we need the consent of both but since we're nice, we're not making you follow that rule so tonight while you're asleep you'll be swapped with this Betty girl. Do us all a favor and try to get everything done in one day, alright?\" She explains. He nods several times as he lifts from his chair to shake both of your hands. \"I will, thank you both for this.\" He says as he backs out of the shack almost in a run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowl slides off both of your faces as you both fall to a sit with long sighs to release the pressure. \"You owe me.\" Betty says bluntly as she unmasks her face to show the stern expression beneath. You unmask yourself as well as you ponder what to even say towards her generous willingness. Her cold expression seems to fail and her knees become anxious as they bob up and down in her Indian style as you plainly stare at her without a word. She eventually just lets out a loud groan and rolls onto her back. \"Ah! He better not do anything to me-- though I guess after what we did with his body... I can't really be critical.\" She realizes as you both swell up in the face as the feelings from yesterday come swirling back. You certainly can't deny how much you loved the feeling, it's almost pathetic that your first time was with Betty even if it was Robert's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess being a man was kinda cool so I guess I don't mind <i>that</i> much but... you still owe me.\" She states once more as she climbs to her feet and begins to remove of her robes, as you do. \"Thanks again for this.\" You tell her as you both prepare to leave but her sweat glistening face does little to realize a happy disposition. \"I don't know why you don't just ask him out. You're both wimps at this.\" She says rather cruelly as she walks by you. You merely laugh awkwardly as you follow in her wake as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay up a few hours later than usual to make sure both Betty and Robert are fast asleep and cast a thought in your mind that they would both swap places just before your own head hits your pillow...</span></div></div>",

We just happened to think a school would be a good place to test this new ability.\" Betty says from behind you, feigning a quite expressive Irish accent. Sharon remains quiet as she thinks about the evidence formed against her before eventually shrugging it off. \"Fine. However, I would like something you did to me yesterday done again.\" She states. You blink a few times as you think about what it could be but later ask \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to swap me back with Victoria Wilson.\" She says in quite a serious statement. \"I.. uh.. well, I'm afraid you need two willing participants.\" You reply, stammering over the shock that Sharon wants to be you again.

Sharon wears a foul expression of disappointment as she clicks her tongue in frustration, arms folded under her large breasts. \"Well, how much would it take for you to do it without her consent?\" She questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot.\" You reply on reflex. \"How much to do it permanently? Name a price.\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P--permanently?\" You and Betty both blurt out. \"Why do you want to be this girl so much?\" You ask out of vicious curiosity. Sharon's serious expression fades to a much more docile, timid expression as she gazes down at herself. \"I--I don't know. I've just always been jealous of her. I'm rich, I'm pretty and popular, yet I find myself jealous of her no matter what. When I saw her reflection as my own I knew it was how I wanted to look-- exactly.\" She admits to you which only blows your mind in quite a vast way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks aren't everything.\" You hear Betty say from behind you. \"I'm aware of that... but it's not just looks. You can't tell me you haven't just felt something and thought it was right. Some people find true love from just a feeling they get. I found a body that feels like it was made for me, flaws and all, I want to look like her. Does this sound bizarre? My parents sent me to a psychologist about it once. He said that I just projecting all my desires into Victoria, basically forcing her image to what I really wanted when it really isn't-- but I think I really do want to be her.\" She elaborates. The sincere, cooperative girl in front of you is not like you experienced when you were Betty but as yourself you have always noticed Sharon being overly nice to you. This explains her singled expressions towards you and you alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O--one moment.\" You say as you stand out of your chair to speak with Betty. \"She's nuts.\" Betty says as soon as your ear is close enough for her whisper. \"I found it really weird when she was so mean to me when I was you compared to how nice she was to me when I was myself. I guess this explains it. So... what do we do?\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say some outrageous price so she leaves or just just say no-- obviously.\" Betty suggests.</span></div></div>",

You sigh in defeat as you think about how this will all go over. \"Are you ready to swap, Sharon?\" You hear over the line along with a \"Yes!\" in quite a loud burst. You place the phone in your purse and with quivering lips say \"I wish... Sharon and I swapped bodies.\" The natural feelings that usually accompany your wishes for swaps continue to remain constant as you say the words, despite being negligent towards the switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively touch your forehead in response to the swap. In place of your normally parted hair you feel fine hair placed in a line across your brow, extending in length as it reaches the edge of your eye, continually lengthening until it reaches your elbows in length. You look down to find yourself wearing a white scoopneck shirt, plumping quite nicely from the large chest features you now possessed. Lowering to your legs you notice small denim shorts covering a slim section of your thighs, the rest of your legs quite ample. Cool tan colored skin making up your coverage, a trait you are quite amazed you didn't notice the last time you were in Sharon's body. You bring a hand up to scratch your head only to notice of the very beautiful fake nails on your fingers; though you think they look nice, you have never once wanted to use them as they are quite a nuisance to have on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Betty asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly. It's me, Victoria.\" You say as you scratch your scalp with your bright nails. Betty shakes her head and places a open suitcase on the table, opening it up to reveal a vast amount of cash which you can't help but lean over. \"Woah!\" you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am pretty sure with this 5 million dollars, the transaction is complete which would make you... Sharon Winterly.\" She explains to you with a bit of a sly grin as she lowers the mask on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W--what!? No way!\" You protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way, you just sold your body/life for 5 million dollars. I'm going to call you Sharon now in spirits of our transaction and our newly acquired profit.\" She tells you which you can't help but nearly cry over. \"But I don't... want to be Sharon.\" you pout. Betty slaps your loose hand on the table which you quickly retract in reflex. \"Sorry, Sharon but I'm overall quite surprised you went through with it. So since you actually did, I think it's just that I call you Sharon from now on since you have her body, voice and what not. Hey, at least you're not bitchy like the real Sharon, you're still my best friend-- you just look different.\" She explains to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... hopefully Sharon gets sick of being me quickly so I can return to normal...\" You say in hope of returning to a normal life. </span></div></div>",

You lower your head and dispatch of the mirror. \"I just want to see if she really will like my life as much as she thinks she will. Then I'll switch back.\" You reply. She straightens herself, hands placed a tad above her behind. \"Which makes you Sharon right now.\" She affirm. A twitch from the sad fact being your only response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which...\" She begins, a sly grin forming on her perky lips. \"Since you're my best friend now Sharon, can I see your house?\" She asks of you.

You do however stumble over your lack of knowledge about Sharon's situation. \"Hey, where does Sharon live?\" You ask. Betty stops in her tracks, bringing a finger to her chin in thought-- later folding her arms. \"I uhh... can't seem to remember. If she is so rich, I find it hard to believe she lives near the school, not sure why she goes to this school if she lives far away either.\" She answers, supplying no new information to the endeavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes going <i>home</i> a bit difficult.\" You jolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call one of your butlers or something to come pick you up.\" She suggests in a demeaning expression of her voice. You glance away with a distorted smile. \"I uh... don't think all rich people have maids and stuff.\" You disclose to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, check your purse.\" She says, situating herself next to you. You dig through the purse finding: make up, the mirror, papers and all sorts of random assortments, a wade of money and a school ID. \"Nothing in here about her address.\" You announce as you take out Sharon's cellphone to surf through her contacts. You do find one labeled \"home\" and press it. The phone rings for a few short rings before being picked up by a raspy sounding individual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winterly residence.\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's me, S--Sharon.\" You divulge to him despite never wanting to say that you were in-fact her at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, miss...</span></div></div>",

Shouldn't he still be there?\" He responds and without much evidence against the man's existence you say \"Oh, right. Sorry.\" and hang up. Betty and you walk outside of the woods to find a limousine parked just a few feet from the dirt road. Your unmanageable discomfort is brought into sound as you whine between shut lips. Betty however is quite ecstatic as she clenches both her arms in excitement. \"Wow, I've never been in a limo before. You're the best friend ever, Sharon.\" She exclaims with an underlying layer of insult to your position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the somber feeling of even your best friend calling you Sharon and step over to the limo with small wavering steps. Betty soon grows weary of your lack of enthusiasm and pushes you forward. You trip over your heels several times before stumbling into the window of the limo, an oriental man looking back at you. You say \"Sorry\" but he seems to pay it no mind as he climbs out the limo only to open the door for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will we be heading, miss?\" He asks. Sitting in the backseat with the galvanizing Betty, you struggle to even come up with an answer to such a simple question. \"Um... I'd like to go home.\" You respond after a long moment of thinking or to be more precise, watching Betty take hold of everything in the limo. You can't say you're not also impressed by the sheer size of it but your focus is unfortunately on your own body even after the car motions itself towards a home you've never been to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly grind your long nails against your scalp and through the long pale brown hair which Sharon just so recently gave to you. It's nice and all but you find your own much more desirable. \"I know she is pretty and all but I don't think I could ever get used to this.\" You pout as you look into the many things reflecting your current image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty takes her hand out of one of the many small drawers and leans back against you. \"Calm down, would you? You have the power to change it all back. There is no point in worrying so much, Sharon.\" She reasons for you which would have been a nice gesture had she not teased you with your current name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window after a ten minute drive you wonder what neighborhood you're in until you hear and feel the car stop that is. You look a bit confused but as you gaze out the front windshield you find a huge house at the end of this apparent yard which you mistook for a neighborhood. Betty's gasps of astonishment are contagious as you exit the car spewing similar amazement. \"T--thanks for the ride.\" You say to the driver who takes the comment in with little satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no wonder I never knew where she lived. Did her parents build this place or something? There are no other houses like this anywhere here.\" Betty wonders out loud as you both trek across the gap between the car and house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no one at the door you open it to a home drenched with vibes of the rich. You can't accurately describe it but the building actually makes you blush from it's beauty. Despite it's abundance of accessories, you don't find anyone in the large home even after trekking upstairs at Betty's request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool.\" Betty chimes as she glides a hand across the grandfather clock in the hallway which begins to chime along with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels... wrong.\" You whisper as you make your way through the halls as if looking for something, perhaps Sharon's room. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turns around with a book in her hand which you assume is a diary of sorts but Betty soon corrects you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a diary per say, it's something much cooler.\" She begins as she seats herself next to you, utilizing such a small portion of the giant space provided. You lift yourself upward and look over her shoulder, a bit amazed while mutually disgusted by the sight. The book Betty found doesn't really tell you much about Sharon at least in the way you would like to know-- it does however, tell a lot about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D--don't tell me she has been stalking me.\" You exhume from your perplexed emotions. Betty scratches her head and tosses her hair briefly before shrugging with a twisted grin. \"She's quite crazy. I'm only skimming but this whole book seems to about you. What you like to eat, wear, do for fun and other such things-- hell, it even has some details on your family. She is far more obsessed with you than I thought.\" Rattles Betty as she continues to flip through the book. The feeling of discomfort and the actions it takes on your body certainly seem to be common as your new stomach begins to tie itself around and around. \"I-- this is... not right.\" You mumble as you snatch the book from Betty's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she be this-- I don't understand. She's pretty and popular and from my perspective before all this happened, nice as well. This isn't right...\"</span></div></div>",

However, for<br>\r\nsome strange reason, you decided to give the girl a chance by indulging her<br>\r\nbiggest wish : swapping permanently with you. Well, technically, just<br>\r\nswapping with you, the \"permanent\" part being completely up to you, since<br>\r\nyou had the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that you completely rejected everything about Sharon would be false.<br>\r\nAfter all, the girl was nice to you when you were still Victoria, and the fact that<br>\r\nyou now had her seemingly endless amounts of money was also a nice touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepy part was the stalking/obsession thing. Finding her \"stalker diary\"<br>\r\nwas just the last nail in the coffin : being Sharon Winterly was okay, but the<br>\r\ngirl was waaaaaay too obsessed to be let in your body. You then decided to<br>\r\ngo and confront her about the swap, tell her you possessed the power, and<br>\r\nmost probably swap back to your original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left your house with what appeared to be Sharon's car - a pink bmw m6<br>\r\nconvertible, who looked like it was seldom used - and drove Betty back to her<br>\r\nhouse, promising her to call her later. You could tell she was a little disappointed<br>\r\nto see you wanting to swap back so fast, but she seemed to understand your motives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then drove back to your old house, finding it incredibly dull in comparison to<br>\r\nSharon's. On the way, you had to readjust the rear mirror and you found yourself once<br>\r\nagain drawn to Sharon's -now your- reflection. Hell, even if some things looked too fake<br>\r\nto be any good -the extra effort on the tan, the fake nails that were extremely hard to<br>\r\nadjust to- the girl was probably THE most beautiful girl in school...The only thing she was<br>\r\nlacking and that maybe you had was this \"girl next door look\" that you sometimes hated in<br>\r\nyou. Everything in Sharon screamed sophistication, which was good but also made the girl<br>\r\nalmost unreachable...You thought you'd love to have that \"girl next door\" look back, and <br>\r\nyou were on your way to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flurry of thoughts still buzzing in your mind, you realized you had arrived at your house.<br>\r\nYou parked the car, and went on to ring the doorbell. The door opened to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sharon looks at you for several seconds before realizing she is no longer Victoria and after a brief self-discovery, raises herself from the chair in protest. \"G--give me my body back!\" She screams it far too loudly so you calmly ask her to be quiet about it. You lean forward, placing an arm for support on the table. \"I'm the one who has the ability to switch bodies. Now stop ignoring it and tell me the real reason you want to be me.\" You demand, gazing deeply into her shifting eyes that quiver from her predicament. \"How can you do that?\" She asks but you shoot down her attempt to change the subject with a quick and sadly true answer. \"Don't know. Now tell me why you want to be me. I saw that creepy book of yours, it's just pages and pages about me.\" The mention of the book brings an ill expression onto the front of Sharon's face. Her lips open and close as if to start speaking but they do nothing but shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's far from your expectations but a tear finds it's way down Sharon's face, dripping only out of one eye while the other shimmers under the warm sun's light. She wipes it away the moment she feels it's cool touch, turning away from you in embarrassment. \"L--look... I don't have a real reason. I just want to be you. I like everything about you and for the longest time I thought I was in love with you but I didn't find any other girl attractive in the slightest-- hell, I thought I would sooner find myself attractive before some random girl.\" She begins her somber ramble, weakness and disorientation making up her fortitude. You are quite sure that this expression is something you had made a frequent visit to while you had Sharon's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reviews her body with a revolted character, coming to the conclusion that this really isn't how she wants to be. She wears a meek smile and while continuing to gaze at herself continues her words... \"By most people's definition I am far prettier than you and even I sort of agree but I feel so much better as you. Everything... your face, your hair, your voice, your body... your life. It all feels right to me.\" You begin to feel uneasy, unconsciously bringing visual memory to each listing she makes, recalling yourself to see if you feel the same way she does about your body and life. She then shakes her head vigorously, her pale hair flourishing behind her and lashing at her face and as the motions end she clasps her hands together and leans toward you. \"Please! I'm begging you... let me be you. I guarantee you I appreciate everything about your body and life more than you do! It felt perfect-- exactly how I want to be. My psychiatrist was wrong, I really <i>do</i> want to be you. So please...\" She pleads with sincerity so endowed with clarity that she is assured that this is indeed exactly what she wants and you can regretfully sense that and amazingly, you feel guilty about keeping your own body. \"You want me to give up my life?\" You ask weakly, questioning whether or not you care about your life more than Sharon does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs but nods to your blunt question. She then takes up your hand, grasping it with both of hers. \"I'm prettier than you, rich, popular, and yet I'm unhappy with this life. It's a great life but I want to be you-- with all your flaws, they're all perfect. Please...\" Her pleads don't fall onto deaf ears-- though you wish they were as you cannot believe you are hesitant that staying as yourself is 'fair.' In the end you...</span></div></div>",

You look up at her only to watch her explode from confusion to happy little girl who got what she wanted. After jumping from joy in the most literally of ways, she leans and spams \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" She only ceases her repetition to assure a small fear she has... \"Wait, are you going to keep us this way for good?\" You have no answer to that question and merely lift one hand to shrug to her a \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes it as a yes apparently, as she smiles eagerly before suddenly batting you on the chest. \"Oh! Stay here, I'll be right back.\" She says and scurries off into the house. Perhaps she cannot sense how uncertain you are about all of this-- though you feel it's pretty clear as you're trying your best to convey it on your <i>new</i> face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes scurrying back with a pen and paper and promptly starts writing things down. \"I thought you could use some information about yourself, S--Sharon.\" She says, looking up at you nervously (probably frightened about losing your body) after calling you by her own name. \"I definitely could use some.\" You admit with a nod and let her go at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... you're a 34D... my locker combination is... you're 5'11... you have my taste buds now so believe me you'll enjoying eating these... class schedule... date of birth...\" She mumbles aloud with each thing she writes but you really have no interest in it even if you are impressed by the 34D and 5'11. You don't really want to admit that you are actually giving up your life but while Sharon lists off the aspects of her body and life, all you can focus on is her shining smile; so pure in it's creation, in-fact you don't think you have ever seen such a happy expression. It disgusts you to realize it but you know that Sharon probably really does like being you more than you do. You sure never felt perfect when you were in your own body but at least you didn't feel awkward like you do now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go!\" She exclaims suddenly, bursting you out of your trance and into a state of revision as you glance over the quite expansive list of details. \"Thanks...\" You say softly as you stand from the table and begin walking around the house to return to Sharon's or rather your car. \"I can't thank you enough for this. If you need anything let me know O.K?\" She assures to you her good intentions and while you're thankful, you still don't believe you're really doing this. \"Thanks.\" You reply but she seems disappointed. \"I know I was rude but I've always wanted to be friends with you. I'd like it if we could be.\" She informs you after taking a firm stance in front of you. You are actually a bit happy about hearing that. Being a sucker for friendship, you smile and nod in agreement. \"I'd like that too, Sharon.\" You reply but it's taken in once more with disappointment and with a pleading smile and gentle cupping of her cheeks, Sharon asks... \"Can you please call me Victoria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hesitant to appease such a request but in the end concede, if not only so you can leave and gather yourself together. \"Alright. Well, I'll see you at school tomorrow, V--Victoria...\" You say and rush to your car but sadly catch a glimpse of her satisfied smile before turning around. \"Bye Sharon!\" She hollers and as you turn out of the driveway, you can see her waving, still bright eyed. You sigh and smack yourself in the head, disgusted with how opposite that went. You were supposed to walk out of there with your body but instead almost said to her face that she could keep your body for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepressed with your confrontation skills you...</span></div></div>",

You wave too, you watch through the window how Betty steps inside her car and drives off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were alone again, not a surprise anymore. You try to think about something else, you have to take over Betty's life, at least for a while. You could check out her Facebook, she had some other friends than you. But you could also try to call Sharon in your body, see if she can 'pretends' to be you or at least act like you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're immensely disappointed as Betty shakes her head and with a little spunk you quiz her on why as she seemed eager about it yesterday. She shrugs while rubbing the back of her neck. \"I wouldn't mind swapping in a few days for a few hours but being Sharon permanently? No thanks.\" She deems and while you are sure she is finished, you are proven wrong as she crouches down beside her bed and pulls out a silver case from under it, something you recognize as the container Sharon gave to you as payment. \"Besides... one of the perks to being Sharon was being rich but we're pretty wealthy now ourselves.\" Betty says with a sly grin as she holds up one of the wades of money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh but end up chuckling loosely from Betty's giddy expression but in denial of being happy about anything right now you plummet yourself face first into the bed, smothering your laughter. The discomfort from lying belly first is only more prominent as you lay atop Sharon's even heftier breasts. You promptly roll over to relieve the ache, finding Betty standing above you looking curiously down at you. \"By the way, did you ask Sharon about how she got this much money from her parents?\" She asks and it is something you do want to know yourself, especially since if she got it without permission it could be a huge problem for <i>you</i> right now. \"No...but I'll find out.\" You say as you pull out Sharon's phone and dial your number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You hear over the line, still retaining the gleeful chirp that Sharon left you with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sharon, it's Victori-- well, you probably guessed that. Anyways I w---\" You greet her as natural but as before, Sharon is not appeased and refuses to continue any conversation until you <i>'correct'</i> yourself. You sigh and repeat using the words she wants to hear... \"Hello Victoria... it's Sharon.\" Sharon beams a satisfied \"Thank you\" while Betty struggles to hold back her laughter from the sidelines. You toss Betty a quick glare before returning to what you wished to ask. \"I was wondering how you got all that money. I know you're rich but... getting that much from your parents is just... too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. Don't worry about that. How to explain... when I was born my parents put ten million dollars in an account for all my life expenses. When I turned sixteen they gave me complete access to the account-- I wrote it down on that paper, it's yours now. So yeah, college funds, housing and stuff like that. My pa-- your parents aren't going to help you financially if you use all of that money so don't waste it.\" She explains it to you but you can't help but feel it's a bizarre move by their parents to give their daughter complete use of that much money. Clearly they are way too rich for their own good. \"That it? Dinner is ready so I hope so.\" She asks suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks. Bye.\" You respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Sharon, see you tomorrow.\" She says her farewells and you wonder if perhaps in a couple weeks, people calling you Sharon won't leave your heart skipping a beat. \"So?\" Betty leans forward, morbid with curiosity, tilting her head cutely. \"Her parents gave her complete access to an account with ten million dollars in it when she turned sixteen.\" You relieve Betty of her curiosity, leaving her in a similar state to yourself; utterly blown away by Sharon's parents for giving a teenager access to that much money. Following that interest, you pull the sheet of paper out of Sharon's purse, finding the account number clearly written. The random paper snags Betty's attention instantly as she buzzes \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bunch of information about Sharon, that account number is on here.\" You tell her and with an eager hand she snags it out of your own, quite close to leaving you with a nasty paper cut. \"Hey!\" You shout but she is far too enveloped in the sheet to pay you any heed. \"34D...\" Betty whispers, bringing her eyes up from the paper to stare at your breasts. \"This sheet almost makes me want to swap but after seeing how uncomfortable you are, I think I'll stick with my own body.\" She declares with a smile. A bit irked by her, you take the sheet from her hand and shove it back into Sharon's purse, spouting \"Thanks\" in quite a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, I was just jok---\" She begins to say but her mother's voice soon takes over as it echoes through the house. \"Betty! Dinner!\" The echo ends and Betty eagerly takes herself out of the room, leaving only \"Great, I'm starving\" in her wake. You let out a long sigh, pick of Sharon's purse and head out of Betty's home, passing by her family for a brief farewell. \"I'm sort of hungry too...\" You mumble as you seat yourself in Sharon's car, a hand resting gently over Sharon's firm belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more distractions to persuade you from returning to Sharon's home you eventually head off to it, getting somewhat lost along the way. You are impressed the second time around as you feel miniaturized from the building's size as if it could crush you just from entering. Immediately after entering, a young butler is motioning you towards what you believe is the dining room. \"Great timing, miss. Dinner is waiting for you when you're ready.\" He tells you and with peer pressure and hunger guiding you, you follow him step for step. Your nerves ramble beneath your skin as you take a look at the long elegant table, Sharon's mother present as well as her father or so you assume. \"You're late.\" The supposed father says as you take a seat randomly. He is notably handsome and quite muscular for a man who is probably older than he looks but you only assume that because his hair has grayed. You would be lying if you said you didn't find older men attractive and this man definitely is making your heart beat a little faster-- of course that could just be stress. \"Sorry. I was at a friends and lost track of time.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so tense, sweetie. What's wrong?\" A gorgeous lady asks, who you know is Sharon's mom just by the soft expressions she is making. Her dark eyes gaze deep into you, a typical gaze from a mother, one designed to inspect their child for flaws and signs of issues. \"I'm just a little sick but I'm sure after dinner I'll feel fine.\" The lie broods a face from the woman that easily shows she doesn't believe you, as mother's often do not. \"Really? Alright then.\" She says with little sincerity as she tilts her head away, brushing her long shimmering black hair before taking up a fork and knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grinding of metal against metal catches your senses as you turn to another person who is uncovering what appears to be your meal. It's something you're not a particular fan of but you do remember it being on Sharon's list of favorite foods. \"Thanks.\" You say kindly towards the man, who bows his head with a smile before walking off. You are surprised when you find yourself completely infatuated with the food, it's taste so much more alluring than it used to be. The cooks are either really good or perhaps some foods taste a bit different now that you're Sharon. You didn't notice anything while you were Betty but perhaps cafeteria food is bad no matter who you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allude the parental figures after dinner, an easy task in such a big home. There is plenty of things to grab you attention and curiosity inside Sharon's large room but in the end you do her homework and spend the rest of the night reviewing the information about her class schedule and things related to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drift to sleep eventually but not after hours of wandering thoughts and concerns...</span></div></div>",

The vast size of Sharon's room and the idiotic notion that you are going to be stuck as Sharon for the rest of your life wrap you in the cloak of yesterday's stress. You look at the large clock straight across from your bed. Seeing that it is only 6 AM you believe you could at least stay in bed for awhile longer but your bladder says otherwise. You head to leave the room but end up stopping at the full length mirror along the way. Sharon's hair is tossed and twisted but with the direct hairstyle it's far from as messy as you look in the morning. \"I spend a lot of time on my hair in the morning, looks like I won't have to do that now.\" You realize as you twist and contort, quite impressed by how well your figure looks in the dazzling lavender nightgown that you slipped on before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little embarrassed to go walking around the house with such an appearance but do so regardless. You come to an immediate regret as you come face to face with a rather homely looking woman. \"Oh, miss, you got up yourself this morning?\" She asks you with a smile which seems somewhat forced. \"Yes.\" You reply bluntly, not having much else to say. \"What would you like this morning?\" She asks afterward. You assume she is asking about food but not wanting to be picky or overall abusive of the caretaker, you say... \"Anything is fine.\" She nods and let's you go on your way and into a bathroom that is larger than your bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so unnecessary.\" You comment as you go about your business while relishing the sheer size and quality of the restroom. The Jacuzzi is beyond tempting as you have never been in one before but you instead opt for the shower built for seven. You remove your clothing with hesitance, not wanting to see Sharon naked despite being curious but also a bit disgusted. You are by no means homophobic but you do feel it's natural to be embarrassed about seeing anyone else naked. Considering the circumstances you finally take a peek at yourself in the mirror. You are a bit dazzled by how beautiful Sharon's body is, her tanned skin such a different variety from your milky white. Her curves are flawless and as you take a look down at yourself, your stomach begins to curl; with no clothing to hide it any longer, you come to a strange understanding of the situation. It's clear you are now someone else as you look down at your bare body, completely different in shape, size and color. Oddly enough, you find the first person gaze from atop Sharon's ample body a far more surprising and gut wrenching guilt express than seeing someone else's face in the mirror. \"It's strange...\" you whisper but finally remember that the water has been running in the shower for a good three minutes now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the bathroom with towels wrapped tightly around your head and chest and make your way towards Sharon's bedroom. You could spend days exploring her vast closet but opt for something a little less revealing from yesterday's outfit and perhaps a bit more you; a pair of jeans and a simple green T-shirt, both still doing quite a job of showing the curves of Sharon's body. You return to the bathroom to dry your hair completely as well as do your makeup. With her bangs designed to cover her forehead, there is little creativity to be had and so you end up walking out with the same direct hairstyle she always wears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't dabble into much conversation with any of the people working at this mansion and as such eat your breakfast quite peacefully. Thankfully, getting around her house and out of it before her parents show up to give you another knotting of the stomach. You climb into Sharon's car and begin your drive to school, realizing just why Sharon wakes up so early as the trip is quite the commute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head towards the bus drop off right after parking in hopes of meeting up with Betty but along the way get two (while not entirely unwelcomed) \"Hellos\" from Grace Beaufield and her boyfriend Cliff. \"H--hey, what's up?\" You reply casually while still making a motion away from them and towards where Betty may be. They do however follow and ensue a conversation you're not entirely eager or sure you can participate in properly. \"Not much but I will say that Trisha was acting awfully strange this morning.\" She says and while initially uninterested you then recall that Trisha is actually her mother so with a bit of dread you turn around and ask... \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer glossy set of lips glide across each other with ease and with an arc in her brow, Grace says... \"I don't even know how to explain it. She was just acting weird. Like, she called Cliff a... hipster doofus after he made some comment about her outfit. Who says that!?\" A bit nervous about the disaster you may very well have cased, you brush your hair softly while exuding a dimwitted smile and a nervous cackle. \"W--well, maybe she is just feel ill or something.\" You try to convince them as the last thing you wish to do is worry about someone<i> else's</i> life right now and it seems to work somewhat as Grace and Cliff snuggle up close to one another, both a bit distant about the conclusion but reasoning it fine. It's during the pause that you take notice of Betty who is coming in your direction, smiling quite clearly towards you. However, before you can make a move towards her she is stopped by Sharon who only recognizes your presence with a modest wave. She begins talking to Betty and before long she is pushing her away from your direction and at the same time you are being pressured by Grace and Cliff to go hang out with them. You watch them walk off, wrapped in defeat and really feeling as though you are not Victoria anymore. The slight waves of your blond hair moving with Sharon's motions instead of your own and as their profile shows laughter and a smile, your pain only deepens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer bearing an excuse to not have the company of Grace and her boyfriend, you go with them but don't exactly relish their conversations. You are far too unfocused to really add anything to their discussions so it's as though you are just observing a couple's trip around school. You eventually disperse from their company to retrieve books from Sharon's locker but surprisingly fumble over Trisha, though her mother lays behind that face. You are not surprised now by Cliff's comments as Trisha is wearing a rather elegant looking dress, far too nice for a simple day at school. \"Nice dress, Trisha.\" You compliment in hopes to make up for Cliff's comment from before. She turns to you with a delightful smile and says \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end up going in the same direction as her and before long realize you're sitting right next to her in your first class. She is obtaining quite a lot of stares from the other students and each one makes you feel worse and worse about swapping Trisha with her mother. This isn't what you expected when you agreed to swap them. It's on that note that you decide to... </span></div></div>",

You smile and lean just a brief bit closer and confirm to her that she wasn't hearing wrong. \"I know you're Mary.

I'm here because I'm still a bit hesitant about swapping you with your daughter as she did not consent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offers her sympathies with a glance and confirms your concern... \"She is quite angry about the whole thing but I am adamant about this.

It was not an easy sight to take in, the view of Betty chatting enthusiastically with your original body. It's by no means easy to swallow that no one can tell the difference between the old and new Victoria. It hasn't even been a full 24 hours but you just want someone to say something about how <i>Victoria</i> is acting strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a breath of preparation, you proceed towards them, walking between their chattering and seating yourself with an overly eager greeting. \"Hey Betty! V--Victoria.\" Sharon greets you with similar enthusiasm but Betty scoffs at you, the act sending a cinder loose in your heart. Sharon doesn't give you much time to dwell on it however as she exudes a bout of business with you. \"I already signed up for cheerleading, I'll be ready for today's practice. Go a little easy on me, Captain.\" She informs you, her eyes glowing with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y--yeah...\" You respond with what you can muster, a bit thrown off by the idea that you're going to be the head cheerleader when you have no knowledge about it. You're going to end up humiliating yourself-- or rather Sharon to an amazing degree, you are sure. But, your mind ends up drifting back towards Betty who is still unhappy with your presence. \"How are you Betty?\" You ask in an attempt to break whatever wall it is that has been put up between you. She rolls her eyes slowly in your direction, her hands wrapped tightly around her stomach and with a thick upper lip spits \"Why are you even talking to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Sharon giggling silently from behind you, perhaps taking enjoyment out of the tears you are surely going to shed but before you do, you notice Betty fingering towards her phone. You gather the hint and check yours or rather Sharon's phone and notice quite a few messages left from Betty. You scroll through them during the first few minutes of class, realizing that Sharon wanted Betty to act as if she was the real Victoria and you were the real Sharon so people in school didn't think it was strange that <i>'Sharon'</i> became such good friends with Betty overnight. You understood the concept and the reasoning but by no means were you thrilled to be participating involuntarily with this idea. With this concept driving both Sharon and Betty, that now meant that you were now considered Betty's enemy so to speak. Something you can't emotionally deal with even knowing it's a fake hate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a tap on your shoulder and then take notice of the teacher's lengthening of your current name. \"Shaaaaron!\" He calls out, gathering the stares of all the students in your direction. \"What?\" You ask as politely as you can despite wanting to bark at him like a rabid dog. \"You probably missed it but we're reviewing the homework, what's the answer to number 4 and explain why?\" The question sends you flipping through your books for your homework sheet, murmuring a long \"Umm...\" but just as you stumble over it, Sharon answers it in your stead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Victoria.\" The teacher says. The compliment leaves Sharon with a satisfied grin and a modest shrugging of her shoulders but leaves you with a glare you hope is penetrating the back of your head so Sharon can witness it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of class drags on as one would expect, even if you are distracted by your current state. Betty sends you some amusing texts but what little satisfaction you got from them fades the moment class ends and Sharon and Betty walk off together the same way you and Betty used to. As you exit the class and towards the next one, you end up stumbling into the person who is supposed to be Sharon's Betty; Grace. \"Sup girl.\" She says as she joins you towards the classroom, a class you probably share with her. \"Hey Grace.\" You say back, not losing a frame in your motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard Victoria joined the cheerleading team. You finally talked her into joining huh?\" She relays the gossip with full intention of confirming it. You nod on instinct and grind your nails along the back of your neck. \"Yeah, I really got her. It took a long time.\" The confirmation leads her to give a broad smile, a bit mischievous to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a pretty girl, I guess but I'll never understand your obsession with her. If you didn't go through boyfriends like toilet paper, I'd say you had a crush on her.\" She jests with a slight push of your shoulder. Despite not doing a good job at this sort of thing, you decide to at least act like Sharon for just a brief moment and spout... \"Yeah, fuck that! I just think she'd be a f'in good addition to the team.\" It's unnatural to a painful degree but every now and then you disregard your usual self and do the opposite to appease Sharon's desire for you to be her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're even forced into continuing with the charade at lunch. You initially go towards Betty and Sharon but she waves you away and sadly towards the two tables that are pushed together, sprouting with girls you have never really gotten to know. Grace, her boyfriend and Trisha are the only ones you even know the names to as most of them are cheerleaders like Sharon. It's dreadful forcing a conversation with them while playing a role your personality is by no means suited for. You sigh and... </span></div></div>",

You sift through the cafeteria, finding little of interest until you fall onto the view of Robert who is directly across from Sharon. They share similar smiles and soon Robert leaves her table with a gleeful exit, full of excitement in his profile. Your initial fear wears on your body, as your heart weighs down and quickens it's ominous beat, providing the music to your dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break away from your table and march boldly towards Sharon, planting yourself directly beside her with a furious glare. \"What did you just do!?\" You demand to know but as Betty looks away somberly you are quite positive that your fears are confirmed. Sharon looks at you, actually looking a bit frightened but it does not last even though you remain angry. \"Why would you ask him out? You probably don't even like him!\" Your demanding questions further but behind your anger the tears begin to swell. \"I'm sorry, Sharon. I didn't know you had feelings for Robert but in fairness... I--I've been pining for him for a long time.\" She states and while you're initially taken back by her feelings, you realize quite swiftly that she is merely playing her role as <i>you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking to <i>Victoria</i> right now. Talk to me normally or I'll change us back right this instant.\" You threaten, something that makes her submit quite obediently. \"I told her not to ask him out.\" Betty relays to you, perhaps merely securing her positive position in this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me why you did that?\" You ask once more. Your gaze feigns it's strength well but the bubbling of your usual sensitivity are grabbing at the edges of your expressions. The air around her nose pushes away swiftly as she releases her frustration with a stern lip. \"As Victoria, I have a crush on Robert.\" She asserts but you scoff at it, reminding her that she is <i>not</i> you. \"You have my body and my life-- something I don't even want to give you. You're even taking Betty away from me and now Robert? You probably don't even like him as yourself.\" Your frustration is picked up by Sharon but only out of fright of loosing her precious new body. It fades though as she reverts to her original persona, by your request or from the heat of the situation, you are unsure. \"He's alright looking but I've definitely dated way hotter. I don't know why you fuckin' care. With a body like that you could easily get any guy in this school, why waste it on Robert?\" Her words are finally of her own mind and as such you feel relief for a brief moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like him. S--sure, I find other guys hotter but I just like Robert. H... he's cute and seems really nice.\" You say quietly, the embarrassment of the admittance bringing a reddening to your face. Betty giggles from your display while Sharon rolls her eyes and slouches back into her chair. \"Well what do you want me to do? Bomb the first date? I already asked him out.\" She asks with each word sounding more rude than the last, a surprising amount of snobbishness clearly possible with your voice. You're not sure what you should do, if you let her destroy the first date your chances of being with Robert should you return to normal will be non-existent but you don't want to her so quickly decline the date with Robert as he'll surely be upset. Perhaps you should just let her go on the date but you can't feel satisfied with that even if it's the only way to not hurt Robert. </span></div></div>",

After her absence, you immediately plummet into your despair, letting all of your building emotions out in a long breath. You run both your hands through your hair before laying your head just briefly onto the table. \"This is... so much.\" You grumble and lift your head back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I thought you hated Sharon and yet you're fine with being around her?\" You ask, regretfully sending your jealousy out into the open. Betty smiles briefly but as her lip curls and her eyes reach the top of her sockets she says \"You're still my best friend but... I must say-- and I doubt you want to hear it but it's hard to tell the difference between you and Sharon. She can act like you really well and since she has your body and voice, it's uncanny. If I just think I'm with you and not Sharon, it's actually pretty nice but I do get angry whenever I start reminding myself that she is really Sharon.

If even your best friend is having trouble telling the difference between Sharon's act and the real you-- if you had not told her you were the real Victoria she wouldn't have even noticed.

But as her head raises and her hand whisks away the long dark hair from her face, you now see the anger upon her new face; her lower lip pressing up and her small nose furling just as the former Grace's would. You fall into your shoulders as she walks towards you, seemingly unabated by the mute Grace who sits staring with a jaw hung by an anchor weighing more than the chair she sat upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze falls to the cafeteria floor in a pray to evade the confrontation but soon the feet of the girl come into your few, the tapping white toes which peer out from her sandals a sign of her disapproval. You raise your head to meet her, your heart crafting a new rhythm as you see her face which seems to pierce your nerves far more than Betty's ever would-- clearly Grace's face was accustomed to anger. \"What th--\" She begins to ask something but before she can even test your whim, Grace interrupts with similar words... \"What the... fuck? Give me my body back right this instant!\" She demands with a hand planting itself firmly onto the table. Yet again, you find it impressive how swiftly she figures out her predicament, it took you a trip to the bathroom and a mirror to figure it out your first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty arches her neck around to confront the imposter, saying simply... \"What are you talking about? If you don't mind, I need to talk to Sharon in private.\" Grace doesn't appear to know what to say and neither do you. Though she has no words in mind to say, Grace doesn't leave her seat to provide the privacy Betty desires so instead you feel yourself being ripped from your seat so fast that the feel of Betty's firm grip doesn't even register in your mind until after you're out of the cafeteria. \"Do you mind explaining to me why I'm in Grace's body?\" She asks as she releases your arm and swivels upon her heel to meet eyes with you. You can tell by the ridges of her jaw which pulse with the continual clenching of her teeth that she is far more angry than she sounds and is probably refraining from cursing simply because it's you; her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opens but words fail you as tears begin to well up in your eyes. Your life is slipping away from you and now you just made your best friend furious with you. \"I just...\" You begin as you rub away the tears before they expel from their ducts but before you can even grasp at what it is you want to say next you feel a flick upon your forehead. You rub away the sting quickly but a glance at the culprit reveals a much softer expression than before. \"Calm down. Gosh, you're so emotional. Now just tell me why.\" She says with a long sigh as she calmly places a hand upon her accentuated hip. You smile briefly and nod obediently, thinking continuously in your head about how much you love Betty. \"Right, I was just... a bit scared of losing you as a friend. You said you couldn't really tell the difference between Sharon and me and that you have to 'fake' hate me for now. I'm sorry, I just wanted things to be normal again or as close to it as possible so I sort of-- without thinking... swapped you with Grace so you could be my friend again.\" You explain sounding increasingly pathetic as the tears swell up again. Any anger Betty may wish to put upon you is long lost as your hands cover up your tearing eyes yet again and with a long sigh she pats your shoulder, consoling you merely on habit... \"Right, right, I get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou merely stare at her with a delightful smile, pleased to know she understands your emotions the same way as she always has. You're about to ask her if she actually wants to stay as Grace for your selfish benefit but before you can, you hear Sharon whine from behind you... \"Did you do something? Betty is telling me she is... you.\" She asks as she turns to Betty to finish her question. You tell her why you did it which leaves her disoriented on whether or not she is fine with it herself. You know it may ruin her 'immersion' as 'Victoria.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she says...</span></div></div>",

You settled on Trisha's locker, which she had negligently let open when you parted, and wrote a little note that said :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you want to be<br>\r\nWho you want to be<br>\r\nWrite it down on this paper<br>\r\nAnd bring her tonight at 8PM.<br>\r\nYou know the place.

I'm sending you the adress.</i> You smiled a mischevious smile and litterally waited for the class to end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[About 8PM, in a shack downtown]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to keep the \"naive, surprised girl\" act for a while, and you made an effort to look freaked and uncertain as you met up with Trisha in the shack. \"What are we supposed to see here exactly Trisha?\" The girl, litterally beaming with what you guessed was anticipation, looked around her, then at her watch.<br>\r\nYou decided to act quickly, since the act was just a way for you to make a smooth transition to her body, and maybe gather a little bit about her if you could...<br>\r\nYou take a few steps backwards, and wish yourself swapped with Trisha Hillsburry. You feel faint for a second, feeling a little different with this swap than with your previous ones, for reasons you don't really understand...but you have no time to think about it, as you quickly pass out, your last vision being Trisha's body passed out just in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to your senses and instinctively look around you, Sharon's body confirming the fact that you are now, for all intends and purposes, <i>Trisha Hillsburry</i>. You quickly took a look at Trisha's cellphone to confirm you had been unconscious a few minutes, which started to worry you. You quickly chased the thought away when you saw Sharon's body coming to life slowly, before looking around her and seeing...her former self. Despite expecting this, she obviously looking surprised before pulling up a powder mirror from your former purse and looking at her new self, still dumbfounded, but clearly very happy with this turn of events. She came to you after a few seconds, clearly looking concerned about her friend despite having \"tricked\" her (or so she believed) into swapping bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sharon, are you all right?\" \"Yeah...other than my head hurting a little...and the fact that I'm in your body !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best to look surprised and confused, and the new Sharon was too overjoyed to see it, since spilled the beans in a hurry. \"Look...this will sound crazy but I've always envied you Sharon...you had it all : looks and guys, not to mention the cheerleading squad ! I came across this shack when...well, it's a long story, but somehow I asked someone to swap you and me, and it obviously worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell she had trouble hiding a large grin, but she kept on :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's no way to undo it, so we might as well make the best of it. You're in a a good family, and even if my parents are a little crazy, they are okay people.\" You could tell she was overselling her life in hopes to ask you something, but you didn't object and answered. \"So, I guess we'll have to get used to be each other, be called by the other's name and stuff? We are BFFs, but I'll need some info if we have to pull this off...\" Now it was your turn to hide your grin, and after a couple more minutes, you quickly pulled off two sheets of paper you used to write down personal info about your respective lives. You then discovered how much info about Sharon's life you actually new...which was a lot. You weren't sure how much was coming from what the original Sharon gave you and how much of it you had \"soaked in\", but this surely was a worrying thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exchanged the sheets to discover Trisha was sort of a \"poor's man\" Sharon : she was a little less pretty, which you already knew, her 32C breasts were no match for Sharon's 34D, and she had even worse grades than Sharon...the only positive in this was a possibility for you to start fresh, and especially away from the new <i>Victoria</i>. You saw she avoided <i>Sharon</i> at school today as much as she could, so you guessed this wouldn't be that much of a problem...and if it came to be, you'd deal with it later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Sharon dropped you home in the convertible you came with, and you couldn't help but notice she nearly got you killed at least a dozen times on the road because she was litterally absorbed with her reflection. You actually looked at your new self a couple of times, and surprisingly found yourself more at ease being this dumb blonde girl than you were as Sharon. You got out of your reverie when Sharon, still awed, dropped you off at your new house and promised to have a long chat about the swap tomorrow at lunch. You absent-mindedly agreed to it, briefly saluted your parents before quickly fading to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thought brings a small smirk to your new cheeks as you describe in your mind just how completely upset Sharon would be if she suddenly swapped bodies with Trisha-- before she knew it was you doing it at least. \"Ah... she would be so upset!\" You chime with a small chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Asks Trisha. \"Huh? Oh, nothing. I'll see you later then.\" You tell her, though as you hang up the phone the weight of what you've done begins to set in.

I know it's superficial and all but this is like a downgrade from my original body. The inside matters and what not but my insides aren't changing here. I-- I should swap back right now.

You stomp your foot down and press your face towards hers. \"What is this crap about getting tutored!?\" You exclaim but your upturned lip does little to stutter her as she calmly raises her hands. \"It's to be expected. You've always been pretty careless about school. It's better than being expelled at least.\" She responds, so convincingly passing all of her past idiocies onto you like she had never once been in the shoes you're currently wearing. \"Don't worry, with my tutoring, you'll be just fine. Come on, come home with me.\" She states as she pushes at your back, motioning you onto the bus. You don't decline and climb aboard the very familiar bus, the one you should still be going on daily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I have to get 'tutored' by you.\" You pout with your arms and legs tightly folded with rage. She takes a seat beside you with a light chuckle and places a hand upon your shoulder. \"It's not so bad and hopefully when all is said and done with you'll care about more than just cheerleading and partying.\" She says with a playful smile which only tenses the fibers of each and every muscle beneath your skin. \"I will swap us back right this instant.\" You threaten with your lips only an inch from her ear and a finger pressed against her cheek. You doubt it did much to douse her ego but it did at the very least cease all conversation until after you walked back into your former home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in your old room you sit forcefully down on the floor with your books spread out all around you. \"You don't have to actually tutor me. I know all of this-- I'm not the one who really blew off her school.\" You tell her as you pick up one of the books from the floor and the worksheet entitled for it. \"Fine...\" She grumbles as she goes to work on her own homework. After several minutes of silent work, you see Sharon drop to the floor a completed worksheet but what's surprising is that it's the same one you're currently struggling with! You glance upon her answers from the twisted angle, finding them detailed and precise; clearly answered correctly. While here you are not even a third through the same sheet. Your looming stare at your paper and your obsessive batting of your pencil against it lead Sharon to peer over your shoulder and ask... \"Want some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to decline her offer but before you can even tuck the paper away from her view, she leans over your shoulder even further, a finger pressing itself against the page at your currently unanswered question. \"Oh, this one. You have to...\" She begins to blabber on about how to solve it while slowly and confidently brushing her long blond bangs out of her view, all while wearing a dastardly proud smile. \"Get it?\" She finally asks, turning her soft smile towards you-- though it only looks cocky and smug to you. The situation finally gets to you, resulting in you blurting out... \"How do you know this when I don't!? I felt it earlier too. This whole swap is messing with my head somehow too! I remember things about your life that I shouldn't! You're experiencing it too then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy. I've always been smart, I just never tried.

You suspect the worst and begin to really feel as though what you thought was just a feeling may be real. Perhaps you really are becoming more and more like Sharon with each second you remain this way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N--now if you don't mind I have to pick out what I'm going to wear later on my date.\" She says which only leaves you even more frightened about the future outcome.

Even she has a knack for driving you crazy, you realize she had some valid points: she never did try as Sharon,but she's now more willing to do so since the swap. Furthermore, you also have been extremely tense and sensitive since it happened, and you guessed it doesn't help your performance at school at all. Still, there are some odd circumstances that your would like explained, and Victoria's uneasiness when tackling the memory swap issue does nothing to reassure you in that regard. So you decided to press the issue a little more before going back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be completely honest with me, because your current <i>state</i> depends on it.\" You pointed a finger in her direction and greatly accentuated the word \"state\" in order to get her attention. Judging by her uncertain look, you quickly guessed you did well, and continued. \"Have you or have you not felt some different things about your memories and skills since we swapped ?\"<br>\r\nYou watched her closely, knowing that the answer would come as much from her reaction than her words. As you might have expected, she shrugged her shoulders and added \"Honestly? I don't know...Yes, I'm more focused at school and I'm doing better in my homework, but I'd say it comes from being finally relaxed and happy with my life, as opposed to always being partying, chatting away and generally unhappy before. And you can't tell me you haven't been distracted at school today !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she had a point. Your schoolday had been rocky to say the least...between your difficulties coping with being Sharon, Trisha's \"situation\" and the principal, not mentioning the amount of people chatting with you during classes, you couldn't even follow a single class properly, which also made you understand why Sharon was struggling so much with her grades.Maybe you weren't becoming her, but adopting her daily routine sure hurt you in a lot of different ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, <i>Victoria</i>, we can't do that same stuff tomorrow. Things HAVE to change if you want this to work.\" You could see the new <i>Victoria Wilson</i> was having trouble containing her smile, cause she knew that right this moment she had won yet another battle in order to definitely secure this body and life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also successfully hid the fact that she indeed had been noticing a sublte change in her IQ, and that she had learned things about Victoria Wilson's life that no one but the one and only <i>Victoria Wilson</i> knew...Her dream would be for the power to come to her in the end, but all in all, the former Sharon would be pretty damn happy to definitely be in the driver's seat of this swap. Then she had an idea...It couldn't work, but the current <i>Sharon</i> was so desperate...She decided to try it. \"You know, if you really want to be sure, you could always try to swap with someone completely foreign to you.I know there are a few girls at school who would be willing to try it just for the sake of being in <i>this</i> body.\" She said, poiting to the girl she was tutoring. \"Like it or not, we are closer than you think, so I guess it's harder for you to be sure of any change. If you tried with Trisha, I'm pretty sure you could verify your \"memory transfer\" theory. And she'd kill to be in my former body, I can assure you of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha was the dumbest of her friends : she only cared about looks, boys and cheerleading, and she envied Sharon just because she was better than her at all three. Now if she was able to swap those two, she would have enough time to definitely secure her position as Victoria...and who knows, maybe get the power ! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the current <i>Sharon Winterly</i> hesitating, she tried another solution that seemed equally appealing to her :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or if you want someone outside of the cheerleading circle, you could always try swapping with Mika Lu.\" Mika was best friends with Robert's sister Maria. She was a running freak and a marathon specialist, but she had a flaw that could be exploited : the girl had absolutely no curves at all, and from the conversation the current <i>Victoria</i> had with her just today, she would do ANYTHING to be in a curvy body (and a killer hot one to boot). The girl was also prone to forgetting things and being dreamy, which could also play out well if they were to swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think ? You have a unique way of verifying your theory, you might as well try it !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking long and hard (or as long and as hard as she could as Sharon), the former Victoria weakly nodded. \"You're probably right. Let's call ______ and do it right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She seems to enjoy the cheerleading practices...I've seen her today, and I bet the only reason she never tried to be a cheerleader was because of her shyness...So i'm pretty sure she'd jump at the chance to be Sharon.Plus she comes from a Mexican family, so that would definitely help me figure things out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current <i>Victoria Wilson</i> didn't really care about those two, but the idea was a good way for her to gain some time and help her secure her position as Victoria, so she didn't really mind...She just had to keep both her former body and <i>Sharon's</i> new one in check till the transfer would be complete. Most of <i>Victoria's </i> memories were still blurry, but she could feel them strenghtening by the minute. Plus she had gained a large portion of Victoria's high IQ already, yet she had an impression the transfer wasn't complete. The way things were going, she was almost sure that in less than a week, she'd be forever Victoria Wilson...and maybe gain her power, which would be the icing on the cake. She was taken out of her reverie when the current <i>Sharon Winterly</i> told her she had made her choice. \"Oh really? Who is it then ?\" \"I'll pick</span></div></div>",

She seemed to have picked up the phone in a hurry, which you believe is probably due to Sharon's \"top of the food chain\" social status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anita ! Sup girl ?\" You asked, knowing Sharon was kinda friendly to the girl since she had plans to recruit her into the squad in the near future. <i>Wait, how did I know that? I really have to figure out this memory stuff...</i><br>\r\n\"Hola Sharon ! How are dju ?\" Was her reply, though you struggled to understand some of it due to her thick mexican accent. Now her parents were some kind of top-notch engineers that moved from Mexico two years ago to earn top dollar in some sort of hi-tech firm, and even if her grammar was very good, Anita still had trouble losing her native accent. <i>Wonder if I'll pick that up when we swap...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine ! Actually i'd like to see you about the cheerleading squad ! I know you've helped us sometimes with our projects in the past, and I need your help once again. Could we meet at my house in about an hour ?\" \"Yes of course Sharon ! I'll see dju there !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung up and turned back to face Victoria. \"Then it's settled...I'd better go back to the house. I'll check in with you tomorrow, no matter what happens. Until then, don't do anything i wouldn't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria flashed you a warm, <i>typical Victoria</i> smile by answering \"And don't do too much of the things I would ! Goodbye Sharon !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your homework assignment in a few minutes by copying over Victoria's sheet, and hurried back to the mansion in your convertible. You arrived at the same time than Anita, her slim latino figure slowly stepping out of her used Ford break. You welcomed her and quickly went down to business once you led her to your room. \" Listen Anita, I have something important to ask of you.\" You could see the concern on her face looked genuine, and accentuated her natural beauty : she looked a lot like a young Eva Mendes, except that she seemed to have little to no make-up on her. If it wasn't for the cultural barrier and maybe the money, you guessed she could have taken Sharon's spot kinda easily as far as looks go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you say if I told you I could switch bodies? And that I want to switch with you, temporarily at least ?\" She looked at you wide-eyed, partly because she tried to see if you were kidding, and partly because she couldn't figure out why you would swap with her if given the chance. You ended up telling her most of the story, including the part with Sharon and yourself swapping and the memory question, and you made her promise she wouldn't tell a soul. When she realized you were dead serious, she smiled and said \" Dju know, I have it good here, but I woud really love too see things from an american perspective, see ?\" \"Yeah, I guess I know where you're coming from...Look, let's swap for a whole day and we'll see where we stand tomorrow night, okay ? I'll meet you here...but as a guest this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see she still wasn't buying all of it, but you motioned her to stay calm, and then wished you and her to swap bodies. You quickly went blank, the world swirling one last time just after you noticed Anita's body laying on the other edge of the bed. When you came back to your senses...</span></div></div>",

You planned<br>\r\nto spend it with Anita's friends (most of the time, the girl hung out with Elisabeth Narby and Melissa<br>\r\nShank), swap back with her, and finally confront Sharon and swap back to your original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>[Meanwhile, in Victoria Wilson's house...]</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"original\" Victoria didn't know it, but at the same time, another person was waking up with maybe<br>\r\nan even bigger smile on her face than herself : her original body, occupied by none other than the former<br>\r\n\"queen bee\" Sharon Winterly. Sharon was feeling more and more at ease with her new body, and her<br>\r\nIQ and memory seemed to have improved some more. She still remembered herself as Sharon, but she <br>\r\nhad to concentrate long and hard to remember her past parties or boyfriends. Only \"core memories\", like<br>\r\nher former BFFs Trisha and Grace, still seemed \"easy to access\".<br>\r\nAt the same time, she had gained what she guessed was most of <i>Victoria Wilson's</i> IQ (her homework<br>\r\nlooked easier every time she started a new assignment) and probably also most of her memories, like <br>\r\nVictoria's first day in high school or the day she met Robert, but she was frustrated to note that some \"key<br>\r\nstuff\" was also missing, like her first kiss or the day she met Betty. Nevertheless, her goal was getting closer<br>\r\nand closer, and she wondered if that meant the power was also coming to her...She would have to try it sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>A little later, at school...</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent \"Anita Moreno\" walked casually in the hallway a couple of minutes before what her schedule indicated<br>\r\nas her first class of the day. She had agreed with \"Sharon Winterly\" not to have any contact with her during the day <br>\r\n(except an \"emergency body swap situation\", of course). She was happy to see Betty Jinus, who obviously didn't<br>\r\nrecognize her, in this first class, and barely listened to the Maths teacher explaining a complicated theorem, as she<br>\r\nwas dreaming about having her body back. She also didn't realize that more and more of her memories as Victoria<br>\r\nwere slipping away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>In the same classroom...</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty Jinus was dumbfounded. She didn't believe it at first, but she finally had to. When Victoria came to talk to her<br>\r\nthis morning, she believed it was still Sharon Winterly inhabiting her body. But the girl surprisingly told her she finally<br>\r\nhad the courage to go and talk to the real Sharon, and that they had swapped back. When Betty didn't buy it, she<br>\r\nanswered numerous questions like only the \"real Victoria\" could. She also bluntly told her afterwards that it seemed she<br>\r\nhad lost her power after swapping back, and that she was disappointed but relieved to be \"finally back where (she) belonged.\"<br>\r\nBetty congratulated her about finally stepping up to the bitch, and she couldn't help but notice a (very) slight reaction where<br>\r\nVictoria actually frowned disapprovingly, before quickly agreeing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Betty was here, wondering whether her real friend was back or if Sharon was playing a trick on her. At the same time, if<br>\r\nthis was indeed Sharon, how could she know so much about Victoria ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Meanwhile, in PE...</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Anita Moreno was beaming. True, she was already considered pretty as herself, but she had seen how much boys<br>\r\nloved the curves and confidence of Sharon Winterly. And now, she was the one flaunting her newly-acquired \"assets\" and loving<br>\r\nevery minute of it. The boys were litteraly at her feet, and she found it incredibly easy to display Sharon's usual confidence when<br>\r\ndealing with them. She also found that her new body excelled at volleyball, which was logical as Sharon was the captain of the <br>\r\nschool team.<br>\r\nAt the end of the class, she was a little surprised to see Victoria Wilson coming to class, which apparently was her next. She <br>\r\nhad to recognize that the \"body swap power\" was real last night when a girl claiming to be Victoria offered to swap Sharon<br>\r\nWinterly's body with hers \"just to be sure of something\".<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure of much of the story was real, but she was definitely sure she made a good deal by agreeing to swap, and as far<br>\r\nas she was concerned, the girl could keep her former body for all she cared...No more outsider looks, no more trouble learning <br>\r\nenglish : everything was easy now, and she had all the money in the world to do whatever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was kinda surprised to be approached by the girl she had been told was \"the real Sharon Winterly\". She especially had trouble<br>\r\nunderstanding how a girl like that could be willing to sacrifice everything just to be the cute yet very \"common\" (or so she considered)<br>\r\nVictoria Wilson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria\" motioned \"Sharon\" to follow her in an empty room on the side, and bluntly told her :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Anita, right ?\"<br>\r\nNow she REALLY was surprised : judging by the way the girl was looking at her, the story she was told yesterday might actually be<br>\r\ntrue...<br>\r\n\"Sharon ?!\" \"Wait...She told you everything, didn't she?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and she actually also told me to stay away from you. I shouldn't...\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I've seen you look at your newfound body, and if you want to keep it as much as I think you do, you will listen to me till the end...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria\" wore a sinister grin, and started explaining her plan to \"Sharon\" and \"testing things out\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You tried to appear as snobbish and bossy as possible, and you found it surprisingly easy, wondering how much of Sharon's body language you had already acquired. Betty appeared completely dumbfounded, and didn't even try to hide the fact that she was behind the body swap shack. She brought back the  wallet containing the money, and quite abruptly ended the conversation by saying. \"Now excuse me, but I have an urgent phone call to make. Good night.\" She shut the door in your face and left you with your new money, body and life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally started to accept this change and looked ahead to see what the future was holding for <i>Sharon Winterly</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>[Meanwhile, in Victoria Wilson's house...]</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Sharon was relieved. When she learned that it was Victoria who had the power and when she changed them back, she thought it was all over : her lifelong dream of becoming the bubbly blonde girl who had seemingly everything she wanted would be over. Surprisingly, Victoria seemed less than happy about being herself, and she somehow ended up being convinced to try the swap on a longer basis. Now <i>Victoria</i> didn't feel at home in her new body yet, but she really felt better than she ever did as Sharon. She was scanning the list of information the former Victoria had given her, and even if she knew most of it, the paper contained some info she couldn't have obtained otherwise : her locker combination and various computer passwords, basic information about her family and detailed info on Betty since the two were hanging together very often...But before she had time to finish reading, her cellphone rang, and she dreaded the confrontation with Betty. <i>The former Victoria must have told her everything by now, and I'm gonna have to deal with an angry girl...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria ? Are you all right? What happened?\" Betty sounded anxious, and even called her by her new name...could it be possible that her friend didn't say anything ? She answered cautiously. \"I...I had a problem with my power, and now I'm powerless and back to my own body.\" She hoped Betty wouldn't be able to detect the lie, and was satisfied when she heard the answer. \"Do you want me to come to your place and help you with something? You look tense...\" \"I'm just a little tired. I'll see you tomorrow morning at school if you don't mind.\" \"No problem ! Sleep well, and don't worry...It was cool while it lasted !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Victoria hung up and flashed an evil smile after she realized that even Vicky's best friend wasn't able to tell the difference between the old and the new Victoria. <i>Tomorrow will be an interesting day indeed...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how both girls ended up falling asleep while browsing information about the other one. Information they now HAD to know due to their swap. The next day, each came to school as usual...at least, the usual way their bodies came : <i>Sharon</i> in her brand-new pink BMW convertible, and <i>Victoria</i> in the bus with Betty. The new Victoria found this idle chat quite easy, and at the same time very helpful for her to get into character, which she found increasingly easy which each passing hour. She was also disturbed with memories of a life she didn't live popping up randomly in her head, but since <i>Sharon</i> wanted to distance herself from her former identity, she kept this to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Victoria and Betty arrived in the school hall, before Betty made a grunt noise and pointed in the opposite direction. \"Here she is. To think you could have been trapped as her...No offence Victoria, but I like you much better as you are. She's all style and no substance...And I hear her grades are getting to the point where even her parents money won't save her.\"<br>\r\nThe new Victoria should have been hurt by those comment, but her former life seemed so far and foreign that she didn't even care. Betty was her friend <i>now</i>, and the Trishas and Graces of the world could go to hell for all she cared. What really surprised her, though, was the way <i>Sharon Winterly</i> had dressed her new body. Usually a pretty but kinda conservative girl (the kind of clothes <i>Victoria</i> was wearing right now), her swap to Sharon seemed to have motivated the girl : she seemed to have kept the fake nails Sharon had, but changed their color to a bright red. She also had opted for a low-cut, cream and black V top that accentuated her now curvy body and a black mini-skirt, and had even more makeup than the former Sharon used to apply...which was already above average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did she dress the \"queen bee\" part, but she was talking with the whole cheerleading clique : Trisha and Grace were at her side, and you could see her talking briefly with Elisabeth Narby too, which was more unusual. You found yourself continuing to chat with Betty (who was pressing you with questions about Robert Bennet, your new love interest as Victoria), more curious than concerned with your former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes afterwards, the bell rang and you were about to go to class (Betty had already entered) when <i>Sharon</i> put a hand on your shoulder and motioned for you to come and talk to her.

You see, people are used to see <i>Victoria Wilson</i><br>\r\nhang out with Betty Jinus and some others, like they usually see <i>Sharon Winterly</i><br>\r\nwith Trisha Jones and others.<br>\r\n - And...?<br>\r\n - And even if we'll probably have to \"adjust\" that a little bit, you can't just suddenly be<br>\r\n best friends with Betty overnight when Sharon despised her, like i can't be Trisha's new<br>\r\nBFF when you...well, you didn't like her very much, right ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right...even if it was a pain to admit it, you knew it wouldn't be fair to you to \"lend\"<br>\r\nher your body while \"forbiding\" her to live your life. Can't have one without the other, you<br>\r\nguessed...And on the other hand, it would be a chance to get to know Sharon's friends, even<br>\r\nif Trisha's body was currently occupied by her mother, you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- I guess you have a point, even if i don't like it. What do you suggest ?<br>\r\n - It's pretty simple really. Act like <i>Sharon Winterly</i> would. And you know i'll do a pretty<br>\r\ngood job of acting like <i>Victoria Wilson</i> does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emphasized the names, in a discreet yet obvious reminder of your altered state. You knew<br>\r\nshe had all the data she needed to act as you if she really dedicated herself to it, but you had<br>\r\nwitnessed Sharon being such a bitch sometimes that you weren't entirely sure she could pull<br>\r\nthis off 24/7. In fact, that was your worst fear : that she'd screw your life beyond repair. And in<br>\r\norder to avoid that, you had no choice but to be cooperative and be close to her as much as<br>\r\npossible, in the beginning at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- I won't be able to act exactly like you, Sha...Victoria. You know that. Unlike you, i haven't<br>\r\nbeen planning that for years.<br>\r\n- I know, i know...just try to make your changes subtle. People will get suspicious if you do<br>\r\nexactly the contrary of what i would have done, but doing something just slightly different will<br>\r\ndo the trick.<br>\r\n- Same for you...i know you...well you don't need my advice, but i'm generally perceived as <br>\r\nnicer than you are..ah...were as Sharon.<br>\r\n- Yeah, i know, but i believe most of it came from my frustration...now that i'm in peace with<br>\r\nwho i am, nobody will be able to tell the difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last sentence sent shivers trough your spine, even if she meant well. In a way, you wanted<br>\r\npeople not to recognize the difference, but at the same time... you sort of <i>had to be different. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure of what to do, you asked one last question :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- One last thing...What about Betty ? She knew about my secret, and last time we spoke, I was<br>\r\nheading to...well...YOUR house to swap back.<br>\r\n - Perfect !<br>\r\n - Perfect ?! What are you talking about ?<br>\r\n - That as far as she knows, we have swapped back, i'm the real Victoria and you're the real Sharon.<br>\r\n I lost my power and i don't know why, but since i didn't know why i got it, it seems right.<br>\r\n - Are you kidding me ?!<br>\r\n - Just hear me out : i'm giving you Trisha and Grace, my two best friends. I'm giving you the head<br>\r\nof the cheerleading squad, the volleyball team, and my money. Plus you probably can have pretty <br>\r\nmuch any guy you want in the school...i didn't have a steady boyfriend by the way.<br>\r\n - And what's that's supposed to mean ?<br>\r\n - That means that i'm putting all on the line just for a chance to be you :  my former beauty, popularity<br>\r\n and wealth are now yours. And all i'm asking you in return is the opportunity to really experience it. And<br>\r\nI cannot do that if Betty Jinus starts hanging around exclusively with Sharon Winterly because she knows<br>\r\nwe swapped. Do...you...understand...that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard through the phone that she was on the verge of tears while explaining the situation to you, and she<br>\r\nstarted crying just after finishing her last sentence. And then again, you quickly felt like agreeing with her : it<br>\r\nwouldn't be fair to her to \"crush her dream\" by working with Betty. You decided to reply quickly :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- Please stop crying. You're right. You can call Betty and tell her your story. Just be VERY careful : she knows<br>\r\nme better than i know myself, so it's going to be harder for you to maintain appearances around her than it would<br>\r\nbe everywhere...including my house. Is that okay to you?<br>\r\n -It's...it's perfect. Thank you, thank you for everything you're doing for me Sharon, i won't forget it ! Is...is it okay if we<br>\r\nhave coffee together after school tomorrow to...well, get the hang of things and maybe exhange some additionnal <br>\r\ninfo ? I'd have said lunch but that's gonna raise questions.<br>\r\n - Yeah, i understand. Coffee at Pete's, 5 PM ?<br>\r\n - All right ! Thanks again Sharon, see you tomorrow !<br>\r\n - No problem Sh...Victoria<br>\r\n -Oh yeah, that raises one last problem : starting tomorrow, you just can't slip up like this. Please, i beg you, just<br>\r\npay attention !<br>\r\n -Oh...okay, I guess you're right. See you tomorrow...Victoria.<br>\r\n - See ya Sharon !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by this exchange, you took the time to process all the things that you agreed on during the phone call :<br>\r\nno more Betty like you used to, and essentially living and acting exactly the same way Sharon did at least during<br>\r\nthe beginning, only being allowed to subtle changes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling weak and defeated, you headed on to what was your home and your room, quickly hugging your mom and<br>\r\na man you identified as Sharon's father, refusing to eat because of a stomachache, and dozing to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you're woken up by the sound of your phone. It's...</span></div></div>",

At the sleepover I'll let you know if I find you worthy enough to have my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Sharon says immediately.

If Sharon was really as desperate as you think she is, she's not letting herself go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless of course you would find some way to provoke her into bullying someone.

Without a notice you give your mother a big hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, what's the matter?\" She asks you confused as she strokes your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just wanted to hug you.\" You say closing your eyes and trying to remember this warm feeling. It might be one of the last hugs you will ever receive of your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week passes slowly. When you enter school on Monday nothing seems to have changed, Sharon was still getting the attention and she seemed to behave like normal. There was one exception though, the bullying stopped. No kid was getting bullied buy Sharon Winterly. After you interrogated Betty about Sharon's behavior during gym (you try to catch Sharon on the slightest thing she did to Betty, but nothing out happened) Betty asks about your interest in Sharon's behavior. It's then that you tell her about the bet you made with Sharon. Betty isn't surprised with your decision, she knows you always try to be good to everyone. Betty doesn't seem to mind it though, she sees it as an opportunity to be more popular. It's just that she isn't the one who gets to be swapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week passed calmly, Sharon keeps her promise and doesn't bully anyone. She even manages to raise a few of her grades. All to please you, of course. On Friday you walk over to Sharon with trembling knees and ask her for a sleepover that night. She nods slightly and then goes back to her business. You text your mom if it's okay if you bring a friend over for a sleepover. There is a sparkle of hope that your mother doesn't want it, but your mother agrees to a sleepover and is very happy about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the school day ends you make your goodbyes to Betty, promising you keep contact. When you get home with the bus Sharon is already waiting for you. She was probably brought by her driver. She has a large bag with her to hold her stuff in. Unlike school she acts much more friendly. Entering your home you introduce your mother to Sharon, who she already met (when you were here). The two of you both go upstairs and the first question Sharon asks you if she passed your bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen you bullied anyone and your grades have gone up, you have passed.\" A faint smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, so that means I get to be you permanent right?\" Sharon asks you with a smug on her face. You nod your head, she is right. \"So are you going to switch us now?\" Sharon asks you eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"I want one final dinner with my parents. After that I'll switch us.\" You promise her. Sharon looks satisfied with your promise. Until dinner time the two of you fill your time with exchanging information. Even though Sharon has gathered a lot about you a few details are a bit off or not right at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your mom tells you it's dinner time, you prepare yourself for your last dinner here. As you go downstairs and into the kitchen, you can see your mom and dad already sitting. Your mom made macaroni and cheese, your favorite dish. It's one thing you will miss. Sharon makes conversation with your mom and dad who will soon become own parents. At first you think she won't get along with them, but soon she makes them laugh with a few of her jokes. She gets along well with your parents and that's the most important thing for you. When dinner is finished you and Sharon are excused from doing the dishes and go upstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside your room you tremble a little. \"Congratulations Sharon, you passed my final test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test? What for test?\" Sharon asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner, I wanted to see how you would get along with mom and dad. I don't want my parents end up with someone who wouldn't get along with them. You did great back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I knew a bit about them already so it wasn't difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you ready for it?\" You ask Sharon. She eagerly nods her head. You concentrate on swapping with Sharon and suddenly you are standing across your former body. \"It worked, I'm me again.\" Sharon says getting more excited touching her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm you again.\" You mutter noticing your new voice. Your hands pulls your long hair behind your ears, as careful as you can be with your fake fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do?\" You ask the new Victoria.</span></div></div>",

As you walked towards him you noticed Robert was heading straight towards your body. \u201cWant to be in a group with me Victoria?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\nSharon in your body looked a little shocked. She began to look around desperately but ultimately most of the other students had already found partners. \u201cI\u2026I guess that would be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nRobert\u2019s POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Robert\u2019s mind: I\u2019m the luckiest man in the world. I managed to snag the prettiest girl in the whole school for this project before anyone else. Damn, I\u2019m good!)<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2026that\u2019s great.\u201d You smiled slightly, but deep down you were incredibly happy. However as you were busy celebrating in your head you felt a tap on your shoulder. You spun around and came face to face with Sharon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have room for another partner?\u201d Sharon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d (Robert\u2019s mind: What\u2019s Sharon doing here? I thought she didn\u2019t like me, is she going to try to get Veronica to join the cheerleading squad again? Maybe she\u2019s here to just slack off and hand all the work to us?) \u201cI don\u2019t th-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, we have room.\u201d Said Victoria<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. Didn\u2019t Victoria not like Sharon? Why is she letting her join? Maybe this is a dream? Before you could think anymore your thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the teacher\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell class is pretty much over, you can all leave now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you headed home.</span></div></div>",

Why are you staring at me like that?\" Before you can relay a response she continues to ask questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a new friend?

Should I ask Anthony to make something for your friend?\" The offer is taken in by Betty with enthusiasm as she starts barking out things she enjoys eating.

You can only assume Anthony is the name of someone who works here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool. I want people to cook for me whenever I want.\" Betty blurts out as you head downstairs to sustain yourselves with the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere of the whole place is becoming a bit more welcoming as you pass all the obstacles one at a time that you feared crossing when Betty first decided to go to Sharon's home.

You would occasionally text her, but nothing more than that. And she would probably be the only girl, apart from Betty, to understand your relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Betty quickly change into each other's clothes and soon you're walking hand in hand to Janice her house. Betty wanted to hold hands, you were unsure about it. You wouldn't want to give off the idea that you might be something more. But then Betty pointed out nobody would notice a thing. You look around and clearly nobody looks surprised seeing two girls holding hands. This actually might work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you don't have anything special to do today, you and Betty decide to walk over to Janice's house. Contrary to what everyone in school thought, Janice didn't move out of town. She just moved to the other side of town, to another school. Not as much fun as yours (you thought) but nobody knew her there. She seemed to do okay, having made some friends already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice lived with her mom in an apartment. She had given you the address, but only to use in emergencies. You wouldn't call this an emergency, but you wouldn't know anyone else you could talk about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up the stairs to the apartment Janice lives in. From the look of the building, the apartments aren't that big. Janice and her mom lived pretty nice before, you still feel ashamed thinking about what little you and Betty did. Betty notices your reaction and hugs you tightly. \"We did all we could.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it still feels wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For me too, but at least she has us.\" Betty points out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of the apartment, you ring the bell. You can hear someone walking towards the door, you can hear the locks being removed. When the door opens, you can see Janice in front of you. She hasn't changed much. Long blond hair till her shoulders, a rather large forehead, glasses, a little acne. She was dressed in a t-shirt which showed her impressive chest and some sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice first looks confused but then realizing two of her best friends are in front of her she grabs them and hug them both. \"Bet, Vic, what are you guys doing here? Quickly inside.\" She ushers you inside as she closes the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is seemingly relieved when she locks the door again. \"Sorry for that, not wanting anybody seeing you here. But what are you doing here?\" She asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have great news.\" Betty tells as she grabs your hand and looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice looks at the two of you, and slowly gets it. \"Wait, you don't mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty and you nod. Janice looks excited hearing the news. She gives you both a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing guys, really, I'm so happy for you both. We have to celebrate this.\" She tells the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then takes you to the living room. It's small, with only a couch, two chairs and a small TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat, my mom is at work. I'll get us something to eat.\" Janice hurries into the kitchen while you and Betty sit down on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we tell her about?\" You ask her. Betty nods to your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice comes back with a piece of blueberry pie for the three of you. Blueberry pie is Janice's favorite snack. Janice holds the blueberry pie in her hands, when Betty tells her she wants to tell her something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be more important than the two of you going out.\" She takes a piece of the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has something to do with us becoming a couple.\" You tell her. Janice looks confused. Betty then tells her the story of how you could swap bodies, and how it lead to you going out. Janice is really confused by it, as she hasn't touched her pie since Betty began telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice nods when Betty is finished. \"I thought something was weird. Normally Bet would tell me such a thing instead of Vic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you believe us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do, I know you wouldn't lie about something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are touched by Janice's faith in you both. You walk over to Janice and give her a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you are Vic.\" Janice giggles as you let go of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking how would you like swapping with one of us?\" Betty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Betty understandably. Betty was more involved with the humiliation Janice went through. She even defended her a couple of times, explaining how she was less popular than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Janice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Betty asks.</span></div></div>",

We hanged out with each other and until a few weeks ago we were just good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, so you already did it?\" Betty asks ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice nods shyly. \"Yeah, it was amazing. Best thing ever. Did you two already?\" She asks pointing at the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty nods excited and you nod hesitantly. \"Somehow that wouldn't surprise me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking, how about you and your girlfriend swap with Victoria and me?\" Betty suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice thinks about it and then begins to nod. \"Yeah, I suppose that wouldn't be a bad idea. I mean hey it's not like we could do better, but it would sure be fun if we could go to a movie together and sit next to each other without the whole cinema looking at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's decided, well call her up and see if she's free today.\" Betty suggests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea girl.\" Janice compliments Betty. She picks up her phone from her pockets and walks to the hallway to call her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" You ask Betty hesitantly, while she plays with your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty gives you a look, then lock lips with you. At first you don't want to but she kisses you so strong your resistance falters. When she lets go, she looks at you confident: Just as sure as our relationship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice comes back at that moment. \"I just called her, she is on her way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you guys exactly swapped?\" Janice asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Victoria can just think about who to swap with and poof it happens.\" Betty explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah like this.\" You focus on swapping with Betty in your body. A moment later you find yourself sitting on the other side of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty doesn't look happy with it. \"I thought we would stay like that.\" She then sits with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice giggles seeing this. \"Alright, I know that you really are Betty now. Only she would sit like a child when angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch yourself to make sure you are in your own body, the only disturbance is when you stroke your crotch to find your panties a little dampened. You look over at Betty, but she pretends she didn't do a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear a doorbell ringing, Janice stands up all excited as she hurries towards the door. You are pretty nervous to see what kind of girlfriend Janice got herself. You can hear a girl giggling in the hallway. The door then opens and coming with Janice is a girl...</span></div></div>",

Suffice to say that the moment you see the girl, it feels like a rock hit your stomach. First off the girl her hair is a giant Mohawk, completely pink. Then the piercings, except the ones in her earlobes, she has one in her eyebrow and one on her tongue. That would be weird eating, you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl wears just a black tanktop, which not only reveals a deep cleavage but it also shows off the tattoos on her arms. On her right arm is the picture of a star, while the other one is covered with different symbols. The girl also wears a black skimpy skirt while underneath fishnet stockings. You hope this is just a prank of some kind, that Janice is trying to fool you, but when the two of them kiss each other you knew that wasn't true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria, Betty, this is Lizzie. Lizzie, Victoria and Betty two of my best friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence of a few seconds occurs when Betty stands up. \"Hi, nice to meet you.\" Betty says walking over to Lizzie. She always had the guts to take the lead during awkward times like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" You could hear Lizzy is a smoker, having a rather husky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Lizzie and give her a hand too. You are a bit disturbed when she looks at you, like she was checking you out. It creeps you out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's sit down, shall we?\" Janice suggests. You and Betty sit on the couch again while Janice and Lizzy both take a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I heard you can switch bodies?\" Lizzy asks interested while grabbing a cigarette from her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well it's not only me I can switch other people too.\" You tell a bit embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy pulls a lighter out of her pocket and uses it to light the cigarette. \"That's really cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, we have tried it, and it's really awesome.\" Betty suddenly talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to swap us with you two? Sounds cool.\" Lizzy takes a huff from her cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right, I thought about us going to the movies.\" Janice tells Lizzy, sounding excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy pufs. \"Cool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who do you want to swap with Liz, with Victoria or Betty?\" Janice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope deep inside she doesn't pick you, you've got a weird feeling about this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy decides to swap with...</span></div></div>",

Janice looks worried, Betty like you were about to throw away a million dollars. Lizzy looks at you with a little smile. Saying that you wouldn't want to swap with Lizzy, could hurt Janice her feelings. And the fact that you haven't always been there for Janice, makes you feel a little guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" You say smiling a little. Janice and Betty look relaxed hearing that. They both grab their hands, and you focus on swapping them first. You can see a little shock going through them.

Before you close your eyes to concentrate you can see Lizzy looking at you with that weird look. You just hope this don't turn bad. You think about switching with Lizzy. A second later you feel a strange tingling. When you open your eyes you can see your body standing opposite you. Immediately your hands go up to your hair where you can feel the pink Mohawk standing. A look down your top shows your more impressive but pale cleavage. Your fingernails are painted black. Your skirt feels awfully short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body stands there gloating until Janice comes running up to her, and kisses her deeply. It's weird seeing your body being kissed by your best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\" You suddenly hear Betty say as she turns you around. She grabs you by your neck as she kisses you. Your first reaction is to pull away, but Betty keeps holding you tight. Her tongue slides inside your mouth, and automatically your tongue plays with her. Betty is surprised as well, but doesn't interrupt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you girls like it too.\" Janice says. Both you and Betty stop, and look ashamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that girls, you really enjoyed it. The same with me and Lizzy.

Without realizing it until class officially starts, you had sat in the desk directly behind Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mr. Carver begins the day's lecture you try and focus on what he is teaching. Unfortunately your eyes keep wandering to look at Victoria. As your Nervousness grows you force yourself to look away. Your eyes stop on Hank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank is biting his lip and looking nervously at the girl sitting beside him. The girl in question's name was Sharon Winterly, head cheerleader. You'd heard rumours that Hank had a crush on her but he'd never shown it or admitted to it. Currently he just sat there, biting his lip. Suddenly the class is disrupted as...</span></div></div>",

It was different for you when you were Victoria, you thought about your own time of high school, a fun time where you laughed and had fun. But now most of it is gone. You don't even see your friends anymore, they have all moved on, each going their own way. You breath relieved when you see it's five o'clock. You gather your stuff, lock the library and put on the security system and go to your car. You're surprised when you see Victoria waiting on the parking lot, just as she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria looks shy away when she sees you coming over to her. \"Your parents not wondering where you are?\" You asked her as you opened the door of your car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I text them I was with Betty. They trust me.\" Victoria replied. You stepped inside the car, waiting for Victoria to sit down as well. \"What are you standing there for? Come on in.\" You told her. Victoria stepped inside the car, a little unsure. Unlike the principal and some of the teachers your car was rather small, with you barely fitting inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if it is too small, I normally don't have any passengers with me.\" You told her as you drive off the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, I understand.\" Victoria says with an apologetic smile. \"I just want to say how sorry I am for my behavior from before.\" Victoria says looking with her pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What behavior? You mean when you grabbed me by my arms? That wasn't too hard, I was only somewhat surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just..I was afraid we were stuck like that, you know. I panicked and therefore I treated you badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Victoria, if I was your age I would probably have reacted the same way. I just tried to stay calm and collect, but I was just as shocked as well. One minute I was standing in line and the next moment I saw Betty's face calling me Victoria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have been pretty weird as well. I just felt my hands holding a tray and when I turned around I saw you running away. I immediately followed you, though running while wearing those heels isn't easy.\" Victoria explains. \"So where is your place?\" Victoria asks looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here, already. Look there.\" You tell Victoria pointing above. You can see your apartment waiting for you already, Victoria seems to be surprised of it. \"I don't have much money, a librarian doesn't get paid much as a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that.\" Victoria says apologizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, took me a long time to accept it as well.\" You tell her. You park your car into the parking garage and walk with Victoria to your apartment. \"Welcome to my house, you can take your shoes off here.\" You tell Victoria as you're both standing in the hall. You quickly slide out of your high heels, rubbing your heels for wearing those shoes. Victoria takes off her sneakers, a much better choice to wear, but the principle insists that you dress yourself appropriate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to tell you though that I haven't cleaned my room in a while, so don't be surprised by what you find inside.\" You warn Victoria before opening the door. Walking inside you feel ashamed how your room looks like, even when you're this old you still don't clean your room often. Victoria however walking behind you doesn't seem to mind. \"This is not so bad Ms. Turner, my room might look even worse.\" Victoria says as she looks around. \"Thanks, and you can call me Hillary, Ms. Turner is for when we are at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Hillary.\" Victoria replies surprised by this informality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want a cup of coffee or prefer tea?\" You ask Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea, if you have it of course.\" Victoria says sitting down at the table, removing a pair of panties from the chair she sits on. You look around in the cupboards and find a bag of tea, you put on a kettle with water while you make a cup of coffee for yourself. You also grab a box of your favorite chocolate cookies, you're not supposed to eat them during the week, but with a guest around things are different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't take one, but in this case.\" Victoria says as she grabs a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I love them too, but I have to take care not to eat too many of them, it all goes down to my hips.\" You tell Victoria as you put the box back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same with me as well, if I eat too much I won't fit in my swimsuit.\" Victoria giggles. You giggle too as Victoria's tea is ready and you put it down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She says taking a sip. You and her then discuss how it's possible to swap.

You didn't actually agreed with Victoria how long you would stay like this. Should you spend a day like this or a week or even a month? It all depends on how Victoria would want to stay as you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at Victoria's house you take a deep breath as you step inside the house. \"Hello, I'm home.\" You call out loud. \"I\"m in here.\" You suddenly hear a female voice shouting back. Jumping up a little you think it must be Victoria's mom. Stepping inside the kitchen you see an older woman looking similar to Victoria standing in front of a stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are. Was it fun at Betty's?\" She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused for a moment, but then remember the textmessage Victoria sent before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we talked for a while. So mom, what are you up to?\" You ask her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then help Victoria's mother with cooking dinner along with preparing the table. She seems surprised at this behavior, but didn't say too much about it. You talked with her and when it was finished Victoria's father came home from work. He was a good looking man, someone you would have loved to go with yourself. You try not to talk too much as not to raise suspicion and when dinner was finished you hurried upwards. Victoria told you where her room was. Going inside you amazed yourself at it. The walls of the room was pink and so was much of the furniture inside it. The walls were covered with posters of boybands and one of the school's swimming team of which Victoria is part of. Pulling off your shoes you lie down on Victoria's bed. This is going to be your room for the moment. So what now? Lying on the desk is Victoria's homework for the next day. It's a lot to do, it will probably take you the whole night. On the other hand you are curious about her wardrobe. Trying out some stuff she has. That would leave you with less time to do Victoria's homework, but it would be fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what to do?</span></div></div>",
