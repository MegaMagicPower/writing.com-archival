Closing the door,<br>\r\nher eyes stared through the windshield at the silhouette of the island that was drawing closer by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled contently to herself. Her vacation had officially begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it wasn't quite a vacation. Just a yearly tradition. For the past five years, the intrepid reporter and photographer for the Mason City<br>\r\nTimes newspaper returned to this island from May to August to work remotely. As her reputation had grown and her ability to meet<br>\r\ndeadlines remained intact, she faced less and less blowback from her boss every time this time of the year arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis island was her favorite spot in the entire world. A veritable paradise, where she was free to write and relax at her leisure. And have a<br>\r\nfew laughs along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferry bell began to ring furiously, as the ship reached the dock and was securely tied. Soon the gate fell and the engines of<br>\r\nvarious vehicles roared to life, eager to exit the ship's confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin soon followed suit and brought her vehicle onto the island.

Erin drove into town, ending up at The Caffeinator Laughinator within ten minutes. Upon exiting her car, Erin saw exactly what she had expected to: a girl tied up on a rack with a sign saying, \u2018Tickle Me!\u2019 posted in front of the rack. \u201cPoor girl,\u201d Erin thought to herself. \u201cShe must have not had enough money to pay for her drinks.\u201d As this was one of her favorite places on the island, Erin knew the ins and outs of the coffee shop. Anyone who failed to pay for their coffee would be stripped to bra and panties and put out in the rack or in one of the other restraint devices at the Laughinator to be tickled by the public until the \u2018debt\u2019 had been paid. Having forgot her purse a few times when coming here, Erin knew what the rack was like firsthand. She walked up to the girl, seeing that only her feet and armpits were being tickled right now. Wanting to have some fun, Erin danced her fingers on the girl\u2019s helpless belly for a few minutes before going inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting inside, Erin saw a long line, and got in the back. While waiting, she noted the stocks sitting right by the entrance and the other set by the waiting area where the coffee was delivered. A girl was inside each, getting tickled mercilessly by waiting customers. She waited until she got to the front, at which point the barista greeted her, \u201cHello, what would you like today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a venti cappuccino,\u201d Erin ordered, and she soon paid for the drink. She then headed over to the second set of stocks, where a teenage girl was having her feet tickled. Having nothing else to do, Erin began tickling the girl\u2019s armpits mercilessly, causing the girl to scream out in laughter. \u201cTickle, tickle, tickle!\u201d she teased as her fingers tormented the girl\u2019s exposed armpits. A few minutes later, an employee came by to let the girl out, so Erin ceased the tickling, and the girl was let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin expected that they would have someone else in the stocks soon, as there were usually several people who took advantage of the free coffee for tickling agreement, but the employee surprised everyone by announcing, \u201cAt the moment, we have no one else to put in the stocks, so we will be making a special offer. If anyone is willing to volunteer for the stocks, we will give them a gift card for $10 per minute they spend in the stocks, as well as an extra free drink coupon. This agreement will go as long as that person is willing to be locked in or until we have someone else who needs to occupy the stocks to pay off their order. If we get no volunteers, we will be forced to pick someone at random to go into the stocks. They will receive the same compensation for their time, with the exception of the extra free drink coupon. Do we have any volunteers? As always, the person who ends up in the stocks would need to strip down to clothing that exposes tickle spots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought about the offer for a minute. She was very ticklish, especially on her belly, but she did come here often, and $10 per minute in the stocks could go a long way to her coffee bill, not to mention the free drink. However, she wasn\u2019t quite sure if she could actually take the tickling that she would be signing up for. After careful consideration\u2026\u2026.</span></div></div>",

We will have her out in a minute or so.\u201d The girl, apparently a little nervous at her decision, still followed the employee back into the back. True to her word, the employee brought the girl, now only clad in a bikini, back out in a minute and locked her up in the stocks. \u201cThank you for your patience. You are free to tickle Ms. Kari now. Remember that she is getting paid for getting tickled here now, so make it worth the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral patrons, including Erin, eagerly accepted the challenge, and surrounded Kari. Having been nervous that her own stomach would have been tickle tortured had she volunteered, Erin was now unrestrained in tickling Kari\u2019s bare belly. The ticklish reporter ended up near the prisoner\u2019s bellybutton, and she used all the techniques others had exploited on her to bring the stocked girl to hysterical laughter. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d was all Kari could scream out as her entire body was tickled.

The barisa behind the counter had her order all ready, and Erin smiled. She gave a few flicks around the navel one last time, making sure to play with Kari's dangly belly button piercing before withdrawing her finger and stepping away; another woman immediately took Erin's spot, and Kari squealed as Erin's replacement tried to copy her techniques. Erin retrieved her drink, tipped her server, and sat down, pondering over her phone while sipping her cappuccino. She didn't need to start working on the clock for a couple of days, so while she was eager to explore the island and get a head start on her reporting, Erin figured she could also relax for the weekend. After double-checking her emails, bank account, and the weather (sunny for her whole visit!), Erin's drink was already half empty. She was beginning to consider getting up and finishing it on the road, when a hand tapped her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand belonged to Kari! She had apparently finished her sentence, and had changed back into her casual clothes; a pair of blue jean shorts, and an orange tank top that all-but covered her belly; Erin saw the bump where the navel ring was decorated, and the bottom of its dangly attachment was poking out the bottom of the top. Kari also had very long hair tied into a neat dirty blonde ponytail, and looked to be in her late teens or early twenties. Erin looked over to the rack; it was empty, and the servers were again offering rewards to any volunteers, but there seemed to be few after what happened to Kari; however, the young girl had a cheerful smile on her face as she spoke to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've ever had my belly button tickled that well before! You're good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin blushed; her own belly button was extremely ticklish, and truth be told she had learned most of her techniques from having them used on her before. But she didn't want to spill those beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've had... experience. Kari, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin. Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shook hands, and Kari sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you to Cosquillas Island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm actually a reporter. I do some general stories about the island every year, and try to come back every once in a while to see what's different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari dug into her handbag and pulled out her smartphone, quickly searching something up and showing it to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the perfect place for you to do research! Check it out! You might even get to use your belly tickling skills there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused by Kari's enthusiasm, Erin looked at the screen, and saw a link to:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin scrolled through, looking at the impressive \"Laugh 'n' Splash\" park. She had indeed heard of it, but wasn't aware it would be open by the time she arrived. She browsed through a few pictures, while Kari gave a general description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a tropical island theme to match Cosquillas' Island, and was bright and colourful. There were girls of all ages in swimsuits enjoying the park in its promotional pictures, and it had the usual features; a large wave pool, saunas, lots of slides, and a lazy river. But there was also, as was normal for the island, a tickling motif throughout. While not every attraction was designed to elicit laughs, Erin noted a few interesting options. A few girls sitting on top of inner tubes were floating through a thin cave with rotating feathers on spokes coming out the sides, laughing as their bare soles and ribs were brushed. Another woman was crossing her arms over her chest and looked like she was about to burst as she shot down a large drop slide with the sides entirely lined with feathers. A family was having light giggles as they sat in a pool of cleaner fish which nibbled on their toles and stomachs. And of course general tickling was present, with an unfortunate pair of sisters buried in the sand with tails shaped like mermaids and their mother tackling their tummies. An older woman was even giggling as an attractive male lifeguard was rubbing suntan lotion into her leg; the website listed the lotion as a signature product that could be purchased; Erin shuddered at the thought of it in her ticklish areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari took her phone back when Erin was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends and I are going there this afternoon! You should come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin gave it some thought. It would be quite the scoop to cover the park as a reporter, but she couldn't get away with carrying all her notes and cameras around in a bikini. Should she request entry as a plainclothes reporter, and just make observations? Or should she get into her swimsuit and enjoy the park as a guest, and write about it afterwards?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin took a look at the link. One of the city's major dance clubs, the \"Great Giggle Gig\" was hosting a special event that evening; attendees could come dressed in a costume, almost like a Halloween party. There was a dance floor complete with a DJ, a large drink bar, and even a family-friendly restaurant section for people not quite twenty one. There would also be a costume contest towards the end of the evening, with a \"mystery prize\" to be handed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKari smiled. \"Me and my friends will be going. You should come too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin gave it a thought, and it did sound interesting, both to cover as a reporter and to attend. But she hadn't exactly packed a costume for the trip; she asked Kari if it would be fine to get in without one, and the younger girl laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with that! You'd probably get called out as a party pooper, and tickled to death! Though, everyone's probably going to get a night's worth of tickling anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin took a closer look at some more promotional pictures. Sure enough, there were people poking each other in the sides, scribbling on soles at the dining tables, and even a row of women getting belly shots more akin to belly raspberries. It seemed that almost everyone's costume bared something to be tickled; lots of sleeveless dresses, bare feet, and short shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to find one then. What will you and your friends be dressing as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll see! But I'm sure you'll be happy with it!\" Kari winked, and Erin laughed as she glanced down at the belly button she had finished tickling earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left the Cafe over the pleas of a \"volunteer\" being loaded into the stocks, and Kari waved goodbye as she headed down the street. Erin, meanwhile, took a short drive a few blocks over to a big party store she knew sold costumes. The store was stocked full of goods for parties of any kind, from birthdays to weddings, and Erin had been there many times for various reasons, but had never really delved into the costume aisles. And when she got there, she wasn't disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was quite busy, as there were quite a few groups trying on costumes, apparently for the party that night. As Erin browsed the shelves for something fun, but nothing that would leave her too vulnerable, she observed some teen girls dressed as cheer leaders and rock stars spill out of a dressing room in a giggling mess; Erin surmised they had been tickling each other in their new outfits. She also observed nurses, angels, fairies, queens, and superheroes, and was tempted by each; everything looked entertaining. She eventually came to a standoff; in one hand, she held a mermaid costume, complete with a tail designed to walk in, and a seashell bra; Erin was worried it would reveal too much of her upper body, but she could probably fish for a flesh-coloured shirt to wear underneath for extra protection. In the other hand was something simple: a firefighter. It wasn't too creative, and Erin surmised it might get hot under the coat. But it would keep her covered, especially with the coat, pants, and helmet.</span></div></div>",

The warehouse has been closed for years now, but people still went there to hang out or have fun, but the disappearances started only a few weeks ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was perplexed, and scrolled through the article as Kari kept explaining. It alleged that up to a dozen girls had vanished, and official investigations hadn't turned up anything. This could be a breaking story, if she found anything new to go on. She looked at Kari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why show me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said you're a reporter. I wanna get to the bottom of this mystery too! I can help you, if we go tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sat back and sipped on her drink while she thought things over. Kari was young, but she knew the island and the story of the warehouse more than Erin did; she could be helpful. Then again, there may be other people on the island who could help as well. Should she agree with Kari and head down to investigate tonight, or take some time to ask around for rumours?</span></div></div>",

The two made plans to meet at a small intersection and take a short hike to the warehouse later in the evening as the sun was setting. Erin was also excited, though she tried to remain professional. If something big was happening on the island, and she would be the one to crack it, then this could be the big break she was looking for! She spent the rest of her day settling in and doing errands, trying to keep an ear out for any whispers of the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Erin drove up and parked her car on the side of the road; Kari was there waiting for her, and seemed prepared just as Erin had asked. The two both wore skintight black clothes to avoid being seen, and each had a camera. Erin smirked as she saw the outline of Kari's belly button piercing protruding from the fabric of her shirt; when Kari saw her staring, she smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't blow our cover by tickling me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The thought never crossed my mind. Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two crept over the hills through the trees until the warehouse was in sight; it looked exactly like it did in the photo, completely empty. Rather than go down and snoop around right away, the two stayed crouched down at the top of the hill. After almost an hour, the sun had set, and the building was dark. Both Kari and Erin were trying hard not to yawn, and Erin worked around some ideas in her head. She was tempted to go down and get a closer look under the cover of darkness; perhaps she could even get inside the building. But as she raised her hand to tap on Kari's shoulder, she suddenly heard something...</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s go.\u201d Erin followed the employee out, and she laid down on the rack when they reached it. Soon enough, Erin found herself being stretched out before her arms and legs were tied up, preventing her from retracting her decision. \u201cEveryone, Erin here is ready to be tickled on the rack. Remember, she is getting $10 for every minute she is on the rack, so let\u2019s try to make her earn it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Kari had, Erin immediately was forced into laughter as a crowd began tickling her all over. In particular, Erin actually was able to feel her bare feet each being treated to one tickler, two hands on each of her armpits, two pairs of hands working over her ribs, each of her knees being squeezed by a hand, and six hands working over her extremely sensitive stomach. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Erin was not able to do anything but laugh as she was overwhelmed by all the tickling sensations. Soon enough, the ticklish reporter felt people switching out, and the intensity lessened just a little bit, enough for Erin to potentially say the magic word that could get her out. She thought about it for a few seconds and then\u2026</span></div></div>",

The supermarket that Erin went to had a rule of every $1 was equivalent to around 2 and a half minutes in the trickling stocks.

However this supermarket had a mixture between both staff and the local people who tickle those who don't pay or waste time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin walked into the massive supermarket she immediately saw tickling racks on her left, five in total, three of them which had employees mercilessly tickling those who didn't want to pay. Each rack was currently filled, however if all of the racks are filled and you can't pay you are taken to somewhere else special in the shop underground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had been extra careful not to go to such a place due to her ticklish nature but it was actually possible to book being tickled in this underground area of the shop, which always had intrigued Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter browsing for awhile and finally collecting all that she needed for her vacation home Erin... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin didn\u2019t need too many things; just a few groceries and snacks to last her through her vacation. The island had many fun restaurants to dine at anyways. With just a basketful of items, she made her way to the self-checkout, scanned her items, tapped her credit card, and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Miss, could you please come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was startled a bit, and turned around; a young employee was standing at the machine she had just used, and politely waving her over. The employee was in her late teens, and had bright red hair tied into two pigtails running down her back. Her complexion was very pale, save for the freckles on her face, and her nametag red \"Brooke\".  Erin walked back to see what was the trouble, a little anxious in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems your card was declined, could you try again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at the screen, and sure enough, it had a \u201cDeclined\u201d notice. Erin tapped her card again. Nothing. Now a little worried, and noticing Brooke trying to hide a grin, Erin tried inserting her card. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. I just got paid before I left, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am, you do know what happens when you can\u2019t pay for groceries here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I assure you, I HAVE money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was frantic now, and pulled out her phone to check her balance. As she turned it on, however, her recent email notifications showed up on the screen\u2026 including one from her bank. The subject of the e-mail read \u201cOur dearest apologies. All payments delayed due to system maintenance.\u201d Brooke, reading over her shoulder, smiled. Erin was of course shocked as the worker grabbed her by the shoulder and led her to one of the racks; she wouldn\u2019t try to fight it, as she knew the punishment, but was incredibly anxious about the tickling that lie ahead. At this rate, she wouldn\u2019t make it to the hotel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke helped Erin into the rack, spreading her arms above her head and tying her legs together, overall giving her a \u201cY-shape\u201d. With her arms stretched like so, Erin\u2019s shirt popped out of her pants, and came up to barely expose an inch of her stomach. Her ultra-ticklish belly button was still hidden, which Erin hoped would last. She did expect to get tickled on this island, but had hoped it wouldn\u2019t be through incidents as clumsy as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, since it was a card getting declined, and not you trying to steal stuff, I\u2019ll be nice and leave you to the public, rather than have our professionals take care of you. Your total came to $23.94, which rounds to 24 minutes in the rack; I\u2019ll come and get you when you\u2019re finished!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sighed as Brooke walked off. She turned her neck and looked at the three full racks to her left. One was occupied by a girl in her late teens, with dyed hair and a few tattoos and piercings. She was being tickled across her armpits and belly by a group of store workers, hinting to Erin she had been caught stealing. Erin winced as one employee brought an electric toothbrush into the girl\u2019s pierced belly button, using the metal vibrations to send the girl into hysterics. Next over was a woman who looked to be in her late 30s; she had very tanned skin and was dressed like a typical tourist, except her floral shirt had been unbuttoned and a man was scurrying his fingers across her belly. The man was also dressed for vacation, and Erin saw two wallets sticking out of his back pockets; had he taken his wife\u2019s wallet just to get this opportunity? Lastly, there was a young girl, maybe only nine years old. She wasn\u2019t as tied down as the others were, with only her legs trapped, and she was in between an older woman and a store employee. The employee was holding a large feather in one hand, and a bag of candy in the other; it appeared the girl had accidentally taken the bag of candy without paying for it. The tickling was light and gentle, and Erin surmised it was just a way for the girl to learn a lesson, though she winced when the girl\u2019s mother slipped up her shirt a tiny bit and dragged a feather across the girl\u2019s outie belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was too busy watching the others to notice someone come up to her and poke her in the side. She yelped, and looked down to see\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hair was dark brown and tied into a very long ponytail behind her, and she was wearing a zipped-up jacket and a pair of leggings. Beside her were two identical twin ten-year old girls, both with dirty blonde ponytails. Both wore crop tops, and leggings pulled up past their navels; only a few inches of skin were showing. While their mother\u2019s face was very warm and friendly, the girls had more mischievous smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello Jackie! Awe, and these must be Brittany and Bethany!

We finally decided to take a trip to this island; the girls couldn\u2019t wait!

They wanted us to all have our belly buttons exposed for tickles, but I told them not until we\u2019re settled in and I\u2019ve figured out how the island all works! I wanted to go to Spain this year, but they convinced me otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe tickled her!\u201d said both twins, excitedly at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin laughed at the thought of the girls tickling their mother. She knew Jackie was very fit, but incredibly sensitive all over, especially on her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you know your mom\u2019s weakness is raspberries in her belly button?\u201d teased Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin\u2019s eyes went wide and they grinned at each other, and a flustered Jackie poked Erin in the side again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

She\u2019s way too ticklish to be doing this for too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she did not realize it at the time, but the ticklee easily made it past a minute without saying the safe word.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bell went off, and the audience in the cafe cheered, not that Erin could hear them. In fact, she remained in the rack for another two minutes; if she had been able to pay attention, she would have noticed the very worried looks on the employees' faces, as they scrambled to get her to crack. But after the first extra minute, they seemed to give up, and the tickling, licking, and raspberries slowed down enough for Erin to sputter out \"apple\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly regaining her senses, she took in the crowd of people watching and clapping, as two of her ticklers whispered to each other. One of them, who appeared as a high school student with black curly hair, sheepishly looked down and went into the back of the store, while the other four got to taking Erin's restraints off. There seemed to be a diverse mix of ticklers on her; a latina woman, a short young girl with long wavy brown hair, a redhead with a pixie cut who looked like a university student, and a black woman with a braided ponytail. All four of them, including the enthusiastic brunette who pushed her into the racks to begin with, looked worried, but had fake smiles on their faces as they let Erin out. Erin wondered what the hassle was, after all they'd had their turn of tickling, and then the door to the back swung open. The earlier girl returned along with a woman who looked in her mid-thirties; unlike the employees, she was dressed very prim and proper, with her blonde hair tied up into a tight red bun and horned-rimmed glasses resting on her nose. From her pantsuit and makeup, Erin deduced she must be the store manager; her nametag read \"Mallory\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, Erin, is it? Oh no, honey, don't worry about responding just yet, catch your breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded, and Mallory took her to the back, followed by the five ticklers, as a new wave of employees came out to resume business. Erin expected to be taken to the room where her belongings were, but instead, she was directed into an elevator. The seven women walked in, and Mallory hit a button to descend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears, you've broken our record without saying the safe word! A marvelous feat, I'm sure. I hope you enjoy your free drinks, but there's something else I'd like you to enjoy as well.. You see, my employees might be great ticklers, but today they failed, and must be... disciplined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin raised an eyebrow, and looked at her five tormentors, who were huddled together with their heads down. The elevator stopped, and Erin was let out into a room that she immediately deduced to be the not-so-secret torture chamber. There were many sets of stocks and tools lining the large underground space, though you couldn't tell it was underground due to the bright white walls and flood lighting. Mallory filled her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room is where we send anyone with very large debts, or anyone who needs to be punished. Not something we'd let the public upstairs take care of. Now, as a part of your record-breaking reward, you do get to tickle any girls here you like. Does anyone suit your fancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked back at the five women; the curly-haired Brie, the latina Maria, the brunette Taylor, the redhead Lara, and the black Giselle. She was eager for revenge, but what should she do?</span></div></div>",

Erin remained on the rack panting for air, even after one of the workers removed her restraints. Looking down at her poor belly, Erin could see how red it was from all the tickling. Her belly button in particular was still tingling. As the barista led the exhausted reporter to the back room, where she saw her clothes and belongings neatly folded, with her drink rewards sitting next to them. She would definitely have to remember to use them in the future to make this all worth it. As she packed her things and walked back out to the cafe's dining area, she saw the racks had already been filled. Volunteer or victim, she didn't know, but to get her just deserts, she walked to the poor girl, lifted her shirt up, and blew a single, large raspberry on the girl's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the cafe, she could hear the new ticklee pleading for the other customers not to repeat what they saw, to no avail. Erin closed the door behind her, dampening the sound of zerberts and laughter, as she looked up into the sky. She still had a lot of time left in her day, but all the tickling in the cafe had still left her feeling exhausted. She wouldn't be able to make it to her house without falling asleep at this rate, but fortunately, there were places near the downtown area where she could afford a quick nap. The beachfront area was very close; lined with palm trees and with plenty of public beach chairs, there would no doubt be a nice sandy place for her to relax and watch the waves. Alternatively, there was also the park; it had many winding pathways and shady trees, perfect for finding secluded silent areas.</span></div></div>",

Placing a hand on Erin's shoulder the employee smiled slyly and announced, \u201cYou have been chosen. If you will please follow me I'll escort you to the changing room\u201d. Erin snapped out of her trance and immediately realized what was going on. Butterfly's filled her stomach and she swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With great trepidation she followed the employee to a small room. On one wall was a changing mirror and a built in bench was just opposite. The young girl handed a vacuum packed bag to Erin, \u201cI'll be right out here when your ready\u201d she said all to giggly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Erin broke the seal on the plastic bag to reveal a two piece pink silk bikini. When she removed her ticklee attire, Erin could not help but notice the bikini looked more like something you would see in an anime or manga. She watched herself in the mirror fiddling with the material in a vein attempt to make it \u201cfit\u201d. The top was nothing more than a few strings with a couple of tiny triangles that barely covered her perky nipples. The bottom wasn't any better. Thin strips that tied over each hip held what amounted to a strip of floss running down between her shapely cheeks and connecting  in front to a another triangular piece of silk made to cover no more than the bump that was her clit. After trying everything she could to force the material to cover more of her nubile body, especially her smoothly shaven lips, Erin nervously cracked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The employee that had been waiting for her handed her a pair of pink flip flops, \u201cPut these on, we wouldn't want those pretty feet of yours to get dirty.\u201d Erin heard the girls teasing tone and it did nothing to help alleviate her apprehensiveness. She slid the strap between her pedicured toes and stepped out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The young girl led Erin back out and stopped at the rack. </span></div></div>",

The girl was a real cutie, with long hair and a surprisingly large bust for someone who was barely 5 foot. Erin licked her lips; having reasoned that there were more rewards than potential consequences to getting this beautiful, young woman in the stocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for volunteering,\u201d the employee happily responded. \u201cPlease follow me, and I will get you prepared. We will have her out in a minute or so.\u201d The girl, apparently a little nervous at her decision, still followed the employee back into the back. True to her word, the employee brought the girl, now only clad in a pink bikini, back out in a minute and locked her up in the stocks. Erin beamed as she could see the girl was clearly not endowed with any pubic hair. The pink bikini was see-through to her delight. \u201cThank you for your patience. You are free to tickle Ms. Kari now. Remember that she is getting paid for getting tickled here now, so make it worth the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral patrons, including Erin, eagerly accepted the challenge, and surrounded Kari. Having been nervous that her own stomach would have been tickle tortured had she volunteered, Erin was now unrestrained in tickling Kari\u2019s bare belly. The ticklish reporter ended up near the prisoner\u2019s bellybutton, and she used all the techniques others had exploited on her to bring the stocked girl to hysterical laughter. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d was all Kari could scream out as her entire body was tickled. After a few minutes of tickle torturing Kari\u2019s bellybutton, Erin stopped to give someone else a chance and saw that the employee had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin hoped the girl would continue to be tickled. The employee handed her a cup of joe that brought relief to her face. She drank it happily as the poor girl screamed some more. Finishing it quickly, Erin decided to return to the girl's open navel and ribcage. The result was the poor girl thrashing even more. Erin loved this feeling, her own breasts were getting quite pointy. And she could feel that familiar tingling deep between her thighs. However the girl couldn't take much and it was now time for someone new. The girl had to be helped up by the two female staff. \"Any new volunteers?\"</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, the announcement was updated as one of the baristas called to the restaurant goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, we don\u2019t have any volunteers, which is unfortunate! That means it will be a random draw! We would like to ask all the ladies in the caf\u00e9 to please come up and select a straw from this cup! Now don\u2019t worry, as this isn\u2019t voluntary, there will be plenty of compensation for whoever is chosen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista held out a venti cup with several straws. Nervously, the girls in the caf\u00e9 stood up. They all looked antsy in one way or another; some looked desperate not to be tickled, others like they wouldn\u2019t mind it but didn\u2019t want to be in the spotlight. They all knew, however, that someone had to be in the racks; that was what the caf\u00e9 was known for, and why they were there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin knew this too, and was getting increasingly worried. She didn\u2019t want to be tickled this early into her trip, but a sinking feeling was getting to her. She looked around the caf\u00e9 and saw about a dozen other girls, giving her less than a 10% chance of a random selection.  Not great, but not terrible. Erin stood up and joined the line, taking in the other possible victims. If not her, she\u2019d at least have some fun getting in a few more tickles before she had to be on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a young, but very tall and very fit, woman wearing a sports bra and leggings; she looked like she hadn\u2019t ordered a coffee, but a cool drink after a morning full of exercise. Her brown hair was tied back in a slick ponytail, and Erin took note of her smooth tanned abs. She wore sneakers, though Erin was sure if she landed in the rack they wouldn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin also saw a young metalhead girl, in her late teens by the looks of things. She had bright blue hair with a few black streaks, and had piercings all on her eyebrows, nose, and ears. She wore baggy ripped jeans and a ripped shirt to match, showing off a great portion of her sides. Erin couldn\u2019t quite see the girl\u2019s navel, but did see the tip of a dangly piercing poking out the bottom of the punk\u2019s top. She looked very nervous to be there, Erin thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl to pick a straw before Erin was a woman who was practically dragged to the front of the caf\u00e9 by two children, ostensibly her sons. The mother had a short brown bob-cut, and was dressed conservatively: a buttoned up shirt tucked into her jeans under a belt. Her children clearly wanted to see her tickled more than she did, and she reluctantly grabbed a straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, please hold your straw up and blow into it! The one with a feather inside will be our next volunteer for the stocks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin blew into her straw, and to her relief, nothing came out. She was safe! She heard the voices in the caf\u00e9 make noise in anticipation, however, and turned around.

Speed-walking through the door, she successfully escaped onto the street and the fresh air.

With rising profits from the business and continued wise investing, the single<br>\r\nmother soon gathered a sizeable fortune, with which she purchased the sensible cottage that sat across from Erin's and<br>\r\nfunded her daughter's education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin first met the intrepid Englishwoman at a local yoga class, where they bonded over their mutual love of art and became<br>\r\ninseparable friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin exited her cottage, she looked across the way to the Cornwall house, where three vehicles sat in the driveway. No <br>\r\ndoubt Melissa was home, as was her daughter, Catherine, now a twenty year old college student, who was home for her<br>\r\nsummer vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third vehicle at the end of the driveway, a black sedan plastered with bumper stickers and peace signs, indicated that<br>\r\nMelissa's niece, Sarah, was also visiting for the summer from England. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin enjoyed a friendly relationship with both Catherine and Sarah, so the sight of those two vehicle brought a greater smile<br>\r\nto the young reporter's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she climbed the small stairwell to the front door, Erin could hear sounds from inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinging the doorbell, Erin was soon greeted by...\u2026\u2026......\u2026.....</span></div></div>",

Melissa got some frozen o'dourves out and put them in the oven, while everyone went to get changed. Eventually, Erin came down wearing a black bikini, showing off her shapely body, and sensitive stomach. Melissa was next wearing a pink bikini; she had a little more chub to her than Erin, but it didn't do anything to detract from her looks. she looked a little nervous, and Erin guessed that she'd been tickled in the pool before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Sarah and Catherine giggling upstairs, Erin got an idea, and hid by the landing wall, beckoning Melissa to join her. Catching on, Melissa quietly slid over; the two young girls had done enough tickling of their own, and it was time to be on the receiving end. When the chatty pair reached the bottom of the stairs, Erin and Melissa jumped out with their hands at the ready... only to see the two girls wrapped up in very thick towels, preventing any sort of ticklish attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Mom! You planned to get us, didn't you!\" said a coy Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Melissa were caught red handed, and the devlish looks of the two caused them to slowly step back. They were in bikinis, bellies and other ticklish spots perfectly exposed. The girls were well-protected, and held every advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes d...dear, I know\" stammered Melissa, trying to get out of the situation. \"But we didn't tickle you! You stopped us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Erin, her voice starting to shake as well. \"Can we own our failure, and enjoy the pool now? We won't get outside if we keep trying to tickle each other in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked at each other with sly eyes, then back at them. Each held up a single index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hands over your heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing resisting would make it worse, Erin and Melissa obliged. Catherine approached and stuck her index finger into her mom's deep innie belly button, while Sarah stuck hers into Erin's. Both older women giggled, but the fingers hardly moved. Instead, the girls only very slightly wiggled them, causing only light spits of laughter to escape the mouths of their prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right mom, and Erin, I'll make it clear\" said Catherine in a teasing voice. \"We are the master ticklers in this household. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye...yehehehehssss!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand any attempts to tickle us will only end in your hysterical laughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Hehehe please, take it out!! Hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrating fingers stopped, and the girls withdrew. Erin and Melissa looked at each other as their breathing returned to normal. They both knew it could have gone a lot worse, and they were very lucky. The four girls made their way out to the back pool, and Melissa entered first, keen to escape the clutches of the terrible ticklers. Erin tried to let the others pass in front of her, but a raised eyebrow from Sarah conveyed a clear meaning, and Erin swam into the pool. The evening water felt nice after a hot day, and Erin swam over to Melissa. she turned around just as Sarah and Catherine removed their towels, revealing respective bright blue and bright green bikinis underneath. Erin's eyes were immediately drawn to their belly buttons; both girls had prominent ball-shaped outies, but both were also pierced; Catherine's navel was decorated by a sizeable gold gem inside a standard piercing, while Sarah had a more dangly one with some very sparkly diamonds hanging down from her belly. Melissa must have noticed Erin staring, and swam in front of Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like them? Those are actually rare jewels from Egypt that were shipped to my store! I'm supposed to keep them safe and secret, so I hid them where nobody else could get to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled; the gems were indeed very pretty. The four enjoyed an evening in the pool and some snacks, before all settled onto a beach chair, far enough apart to prevent any unwanted pokes. The moon was rising now, obscuring much of everything beyond the lights of the water and the house. Erin looked over at the younger girls and saw that their belly button jewelry was still shining enough to be very noticeable.</span></div></div>",

You could do some reporting on it! But you will need to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, something fancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The exact opposite. The dress code for women there is short shorts, and a belly-top\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was a little taken aback, until she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tickling-themed restaurant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had mixed feelings; she felt she'd had enough tickling for the day, but she could never get tired of watching Melissa laugh. Plus, there was Catherine and Sarah, and Erin was eager to get revenge on them. She mulled over her decision, before the two younger girls came down dressed for the occasion; both had loose-fitting crop tops on with jean shorts, and Erin had a great view of their ball-shaped outie belly buttons. The sight of them was all she needed to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin changed into a black tank top, while Melissa got into a tight-fitting white t-shirt. It came down to below her belly button, but still showed an inch of her tummy above her shorts; Erin figured it might be a loophole, but didn't count on it lasting long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunty Melissa, can you drive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Erin. But yes, I'll drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was unsure what the apology was fore, until she got to Melissa's car and sat in the back, only for the two younger girls to sit next to her with devlish grins on their faces. Already buckled in, it was too late to change seats; Melissa looked at her all-but-captive friend in the rear-view mirror, and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't waste your appetite, girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't, mom! Just a light appetizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pinned Erin's arms to her sides, and held their hands above her tummy. Erin braced for tickling, but surprisingly, it never came... at least until the car started, and the vibrations caused their hands to barely scratch her tummy. Erin stifled a giggle, and the car drove off. Sarah and Catherine weren't doing anything outside of holding their hands in front of her, but with every bump in the road, or a sharp turn, their hands grazed over Erin's belly; it was very light tickles all the way to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought she would pass out, before Melissa began parking. As the girls started unbuckling, Erin gathered her composure; she looked out the window to see...</span></div></div>",

It was an outdoor restaurant, looking like it was straight out of Hawaii itself. All the waitresses were wearing hula skirts, and there were palm trees all around. Of course, there was still the one thing that scared Erin just a little: it appeared that both customers and waitresses were getting tickled all over. The specific reasoning for the tickling was unclear at the time, but Erin was sure that would be made clear very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Ticklish Tropics, where we always fill your tummy, and tickle it, too\u201d a hostess greeted the four. \u201cWould you like a booth or table?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA table!\u201d Catherine excitedly decided, causing Melissa to roll her eyes, but nod in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, follow me,\u201d the hostess was unfazed by the level of excitement. On the way over to the table, customers reached up from their seats to tickle the new arrivals and their hostess, causing plenty of squealing and squirming. They eventually got to their table after a flood of tickles, and they sat down. \u201cHere are your menus. Have a wonderful time.\u201d The hostess left with a departing tickle to Erin and Melissa, who had been outed as the most ticklish of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hostess headed out, Erin looked over the menu and was surprised at what she saw for prices. In addition to a standard price, which looked lower than normal, there was a time like 5 minutes, 1 and a half minutes, or 30 minutes (the highest). She turned to Melissa and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the times on here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for every meal you get, you get tickled, too,\u201d Melissa explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll get tickled once we finish before we leave by the waitresses.

Melissa was Erin's closest friend on the island and always the first person she wanted to see on arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cornwall family had been residents of Cosquillas Island for the past fifteen years by the time Erin took up her summer<br>\r\nresidence. The matriarch of the family, Melissa, was in the final year of her thirties, nearly a decade older than Erin, but<br>\r\nremained one of Erin's closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also the most extraordinary woman Erin had ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mother at age 19, Melissa managed to finish a dual undergraduate degree in the areas of Art History and Art Restoration from<br>\r\nCambridge University in her native England. Eager to distance herself from the father of her daughter, Melissa had taken a <br>\r\nposition at the Cosquillas Island Museum where she worked as a curator. Even with that full time job and supporting her then<br>\r\ninfant daughter, Melissa took evening courses online and completed an MBA, while also investing her money in the stock market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith several successful investments and a business education, Melissa broke from the museum and began her own business<br>\r\non the island: Cornwall Restoration and Antiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning as a shop that restored antique furniture and artwork, the business soon grew into the primary collector of rare<br>\r\nartwork and antiques on Cosquillas Island. With rising profits from the business and continued wise investing, the single<br>\r\nmother soon gathered a sizeable fortune, with which she purchased the sensible cottage that sat across from Erin's and<br>\r\nfunded her daughter's education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin first met the intrepid Englishwoman at a local yoga class, where they bonded over their mutual love of art and became<br>\r\ninseparable friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought about all this as her car wound around the windy streets of the island town, before it drew upon driveway the old building that housed Cornwall Restoration and Antiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the rest of the town buildings, the Cornwall Restoration shop sat in an isolated part of town. It was located on a small hill on the outskirts and was accessible by taking the long driveway. The journey was bit of an annoyance, but once you reached the summit of the hill and stood in front of the shop, you could see why the location was used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the hill offered a gorgeous panoramic view of the town and coastline. So scenic was this view, that Melissa had put several picnic tables and lawn chairs along the hillside, where visitors could sit and enjoy their lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pulled up the long driveway and reached the entrance to the shop, just as it was turning 5:00 p.m. The parking lot was vacant, save for Melissa's car, but the Open sign still hung in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin exited the car and made her way to the front entrance.

The people inside had no idea she was out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks goodness for that,\" Erin thought as she began to creep around the building, \"Melissa needs my help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrotting around the back of the building, Erin found the back entrance slightly ajar. Ever so carefully, she slid through the back door and tiptoed her way to the front of the store. Keeping along the walls, the front desk finally came into view and Erin was able to see and hear with greater clarity the scene that she had nearly walked in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the desk was a tall woman dressed in a well pressed business suit and high heels. A domino mask covered her eyes and most of her forehead. Her thick blonde hair was pulled back tight behind her head. In one of her gloved hands was a pistol that was aimed at the frightened British woman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's back was to Erin, but her arms were raised high over her head. It looked like an old stick up scene from a cowboy western. The masked robber began to speak, a thick Eastern European accent coating her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Cornvall, I don't vish to be here much longer. Tell me vhere the amulet is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what you're talking about,\" Melissa nervously replied, \"I don't have anything like that here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. I've traced it from Turkey to the Ukraine to America and now to this island. This is the only such place on this rock that could possibly have it. I've spent years vorking to acquire it. And I will do vhatever it takes to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the masked woman began to back away from the desk. She still faced Melissa as she did so and kept her pistol leveled at the young British woman. Once she reached the front door, the masked woman took her free hand and slid the front door lock into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gulped at the sound of the lock hitting home. No escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the masked woman then slid over to the store sign that still read OPEN and switched it to CLOSED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so ve vill not be disturbed Ms. Cornvall. Like I said....I am not leaving until I have vhat I vant. And I have vays to get it from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned to the wall next to the front desk with her pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out from behind the desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa lowered her arms and obediently slid out from behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman raised her pistol again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring your arms back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's arms went back up again. The British woman was dressed casually for the day, with blue jeans and sandals. She was dressed in a white collared shirt with a pink sweater over it. The pink sweater was a bit small for her though, as it gripped th3 bottom of the white collared shirt when her arms were raised and pulled it up to her ribs, revealing her pale belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around, Ms. Cornvall. Keep your hands raised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frisk you darling.

The British woman was keeping calm given the circumstances, but Erin could see fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman moved behind Melissa and squatted down to begin her search.

What could she possibly find funny about...\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frisking was tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shifted in her hiding place to get a closer look. The masked woman was squatting down and meticulously tapping Melissa's legs with the tips of her fingers. She slowly moved up from her calf to her thigh on her right leg and down from the thigh on her left leg to her left calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's body began to tense from the touch. She was arguably the most ticklish person Erin knew on the island and Erin couldn't imagine how badly this was affecting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman then rose and moved her hands to Melissa's hips. The British woman's cheeks began to turn red a bit, as she did everything in her power to hold her laughter back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the masked woman's finger moved to Melissa's exposed bare sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's eyes grew wide as the tips of the fingers touched on her bare skin. Erin knew this would be the worst of it. Melissa's torso was her biggest weakness. The ribs, sides, tummy, waist, bellybutton. Tickling any of these areas would drive Melissa absolutely insane with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe British woman began to sway a little from side to side, as the masked woman dragged her fingers up and down Melissa's bare sides. The robber couldn't see Melissa's expression, but there was no denying the reaction she was getting from touching these sensitive areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the robber stopped her search and took a step back. Melissa breathed a sigh of relief, though it was clear that it took a Herculean effort for her not to crack up in hysterical laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Ms. Cornvall.

Too afraid of the pistol to lower them, Melissa shut her eyes tight as she felt the delicate tip of the feather begin to move teasingly up and down her stomach. She bit her lip to suppress any laughter, but her growing grin began to allow snickers to escape, betraying how badly the dancing feather was tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin winced as she watched this unfold. She knew her friend wouldn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman didn't seem to think so either. She began to use the feather to dust Melissa's ribs and brush her abs. The masked woman could see her bare belly twitch with each touch of the feather and see her body tighten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vere you lying to be about how teeklish you are, Ms. Cornvall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....hehehehe\u2026.wasn't hehehehehehehehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suuuuuure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh yes I'm not that ticklisheheheheheheheheh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm I' not so sure. Let's try something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman put the feather away and used her free hand to wiggle her fingers gently along the exposed belly. Melissa could not longer hold in her laughter. She began to giggle frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhehehehehehhohohohohoo oh no no hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha! So you ARE ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahahahahahaha yes yes I lied hahahahahahahahahahahhaah I'm really ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman then began to scratch Melissa's ribs as she continued to tickle torture the poor British girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so.

Melissa panted as the tickling stopped. Her arms were still raised above her head, but were now beginning to grow tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Ms. Cornvall. You saw how bad this vill get! Tell me about the amulet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I really don't. I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ve need more privacy for this to continue.

Melissa threw her head back and giggled. She hated having her bellybutton tickled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAhahahahahahahahahoh no no hahahahahhahahahahahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vhere can ve go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahah the store room the store room hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahhahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling stopped.

No more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave me no choice. Lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms still raised, Melissa began to move slowly towards the back of the store, right in Erin's direction. Erin crouched lower in her hiding spot, desperately hoping to maintain her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin heard the two sets of footsteps approaching, her mind began to race about what she could do.

Erin's mind was racing, not knowing what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, she felt small bristles from the robbers feather from before glide along Erin's belly. <br>\r\nErin immediately turned her head away and pulled against her restraints, to no avail. <br>\r\n\"Pfftffttt hehehehehahahaha\" Erin giggled, her belly swaying side to side as much as it could.<br>\r\n\"I see you're quite teeklish, now do you know anything about vhe location of vhe amulet?\" the robber questions Erin, slowly increasing the speed at which she drew her feather around Erin's belly.<br>\r\n\"Nohohoho hehehehe hahaha hehehe\" Erin giggled in reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't know anything! Let her go, please! She -\" Melissa says pleads, only to be interuppted once more.<br>\r\n\"Shut it voman, unless you want to be teekled vhat badly\" the robber says, forcefully. \"I vill break her virst and then you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the feather away, Erin slouched in her bonds, thankful for the breather but knowing it'll only get worse from here. <br>\r\nHopefully someone comes to save them before Melissa reveals anything, Erin thinks to herself. She must hold out! For her friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin braced for the worst, jumping and squealing slightly when she felt the robbers hands at her sides. Without delay, the robber spidering her nimble fingers all over Erin's precious, exposed and ticklish sides. Erin twisting in her position as much as she could, laughing, helplessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAHahahahahahaha! Nohohohoho hahahahahaha! Plehehehese ahahahahahaha!

Erin only replying with her laughs. \"Oh vell, I can keep vhis up allll day\" the Robber now moving up and down Erin's sides, and to make it worst, occasionally switching back to her belly causing Erin to screech with extra laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohohoho AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA Nahaha hahahaha!

Hahahahahahaha!\" Erin laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber spiders her way up Erin's exposed sides one last time before entering her clean shaven armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's laugh increased in magnitude. Her armpits are her worst spot and she could feel every single finger tickle her with insane precision. \"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! OH FUHUHUHUCK NO! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HA NO PLEHEHEAHAHAHASE PLEASE HAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\nThis tickling was far worse than the last, with every nerve sending tickles right into Erin she could feel her sanity slipping. Erin tried her hardest to pull down her arms but it was useless, she was too secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, vhis is a veeeerry teeklish spot! Teekle teekle\" teased the robber as she assaulted Erin's underarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAHAHAHAHAD NOHOHOHO  HAHAHAHAHA! STAHAHAHAHAP! PLEHEHEAHAHAHASE! PLEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I BEG OF YOHOHOU! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! AAAHAHAHAHAHA!\", Erin was finding it hard to breathe because of her laughter, only getting in a big breath once every now and then. This tickling is too much, it has to stop now! Erin cannot hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right when Erin was going to beg Melissa to save her, the robber stopped tickling for a moment, allowing Erin to partially regain her sanity and catch a couple of breaths. With sweat covering most of her body, only making her more ticklish, Erin only thought about what the robber was going to do to her next as all she could hear was subtle movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was quite shocked when the robber re-adjusted Erin's bonds, forcing her to be in more of a line formation like an 'I' rather than the 'X' she was before but Erin was already too tired to fight back.<br>\r\nHaving been safely tapped back onto the wall, Erin took her last couple of breaths of hope before she felt a sudden gel like substance covering her underarms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehe\" Erin giggled as the robber applied the gel over her topless, exposed body, covering everything from the armpits to her belly.<br>\r\nWith a single snip, Erin felt a slight breeze before the same gel covered her now exposed breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin panicked but not for long as the robber quickly began to make work of her exposed armpits with the gel increasing how ticklish she became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO FUCK AHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA! PLEHAHAHAHAHA! I GIVIVIVE BAHAHAHAHAHA! GAHAHAHAHAHAHAD NOHOHOHHAHAHAHAHA!\" Erin squirmed as much as she could but she seemed to be even more secure than before, leaving her little room to move. Her laughter increased even more and Erin again began to feel helpless once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By now vou vould be 5 times as teeklish, now bevore you give out, vhere is vhe amulet?\" the robber asked one final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin could barley reply, she was laughing too much to even breathe let alone reply because of how ticklish she had now become. <br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I DOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I DOHOHOHAHAHAHA BWAHAHAHAHAHA!

All she could do now is plead and beg, only to fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa couldn't help but feel guilty for what's happening to her friend, but she herself was just as helpless to do anything.

Surrounding her were shelves and aisles filled with everything from old paintings, to furniture and all sorts of knick knacks collected from all corners of the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell on top of the front door rang shrilly as Erin entered. However, Melissa did not turn around. She continued with her business behind the desk with her back to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa?\" Erin called curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. Her back remained to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward towards the desk, a new sound reached Erin's ears that explained Melissa's obliviousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the faint sound of heavy metal music. Well it sounded faint to Erin. In Melissa's wireless headphones the sound of the bass guitar was probably deafening. Melissa's curly, chestnut brown hair, which hung gracefully across her back, was shielding these headphone from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled and shook her head. Had she more evil intentions, she probably could've run off with anything in the store and Melissa would not be any the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was dressed very comfortably for the summer day. She wore faded jeans and sandals, with a white collared shirt that was untucked. On top of the collared shirt was a pink sweater that appeared to be too small for Melissa, for every few seconds Melissa would drop what she was doing and pull down on the bottom of the sweater until it went past her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin began to stealthily tiptoe towards the desk, hoping Melissa would keep her back to her long enough to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she got within arm's reach of the desk, Melissa let out a long, loud yawn that echoed through the empty shop. Erin had to hold back her laughter. Clearly the loud noise of the headphones made her forget just how loud she sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, keeping her back to Erin still, Melissa raised both arms straight up into the air and high over her head, in a long and relaxing stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, the sweater that had been forcibly pulled down and stretched, got its revenge. As her arms raised, the sweater gripped the bottom of the untucked collared shirt and pulled it higher and higher up Melissa's belly. When the sweater and shirt stopped, they left the ivory white skin of her torso bare from her waist, past her bellybutton and up to the bottom of her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devilish idea soon gripped Erin's mind as she decided to take her final steps closer. Slowly moving her hands towards the oblivious Melissa, Erin decided to.........................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In spite of her excellent physical fitness, she had a slight muffin top to her belly, which always made her nervous to wear midriff bearing clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that's what she said to Erin. Erin never believed that explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Melissa failed to mention is that her stomach coincidentally was the most ticklish area on her body. Ribs, sides, love handles, tummy, bellybutton and waist. The slightest touch from a feather or finger to any of those spots would send the British girl into cackling hysterical laughter. THAT was why Melissa always hid behind the muffin top excuse. She refused to admit that having her belly tickled was her biggest weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin never understood why. She'd spent countless hours at the Cornwall house with Melissa, her daughter Catherine and her niece Sarah. Tickling Melissa's belly was Catherine and Sarah's favorite sport. Erin could recall watching arguments between Catherine and Melissa end with Sarah getting Melissa in a full nelson wrestling hold and Catherine tickling her mother's torso until she turned red in the face. Even on quiet beach trips, Sarah or Catherine would take turns sneaking up behind Melissa while she and Erin talked. Once they got close enough, they would reach around and lobster claw her bikini clad belly and furiously scratch her ribs until Melissa laughed so hard she fell to the sand. Even then her attacker would continue to tickle her tummy until she surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Melissa would lie to Erin of all people made no sense. With the exception of her toes, Melissa's tummy was her most ticklish spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why now Erin reached forward and began to gently and deftly wiggle her fingers along Melissa's stretched soft sides. Immediately the outstretched arms came down and wrapped themselves around the front of her stomach in a vain attempt to protect her ticklish flesh. Unfortunately for Melissa, Erin maneuvered her fingers snugly beneath Melissa's arms so that she could still continue her tickling assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa howled with laughter and swayed side to side trying to escape the tickling fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAH WHO IS THAT HAHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHHEHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHSTOP TICKLING ME HAHAHAHAHAHHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin kept her hands frantically wiggling over every exposed spot of white skin she could see. Her hands moved so quickly that Melissa couldn't keep up. Every time she would block a spot, Erin's hand would find a new unprotected area of her belly to tickle. Laughter filled the empty store and Melissa fell to the floor with a ticklish thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHEHHEHAHAHEHEHEHHAHHEHEHHEH NO NO NO STOP AHEHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled and continued to tickle her friend as she rolled on the ground in hysterical laughter.

Just...\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine and Sarah are traveling to Europe for a week. They'll be staying with my parents in Surrey for a few days and then go to the continent from there. This is the first time they're traveling on their own, so naturally I've been up half the night worrying about.....well everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When'd they leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two nights ago. I was up late waiting for Catherine to text me to check in. She did....but I still worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're getting older Melissa. They want to see the world. You gotta get use to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed again. This one was more deeper and resigned than the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. And I know they can handle themselves. I just miss them. It's lonely here without them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of you though, Melissa. I didn't think you'd let them travel that far on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was against the idea at first. I warmed up to the idea of them going to my parents place quickly. The traveling on the continent alone part was out of the question. That was a lot harder to accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd they convince you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa suppressed a smile. Her cheeks turned a little red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They ended up being very...\u2026...\u2026..persuasive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persuasive? How...\u2026\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stopped herself. It suddenly hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tickled it out of you didn't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's smile grew wider. She refused to look at Erin, but her cheeks turned a brighter red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've guessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little imps. I fell asleep on the sofa. Catherine wrapped a sheet around my legs and Sarah tickled my toes. I couldn't stop laughing and they said they'd stop if I agreed to let them travel on the continent. It didn't take long, but I agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're getting good at doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too good. I still miss them though. But it's good you've come for your vacation. It'll be nice to have some company while they're away. How long are you staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks. Maybe a little more. I came by to see if you were free for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.

His thick black hair was neatly arranged on his head. He sported pressed slacks, polished shoes and a crisp collared shirt. From the looks of it, he was in his late thirties or early forties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell on both women and a friendly smile crossed his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening mes cheres,\" he said, a thick French accent coloring his speech, \"I hope that I am not too late before closing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked the man over. There was something familiar about him. She had seen his face before, but could not remember where. It certainly had not been on the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was the first of them to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Francois. Though you have just one second to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man moved forward and extended his hand to Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have good timing then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Melissa's hand in his and with a chivalric gesture pressed his lips to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again Melissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You as well Francois.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Frenchman released her hand and turned to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a friend of yours, Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. This is my friend Erin, she's a newspaper reporter on the mainland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancois extended his hand to Erin and repeated the same chivalric gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you Erin. I am Count Francois Valois. At your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name brought the memory back. Erin now knew where she'd seen him before. Count Valois was a world renowned philanthropist, responsible for the excavation and preservation of numerous historical artifacts. He was also known as an avid adventurer. The papers had dubbed him the modern day Sir Richard Burton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure's mine,\" Erin replied. \"How do you know Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count started to reply, but Melissa quickly cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count Valois has brought several pieces to me for restoration. He's one of my best customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's cheeks turned red as she spoke. Erin could sense there was more to this than she let on. She'd have to press for more information later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yes,\" the Count replied, his tone a bit crushed by Melissa's response, \"I own a small estate on the island. Melissa has been good enough to help me with its interior design and restoring several pieces that hang there. She does remarkable work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only too happy to help,\" Melissa said, \"Is that why you've come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cherie. I actually have a small favor to ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's eyes narrowed at the young nobleman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing dangerous I can assure you,\" the Count said smiling, \"There is an important package due to arrive on the island from Nepal. It's contents are very valuable and delicate. I am having it sent here and was wondering if you would be kind enough to ensure that the contents are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a delicate item. It requires delicate hands to care for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rare artifact. The Nepalese call it 'The Golden Fist.' It's been lost for centuries. An old acquaintance of mine discovered it and charged me with its safe keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you plan to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it to experts to be verified. Then turn it over for further study. Will you do me this favor, Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took a moment to think it over. It seemed like a harmless enough task. Still............something seemed off, though Melissa could not say why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, whatever would get the man out of her place of business the fastest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'll look after it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. I knew I could rely on you cherie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is it due to arrive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count checked his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8 o'clock this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8 o'clock? The mail service doesn't run that late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private plane cherie. I have instructed them to take it right here after they land. I know this is an inconvenience, so I am happy to pay you for this service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed. She had hoped to head home at normal time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I'd be happy to wait here with you until it arrives to provide company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have Erin here with me. Thank you for the offer though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count's shoulders dropped defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course cherie. Um.....all you need do is call once the package has arrived and you've inspected it. I will send my secretary, Ms. Valenka, to retrieve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be done then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" the Count replied meekly, \"thank you again cherie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defeated nobleman turned and made his way to the door. He stopped in the doorway and turned to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you as always Melissa. Erin it was a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed behind him with a soft thud. Melissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to volunteer you Erin. If I hadn't he'd have stayed and I'd have to sit around here in awkward silence for the next three hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you know Count Valois! Why didn't you tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a big name dropper. Besides, I barely know the man. He's a customer. Nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin eyed Melissa suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed and rubbed her eyes in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it right now. I'm too exhausted. Are you okay with waiting with me? I can make us dinner at the house afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure no problem. Can I help you close up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be great actually. I have some things I need to put in the attic area. Would you mind watching the phone for a second? Once I come back out, I'll show you what you can do to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin agreed and Melissa disappeared into the back. The store fell silent again, as Erin waited behind the desk. That silence was suddenly broken as Erin heard...................</span></div></div>",

Even though the ceiling was not that high, a small ladder was required to gain access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ladder was now lying flat on the ground along with Melissa's sandals. The source of the crashing sound Erin heard had been the falling ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin called up to Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa?! What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin? Thank God.

Melissa's torso and legs were all hanging in the storage area, while the top half of her body was stuck in the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse of course, Melissa's shirt was pushed up leaving her pale belly fully exposed.

It was too good of an opportunity to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one problem. Her hands couldn't quite reach up to Melissa's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she spotted something in the corner of the storage room that provided a perfect solution. Leaning against the corner of the room was an old Egyptian style fan. It was a tall golden pole with a single feather attached to the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect for the height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin!\" Melissa called again, \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin casually strolled over to the fan and took it in both hands. She then positioned herself to the side of her trapped friend, just far enough that Melissa's flailing legs couldn't reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Melissa...\u2026\u2026..before I put the ladder back up, why don't you tell me about the Count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

We're all alone with plenty of time. Did something happen between you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it now. I'd like to get down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not in a position to keep quiet Melissa,\" Erin taunted, \"I could always force it out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you...\u2026.oh no. No. NO TICKLING. I've had enough for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you one last chanceeeeee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin I swear to God! If you try and tickle me, I'll kick you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You asked for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa began to flail her legs furiously, hoping to connect with something. Unfortunately, she had no idea what was below her, so it was all in vain. After a few fruitless minutes, she let her legs hang exhausted and helplessly below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Erin decided to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly raised the feather tipped part of the fan close to the pale white belly that lay helplessly before her. She let it touch gently down on Melissa's lovehandles. Then slowly she let it trace down Melissa's sides, up and down, causing her tummy to twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is thahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahaahhat?! Hahahahahahahhahahah oh no hahahahahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin then changed directions, bringing the tip of the feather across the front of her belly and down the opposite side. Then she brought it along Melissa's sensitive waist, causing the trapped British woman to begin kicking her legs again to get the object away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehaheheheheheeheh oh God stop ahahhahahhhahhhheheheheh that tickles so bad! Hahahahahaahahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Erin kept the feather one step head of the flailing feet and continued to gently glide the feather all along Melissa's ivory white skin. She danced it gently along Melissa's abs and used it to dust between her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa kept flailing helplessly as she struggled to avoid getting tickled, but the feather tormenting her belly was sending her into hysterical fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahaahahahahaha oh no no hahahahahaah not my ribs! Hohohohohohohohhohohohohohahahahahaaha not there not there hahahahahahahahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahaha no I won't tell hahahahahahaahhaahahahahahahahahahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then.

This was by the far the worst scenario for Melissa. Her daughter, Catherine, and niece, Sarah, referred to this as her \"Tickle Button.\" One poke in that area and Melissa would be on the ground in an instant in hysterics. It was so bad in fact, that often times they didn't even need to make contact. Erin could recall one time she had walked in on Catherine and Sarah wrestling with Melissa, when Catherine successfully pinned Melissa's arms above her head. Sarah then straddled Melissa's legs and gently lifted her t-shirt up to her ribs. Sarah teasingly wiggled her finger and Melissa and slowly began to let it drop toward her bellybutton. Before it even touched her stomach, Melissa was writhing with laughter. She was nearly in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why when the feather entered her bellybutton, Erin was not surprised by the hysterical reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHHHAHHHHAHHAHHAHAHAA NOT THERE ANYWHERE BUT THERE HAHHAHAHAHHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHHAHH YES YES AHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHHAHAHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to tell me everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH WELL I DONT...\u2026.HOHAHAHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHHE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin began to twirl the fan and wiggle the feather deeper and deeper into her bellybutton.

Erin stood behind her with arms out, worried that in her weakened state she would collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the minute her feet touched the ground, Melissa slumped against Erin.

She smiled briefly at the two girls, before beginning her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone was colored with a rich German accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening. I am here to pick up a package for the Count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa patted the top of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Has it been opened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. No. I didn't think the Count wanted....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct,\" Ingrid interrupted, \"The contents are very fragile and of the utmost importance to his grace. He would prefer that the contents not be disturbed before he has a chance to look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Melissa replied, slightly off put by the businesslike tone. \"It's yours to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid strode forward and removed the box from the counter. She moved to the front door and gently pushed it open, calling out in German to someone outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man dressed in a limo driver uniform came quickly to the door and relieved Ingrid of her burden. Once the package was removed, she turned back to the two ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Count is grateful for your help. Has he warned you about the contents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that the item is of great value.\" Melissa answered, \"Nothing more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid looked over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone else been by to inquire about the package today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The only one who talked about it was the Count. He's only been gone an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has he told you about...\u2026.other interested parties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not aware there were any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to the Count about this several times. He never listens to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Erin inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The package,\" Ingrid began, \"is one of the rarest items in the world. It's been the Count's obsession for years. He sank a great deal of money into tracking it down and ensuring its safe arrival here. Until now, his success in locating it has only been made known to myself and the Count. No others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there were several other parties who have spent even longer than the Count looking for it. The fewer people who know, the easier it is to conceal its location. When the Count suggested using your shop as a drop off point, I told him to explain to you the danger you would now be in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Melissa exchanged nervous glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danger?\" Melissa repeated, \"What kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people who seek this item are not of the most reputable kind. Several of them are linked to organized crime. But one group in particular has been more...\u2026.........troublesome than the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid's voice now sounded graver than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Cocegas Crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three women. From the jungles of the Amazon. They're of immense physical strength and cunning. To them, the item is nearly a God. We've had several encounters with them and they've proven quite formidable. Luckily, the Count was able to outmaneuver them and get the item here. To our knowledge they do not have any idea that the item's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\u2026...we must take precautions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of precautions?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid reached into her jacker pocket and removed a small cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this. It's number is not traceable. It connects directly to me. No one else. Should you find yourself or your friend see anything suspicious: being followed by a strange car, anything. Call this number. I will be able to ensure your safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the police?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They cannot help you. Not against those women. The Count and I know them very well. We are your best defense. Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Erin looked at each other nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Melissa said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Ingrid replied, \"and DO NOT mention this package to anyone. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it. The more the word spreads the more the Cocegas Crew can find us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both swear.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I will take my leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the strange German woman disappeared. Once her car vanished from sight, Erin looked at Melissa with great concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she's serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But in any case.........it may not be a bad idea for us to keep together tonight. At least until I can talk to the Count more in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\" Erin agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Let's head back home. Grab a change of clothes. We'll stay a my place tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her coat from behind the desk, Melissa led Erin to the front door of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them then...\u2026..............</span></div></div>",

Make yourself at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa led Erin to the living room, which was already prepared for her arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pizzas were on the coffee table, along with two bottles of wine and glasses. The large leather sofa was arranged with sheets and a small blanket for Erin to sleep on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa as well was already in relaxation mode for the evening. She was barefoot and dressed in flannel pajama pants and a black, long sleeved crop top sweatshirt, which left her torso from her bellybutton to her bottom ribs exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to bed already are you?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. I always change into this the minute I get home from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gestured to the food and wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat. I haven't had anything since noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls ate heartily from the pizza boxes and each had a few glasses of wine, which instantly relaxed them both. The secretary's story had shaken them up a bit, so both were eager to forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they'd eaten and began their catch up conversation, one question was still lingering in Erin's mind from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa.

Seriously? I saw you six month ago! How did this not come up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgotten? C'mon now. We've been friends for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I just......didn't want to make a big deal out of it. He's followed by people everywhere he goes. I was amazed we were able to keep it secret as long as we did. I didn't know how it would turn out, so I figured I'd keep it to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.....what happened? He dump you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dumped him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nearly spit out her wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You DUMPED Count Valois? Why would you do that? He's one of the richest men alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just wasn't working. He and I had totally different visions of what the relationship was supposed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed and drank more from her wine glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at first things were great. I'd close the shop at five and then we'd go off somewhere. Fly to the mainland. Have dinner at some upscale place in a private room. He lived his life and I lived mine. Our free time was spent with each other. Always something new. Exciting to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He......kept talking about our future. Saying he'd take care of Catherine and me. Take us with him on his travels. See the world with him. Tell me I'd never have to work another day in the shop as long as I lived. Told me I could sell it...and this house and come live with him. Never want for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stared at her friend in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Catherine was born......I had nothing. If my parents didn't live nearby there was a good chance we'd of both been homeless. It took me YEARS......to get on my feet. To get to this island. Get the shop open. Buy this house. Make the fortune I've made.....and get my independence from that past. That shop is a part of me. Just like this house is. They're what I've achieved on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that got to do with the Count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It felt like he was trying to take over. Push me over to the passenger seat of my own life and take it from there. I don't NEED someone to take care of us. I've been able to do that on my own. If I settle down with someone, I want them to be a part of my life, not take control of it. It was a little insulting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't mean to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know he didn't, but a man like that is use to being in control of things like that. I couldn't get him to understand that I didn't want someone taking care of me. I wanted to it to be a partnership. Each of us have our own lives and then combine them. Not me dropping everything in my life to be a part of his. It was a nice gesture but...\u2026..I wouldn't feel like I was living my own life that way. Just living his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took another drink from her glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt horrible. I could tell I crushed him. But...\u2026.I had to be honest. He seemed to respect that, but it's always tough seeing him now. I feel like he's not use to being pushed away like that. It's like.....he keeps trying to win me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it could be worse..........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Worse things than having a billionaire chasing you...\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa popped open the next bottle of wine and was about to pour more into her glass when she was interrupted by a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...........................<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We got a call about an unmarked vehicle nearly hitting a few pedestrians near your shop. They said it came down from the hill. We sent a squad car up there and it looks like one of the windows was broken,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa eyes narrowed curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broken window?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I've got a security system that should've gone off if one of the windows broke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing ma'am. No alarm. Someone managed to get around the system. We need you to come down and help us figure out how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. How much was taken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure ma'am. We need help with that as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes officer. I'll be down immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa hung up and quickly strode back through the living room. Brushing past Erin, she went over to a small closet door, where she removed a pair of hiking boots which she put over her bare feet. She removed a coat as well which she through over her crop top sweater and bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin watched her with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cops called. Someone broke a window at the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin rose immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!

If a window broke I'd know about it. The security system connects directly to my phone. Nothing was triggered until the cop called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think...\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But in case I'm right......I want you to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa went back into the kitchen and came back with the cell phone Ingrid had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to take this. If I see anything suspicious when I get to the store, I'll text your cell phone. If I do that, call the Count's secretary on that phone and let her know about the break in. Tell her Officer Charlene Flanders was the one who reported it. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded. She hugged her friend tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope nothing's missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Melissa exited. Erin moved to the front window and watched Melissa's car disappear down the driveway and into the dark, clear evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnerved by the call, Erin frantically grabbed her cell phone and laid it on the coffee table. She then sat on the sofa and held the Count's cell phone tightly in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes, Erin's eyes started to grow heavy.

In a few seconds all three women were crouching behind the bushes, completely out of view of any passers-by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Katrina,\" Melissa demanded, \"What's this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina stood up for a second, looking around frantically before continuing. While she stood up, Erin took a closer look at the panicked Crossfitter. The muscular blonde woman was close to six feet tall, with well defined arms and legs. Her hair was tied back tight in a ponytail and she wore white running shoes and socks. She also sported white spandex running shorts and a sleeveless cotton t-shirt that read \"Gansdor CrossFit.\" The t-shirt was cut right at her ribs, showing off Katrina's six-pack abs and toned obliques. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed amusing to Erin that such a powerfully build woman was spooked by anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that old woman gone?\" Katrina asked, as she crouched back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Melissa answered, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina let out a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd never get rid of her. She's got the whole town looking for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again,\" Melissa repeated, \"why? Why are they looking for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina hesitated before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I tickled the mayor's wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me,\" Katrina sheepishly replied, \"She took one of my yoga classes. I didn't think she gave enough effort, so I asked her to stay after class and tickled her as punishment. I didn't know that's who her husband was. Next thing I knew, I started getting anonymous letters from the town vigilante group, saying I needed to appear before them for punishment by today. I panicked and went into hiding. That's when that old woman started moving around town asking people about me. I thought when I hid up here, she'd never find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you come here?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shop's out of view. People can't see me up here......at least for now. That's why I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa glanced over at Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide me at your house. You've got a isolated place on the hill. Just 'til this blows over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Why should I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean you tickle the crap out of me all the time in your classes! You deserve whatever you get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina fell to her knees in front of Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. Please. I'm begging you. I'm sorry. I really am. I won't do it anymore. I just need a place to lie low. Just until I can get a way off the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa looked over at Erin again. Katrina's face was filled with absolute terror. Whatever the group had planned for her was enough to have resorting to begging. Perhaps that mental anguish was enough punishment for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took a moment to think it over before giving her reply.</span></div></div>",

The young British woman was dressed in a pair of dark flannel pajamas, her arms flailing in every direction and her upperbody twisting and turning in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly seated on Melissa's shins, was Marie, a well dressed and dark haired Parisian woman. The French woman had an amused look on her face as she friend was in absolute hysterics. She sat with her chin on one hand, while her other well manicured free hand was gently and delicately tickling and teasing the pale bare feet of Melissa that stuck out from the bottom of her pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my cherie,\" Marie bemused, \"you're even more ticklish than I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA YES YES HAHAHAHAHAHHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should've known better than to lie to me. Oh well, I will get you to admit the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Marie's free hand gently traced its nails up and down Melissa's bare arches. She made sure to make just enough contact with the skin for Melissa to feel them, but light enough that they sent severe tingling sensations throughout her skin. As the French woman's weight was solidly on her shins and ankles, all Melissa could do was move her feet from side to side, but it was a futile gesture. Marie's fingers torturously tickled her sensitive soles, leaving the British woman weak with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH I GIVE UP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would,\" Marie mused, slowly moving her fingers up the soles and towards her toes, \"however, I will need to get a truthful answer to my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe French woman's fingers now reached the base of Melissa's toes. The nails snuck their way into the sensitive spots beneath them and dug in. Melissa's laughter kicked up another octave, as her arms and upperbody flailed even harder on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again: did you miss me, cherie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YES YES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did!\" Marie laughed, \"So you lied before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YES YES I LIED HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insulting!\" teased Marie, \"Will you make it up to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH YES YES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ANYTHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Marie's eyes lit up, \"Really? ANYTHING I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH YES ANYTHING HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm okay cherie,\" Marie said, digging furiously into her toes, \"We will do a tickle game then. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAH YES YES OK OK HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA I'LL DO IT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the tickling stopped altogether. Melissa lay in a panting heap on the floor, Marie still seated firmly on her shins and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you too, cherie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you did,\" Melissa panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie reached into her pocket and pulled out a large coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember this coin cherie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sat up on her elbows. Her eyes went wide at the sight of the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. No. Not this game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie smiled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Remember,\" she said gently tracing Melissa's feet and toes again, \"ANYTHING I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa began to snicker and giggle at the tickly touches. She knew what would happen if she refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehe ok ok hehehehehehehehehehehhehehehe I remember. Anything heheheheheheheh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now as you remember, I will flip this. Heads is your lower body. Tails your upperbody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie flicked the coin high into the air. Melissa propped herself up on her elbows to see the verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin it the ground with a soft thud. Both ladies leaned over to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read....................</span></div></div>",

Raise your arms over your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa started to protest, but saw Marie wiggle her fingers furiously down towards her feet and swallowed her protest. Laying back on the ground, Melissa raised both arms straight above her head. Her flannel pajama top rose about a centimeter above her bellybutton, leaving a good amount of her pale belly exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to please Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa started to put her arms back down, but Marie stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Marie cried, \"Put them back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa obeyed instantly. Marie shifted her position on Melissa's legs, so that she was now straddling her thighs and facing the British woman's bare belly. She moved both hands menacingly over the pale skin of Melissa's exposed tummy, keeping her fingers an inch above the skin. Melissa kept her arms obediently upwards. She was too scared to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, cherie,\" Marie began, \"I am going to get off your legs. You are to scoot back to the staircase and bring your back against the wall. If you try to escape...........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's fingers began to wiggle. Slowly and torturously, though they did not move from their place one inch above Melissa's tummy. Melissa shifted uncomfortably and shut her eyes. A smile cracked across her lips, along with a few giggles. She even began to shift her hips slightly, as if the tickling was already happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...............if you try to escape. I will tickle you without mercy. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie hopped off Melissa legs and onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may lower your arms and scoot to the wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa instantly brought her arms down and propped herself up onto her bottom.

Now raise your arms up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa did as she was told. Marie removed the scarf that was around her neck and tied it around Melissa's wrists and around the railing of the stairs. This stretched Melissa's arms straight above her head, though her bottom still remained on the ground. The flannel pajama top had risen again just above the bellybutton, as Marie straddled Melissa's shins once again. She stared intently at the section of pale belly that now stared back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmm,\" Marie mused, \"needs some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly reached over and began to roll the bottom of Melissa's pajama top up to the top of her ribs, where she promptly tied it in a knot. Then, she grabbed Melissa's legs and gently brought them a little further away from the wall. The British woman now formed an obtuse angle across the floor, with her entire chubby torso exposed to tickling fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gulped.

That would explain why no one could hear her knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin moved away from the front door and trotted around the side of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon reached the back porch. This was Erin's favorite part of Melissa's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden deck had been completely renovated by the young British woman. A roof had been added over it and rather than screens encasing the side, it was surrounded by large glass windows. With a window in the center of the roof, the entire porch acted as a greenhouse and was filled around the perimeter with a variety of flowers and herbs that Melissa and her daughter grew themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin moved to the porch entrance and tried to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights on the back porch were turned on full blast, so Erin could see inside the whole porch. In the center of the room, was a sofa flanked on each side by an armchair. They were arranged in a semicircle with side tables on the ends. This was where Melissa would have guests after dinner to relax and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Erin saw someone come onto the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Melissa. She stopped in the middle of the semicircle of furniture and bent over to catch her breath. The young British woman was dressed in a pair of long sleeve dark flannel pajamas and her hair was messily strewn about her head. She was panting heavily, like she'd just completed a marathon, but instead of a look of anguish, a broad smile was sported across her face and she was giggling uncontrollably between pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was about to knock on the porch door to get her attention when another figure appeared in the porch entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be her friend Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe French woman had a devious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-HA CHERIE!

Melissa stood upright and took a step back. Her panting had calmed down, but her giggling now began to pick up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-he-he-he please no he-he-he-he no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her friend in this state of panic, Erin knew what was about to happen.

She pulled out her phone and checked something on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry ma'am, maybe I made a mistake. Is this the house of Melissa Cornwall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa Cornwall, the young British single mother, lived next door to Erin and ran a profitable antiques shop on the island. Not surprisingly, she was always the target of solicitors and opportunists who wanted to be involved with her business somehow. This was actually not the first time that Erin's home had been confused by such an occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Wrong house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's embarrassing. Do you happen to know where she lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis put Erin in a tough spot. Once business hours ended, Melissa always enjoyed spending her time at home in peace during the summer with her daughter, Catherine, and her niece, Sarah, who always visited the island in the summers. Erin knew that Melissa likely wouldn't want to be bothered...........though the saleswoman had been polite and seemed harmless enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin decided to.......................</span></div></div>",

The male news anchor shuffled the papers in front of him with a grim expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top story this evening, another hit in what has become a string of robberies taking place over the island. A young woman, Amanda Kissinger, reported the theft of her jewelry to police earlier this morning. Ms. Kissinger claims to have no memory of what happened. She had this to say to our local news reporter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera cuts to the image of a twenty three year old woman sporting a distraught look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd gotten home from work and heard a knock at the door. Lady on the other side was friendly, saying she was lost and needed directions. Next thing I know.......I woke up on my couch five hours later. All the jewelry in my bedroom was missing. I.....had no idea how it was found. I keep it hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff camera you can hear a reporter's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it the woman who knocked on the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. Could be. Could not. I barely even remember her face. All I know was I answered the door and.......everything went blank. Only thing I knew was my stomach was aching.......like I'd been laughing really hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut back to the anchor in the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Similar stories have been reported in the area. We warn our listeners that if you spot anything suspicious.....contact the local police immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin rolled her eyes at the TV and switched to a more relaxing sitcom.

I was getting ready to go downstairs, when I heard people coming up the stairs. I thought it was just Aunt Melissa and Catherine......until I heard another voice behind them. I shut the lights off in my room and peeked through a crack in the door. It was the weirdest thing......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Melissa and Catherine. They were walking up the stairs. They had their arms raised straight up over their head. Like they were being held up by robbers. But............they didn't look scared. They had this blank look on their face. The woman behind them was ordering them to move ahead and stop at the top of the stairs. She wasn't yelling. She didn't have a weapon. She just asked nicely.....and they did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,,,,,,,she lined Aunt Melissa and Catherine next to each other. She made them keep their arms raised. Then she started asking Aunt Melissa where her jewels and money were. Aunt Melissa kept shaking her head no. So did Catherine. The woman then said that she was gonna make them tell her.........whether they wanted to or not......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin took a few seconds to absorb all that. She felt a twinge of guilt, as she was the one who had pointed the woman in that direction in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to call the police.\" Erin decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?

Her eyes are shut and her entire body is perfectly rigid and still. Her arms are lying tight against her sides and her legs up to her ankles are motionless on the floor. The only parts of her body moving are her mouth, which is wide open with raucous laughter and the soles and toes of her bare feet, which are being mercilessly tickled by her blond haired daughter, Catherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine, with a glazed look in her eyes, is sitting cross-legged in front of Melissa's feet. She is slumped slightly forward, but her face contains a vacant expression. She is as still as a statue.......expect for her outstretch hands, whose fingers are gently tickling her mom's feet and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the doorway on the inside of the room, the saleswoman Harriet, looks on with an amused grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Melissa,\" Harriet mused, \"I TOLD you you could both be hypnotized. No one is smart enough to resist it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoarse belly laughter emanated from Melissa's mouth, while the rest of her body remained perfectly still, as if it was glued completely to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH NO HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAH WHO'S TICKLING MY FEET HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA MAKE THEM STOP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Don't make me laugh' you said,\" Harriet chuckled, ignoring Melissa's pleas, \"So......challenge accepted. And I didn't even need to lift a finger. Your daughter provided all ten for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA 34;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet now moved closer to the giggling British woman. She crouched down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course you could've given me the location of your jewels and we'd be fine. But no.......even under hypnosis you somehow managed to refuse. I warned you I'd tickle it out of you.....but you didn't budge. Insisted you weren't ticklish. Liar. Luckily........I got what I wanted anyway. A nice little tickle toy and a wonderful tickler. She's so obedient. Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over to Catherine, Harriet issued her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine,\" she commanded, \"just her toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently, all ten of Catherine's fingers converged on the British woman's toes. Her nails dug beneath all of them, sending Melissa into hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHEHEHEHEHHAHEHHEHEHE OH NO NO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHHHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voila. Nothing to it. Now Catherine...............heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a step, the ten fingers of the blond haired British girl moved south to the heels of her mother's feet. Melissa continued to giggle furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.........sides of the feet Catherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten fingers split, five to the side of each foot.

Catherine removed her finger and placed her hands in her lap. She sat perfectly still......awaiting Harriet's next instructions when they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was now panting and giggling from the break. Harriet moved closer to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me, Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe *pant* hehehehehe yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet now leaned close to Melissa's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I snap my fingers......you will be able to move your head.

Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet snapped her fingers. Slowly Melissa lifted her head up. Her hair was matted and covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe I....I can't take it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then......you are ready to tell me where you hide your jewelry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe....I ......can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet looked disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe they're from my grandmother.

I hate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Harriet grinned maliciously, \"her FAVORITE thing above all else. In quiet public places. Where everyone stares at the slightest noise that breaks the silence. She tries to make you giggle loud enough for people to pay attention. And she said you make it tougher now. You wear thick sweaters, ponchos, jackets.......all to protect your tummy. Of course.....she cheats you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sweater, jackets, etc that all have to be washed. She puts them in the wrong cycles. Let's them shrink.

The finger moves to Melissa's bare side where it remains still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She waits until you aren't paying attention, then gets one of her fingers riiiight there. Then......she scratches.

How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Erin responded, shaking her hand, \"what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing Erin's hand, the business woman reached down to the briefcase that sat on the front stoop next to her feet. Picking the case up and popping it open, she removed a newspaper clipping. This clipping was handed to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you recognize the woman in this article?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin glanced down at the article. There was picture of a young hippie woman with a large oak tree rising behind her. The hippie woman looked like she was in her early thirties and was dressed in a pair of bell-bottom jeans, baja hoodie and beret. Her feet were bare and her arms were dangling at her side. On each wrist was a handcuff attached to a chain that was wrapped around the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headline read \"MALL CONSTRUCTION HALTED DUE TO PROTEST.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin recognized the woman. She was Brenna Carmichael, the owner of a small hipster caf\u00e9 downtown. Ever the active in island politics, Brenna was always involved in one matter or another, never afraid to put herself on the front line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know her,\" Erin said after a bit, \"she owns the Avocado Caf\u00e9 in town. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a menace,\" the businesswoman replied, taking the article back, \"I work for the Cosquillas Island Founders Company. We've dedicated ourselves to improving the island to bring more tourists in and have invested a good deal of money in various projects, including the mall construction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\u2026\u2026..what's the issue?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the tree in the picture,\" the businesswoman responded, \"according to this woman it's existed for several hundred years and she refuses to let us cut it down. She's chained herself up to the tree to prevent any workers from coming through. We can't even get her to negotiate with us to see if there's a way to build the mall and allow the tree to remain. And we need her signature on this...\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her briefcase again, she removed a clip board which she handed over to Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the contract signed by all members of the Founders Company agreeing to building of the mall. There are thirteen members, but we only have twelve signatures. Brenna is the thirteenth member of the Founders Company board. Without her signature...\u2026..the construction company won't start. We need unanimous consent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..........what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\u2026.......the tree she's protecting is a quarter mile from here. I've been canvassing the homes nearby to see if anybody knows her and can go down and talk to her. Talk sense to her. Every house I've been to has refused. Yours is the last one. Will you be able to help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought in silence for a few moments. She was still tired from her journey and though she respected Brenna and was friends with her, she did not have any desire to get involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said after a while, \"I don't think she'll listen to me. She's nice but when it comes to stuff like this...\u2026\u2026.she's not open to compromise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businesswoman sighed and took the clipboard back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" she said, returning the clipboard to the suitcase, \"it was a fools errand. Well, I'd hoped to have somebody intervene before my boss and I speak with her tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shot her a suspicious glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my boss and I plan to meet with her tonight. Kind of an ambush meeting. We'd hoped to have someone else talk her down. My boss can be kind of ruthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking her briefcase shut, the businesswoman bid Erin farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway.............enjoy your night ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businesswoman turned and walked back down the driveway. Erin closed the door and stood in silence for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, she decided to............................</span></div></div>",

The populations tickle happy leanings have effected all stages of the park: tickle booths, stockades, tickle coasters, and any other tickle themed fair attractions the eccentric owner Mr. man could think to engineer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year after she started her tradition of going to Cosquillas Erin had made a report on the park with help from Mr. Man and the employees of the park, earning her a temporary backstage pass which she managed to get extended indefinitely, allowing her to get a proper look at the live running of the various contraptions and even participate in ways only the employees normally could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such a great variation of people from all walks of life and all forms of deviation attended, the park took up the atmosphere of a music festival with somewhat more sexual liberty. Everyone knew why they were there and what was intended of them, so many social expectation were laxxed. This required Mr. Man to go against his anarchic ideals and hire a security force to ensure no unwanted harassment happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course such a location was still known for its distinctly sexual atmosphere, and attendees could opt for a pass which indicated interest in the more blatantly sexual themes and optional parts of attractions. However a surprising amount of attendees were more like gawkers at a nudist beach, hardly brave enough to participate in Cosquillas' favorite pass time, let alone involve anything clearly sexual. These people rarely stayed at Cosquillas for more than a single trip, which has lead to the fair being more of a unintentional tourist trap, much to Mr. Man's disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has lead to Erin getting to know both the employees and the regulars, most of whom attend the fair multiple times or even live on the island itself. As such the awkwardness of Mr. Man's decision to have many of his attractions require mandatory exhibitionism somewhat fades away after the third visit or so in much the same way of the exhibitionist meet ups on the mainland which allow a safe feeling exploration of the experience. Of course Erin still felt rather humiliated when she uses one of Mr. Man's machines that arn't labled as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park is built on a long stretch of plains which gently slopes down to the beach. The tents and shacks and rides are tightly packed along wide roads, allowing room to maneuver but also transforming the park into somewhat of a labyrinth from ground level. The attractions are set up in a tiered system, the further from the entrance at the top of the plains or the beach at the bottom the more intense they are. Erin enjoyed those central attractions since she knew everyone who used them, but there were quite a few others on display here and there that she wanted to try out that were new since her last visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll have to visit Mr. Man at some point to get information on an re-examination she's making over the summer, but since his office is in the dead center of the park she can just work her way towards him. In the mean time the large gates and ticket booths stand before her waiting, its time for her to decide on what type of pass she'll get.</span></div></div>",

A mere trickle of attendees headed through this way compared to the moderately busy lines going through the normal lines. The attractions in the center of the park were locked by another gate where you had to present your special pass to get in, there an entirely different atmosphere was present, one much more in line with Mr. Man's original conception of the park and the only place where his mad ingenuity ran truly wild. Erin decided that she was going to head through the normal areas down the hill, stop by the center to check what was new, then head to Mr. Man and decide on her future plans based on what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man behind the counter handed her the pass before glancing back at the computer then to the ID she had handed her, \"Erin huh? Good to see you again, Mr. Man has a note here that says to send you to the clothing station backstage before you head anywhere else\" The man stamped a small key card, slotted it into a lanyard and handed it over to her. He signaled for her to carry on and received the only person in line behind her. Stepping through the turn-still she took a moment to take in the small segmented off area before heading into the site proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe special pass holders entered the park through a secondary gate after the turn still, and before it were the changing rooms on one side and a small booth explaining further details on what special privileges and expectations pass holders were expected to up hold. Erin decided to learn what was new this year with the pass and went to the kiosk first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognized the lady manning the kiosk from last year, a girl named Kim who she had run into in the inner center of the park who had lost all but her underwear in one of Mr. Man's more devious devices and had needed Erin's help to get a towel to use. Kim waved her over and clicked a counter, today seemed to have a little under 5 dozen pass holders come through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erin, Great to see you! Wasn't sure you'd be coming by this year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, I had no clue that you worked here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shook her head, \"I started volunteering to help this winter during the off season, Mr. Man lets me hold the pass for free in exchange for a few hours a week. Anyways, i'm sure you'd love to hear whats going on with the park since you left huh? I've picked up on a few tid-bits not included in any of the leaflets\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, hit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" She pulled out a rolled up paper and unfurled it, <br>\r\n\"New Theme this year, \"Exhibition/Voyeurism\" Attractions to embarrass, tease, and titillate!<br>\r\nOn Site hotel with special pass holder area - More info on site<br>\r\nUnder Ground Arena, See Sam for more info\"<br>\r\n\"A few of those attraction are pretty intense, but you should be able to handle it. They don't have any markings on what they each do, so good luck with that. Mr. Man is at the top floor of the hotel, and said that I should tell you to test out the arena before sending you up to him. I haven't been there yet but apparently its some pretty 'Eyes Wide Shut' level shit, a bit over my head so I haven't headed down there yet, you can find it by a spiral staircase at the center of the inner ring.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyways, Im heading out in a few, so you'll probably see me in there at some point, catch you then!\"<br>\r\nErin responded affirmatively, and...</span></div></div>",
