Closing the door,<br>\r\nher eyes stared through the windshield at the silhouette of the island that was drawing closer by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled contently to herself. Her vacation had officially begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it wasn't quite a vacation. Just a yearly tradition. For the past five years, the intrepid reporter and photographer for the Mason City<br>\r\nTimes newspaper returned to this island from May to August to work remotely. As her reputation had grown and her ability to meet<br>\r\ndeadlines remained intact, she faced less and less blowback from her boss every time this time of the year arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis island was her favorite spot in the entire world. A veritable paradise, where she was free to write and relax at her leisure. And have a<br>\r\nfew laughs along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferry bell began to ring furiously, as the ship reached the dock and was securely tied. Soon the gate fell and the engines of<br>\r\nvarious vehicles roared to life, eager to exit the ship's confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin soon followed suit and brought her vehicle onto the island.

Erin drove into town, ending up at The Caffeinator Laughinator within ten minutes. Upon exiting her car, Erin saw exactly what she had expected to: a girl tied up on a rack with a sign saying, \u2018Tickle Me!\u2019 posted in front of the rack. \u201cPoor girl,\u201d Erin thought to herself. \u201cShe must have not had enough money to pay for her drinks.\u201d As this was one of her favorite places on the island, Erin knew the ins and outs of the coffee shop. Anyone who failed to pay for their coffee would be stripped to bra and panties and put out in the rack or in one of the other restraint devices at the Laughinator to be tickled by the public until the \u2018debt\u2019 had been paid. Having forgot her purse a few times when coming here, Erin knew what the rack was like firsthand. She walked up to the girl, seeing that only her feet and armpits were being tickled right now. Wanting to have some fun, Erin danced her fingers on the girl\u2019s helpless belly for a few minutes before going inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon getting inside, Erin saw a long line, and got in the back. While waiting, she noted the stocks sitting right by the entrance and the other set by the waiting area where the coffee was delivered. A girl was inside each, getting tickled mercilessly by waiting customers. She waited until she got to the front, at which point the barista greeted her, \u201cHello, what would you like today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a venti cappuccino,\u201d Erin ordered, and she soon paid for the drink. She then headed over to the second set of stocks, where a teenage girl was having her feet tickled. Having nothing else to do, Erin began tickling the girl\u2019s armpits mercilessly, causing the girl to scream out in laughter. \u201cTickle, tickle, tickle!\u201d she teased as her fingers tormented the girl\u2019s exposed armpits. A few minutes later, an employee came by to let the girl out, so Erin ceased the tickling, and the girl was let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin expected that they would have someone else in the stocks soon, as there were usually several people who took advantage of the free coffee for tickling agreement, but the employee surprised everyone by announcing, \u201cAt the moment, we have no one else to put in the stocks, so we will be making a special offer. If anyone is willing to volunteer for the stocks, we will give them a gift card for $10 per minute they spend in the stocks, as well as an extra free drink coupon. This agreement will go as long as that person is willing to be locked in or until we have someone else who needs to occupy the stocks to pay off their order. If we get no volunteers, we will be forced to pick someone at random to go into the stocks. They will receive the same compensation for their time, with the exception of the extra free drink coupon. Do we have any volunteers? As always, the person who ends up in the stocks would need to strip down to clothing that exposes tickle spots.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought about the offer for a minute. She was very ticklish, especially on her belly, but she did come here often, and $10 per minute in the stocks could go a long way to her coffee bill, not to mention the free drink. However, she wasn\u2019t quite sure if she could actually take the tickling that she would be signing up for. After careful consideration\u2026\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Having been nervous that her own stomach would have been tickle tortured had she volunteered, Erin was now unrestrained in tickling Kari\u2019s bare belly. The ticklish reporter ended up near the prisoner\u2019s bellybutton, and she used all the techniques others had exploited on her to bring the stocked girl to hysterical laughter. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d was all Kari could scream out as her entire body was tickled. After a few minutes of tickle torturing Kari\u2019s bellybutton, Erin stopped to give someone else a chance and saw that\u2026</span></div></div>",

If you were here a few minutes ago when the stocks got opened up, you heard that there is a chance to earn $10 a minute gift card and a free drink coupon if you volunteer to be locked on the rack. If no one volunteers, we will select a ticklee who will still receive the $10 a minute gift card, but not the free drink coupon, for their time on the rack. Whoever gets in will stay in until they have had enough or until we find someone new to take their place who owes us tickle time. Of course, that person will also need to get into clothing to expose their tickle spots, which we can provide if needed. Do we have any volunteers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had to think about this one harder. The rack was certainly more of a risk, given that her belly would be stretched out and more open for tickling. However, she did still consider the benefits, specifically that $10 a minute gift card and a free drink on top of it. Eventually\u2026</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s good; you\u2019ll earn your $10 a minute. The gift card and coupon will be delivered to you after your time in the rack has ended.

Let\u2019s go.\u201d Erin followed the employee out, and she laid down on the rack when they reached it. Soon enough, Erin found herself being stretched out before her arms and legs were tied up, preventing her from retracting her decision. \u201cEveryone, Erin here is ready to be tickled on the rack. Remember, she is getting $10 for every minute she is on the rack, so let\u2019s try to make her earn it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Kari had, Erin immediately was forced into laughter as a crowd began tickling her all over. In particular, Erin actually was able to feel her bare feet each being treated to one tickler, two hands on each of her armpits, two pairs of hands working over her ribs, each of her knees being squeezed by a hand, and six hands working over her extremely sensitive stomach. \u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Erin was not able to do anything but laugh as she was overwhelmed by all the tickling sensations. Soon enough, the ticklish reporter felt people switching out, and the intensity lessened just a little bit, enough for Erin to potentially say the magic word that could get her out.

The island had many fun restaurants to dine at anyways. With just a basketful of items, she made her way to the self-checkout, scanned her items, tapped her credit card, and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Miss, could you please come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was startled a bit, and turned around; a young employee was standing at the machine she had just used, and politely waving her over. The employee was in her late teens, and had bright red hair tied into two pigtails running down her back. Her complexion was very pale, save for the freckles on her face, and her nametag red \"Brooke\".  Erin walked back to see what was the trouble, a little anxious in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems your card was declined, could you try again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked at the screen, and sure enough, it had a \u201cDeclined\u201d notice. Erin tapped her card again. Nothing. Now a little worried, and noticing Brooke trying to hide a grin, Erin tried inserting her card. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. I just got paid before I left, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am, you do know what happens when you can\u2019t pay for groceries here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I assure you, I HAVE money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was frantic now, and pulled out her phone to check her balance. As she turned it on, however, her recent email notifications showed up on the screen\u2026 including one from her bank. The subject of the e-mail read \u201cOur dearest apologies. All payments delayed due to system maintenance.\u201d Brooke, reading over her shoulder, smiled. Erin was of course shocked as the worker grabbed her by the shoulder and led her to one of the racks; she wouldn\u2019t try to fight it, as she knew the punishment, but was incredibly anxious about the tickling that lie ahead. At this rate, she wouldn\u2019t make it to the hotel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke helped Erin into the rack, spreading her arms above her head and tying her legs together, overall giving her a \u201cY-shape\u201d. With her arms stretched like so, Erin\u2019s shirt popped out of her pants, and came up to barely expose an inch of her stomach. Her ultra-ticklish belly button was still hidden, which Erin hoped would last. She did expect to get tickled on this island, but had hoped it wouldn\u2019t be through incidents as clumsy as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, since it was a card getting declined, and not you trying to steal stuff, I\u2019ll be nice and leave you to the public, rather than have our professionals take care of you. Your total came to $23.94, which rounds to 24 minutes in the rack; I\u2019ll come and get you when you\u2019re finished!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sighed as Brooke walked off. She turned her neck and looked at the three full racks to her left. One was occupied by a girl in her late teens, with dyed hair and a few tattoos and piercings. She was being tickled across her armpits and belly by a group of store workers, hinting to Erin she had been caught stealing. Erin winced as one employee brought an electric toothbrush into the girl\u2019s pierced belly button, using the metal vibrations to send the girl into hysterics. Next over was a woman who looked to be in her late 30s; she had very tanned skin and was dressed like a typical tourist, except her floral shirt had been unbuttoned and a man was scurrying his fingers across her belly. The man was also dressed for vacation, and Erin saw two wallets sticking out of his back pockets; had he taken his wife\u2019s wallet just to get this opportunity? Lastly, there was a young girl, maybe only nine years old. She wasn\u2019t as tied down as the others were, with only her legs trapped, and she was in between an older woman and a store employee. The employee was holding a large feather in one hand, and a bag of candy in the other; it appeared the girl had accidentally taken the bag of candy without paying for it. The tickling was light and gentle, and Erin surmised it was just a way for the girl to learn a lesson, though she winced when the girl\u2019s mother slipped up her shirt a tiny bit and dragged a feather across the girl\u2019s outie belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was too busy watching the others to notice someone come up to her and poke her in the side. She yelped, and looked down to see\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lived in the continental USA, and Erin had bugged her to come out to the Island for a vacation; their surprise appearance here today meant they made it this summer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see you Erin! We finally decided to take a trip to this island; the girls couldn\u2019t wait! We only just arrived; we\u2019re on our way to the Hotel Cosquillas right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but mom won\u2019t let us tickle anyone yet\u201d piped up one of the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, I told you, not until we get to the hotel and drop off our stuff off\u201d, said Jessica, before turning back to Erin. \u201cI guess they just love tickling! They wanted us to all have our belly buttons exposed for tickles, but I told them not until we\u2019re settled in and I\u2019ve figured out how the island all works! I wanted to go to Spain this year, but they convinced me otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe tickled her!\u201d said both twins, excitedly at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin laughed at the thought of the girls tickling their mother. She knew Jackie was very fit, but incredibly sensitive all over, especially on her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cDid you know your mom\u2019s weakness is raspberries in her belly button?\u201d teased Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin\u2019s eyes went wide and they grinned at each other, and a flustered Jackie poked Erin in the side again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t go getting me in trouble! It looks like you\u2019re in trouble enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please don\u2019t tickle me, Jackie! I\u2019m almost finished! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girls, it looks like we might have some fun before we get to our hotel room! Want to help me out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins whispered at each other, grinned, and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now Erin, I know what you\u2019re probably thinking: are you getting off the rack? And the answer to that is a big NO. We won\u2019t even let you go if you say \u2018Apple\u2019 right now.\u201d At that, Erin sort of panicked, but she decided to wait and see what was next. \u201cYou are so ticklish that you\u2019ve qualified for our bonus reward. For the rest of your time here, you\u2019ll get $20 a minute, and for every 10 minutes extra you last, you\u2019ll get another free drink coupon. And if you last long enough, I\u2019m not going to tell you how long, you\u2019ll get your picture up on the wall as the endurance champion here. You\u2019ll be tickled on your most ticklish spot, your tummy, by five of our professional ticklers, and the public will be able to continue tickling you everywhere else. Once they start tickling you, you can say \u2018Apple\u2019 again to stop the tickling. Out of respect for allowing you to get the reward, I will no longer stop the tickling because your coffee is ready. I\u2019ll just make sure it\u2019s still hot when you get done. Are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- I guess so,\u201d Erin responded, and she saw five store employees coming over to her.

Of course, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember that Erin\u2019s earning $20 a minute here, so make it worth it,\u201d the employee proclaimed. \u201cBegin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Erin screamed out as the tickling started all over her body.

Erin snapped out of her trance and immediately realized what was going on.

She watched herself in the mirror fiddling with the material in a vein attempt to make it \u201cfit\u201d. The top was nothing more than a few strings with a couple of tiny triangles that barely covered her perky nipples. The bottom wasn't any better. Thin strips that tied over each hip held what amounted to a strip of floss running down between her shapely cheeks and connecting  in front to a another triangular piece of silk made to cover no more than the bump that was her clit. After trying everything she could to force the material to cover more of her nubile body, especially her smoothly shaven lips, Erin nervously cracked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The employee that had been waiting for her handed her a pair of pink flip flops, \u201cPut these on, we wouldn't want those pretty feet of yours to get dirty.\u201d Erin heard the girls teasing tone and it did nothing to help alleviate her apprehensiveness. She slid the strap between her pedicured toes and stepped out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The young girl led Erin back out and stopped at the rack. </span></div></div>",

Sure enough, the announcement was updated as one of the baristas called to the restaurant goers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, we don\u2019t have any volunteers, which is unfortunate! That means it will be a random draw! We would like to ask all the ladies in the caf\u00e9 to please come up and select a straw from this cup! Now don\u2019t worry, as this isn\u2019t voluntary, there will be plenty of compensation for whoever is chosen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista held out a venti cup with several straws. Nervously, the girls in the caf\u00e9 stood up. They all looked antsy in one way or another; some looked desperate not to be tickled, others like they wouldn\u2019t mind it but didn\u2019t want to be in the spotlight. They all knew, however, that someone had to be in the racks; that was what the caf\u00e9 was known for, and why they were there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin knew this too, and was getting increasingly worried. She didn\u2019t want to be tickled this early into her trip, but a sinking feeling was getting to her. She looked around the caf\u00e9 and saw about a dozen other girls, giving her less than a 10% chance of a random selection.  Not great, but not terrible. Erin stood up and joined the line, taking in the other possible victims. If not her, she\u2019d at least have some fun getting in a few more tickles before she had to be on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a young, but very tall and very fit, woman wearing a sports bra and leggings; she looked like she hadn\u2019t ordered a coffee, but a cool drink after a morning full of exercise. Her brown hair was tied back in a slick ponytail, and Erin took note of her smooth tanned abs. She wore sneakers, though Erin was sure if she landed in the rack they wouldn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin also saw a young metalhead girl, in her late teens by the looks of things. She had bright blue hair with a few black streaks, and had piercings all on her eyebrows, nose, and ears. She wore baggy ripped jeans and a ripped shirt to match, showing off a great portion of her sides. Erin couldn\u2019t quite see the girl\u2019s navel, but did see the tip of a dangly piercing poking out the bottom of the punk\u2019s top. She looked very nervous to be there, Erin thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last girl to pick a straw before Erin was a woman who was practically dragged to the front of the caf\u00e9 by two children, ostensibly her sons. The mother had a short brown bob-cut, and was dressed conservatively: a buttoned up shirt tucked into her jeans under a belt. Her children clearly wanted to see her tickled more than she did, and she reluctantly grabbed a straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, please hold your straw up and blow into it! The one with a feather inside will be our next volunteer for the stocks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin blew into her straw, and to her relief, nothing came out. She was safe! She heard the voices in the caf\u00e9 make noise in anticipation, however, and turned around. One of the girls she had taken note of was holding a straw in one hand, and a feather in the other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the unfortunate victim?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While she would have been happy to sit in the caf\u00e9 and listen to the laughter over her drink, she didn't want to be on the receiving end. It was almost impossible to escape being tickled on Cosquillas Island, but Erin had just arrived; she couldn't be a 'lee just yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her bags and her drink, Erin shuffled out the exit as fast as she could, without making a scene. Speed-walking through the door, she successfully escaped onto the street and the fresh air. She turned her head around to look back, and saw through the window one of the Baristas walking up a woman about her age, near where she had been sitting. \"Thank goodness\", she thought. \"That was close to being me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Erin was too distracted to watch where she was walking in her haste. Without any warning, she collided into another pedestrian; both fell to the ground, with Erin dropping her coffee and her unintended victim carrying their armload as well.

Instead, the girls only very slightly wiggled them, causing only light spits of laughter to escape the mouths of their prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right mom, and Erin, I'll make it clear\" said Catherine in a teasing voice. \"We are the master ticklers in this household. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye...yehehehehssss!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand any attempts to tickle us will only end in your hysterical laughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Hehehe please, take it out!! Hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrating fingers stopped, and the girls withdrew. Erin and Melissa looked at each other as their breathing returned to normal. They both knew it could have gone a lot worse, and they were very lucky. The four girls made their way out to the back pool, and Melissa entered first, keen to escape the clutches of the terrible ticklers. Erin tried to let the others pass in front of her, but a raised eyebrow from Sarah conveyed a clear meaning, and Erin swam into the pool. The evening water felt nice after a hot day, and Erin swam over to Melissa. she turned around just as Sarah and Catherine removed their towels, revealing respective bright blue and bright green bikinis underneath. Erin's eyes were immediately drawn to their belly buttons; both girls had prominent ball-shaped outies, but both were also pierced; Catherine's navel was decorated by a sizeable gold gem inside a standard piercing, while Sarah had a more dangly one with some very sparkly diamonds hanging down from her belly. Melissa must have noticed Erin staring, and swam in front of Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like them? Those are actually rare jewels from Egypt that were shipped to my store! I'm supposed to keep them safe and secret, so I hid them where nobody else could get to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled; the gems were indeed very pretty. The four enjoyed an evening in the pool and some snacks, before all settled onto a beach chair, far enough apart to prevent any unwanted pokes. The moon was rising now, obscuring much of everything beyond the lights of the water and the house. Erin looked over at the younger girls and saw that their belly button jewelry was still shining enough to be very noticeable.</span></div></div>",

She smiled and agreed, and Catherine and Sarah jumped up from the table to head upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled. \"It's their favourite place to eat, and it's only just opened up! You could do some reporting on it! But you will need to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, something fancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The exact opposite. The dress code for women there is short shorts, and a belly-top\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was a little taken aback, until she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a tickling-themed restaurant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had mixed feelings; she felt she'd had enough tickling for the day, but she could never get tired of watching Melissa laugh. Plus, there was Catherine and Sarah, and Erin was eager to get revenge on them. She mulled over her decision, before the two younger girls came down dressed for the occasion; both had loose-fitting crop tops on with jean shorts, and Erin had a great view of their ball-shaped outie belly buttons. The sight of them was all she needed to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin changed into a black tank top, while Melissa got into a tight-fitting white t-shirt. It came down to below her belly button, but still showed an inch of her tummy above her shorts; Erin figured it might be a loophole, but didn't count on it lasting long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunty Melissa, can you drive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Erin. But yes, I'll drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was unsure what the apology was fore, until she got to Melissa's car and sat in the back, only for the two younger girls to sit next to her with devlish grins on their faces. Already buckled in, it was too late to change seats; Melissa looked at her all-but-captive friend in the rear-view mirror, and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't waste your appetite, girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't, mom! Just a light appetizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pinned Erin's arms to her sides, and held their hands above her tummy. Erin braced for tickling, but surprisingly, it never came... at least until the car started, and the vibrations caused their hands to barely scratch her tummy. Erin stifled a giggle, and the car drove off. Sarah and Catherine weren't doing anything outside of holding their hands in front of her, but with every bump in the road, or a sharp turn, their hands grazed over Erin's belly; it was very light tickles all the way to their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought she would pass out, before Melissa began parking. As the girls started unbuckling, Erin gathered her composure; she looked out the window to see...</span></div></div>",

Melissa was Erin's closest friend on the island and always the first person she wanted to see on arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cornwall family had been residents of Cosquillas Island for the past fifteen years by the time Erin took up her summer<br>\r\nresidence. The matriarch of the family, Melissa, was in the final year of her thirties, nearly a decade older than Erin, but<br>\r\nremained one of Erin's closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also the most extraordinary woman Erin had ever met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mother at age 19, Melissa managed to finish a dual undergraduate degree in the areas of Art History and Art Restoration from<br>\r\nCambridge University in her native England. Eager to distance herself from the father of her daughter, Melissa had taken a <br>\r\nposition at the Cosquillas Island Museum where she worked as a curator. Even with that full time job and supporting her then<br>\r\ninfant daughter, Melissa took evening courses online and completed an MBA, while also investing her money in the stock market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith several successful investments and a business education, Melissa broke from the museum and began her own business<br>\r\non the island: Cornwall Restoration and Antiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning as a shop that restored antique furniture and artwork, the business soon grew into the primary collector of rare<br>\r\nartwork and antiques on Cosquillas Island. With rising profits from the business and continued wise investing, the single<br>\r\nmother soon gathered a sizeable fortune, with which she purchased the sensible cottage that sat across from Erin's and<br>\r\nfunded her daughter's education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin first met the intrepid Englishwoman at a local yoga class, where they bonded over their mutual love of art and became<br>\r\ninseparable friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin thought about all this as her car wound around the windy streets of the island town, before it drew upon driveway the old building that housed Cornwall Restoration and Antiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the rest of the town buildings, the Cornwall Restoration shop sat in an isolated part of town. It was located on a small hill on the outskirts and was accessible by taking the long driveway. The journey was bit of an annoyance, but once you reached the summit of the hill and stood in front of the shop, you could see why the location was used. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top of the hill offered a gorgeous panoramic view of the town and coastline. So scenic was this view, that Melissa had put several picnic tables and lawn chairs along the hillside, where visitors could sit and enjoy their lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pulled up the long driveway and reached the entrance to the shop, just as it was turning 5:00 p.m. The parking lot was vacant, save for Melissa's car, but the Open sign still hung in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin exited the car and made her way to the front entrance. As she pushed the door open she saw......\u2026............</span></div></div>",

The people inside had no idea she was out there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks goodness for that,\" Erin thought as she began to creep around the building, \"Melissa needs my help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrotting around the back of the building, Erin found the back entrance slightly ajar. Ever so carefully, she slid through the back door and tiptoed her way to the front of the store. Keeping along the walls, the front desk finally came into view and Erin was able to see and hear with greater clarity the scene that she had nearly walked in on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the desk was a tall woman dressed in a well pressed business suit and high heels. A domino mask covered her eyes and most of her forehead. Her thick blonde hair was pulled back tight behind her head. In one of her gloved hands was a pistol that was aimed at the frightened British woman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's back was to Erin, but her arms were raised high over her head. It looked like an old stick up scene from a cowboy western. The masked robber began to speak, a thick Eastern European accent coating her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Cornvall, I don't vish to be here much longer. Tell me vhere the amulet is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what you're talking about,\" Melissa nervously replied, \"I don't have anything like that here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. I've traced it from Turkey to the Ukraine to America and now to this island. This is the only such place on this rock that could possibly have it. I've spent years vorking to acquire it. And I will do vhatever it takes to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the masked woman began to back away from the desk. She still faced Melissa as she did so and kept her pistol leveled at the young British woman. Once she reached the front door, the masked woman took her free hand and slid the front door lock into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gulped at the sound of the lock hitting home. No escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the masked woman then slid over to the store sign that still read OPEN and switched it to CLOSED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so ve vill not be disturbed Ms. Cornvall. Like I said....I am not leaving until I have vhat I vant. And I have vays to get it from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motioned to the wall next to the front desk with her pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out from behind the desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa lowered her arms and obediently slid out from behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman raised her pistol again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring your arms back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's arms went back up again. The British woman was dressed casually for the day, with blue jeans and sandals. She was dressed in a white collared shirt with a pink sweater over it. The pink sweater was a bit small for her though, as it gripped th3 bottom of the white collared shirt when her arms were raised and pulled it up to her ribs, revealing her pale belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around, Ms. Cornvall. Keep your hands raised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frisk you darling. Do not make a sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin could see Melissa's face for the first time when she turned around. The British woman was keeping calm given the circumstances, but Erin could see fear in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman moved behind Melissa and squatted down to begin her search.

What could she possibly find funny about...\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frisking was tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shifted in her hiding place to get a closer look. The masked woman was squatting down and meticulously tapping Melissa's legs with the tips of her fingers. She slowly moved up from her calf to her thigh on her right leg and down from the thigh on her left leg to her left calf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's body began to tense from the touch. She was arguably the most ticklish person Erin knew on the island and Erin couldn't imagine how badly this was affecting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman then rose and moved her hands to Melissa's hips. The British woman's cheeks began to turn red a bit, as she did everything in her power to hold her laughter back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the masked woman's finger moved to Melissa's exposed bare sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's eyes grew wide as the tips of the fingers touched on her bare skin. Erin knew this would be the worst of it. Melissa's torso was her biggest weakness. The ribs, sides, tummy, waist, bellybutton. Tickling any of these areas would drive Melissa absolutely insane with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe British woman began to sway a little from side to side, as the masked woman dragged her fingers up and down Melissa's bare sides. The robber couldn't see Melissa's expression, but there was no denying the reaction she was getting from touching these sensitive areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the robber stopped her search and took a step back. Melissa breathed a sigh of relief, though it was clear that it took a Herculean effort for her not to crack up in hysterical laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Ms. Cornvall. You have nothing on you. I vill give you one final chance to give me the amulet. Or information leading me to it. If you do not...\u2026......I think I know how I vill get it from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa closed her eyes and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very vell then.

Too afraid of the pistol to lower them, Melissa shut her eyes tight as she felt the delicate tip of the feather begin to move teasingly up and down her stomach. She bit her lip to suppress any laughter, but her growing grin began to allow snickers to escape, betraying how badly the dancing feather was tickling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin winced as she watched this unfold. She knew her friend wouldn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman didn't seem to think so either. She began to use the feather to dust Melissa's ribs and brush her abs. The masked woman could see her bare belly twitch with each touch of the feather and see her body tighten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vere you lying to be about how teeklish you are, Ms. Cornvall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....hehehehe\u2026.wasn't hehehehehehehehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suuuuuure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh yes I'm not that ticklisheheheheheheheheh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm I' not so sure. Let's try something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman put the feather away and used her free hand to wiggle her fingers gently along the exposed belly. Melissa could not longer hold in her laughter. She began to giggle frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhehehehehehhohohohohoo oh no no hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha! So you ARE ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahahahahahaha yes yes I lied hahahahahahahahahahahhaah I'm really ticklish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman then began to scratch Melissa's ribs as she continued to tickle torture the poor British girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so.

Melissa panted as the tickling stopped. Her arms were still raised above her head, but were now beginning to grow tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Ms. Cornvall. You saw how bad this vill get! Tell me about the amulet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I really don't. I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked woman sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ve need more privacy for this to continue.

No more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave me no choice. Lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms still raised, Melissa began to move slowly towards the back of the store, right in Erin's direction. Erin crouched lower in her hiding spot, desperately hoping to maintain her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin heard the two sets of footsteps approaching, her mind began to race about what she could do.

GAHAHAHAHAHAHAD NOHOHOHHAHAHAHAHA!\" Erin squirmed as much as she could but she seemed to be even more secure than before, leaving her little room to move. Her laughter increased even more and Erin again began to feel helpless once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By now vou vould be 5 times as teeklish, now bevore you give out, vhere is vhe amulet?\" the robber asked one final time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin could barley reply, she was laughing too much to even breathe let alone reply because of how ticklish she had now become. <br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I DOHOHOHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I DOHOHOHAHAHAHA BWAHAHAHAHAHA! PLEASE HAHAHAHAHA HA! I DON'T KNOW HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! STAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHA! I GIHIHIHIVE! SOMEBODY HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! MELISSA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had finally broken, she couldn't handle being tickled anymore, it was too intense. All she could do now is plead and beg, only to fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa couldn't help but feel guilty for what's happening to her friend, but she herself was just as helpless to do anything. As Erin begged and laughed... </span></div></div>",

Surrounding her were shelves and aisles filled with everything from old paintings, to furniture and all sorts of knick knacks collected from all corners of the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell on top of the front door rang shrilly as Erin entered. However, Melissa did not turn around. She continued with her business behind the desk with her back to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa?\" Erin called curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. Her back remained to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward towards the desk, a new sound reached Erin's ears that explained Melissa's obliviousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the faint sound of heavy metal music. Well it sounded faint to Erin. In Melissa's wireless headphones the sound of the bass guitar was probably deafening. Melissa's curly, chestnut brown hair, which hung gracefully across her back, was shielding these headphone from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled and shook her head. Had she more evil intentions, she probably could've run off with anything in the store and Melissa would not be any the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was dressed very comfortably for the summer day. She wore faded jeans and sandals, with a white collared shirt that was untucked. On top of the collared shirt was a pink sweater that appeared to be too small for Melissa, for every few seconds Melissa would drop what she was doing and pull down on the bottom of the sweater until it went past her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin began to stealthily tiptoe towards the desk, hoping Melissa would keep her back to her long enough to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she got within arm's reach of the desk, Melissa let out a long, loud yawn that echoed through the empty shop. Erin had to hold back her laughter. Clearly the loud noise of the headphones made her forget just how loud she sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, keeping her back to Erin still, Melissa raised both arms straight up into the air and high over her head, in a long and relaxing stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, the sweater that had been forcibly pulled down and stretched, got its revenge. As her arms raised, the sweater gripped the bottom of the untucked collared shirt and pulled it higher and higher up Melissa's belly. When the sweater and shirt stopped, they left the ivory white skin of her torso bare from her waist, past her bellybutton and up to the bottom of her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devilish idea soon gripped Erin's mind as she decided to take her final steps closer. Slowly moving her hands towards the oblivious Melissa, Erin decided to.........................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In spite of her excellent physical fitness, she had a slight muffin top to her belly, which always made her nervous to wear midriff bearing clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that's what she said to Erin. Erin never believed that explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Melissa failed to mention is that her stomach coincidentally was the most ticklish area on her body. Ribs, sides, love handles, tummy, bellybutton and waist. The slightest touch from a feather or finger to any of those spots would send the British girl into cackling hysterical laughter. THAT was why Melissa always hid behind the muffin top excuse. She refused to admit that having her belly tickled was her biggest weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin never understood why. She'd spent countless hours at the Cornwall house with Melissa, her daughter Catherine and her niece Sarah. Tickling Melissa's belly was Catherine and Sarah's favorite sport. Erin could recall watching arguments between Catherine and Melissa end with Sarah getting Melissa in a full nelson wrestling hold and Catherine tickling her mother's torso until she turned red in the face. Even on quiet beach trips, Sarah or Catherine would take turns sneaking up behind Melissa while she and Erin talked. Once they got close enough, they would reach around and lobster claw her bikini clad belly and furiously scratch her ribs until Melissa laughed so hard she fell to the sand. Even then her attacker would continue to tickle her tummy until she surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy Melissa would lie to Erin of all people made no sense. With the exception of her toes, Melissa's tummy was her most ticklish spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why now Erin reached forward and began to gently and deftly wiggle her fingers along Melissa's stretched soft sides. Immediately the outstretched arms came down and wrapped themselves around the front of her stomach in a vain attempt to protect her ticklish flesh. Unfortunately for Melissa, Erin maneuvered her fingers snugly beneath Melissa's arms so that she could still continue her tickling assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa howled with laughter and swayed side to side trying to escape the tickling fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAH WHO IS THAT HAHHEHEHHEHEHEHEHEHHEHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHSTOP TICKLING ME HAHAHAHAHAHHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin kept her hands frantically wiggling over every exposed spot of white skin she could see. Her hands moved so quickly that Melissa couldn't keep up. Every time she would block a spot, Erin's hand would find a new unprotected area of her belly to tickle. Laughter filled the empty store and Melissa fell to the floor with a ticklish thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHEHHEHAHAHEHEHEHHAHHEHEHHEH NO NO NO STOP AHEHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled and continued to tickle her friend as she rolled on the ground in hysterical laughter. Then Erin decided to............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could've taken anything I wanted without you knowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa rubbed her eyes in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I've been so out of it today. I didn't sleep a wink last night. I'm amazed I even got through today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....yeah. Just...\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catherine and Sarah are traveling to Europe for a week. They'll be staying with my parents in Surrey for a few days and then go to the continent from there. This is the first time they're traveling on their own, so naturally I've been up half the night worrying about.....well everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When'd they leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two nights ago. I was up late waiting for Catherine to text me to check in. She did....but I still worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're getting older Melissa. They want to see the world. You gotta get use to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed again. This one was more deeper and resigned than the last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. And I know they can handle themselves. I just miss them. It's lonely here without them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of you though, Melissa. I didn't think you'd let them travel that far on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was against the idea at first. I warmed up to the idea of them going to my parents place quickly. The traveling on the continent alone part was out of the question. That was a lot harder to accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd they convince you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa suppressed a smile. Her cheeks turned a little red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They ended up being very...\u2026...\u2026..persuasive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Persuasive? How...\u2026\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stopped herself. It suddenly hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tickled it out of you didn't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's smile grew wider. She refused to look at Erin, but her cheeks turned a brighter red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've guessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little imps. I fell asleep on the sofa. Catherine wrapped a sheet around my legs and Sarah tickled my toes. I couldn't stop laughing and they said they'd stop if I agreed to let them travel on the continent. It didn't take long, but I agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're getting good at doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too good. I still miss them though. But it's good you've come for your vacation. It'll be nice to have some company while they're away. How long are you staying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two weeks. Maybe a little more. I came by to see if you were free for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I just need to put a few things and lock up if you wouldn't mind waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's...\u2026............\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise suddenly cut Erin's sentence short and grabbed the attention of both women.

His thick black hair was neatly arranged on his head. He sported pressed slacks, polished shoes and a crisp collared shirt. From the looks of it, he was in his late thirties or early forties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell on both women and a friendly smile crossed his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening mes cheres,\" he said, a thick French accent coloring his speech, \"I hope that I am not too late before closing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked the man over. There was something familiar about him. She had seen his face before, but could not remember where. It certainly had not been on the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa was the first of them to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Francois. Though you have just one second to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man moved forward and extended his hand to Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have good timing then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Melissa's hand in his and with a chivalric gesture pressed his lips to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again Melissa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa smiled pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You as well Francois.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Frenchman released her hand and turned to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a friend of yours, Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. This is my friend Erin, she's a newspaper reporter on the mainland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancois extended his hand to Erin and repeated the same chivalric gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you Erin. I am Count Francois Valois. At your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name brought the memory back. Erin now knew where she'd seen him before. Count Valois was a world renowned philanthropist, responsible for the excavation and preservation of numerous historical artifacts. He was also known as an avid adventurer. The papers had dubbed him the modern day Sir Richard Burton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure's mine,\" Erin replied. \"How do you know Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count started to reply, but Melissa quickly cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count Valois has brought several pieces to me for restoration. He's one of my best customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's cheeks turned red as she spoke. Erin could sense there was more to this than she let on. She'd have to press for more information later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yes,\" the Count replied, his tone a bit crushed by Melissa's response, \"I own a small estate on the island. Melissa has been good enough to help me with its interior design and restoring several pieces that hang there. She does remarkable work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only too happy to help,\" Melissa said, \"Is that why you've come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cherie. I actually have a small favor to ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa's eyes narrowed at the young nobleman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing dangerous I can assure you,\" the Count said smiling, \"There is an important package due to arrive on the island from Nepal. It's contents are very valuable and delicate. I am having it sent here and was wondering if you would be kind enough to ensure that the contents are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a delicate item. It requires delicate hands to care for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rare artifact. The Nepalese call it 'The Golden Fist.' It's been lost for centuries. An old acquaintance of mine discovered it and charged me with its safe keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you plan to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it to experts to be verified. Then turn it over for further study. Will you do me this favor, Melissa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took a moment to think it over. It seemed like a harmless enough task. Still............something seemed off, though Melissa could not say why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, whatever would get the man out of her place of business the fastest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'll look after it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. I knew I could rely on you cherie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is it due to arrive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count checked his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8 o'clock this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8 o'clock? The mail service doesn't run that late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private plane cherie. I have instructed them to take it right here after they land. I know this is an inconvenience, so I am happy to pay you for this service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed. She had hoped to head home at normal time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I'd be happy to wait here with you until it arrives to provide company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have Erin here with me. Thank you for the offer though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Count's shoulders dropped defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course cherie. Um.....all you need do is call once the package has arrived and you've inspected it. I will send my secretary, Ms. Valenka, to retrieve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be done then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" the Count replied meekly, \"thank you again cherie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defeated nobleman turned and made his way to the door. He stopped in the doorway and turned to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you as always Melissa. Erin it was a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closed behind him with a soft thud. Melissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to volunteer you Erin. If I hadn't he'd have stayed and I'd have to sit around here in awkward silence for the next three hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you know Count Valois! Why didn't you tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a big name dropper. Besides, I barely know the man. He's a customer. Nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin eyed Melissa suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed and rubbed her eyes in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it right now.

Even though the ceiling was not that high, a small ladder was required to gain access.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat ladder was now lying flat on the ground along with Melissa's sandals.

It was too good of an opportunity to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one problem. Her hands couldn't quite reach up to Melissa's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she spotted something in the corner of the storage room that provided a perfect solution. Leaning against the corner of the room was an old Egyptian style fan. It was a tall golden pole with a single feather attached to the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect for the height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin!\" Melissa called again, \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin casually strolled over to the fan and took it in both hands. She then positioned herself to the side of her trapped friend, just far enough that Melissa's flailing legs couldn't reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Melissa...\u2026\u2026..before I put the ladder back up, why don't you tell me about the Count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

We're all alone with plenty of time. Did something happen between you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it now.

No. NO TICKLING. I've had enough for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you one last chanceeeeee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin I swear to God! If you try and tickle me, I'll kick you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You asked for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa began to flail her legs furiously, hoping to connect with something. Unfortunately, she had no idea what was below her, so it was all in vain. After a few fruitless minutes, she let her legs hang exhausted and helplessly below her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Erin decided to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly raised the feather tipped part of the fan close to the pale white belly that lay helplessly before her. She let it touch gently down on Melissa's lovehandles. Then slowly she let it trace down Melissa's sides, up and down, causing her tummy to twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is thahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahaahhat?! Hahahahahahahhahahah oh no hahahahahahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin then changed directions, bringing the tip of the feather across the front of her belly and down the opposite side. Then she brought it along Melissa's sensitive waist, causing the trapped British woman to begin kicking her legs again to get the object away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehaheheheheheeheh oh God stop ahahhahahhhahhhheheheheh that tickles so bad! Hahahahahaahahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Erin kept the feather one step head of the flailing feet and continued to gently glide the feather all along Melissa's ivory white skin. She danced it gently along Melissa's abs and used it to dust between her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa kept flailing helplessly as she struggled to avoid getting tickled, but the feather tormenting her belly was sending her into hysterical fits of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahahaahahahahaha oh no no hahahahahaah not my ribs!

This was by the far the worst scenario for Melissa. Her daughter, Catherine, and niece, Sarah, referred to this as her \"Tickle Button.\" One poke in that area and Melissa would be on the ground in an instant in hysterics. It was so bad in fact, that often times they didn't even need to make contact. Erin could recall one time she had walked in on Catherine and Sarah wrestling with Melissa, when Catherine successfully pinned Melissa's arms above her head. Sarah then straddled Melissa's legs and gently lifted her t-shirt up to her ribs. Sarah teasingly wiggled her finger and Melissa and slowly began to let it drop toward her bellybutton. Before it even touched her stomach, Melissa was writhing with laughter. She was nearly in tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why when the feather entered her bellybutton, Erin was not surprised by the hysterical reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHHHAHHHHAHHAHHAHAHAA NOT THERE ANYWHERE BUT THERE HAHHAHAHAHHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHHAHH YES YES AHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHHAHAHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to tell me everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH WELL I DONT...\u2026.HOHAHAHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHHE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin began to twirl the fan and wiggle the feather deeper and deeper into her bellybutton.

Erin stood behind her with arms out, worried that in her weakened state she would collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the minute her feet touched the ground, Melissa slumped against Erin. Erin sat down on the floor, with Melissa sitting next to her. Melissa's head was on her shoulder.

No. I didn't think the Count wanted....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct,\" Ingrid interrupted, \"The contents are very fragile and of the utmost importance to his grace. He would prefer that the contents not be disturbed before he has a chance to look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Melissa replied, slightly off put by the businesslike tone. \"It's yours to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid strode forward and removed the box from the counter. She moved to the front door and gently pushed it open, calling out in German to someone outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man dressed in a limo driver uniform came quickly to the door and relieved Ingrid of her burden. Once the package was removed, she turned back to the two ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Count is grateful for your help. Has he warned you about the contents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that the item is of great value.\" Melissa answered, \"Nothing more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid looked over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone else been by to inquire about the package today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The only one who talked about it was the Count. He's only been gone an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has he told you about...\u2026.other interested parties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not aware there were any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to the Count about this several times. He never listens to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Erin inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The package,\" Ingrid began, \"is one of the rarest items in the world. It's been the Count's obsession for years. He sank a great deal of money into tracking it down and ensuring its safe arrival here. Until now, his success in locating it has only been made known to myself and the Count. No others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there were several other parties who have spent even longer than the Count looking for it. The fewer people who know, the easier it is to conceal its location. When the Count suggested using your shop as a drop off point, I told him to explain to you the danger you would now be in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Melissa exchanged nervous glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danger?\" Melissa repeated, \"What kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people who seek this item are not of the most reputable kind. Several of them are linked to organized crime. But one group in particular has been more...\u2026.........troublesome than the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid's voice now sounded graver than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Cocegas Crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three women. From the jungles of the Amazon. They're of immense physical strength and cunning. To them, the item is nearly a God. We've had several encounters with them and they've proven quite formidable. Luckily, the Count was able to outmaneuver them and get the item here. To our knowledge they do not have any idea that the item's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However...\u2026...we must take precautions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of precautions?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid reached into her jacker pocket and removed a small cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this. It's number is not traceable. It connects directly to me. No one else. Should you find yourself or your friend see anything suspicious: being followed by a strange car, anything. Call this number. I will be able to ensure your safety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the police?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They cannot help you. Not against those women. The Count and I know them very well. We are your best defense. Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Erin looked at each other nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Melissa said finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Ingrid replied, \"and DO NOT mention this package to anyone. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it. The more the word spreads the more the Cocegas Crew can find us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both swear.\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I will take my leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the strange German woman disappeared. Once her car vanished from sight, Erin looked at Melissa with great concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she's serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But in any case.........it may not be a bad idea for us to keep together tonight. At least until I can talk to the Count more in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\" Erin agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Let's head back home. Grab a change of clothes.

C'mon in. Make yourself at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa led Erin to the living room, which was already prepared for her arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pizzas were on the coffee table, along with two bottles of wine and glasses. The large leather sofa was arranged with sheets and a small blanket for Erin to sleep on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa as well was already in relaxation mode for the evening. She was barefoot and dressed in flannel pajama pants and a black, long sleeved crop top sweatshirt, which left her torso from her bellybutton to her bottom ribs exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to bed already are you?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. I always change into this the minute I get home from work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gestured to the food and wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat. I haven't had anything since noon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls ate heartily from the pizza boxes and each had a few glasses of wine, which instantly relaxed them both. The secretary's story had shaken them up a bit, so both were eager to forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they'd eaten and began their catch up conversation, one question was still lingering in Erin's mind from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa.

Seriously? I saw you six month ago! How did this not come up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgotten? C'mon now. We've been friends for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I just......didn't want to make a big deal out of it. He's followed by people everywhere he goes. I was amazed we were able to keep it secret as long as we did. I didn't know how it would turn out, so I figured I'd keep it to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.....what happened? He dump you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dumped him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nearly spit out her wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You DUMPED Count Valois? Why would you do that? He's one of the richest men alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just wasn't working. He and I had totally different visions of what the relationship was supposed to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed and drank more from her wine glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at first things were great. I'd close the shop at five and then we'd go off somewhere. Fly to the mainland. Have dinner at some upscale place in a private room. He lived his life and I lived mine. Our free time was spent with each other. Always something new. Exciting to say the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He......kept talking about our future. Saying he'd take care of Catherine and me. Take us with him on his travels. See the world with him. Tell me I'd never have to work another day in the shop as long as I lived. Told me I could sell it...and this house and come live with him. Never want for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stared at her friend in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Catherine was born......I had nothing. If my parents didn't live nearby there was a good chance we'd of both been homeless. It took me YEARS......to get on my feet. To get to this island. Get the shop open. Buy this house. Make the fortune I've made.....and get my independence from that past. That shop is a part of me. Just like this house is. They're what I've achieved on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that got to do with the Count?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It felt like he was trying to take over. Push me over to the passenger seat of my own life and take it from there. I don't NEED someone to take care of us. I've been able to do that on my own. If I settle down with someone, I want them to be a part of my life, not take control of it. It was a little insulting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't mean to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know he didn't, but a man like that is use to being in control of things like that. I couldn't get him to understand that I didn't want someone taking care of me. I wanted to it to be a partnership. Each of us have our own lives and then combine them. Not me dropping everything in my life to be a part of his. It was a nice gesture but...\u2026..I wouldn't feel like I was living my own life that way. Just living his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took another drink from her glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt horrible. I could tell I crushed him. But...\u2026.I had to be honest. He seemed to respect that, but it's always tough seeing him now. I feel like he's not use to being pushed away like that. It's like.....he keeps trying to win me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it could be worse..........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. Worse things than having a billionaire chasing you...\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa popped open the next bottle of wine and was about to pour more into her glass when she was interrupted by a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...........................<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We sent a squad car up there and it looks like one of the windows was broken,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa eyes narrowed curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broken window?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I've got a security system that should've gone off if one of the windows broke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing ma'am. No alarm. Someone managed to get around the system. We need you to come down and help us figure out how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. How much was taken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure ma'am. We need help with that as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes officer. I'll be down immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa hung up and quickly strode back through the living room. Brushing past Erin, she went over to a small closet door, where she removed a pair of hiking boots which she put over her bare feet. She removed a coat as well which she through over her crop top sweater and bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin watched her with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cops called. Someone broke a window at the shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin rose immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!

Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\u2026......something doesn't feel right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cop said the alarm didn't go off. Someone got around the alarm. They don't know how. Remember what the German woman said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reporting anything strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bought the most up to date system for that store. If a window broke I'd know about it. The security system connects directly to my phone. Nothing was triggered until the cop called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think...\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But in case I'm right......I want you to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa went back into the kitchen and came back with the cell phone Ingrid had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to take this. If I see anything suspicious when I get to the store, I'll text your cell phone. If I do that, call the Count's secretary on that phone and let her know about the break in. Tell her Officer Charlene Flanders was the one who reported it. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded. She hugged her friend tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope nothing's missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Melissa exited. Erin moved to the front window and watched Melissa's car disappear down the driveway and into the dark, clear evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnerved by the call, Erin frantically grabbed her cell phone and laid it on the coffee table. She then sat on the sofa and held the Count's cell phone tightly in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes, Erin's eyes started to grow heavy. She gently laid her head on the arm of the couch and began to gently drift off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to fall asleep completely she heard...\u2026\u2026........</span></div></div>",

Her jacket and hiking boots were thrown on the floor. Her hands were folded in front of her, tied at the wrist with rope. That rope around her wrist then ran above Melissa's head and was thrown over one of the rafters in the ceiling. A muscular woman was holding the other end a few feet away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa feet were bare and rope was wrapped around her ankles and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular woman in front of her began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Cornwall.

This one plans to be stubborn. Let's fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tug, the muscular woman pulled the rope across the rafter, causing the rope holding Melissa's wrists together to rise up. The British woman's arms were raised high above her head and even pulled the short woman nearly a foot off the ground. Melissa's crop top now left her entire rib cage, sides, belly and bellybutton entirely exposed. Her bare feet and toes were now dangling helplessly above the cold floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" the muscular woman mused, \"let's begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular woman grinned devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Cocegae Crew does best.

While she stood up, Erin took a closer look at the panicked Crossfitter. The muscular blonde woman was close to six feet tall, with well defined arms and legs. Her hair was tied back tight in a ponytail and she wore white running shoes and socks. She also sported white spandex running shorts and a sleeveless cotton t-shirt that read \"Gansdor CrossFit.\" The t-shirt was cut right at her ribs, showing off Katrina's six-pack abs and toned obliques. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed amusing to Erin that such a powerfully build woman was spooked by anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that old woman gone?\" Katrina asked, as she crouched back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Melissa answered, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina let out a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd never get rid of her.

Why are they looking for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina hesitated before she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I tickled the mayor's wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me,\" Katrina sheepishly replied, \"She took one of my yoga classes. I didn't think she gave enough effort, so I asked her to stay after class and tickled her as punishment. I didn't know that's who her husband was. Next thing I knew, I started getting anonymous letters from the town vigilante group, saying I needed to appear before them for punishment by today. I panicked and went into hiding. That's when that old woman started moving around town asking people about me. I thought when I hid up here, she'd never find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you come here?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shop's out of view. People can't see me up here......at least for now. That's why I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa glanced over at Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide me at your house. You've got a isolated place on the hill. Just 'til this blows over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!

I just need a place to lie low. Just until I can get a way off the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa looked over at Erin again. Katrina's face was filled with absolute terror. Whatever the group had planned for her was enough to have resorting to begging. Perhaps that mental anguish was enough punishment for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa took a moment to think it over before giving her reply.</span></div></div>",

She was tied to a thick oak tree. Her arms were stretched high above her head, leaving her bare underarms vulnerable and causing her sleeveless crop top to rise just below her sports bra and leaving her muscular torso exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Crossfitter's feet were a good foot off the ground, giving easy access to her bare feet. Ropes were wound round the tress and tightly over her ankles, shins, wrists and forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina was trapped and at the mercy of these tree mysterious figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them now stepped forward and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katrina. You will now face punishment for your crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatrina gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure did not reply. Instead, the figure glided slowly and noiselessly forward, close to the tied up CrossFit woman. Leaning close to Katrina, the figure whispered something in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the figure moved back, Katrina began to shake her head in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No. Not that. Please not that. I won't be able to stand it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure snapped its fingers as it began to take a few steps back. At the sound, the other two cloaked minions reached into the folds of their robes and removed to large feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and silently they moved towards the trapped muscular woman and began to..................</span></div></div>",

The young British woman was dressed in a pair of dark flannel pajamas, her arms flailing in every direction and her upperbody twisting and turning in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly seated on Melissa's shins, was Marie, a well dressed and dark haired Parisian woman. The French woman had an amused look on her face as she friend was in absolute hysterics. She sat with her chin on one hand, while her other well manicured free hand was gently and delicately tickling and teasing the pale bare feet of Melissa that stuck out from the bottom of her pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my cherie,\" Marie bemused, \"you're even more ticklish than I remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA YES YES HAHAHAHAHAHHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you should've known better than to lie to me. Oh well, I will get you to admit the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Marie's free hand gently traced its nails up and down Melissa's bare arches. She made sure to make just enough contact with the skin for Melissa to feel them, but light enough that they sent severe tingling sensations throughout her skin. As the French woman's weight was solidly on her shins and ankles, all Melissa could do was move her feet from side to side, but it was a futile gesture. Marie's fingers torturously tickled her sensitive soles, leaving the British woman weak with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH I GIVE UP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would,\" Marie mused, slowly moving her fingers up the soles and towards her toes, \"however, I will need to get a truthful answer to my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe French woman's fingers now reached the base of Melissa's toes. The nails snuck their way into the sensitive spots beneath them and dug in. Melissa's laughter kicked up another octave, as her arms and upperbody flailed even harder on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again: did you miss me, cherie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YES YES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did!\" Marie laughed, \"So you lied before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA YES YES I LIED HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insulting!\" teased Marie, \"Will you make it up to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH YES YES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ANYTHING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" Marie's eyes lit up, \"Really? ANYTHING I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH YES ANYTHING HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm okay cherie,\" Marie said, digging furiously into her toes, \"We will do a tickle game then. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAH YES YES OK OK HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA I'LL DO IT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the tickling stopped altogether. Melissa lay in a panting heap on the floor, Marie still seated firmly on her shins and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you too, cherie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you did,\" Melissa panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie reached into her pocket and pulled out a large coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember this coin cherie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa sat up on her elbows. Her eyes went wide at the sight of the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. No. Not this game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie smiled deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Remember,\" she said gently tracing Melissa's feet and toes again, \"ANYTHING I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa began to snicker and giggle at the tickly touches. She knew what would happen if she refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehe ok ok hehehehehehehehehehehhehehehe I remember. Anything heheheheheheheh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now as you remember, I will flip this. Heads is your lower body. Tails your upperbody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie flicked the coin high into the air. Melissa propped herself up on her elbows to see the verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin it the ground with a soft thud.

Raise your arms over your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa started to protest, but saw Marie wiggle her fingers furiously down towards her feet and swallowed her protest. Laying back on the ground, Melissa raised both arms straight above her head. Her flannel pajama top rose about a centimeter above her bellybutton, leaving a good amount of her pale belly exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to please Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa started to put her arms back down, but Marie stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Marie cried, \"Put them back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa obeyed instantly. Marie shifted her position on Melissa's legs, so that she was now straddling her thighs and facing the British woman's bare belly. She moved both hands menacingly over the pale skin of Melissa's exposed tummy, keeping her fingers an inch above the skin. Melissa kept her arms obediently upwards. She was too scared to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, cherie,\" Marie began, \"I am going to get off your legs. You are to scoot back to the staircase and bring your back against the wall. If you try to escape...........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's fingers began to wiggle. Slowly and torturously, though they did not move from their place one inch above Melissa's tummy.

This was Erin's favorite part of Melissa's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden deck had been completely renovated by the young British woman. A roof had been added over it and rather than screens encasing the side, it was surrounded by large glass windows. With a window in the center of the roof, the entire porch acted as a greenhouse and was filled around the perimeter with a variety of flowers and herbs that Melissa and her daughter grew themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin moved to the porch entrance and tried to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights on the back porch were turned on full blast, so Erin could see inside the whole porch. In the center of the room, was a sofa flanked on each side by an armchair. They were arranged in a semicircle with side tables on the ends. This was where Melissa would have guests after dinner to relax and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Erin saw someone come onto the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Melissa. She stopped in the middle of the semicircle of furniture and bent over to catch her breath. The young British woman was dressed in a pair of long sleeve dark flannel pajamas and her hair was messily strewn about her head. She was panting heavily, like she'd just completed a marathon, but instead of a look of anguish, a broad smile was sported across her face and she was giggling uncontrollably between pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was about to knock on the porch door to get her attention when another figure appeared in the porch entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis must be her friend Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe French woman had a devious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-HA CHERIE!

The populations tickle happy leanings have effected all stages of the park: tickle booths, stockades, tickle coasters, and any other tickle themed fair attractions the eccentric owner Mr. man could think to engineer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year after she started her tradition of going to Cosquillas Erin had made a report on the park with help from Mr. Man and the employees of the park, earning her a temporary backstage pass which she managed to get extended indefinitely, allowing her to get a proper look at the live running of the various contraptions and even participate in ways only the employees normally could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such a great variation of people from all walks of life and all forms of deviation attended, the park took up the atmosphere of a music festival with somewhat more sexual liberty. Everyone knew why they were there and what was intended of them, so many social expectation were laxxed. This required Mr. Man to go against his anarchic ideals and hire a security force to ensure no unwanted harassment happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course such a location was still known for its distinctly sexual atmosphere, and attendees could opt for a pass which indicated interest in the more blatantly sexual themes and optional parts of attractions. However a surprising amount of attendees were more like gawkers at a nudist beach, hardly brave enough to participate in Cosquillas' favorite pass time, let alone involve anything clearly sexual. These people rarely stayed at Cosquillas for more than a single trip, which has lead to the fair being more of a unintentional tourist trap, much to Mr. Man's disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has lead to Erin getting to know both the employees and the regulars, most of whom attend the fair multiple times or even live on the island itself. As such the awkwardness of Mr. Man's decision to have many of his attractions require mandatory exhibitionism somewhat fades away after the third visit or so in much the same way of the exhibitionist meet ups on the mainland which allow a safe feeling exploration of the experience. Of course Erin still felt rather humiliated when she uses one of Mr. Man's machines that arn't labled as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park is built on a long stretch of plains which gently slopes down to the beach. The tents and shacks and rides are tightly packed along wide roads, allowing room to maneuver but also transforming the park into somewhat of a labyrinth from ground level. The attractions are set up in a tiered system, the further from the entrance at the top of the plains or the beach at the bottom the more intense they are. Erin enjoyed those central attractions since she knew everyone who used them, but there were quite a few others on display here and there that she wanted to try out that were new since her last visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll have to visit Mr. Man at some point to get information on an re-examination she's making over the summer, but since his office is in the dead center of the park she can just work her way towards him. In the mean time the large gates and ticket booths stand before her waiting, its time for her to decide on what type of pass she'll get.</span></div></div>",

A mere trickle of attendees headed through this way compared to the moderately busy lines going through the normal lines. The attractions in the center of the park were locked by another gate where you had to present your special pass to get in, there an entirely different atmosphere was present, one much more in line with Mr. Man's original conception of the park and the only place where his mad ingenuity ran truly wild. Erin decided that she was going to head through the normal areas down the hill, stop by the center to check what was new, then head to Mr. Man and decide on her future plans based on what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man behind the counter handed her the pass before glancing back at the computer then to the ID she had handed her, \"Erin huh? Good to see you again, Mr. Man has a note here that says to send you to the clothing station backstage before you head anywhere else\" The man stamped a small key card, slotted it into a lanyard and handed it over to her. He signaled for her to carry on and received the only person in line behind her. Stepping through the turn-still she took a moment to take in the small segmented off area before heading into the site proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe special pass holders entered the park through a secondary gate after the turn still, and before it were the changing rooms on one side and a small booth explaining further details on what special privileges and expectations pass holders were expected to up hold. Erin decided to learn what was new this year with the pass and went to the kiosk first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognized the lady manning the kiosk from last year, a girl named Kim who she had run into in the inner center of the park who had lost all but her underwear in one of Mr. Man's more devious devices and had needed Erin's help to get a towel to use. Kim waved her over and clicked a counter, today seemed to have a little under 5 dozen pass holders come through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Erin, Great to see you! Wasn't sure you'd be coming by this year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, I had no clue that you worked here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shook her head, \"I started volunteering to help this winter during the off season, Mr. Man lets me hold the pass for free in exchange for a few hours a week. Anyways, i'm sure you'd love to hear whats going on with the park since you left huh? I've picked up on a few tid-bits not included in any of the leaflets\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, hit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" She pulled out a rolled up paper and unfurled it, <br>\r\n\"New Theme this year, \"Exhibition/Voyeurism\" Attractions to embarrass, tease, and titillate!<br>\r\nOn Site hotel with special pass holder area - More info on site<br>\r\nUnder Ground Arena, See Sam for more info\"<br>\r\n\"A few of those attraction are pretty intense, but you should be able to handle it. They don't have any markings on what they each do, so good luck with that. Mr. Man is at the top floor of the hotel, and said that I should tell you to test out the arena before sending you up to him. I haven't been there yet but apparently its some pretty 'Eyes Wide Shut' level shit, a bit over my head so I haven't headed down there yet, you can find it by a spiral staircase at the center of the inner ring.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyways, Im heading out in a few, so you'll probably see me in there at some point, catch you then!\"<br>\r\nErin responded affirmatively, and...</span></div></div>",
