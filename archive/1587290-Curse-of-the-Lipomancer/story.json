            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A deathly silence ran through the halls of the ancient, unhallowed lair, whose winding and maddeningly complex tunnels sat beneath the sleepy and unassuming village of Little Silverhorne. Many a story of it's deeply buried and mysterious caverns had been told to the children of the village at bedtime; stories of great adventurers plundering it for treasure, and of great monsters and elaborate traps, designed to sabotage would-be thieves planning to steal from the legendary Sitharli. The Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n One such tale had found it's way to the ears of Jane Drake. She sat in the Hare and Vole Inn, which lay at the heart of Greatmanor, one of the largest human settlements in the north, and by far the northernmost. She sat looking out of the window at the sunset over the snowy valley, sipping a glass of wine, \"Another if you please Barkeep.\" she said turning to face the burly looking man behind the bar.<br>\r\nShe spoke in a firm, but melodious voice. A man walked over to the bar, sitting next to Jane \"Drake?\" he asked.<br>\r\n \"Yes. Watcher?\" she replied.<br>\r\n \"Indeed.\" he said.<br>\r\n \"Will you have one?\" Jane enquired, lifting her wineglass. <br>\r\n \"No, thank you...\" he said hoarsely \"... about the deal.\"<br>\r\n His face was obscured by a pointed brown hood, somewhat like that which a monk would wear, but Jane was certain he wasn't a monk. \"Of course, I have the money with me now...\" <br>\r\n She untied a small brown leather satchel from her waist and laid it down on the bar before him. \"Good...\" he said simply and took the money, putting it in the inside pocket of his cloak, adding \"Yes... very good.\"<br>\r\n \"And your end?\" she said, not too eager about the fact that she still had nothing and he had her money \"Can you tell me where this village is?\"<br>\r\n \"Of course, to find the Lipomancer's lair...\" he breathed in deeply \"...seek out the village of Little Silverhorne.\"<br>\r\n And with that he slid off his chair again and began to slink his way out of the Inn. \"Wait...\" Jane shouted after him \"...that's it?\"<br>\r\n \"That is all you need to know to find it, although you may come to regret doing so...\"<br>\r\n \"What do you mean?\" Jane yelled after him as he left.<br>\r\n \"...you'll see.\" he said as the doors closed shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jane sat up in her room above the bar, the sound of dancing and merriment could be heard from below. Jane looked over the map that she had spread across her table, the light dancing across it as the candle flickered a little in the wind. She picked up her compass and stared at it for a moment, flicking it a little so that it found north. It was only a six or seven hour journey from Greatmanor to Little Silverhorne. \"I should set off first thing in the morning...\" she thought to herself \"...so that there is still daylight enough when I get there to try to find the Lipomancer's lair.\"<br>\r\n She was pleased with herself and decided to turn in for the night; putting her hands up above her head she pulled a small headband from her hair, releasing it in a cascade of jet black. She pulled a nightgown over her slim, pale skinned frame and lay her head on her pillow, closing her pale blue eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bleak.  Quiet.  Lonely.  Desolate.  Jane had gone through all the adjectives she could come up with to describe Little Silverhorne.  It was a tiny village, and while not as distant from proper civilization as many other villages, felt like it was on the edge of the world.  Overcast clouds covered the sky and blended with the snow capped peaks surrounding the town.  Houses were few and separated by wide lanes.  Only mild conversation from the town's only pub and the rhythmic dinging of a distant blacksmith showed Jane that the place wasn't completely dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat few people she saw on the streets moved with a slow deliberation.  They answered questions readily enough, but gave no more than that.  Jane found that the only real commerce coming to and from the town was a caravan that came every two months or so.  Travelers were rare.  Those that came by were only passing through.  Jane felt only the usual suspicion of travelers in the villagers' tone.  The Sitharli sect was a secretive one.  If any of them--or the entire town for that matter--were worshipers of him, they didn't show.  They probably thought the Lipomancer was such an obscure legend, the treasure deemed so mythical, that few would even have heard of it, let alone come looking for it, Jane thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane entered the town at dusk, having dawdled too long on the road.  The path to Little Silverhorne was rocky and ill-maintained.  She found the pub, which doubled as an inn, and entered, feeling she had exhausted any useful sources of information still out on the street.  Besides, she was tired and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside she took a seat in a corner.  She was wearing a travelers cloak and hood, a universal sign of somebody on the road and just passing through.  But she couldn't count on being completely inconspicuous.  Professional thieves like her were using the old mysterious traveler guise for so long now that anyone was just as likely to assume she was up to no good as not.  The patrons spoke in hushed conversations, although none seemed to notice her.  Jane noticed a pattern, now that she saw so many together.  While the men had the normal range of body types. the few women around were either plump or outright obese.  They had the same cold demeanor as the men.  Jane noted this with both pleasure and hesitation.  Sure, maybe there were Sitharli worshipers and a treasure horde here, but she knew about too many secretive cults who did not like letting outsiders leave.  This would have to be a quick job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo waitresses scuttled between the tables, bringing beer and food to the townsfolk with little prompting.  They were both large, but one was so fat that Jane wondered how she navigated the crowded floor so deftly.  Jane reacted with a reflexive disgusted expression as she approached, her features fortunately hidden by her hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beer, traveler?  Food?\" she said in a surprisingly pleasant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nodded to both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steaks' the special today.  It's always the special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for her food, Jane saw two others wearing the trademark travelers' cloak as her.  One was a man, a few years older than her, and he obviously had noticed her, although was taking pains to conceal it.  He too took a corner seat by a window.  The other traveler looked out of place despite her dirty cloak.  Underneath she was wearing an ornate read dress that was too tight for her soft body.  She was the thinnest woman there other than Jane, but she still had a noticeable potbelly, and her pale, delicate face was rounding out.  She had an almost regal demeanor to her.  Jane could tell her story just looking at her.  A young girl disenchanted with court life, runs away, and now is in a desolate tavern far from home, alone, scared, probably running out of money.  She was looking down at her empty plate with a tired, almost desperate expression.  When the waitress brought her another plate, this one full of steamed potatoes and herbs, she cringed.  She weakly tried to wave it away.  Jane listened in, barely making out the conversation.  The girl had a very regal accent, and spoke in a discreet, scared voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no, no,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the house, miss,\" the waitress said.  \"You look like you could use a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I don't . . . I don't want this . . .\" it was too dark to be sure, but Jane thought she was either on the verge of crying or was already there.  She leaned back in her chair away from the food, her hands pressing on her round belly, compacted into the fine dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" the waitress said, confused.  \"Eat up, dear.  Keep your health up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I've only been here two days and . . . and . . .\" the girl began sobbing, and nobody took notice.  The waitress stood next to her and patted her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there.  There there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" the girl almost shouted.  A few looked over, then went back to their conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter to me who you are, miss.  Just glad to give you a proper meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress walked off, leaving the food.  The girl was crying softly as her chubby face leaned toward the steaming dish in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  Why are you making me . . . like this . . . eating . . . always . . .\" her broken sentence trailed off as she began obediently eating her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other waitress brought Jane's beer and steak.  It looked delicious.  She was looking forward to it, but that whole overheard conversation had shaken her more than she was used to.  She tried to shrug it off, but it left an extremely bad feeling about this whole endeavor in her.</span></div></div>",

She burst out of the doors and quickly took refuge in the nearby alleyway, looking out occasionally but staying in her hiding spot, just in case she was being followed. The rouge's chest raised and lowered, she didn't know why, but this place actually scared her in some way, no, frightened her rather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, she saw the waitress and several patrons come outside in search of her and he reached for her weapon, only to find it was oddly missing. Muttering curses and more profanities, the rouge slipped into the basement from the rear of the building and looked around, enveloped in total darkness. That is, until a massive statue began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShielding her eyes, the woman approached the strange, obese looking statue and looked at the light purple gem radiating the glow that illuminated the room. Awestruck, as one would be, she reached up, touching the gem with a slender finger and gasping, the world around her had melted and she was now...</span></div></div>",

As she got closer she heard the girl crying softly, muffled by the food she was shoving into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For someone so upset about a meal, you don't seem too reluctant to eat it once you start,\" Jane said to the girl sitting opposite her as she placed down her food. Now that she was close, she could see the girl's face was very pretty and as she moved while she ate two pointed ears poked through her long blonde hair. <i>\"An elf!\"</i> Jane thought <i>\"Don't get many of those, let alone chubby ones.\"</i> The elf was clearly chubby, her face was rounded and, though Jane couldn't see her stomach, her dress looked stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" the elf started through a mouthful of food \"The food here... it's only been two days... I was thin like you... But they don't stop,\" she managed through mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah right,\"</i> Jane thought <i>\"She isn't fat, but people can't put on that much weight over two days,\"</i> If the elf was telling the truth and she was as thin as Jane then she must have put on twenty pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well leave then,\" Jane humored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" she said, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jane was contemplating what the girl in front of her was saying, her stomach rumbled and she was suddenly aware of the steak in front of her, \"One bite can't hurt...\" she muttered, lifting her fork and knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Came the muffled cry of the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Jane...</span></div></div>",

The elf girl looked horrified, she looked defeated as she ate another mouthful. Jane was amazed by the food, it was so good! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate fast and hungrily, demolishing the steak. After finishing, she sat back with her hands on her slightly distended stomach. The elf finished shortly after and looked at Jane's ready eyes. \"I tried to warn you\" the chubby elf said as one if the waitresses came over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoyed the starter I see,\" the waitress said happily motioning to the empty plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starter!\" Jane said in shock nearly choking on her beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, here's the main meal,\" the waitress pointed to a huge serving trolley being pushed by the other waitress, two plates were on it piled high with all kinds of food. Jane found her mouth watering at the tower of food. One was placed in front of her and the other in front of the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, I really do need to sleep though,\" Jane said nervously to the large woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense it's free after all!\" She said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her better judgement Jane found herself eating the huge meal, becoming more and more afraid that what the elf said was true. She ate the whole meal, her stomach now pushed hard against the leather armor she wore beneath her hood. Once more the waitress came, this time with a huge cake for dessert, and once more Jane failed to resist. The whole thing was eaten and the elf continued to sob quietly, matching Jane's own eating speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating so much she couldn't think straight, and the two waitress showed Jane and the elf to their own separate rooms. Jane fell on her huge bed and was asleep almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy morning Jane found herself looking in the mirror, her face was softer as was the rest of her, over one meal she gained 10 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to leave but was met with breakfast, then lunch, and then dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the fifth night Jane was brought to her room and fell on the bed. \"Can't sleep... Need to escape.\" She had to leave now, after five days in the tavern she had packed on 50 pounds. Her face was soft, her arms lost their tone, her stomach now was soft and jiggled slightly if she moved too fast. Her butt was bigger too, complimented by her thicker thighs and even her boobs had grown slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that night was the one time she could leave, but the food made her so sleepy. She got out of the bed, her leather armor groaned in protest, it had already ripped in the stomach area and threatened to show more with each pound. She fought sleep and left the room. The bar was empty and the door in sight. She was going to leave when she remembered the elf, \"I can't leave her,\" Jane thought. She went into the elf's room to find her asleep. The elf was about 10 pounds heavier than Jane, most of the weight going to her belly and breasts giving her a top heavy appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go!\" Jane whispered in a hurry, waking the elf. She was confused and tired, obediently following without a word. As the night air hit them they both woke up more. They ran as fast as their new weight allowed them and escaped the town into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" the elf choked out nearly crying from happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine we're free now, why were you there?\" Jane asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was heading to the Lipomancer's lair, I heard tales of treasure and found where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you know where..?!\" The chubby rogue said grabbing the elf's thick arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes\" the elf stammered \"In here,\" she said pointing at the forest </span></div></div>",

The two had only been in the forrest for about an hour, but she swore she saw that same weird face-shaped rock three times. She began to wonder if the elf actually had any idea of where the lair was. However even if she didn't, elves were suppose to be at home in nature, she should be able to at least get them out of the woods... right? Jane's nerves were not helped when the elf gave off a confused expression when they hit the rock the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you sure you know where the lair is?\" Jane inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!

Jane internally sighed, great I'm already scaring away my only good lead to the treasure so far ; no wonder why my last partner bailed out on me. I can't afford to scare her away, otherwise ill be back to square zero. She barely even looks at me, i better try to ease her before she tries to split from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm sorry for yelling.  I'm just a little stressed out with all this craziness going on. Hell, i don't even know your name yet or anything,\" Jane stated, hoping to ease her new traveling companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh it's okay you didn't do anything wrong. I'm just still a little freaked out from the tavern. I thought i was never gonna get out of there,\" the elf said while shuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets start over then.\" Jane stopped walking, put on her award winning smile and extended her hand out.\" My name is Jane. I'm an adventurer from a town far far away. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ma - AHHHHH!\" the elf exclaimed with a panicked expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is mah?\" a confused Jane asked. This girl might be a tad off her rockers, Jane began to worry. The elf then suddenly dragged the bewildered rogue close to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's Mara. But forget that, were being followed by the staff from the bar! We have to hide now!\" the elf whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you te... ,\" Jane began to ask but was interrupted by another louder voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went this way, they couldn't have gotten far,\" exclaimed a woman in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf quickly began to panic trying to figure out what to do. Jane also was feeling a bit uneasy as she looked down at her extra flab she acquired thanks to that dam town. Not wanting them to finish whatever they planned to do with the two, she quickly tried to look for an escape of some kind. Thankfully her training as a rogue had improved her sense of sight, allowing her to spy a narrow crevice that lead to a small cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quickly, we have to get out of here!\" the Jane stated. She then quickly grabbed elf's hand and started to dash forward. \"There is a cave up ahead that is hidden enough for us to hold out in.\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for Jane, she was having trouble finding her matches in the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse you matches for being so small and hidden,\" the rogue cursed at her bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf chuckled at this state of dismay. \"I might be able to help you out with that , so you don't start stabbing your bag,\" the elf replied.

The elf began to remove her cloak, allowing Jane to finally get a good look of the girl underneath. \"My name is Mara. As you can guess from the pointy ears I'm an elven mage, I'm from a village pretty far from here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane however barely heard the last part of Mara's statement as her  jaw dropped when the elf took off her cloak. In front of her lied one of the most beautiful girls she had ever come across on her travels. The elf was sporting silky smooth golden blond hair. She wore a red ornate dress and some exotic looking shoes that almost looked to be wooden. In the bar Mara seemed to be very thin with a potbelly from their stuffing nightmare, but now she was rocking a stunning hourglass figure most girls she knew would die for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not fair she had a potbelly like me just a little bit ago, how did she turn it into that,' Jane pondered.  However she realized that elf girl was just staring at her, with her face a little red. Realizing she must have been gawking at the poor girl she embarrassingly recomposed herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um that's cool.\" Jane mentally face palmed herself. 'Come on get a grip master rogue, so much for being suave.'  Deciding it would be better if they changed the topic she asked \"What are you doing out here anyway?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same as you I imagine, looking for the grand treasure of the lipomancer's lair,\" Mara replied. \"Though I may have gone in over my head.\" She nervously scratched the back of her head. \"If my panicking before didn't hint it off, I'm kinda new to this whole adventuring business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how many adventurers have you been on before this?,\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This would be the first one....,\" Mara practically whispered in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT! \" exclaimed Jane. \"This is not first adventure material, the lipomancer is a very dangerous person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but.... i just ...I .... i don't wanna talk about it okay,\" the elf murmured. A pained look hit Mara's face and she almost looked like she about to start crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey it's okay, lets just worry about that later. For now lets get some sleep alright?\" Jane insisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA replied *sniff* okay, was all Jane needed to hear to start unpacking her knapsack. The last thing she wanted to do is make her new fragile companion cry. Finally all set Jane prepared to pass out when she noticed that Mara was about the lie down on the cold cave rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing,\" Jane inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sorta left behind some of my supplies at the inn,\" Mara sighed. \"I was so lost in the moment of escaping I didn't remember to grab a lot of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can come share with me then, and i won't take no for an answer!\" Jane declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf girl quietly came over and started to snuggle with the red-headed rogue. Mara quickly entered the land of slumber, while Jane took one last glance at the girl who was smiling a tad. 'Maybe this adventure won't be so bad after all ' Jane thought with a big grin. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, with no sign of the crazy villagers outside, the two adventurers set off on their hunt to the lipomancer's lair. However, as the day prolonged they found themselves ironically hungry. They decided to take a break to find some grub with Mara searching for berries while Jane tried her luck at fishing. Unfortunately for Jane, her luck seemed to be on vacation as she was not getting a single bite from the fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dam fish, in this god dam river are so stingy and rare,\" she grumbled to herself. She had been here for what felt like an hour, with only sight of a single fish that passed by earlier. She was starting to believe that there weren't even any other fish besides that one in this god dam river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like it was on queue however, a fish suddenly appeared, proceeding to slowly inch up on her bait. With glowing hopeful eyes Jane watched as this fish was getting closer and closer to her worm. All her hope quickly turned to rage as a much larger fish then proceeded to devour the smaller one. With its prize it then proceeded to quickly start to swim down the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU NO GOOD, THAT WAS MY FISH,\" Jane exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was just about to jump into the river knives a blazing to chase this no good fish thief (ironic isn't it) before she heard a ruffle behind her. Ever alert she quickly found a good position in some bushes to ambush this nearby visitor. 'Maybe it's a delicious pig we can cook up,' Jane hoped to herself. She was about to jump at whatever it was before she saw the pointy ears she had started to grow accustomed to. Lowering her guard Jane proceeded to walk up to her companion, who by the look of her empty hands was having just as much luck as she was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no luck with the berries i assume,\" Jane solemnly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but i found something else you need to check out. Unless you are not done yelling at the fish,\"  Mara jested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara lead the way into a small clearing in the forrest. In the center of this clearing laid a large wooden box containing tons of food. The food varied from pies, cakes, bread and all sorts of goodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you say you found food before,\" Jane cheerily stated. Jane then proceeded to start to walk towards the box. \"Come on let us grab some of this great food and......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Mara exclaimed while holding Jane back. \"Don't you find it strange how this box made it out all the here and it hasn't been touched. What if it's cursed food like the food in the town or a trap from the town!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it could have easily been a crate from a merchant's wagon that happened to fall off the cart. Which has been waiting for two lucky girls to find and enjoy its contents,\" Jane retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girl's stomachs proceeded to show their opinion with a quick growl from both of them followed my a minor stomach pain. Whatever they were gonna do, they needed to decide now whether to enjoy this seemingly innocent gift or play it safe and continue their hunt for food. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Jane wished it wasn't so, Mara was probably right. The weirdness of this box just happening to appear with not a soul disturbing it is too suspicious to ignore. The box could easily have been a trap from the village folk, lipomancer or some yet seem enemy. If Jane had not have been in such a hungry state she too would probably have recognized this as the trap it almost certainly was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, without the food from the boxes Jane was feeling very miserable from all the hunger pains. While she normally could go days without a proper meal, the stuffing at the inn seemed to mess with her stomach, making it desire more substance then she was used too. Jane hoped that this was only a temporary effect and that she would go back to her normal self soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane glanced over at Mara who seemed , despite their lack of food, very excited and chipper. 'Maybe elves have better displicine for ignoring hungry,' Jane pondered. Still Jane was grateful for this switch of Mara's mood from their first day. Jane was starting to worry last night that she was going to have to babysit her ally more then rely on them, from the amount of panic the elf gave off during their escape. Granted anyone would be distressed if they believed they were going to be trapped in that town forever and suffer whatever fate those town's people had in store for them. However many people learn from their first adventure if they can live that type of life or not, many of which decide to not even finish. Jane herself was lucky, having a grand first adventure to recover her mother's wedding ring from some bandits. Jane wondered what the elf girl would decide on this travel, would she quit and leave at some point realizing this was not for her or would she love the thrill and seek more. She hoped the latter as while allies could be a hinderance for the rogue at times, they also made the travel way more enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mara made a triumph 'woo!' sound interrupting Jane's thought. Mara quickly grabbed Jane's head and directed her vision to a tree, but not just any tree. This tree must have been very ancient as it was almost the height of some castles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look up there, fruit!\" Mara happily stated. Indeed Jane, with the help of her special seeing glass, did see the fruit way way up the tree. The only problem was getting all the way up there, even with her climbing skills that was gonna take some time for Jane to get to. However before Jane could even respond Mara was already quickly climbing up the tree like a little monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry i will get some for us,\" Mara yelled back down to Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... thanks!\" Jane replied back to the quickly disappearing Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well she's certainly seems eager to prove herself and so easily excited, she really is new to this' Jane thought to herself. 'Also god dam, after this I need to ask some elves for climbing tips, she puts me to shame,' she told herself. It had been only about a minute and Mara looked almost one-third up the massive tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jane .....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of a sudden, a strong aroma hit Jane like a brick. Caught by surprise, the smell quickly overwhelmed the rogue, not that she was complaining. The smell was divine, giving off a very sweet scent. The fancy perfumes of mansions, the rogue had broken into, did not even compare to this scent. The aroma seemed to float in from somewhere deeper in the forrest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane didn't even notice her whole body started to move towards direction of the odor. The smell was so intoxicating, she was lost in its beauty. Even when she did notice her movement she brushed off as if nothing was amiss. ' Mara will be fine and i have some time before she gets back, i must figure out where that heavenly smell is coming from,' Jane told herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few eager steps she quickly found the source of the sweet scent. A cluster of purple trees lay before her. While the trees did not compare in size to the tree Mara was climbing, they were impressive in their own right, giving off a strange glow. When Jane got closer, further inspection showed that the glow was from the golden liquid that seemed to ooze off each tree. The liquid in question seemed to be some sort of tree sap and also seemed to be the origin of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jane continued to walk toward these strange trees, the scent grew more powerful and potent. Her mouth started to drool at the sight of the delicious smelling sap. ' I'm just really hungry is all' thought Jane, trying to justify her strange actions to herself. ' I wonder if the sap tastes as good as it smells.'  She slowly gathered some sap in her cupped hands, brought it to her face and sipped the liquid down. As soon as the sap hit Jane's tongue, her senses went wild. This sap was one of the best things she had ever eaten with its smooth texture and heavenly sweet taste. She rapidly downed the rest of what she had in her hands and went head first into a puddle of the sap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she not been so overwhelmed with all these blasts to her senses she might have been concerned with her odd behavior or what this sap was doing to her. Her mind however was so distracted from these sensations that she didn't even care she was slurping the sap up from the ground. All she knew was that the liquid was delicious and she wanted more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Jane was busy being enticed by the forest, Mara had almost made it to the top of the giant tree. She was thankful for her great climbing abilities she developed over the years. While it is commonly know that elves typically live in forests, most incorrectly assume that elves are all amazing at anything to do with the woods. Granted everyone in her village does know how to climb trees, Mara was one of the best, with no one coming close to her prowess or speed. While Mara was proud of this accomplishment, it was always watered down by a sour reminder. A reminder of the loneliness that caused her to become this good.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMara growing up had an enjoyable childhood, with loving parents and many friends. When her parents discovered that she had arcane abilities they were overjoyed with pride, telling their little angel that she had a great gift. When she finally was of age, she was sent to one of the magic academies to master her abilities. However when she arrived she started to feel like she was cursed rather then gifted. She quickly tried to make some new friends but she almost always ignored by the other students. She didn't understand what she was doing wrong, why these people were being so cruel to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually one day the loneliness got to her and after classes she felt like she needed to get away from it all. Remembering the good times when she used to go on mock adventures with her friends at home, she decided to explore the woods surrounding the school's grounds. As she traveled through the woods, the feeling of mystery around every turn made her forget her troubles and she quickly began to relax for the first time in a while. She laughed when she tripped on a log, she felt proud when she climbed large tree, and gazed in awe when she found a beautiful clearing of flowers. From that day on she took many trips into the woods after her classes. Each time she pushed herself harder and harder wanting to find more new areas to explore. While the loneliness always returned later, the happiness these trips brought was good enough for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara finally reached the top of the giant tree, making her way over to the fruit. While the location of the fruit she could see from the ground, she could not really see much about the texture of the food until now. While she saw the fruit was yellow, she didn't see these strange markings on the fruit. The markings were all purple and almost looked like another tree with a big red x though them to Mara. While she did find the markings weird, the fruit seemed good enough. She proceeded to take a small bite out of the fruit, quickly regretting it. While the fruit was not poisonous or have some weird charm in it, the fruit certainly did not taste that good. She was tempted to leave the fruit there but, the elf knew that her and Jane were way too hungry to care. So she proceeded to gather some fruit into her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Jane, Mara did not really know what to make of her so far. She hadn't really met too many humans before this, only some traders that came by her home village every now and again. Jane certainly seemed nice so far. Mara certainly was thankful for her rescuing from the village inn, even if she didn't listen to her warnings. Jane was definitely one of the prettiest humans she had met so far. Mara certainly hoped they could become friends, she didn't really want to go on this adventure on her own. 'Only time will tell i guess' Mara thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her bag now filled, she went to the edge to tell her companion that she was finished. As she got to the edge and looked down she  became disheartened from the lack of Jane. The elf began to feel saddened at the thought of her companion ditching her. She slowly started to climb down, but as she grew closer to the ground she heard the sound of what seemed to be eating in the nearby distance. Hoping her companion had just wandered off because she found food, Mara quickened her pace to where the sound was emitting from. After two minutes she finally saw Jane in the distance, near a cluster of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jane why did you wander off? Did you find some food or something?\" Mara inquired as she approached the rogue. When Mara got closer she realized something was wrong. Jane was not eating food as she suspected, but devouring this strange golden liquid off the floor. She was not even using her hands to gather the liquid, instead deciding to slurp up the liquid on all fours like some sort of animal. More worrying was the fact that she must have been here a while as her gut seemed to be a little more extended then Mara remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane what are you doing, are you okay?\" Mara asked. With no response from Jane again Mara's concern grew. She quickly grabbed Jane, trying to drag her away from the liquid. As soon as she did however, Jane seemed to try to fight back to get to the puddle. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jane, come on snap out of it,\" Mara pleaded to the rogue. She was playing tug of war with the golden liquid's pull on Jane, and she was losing that battle. Mara was not that physically strong and she didn't want to use magic to avoid accidentally hurting Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That heavenly smell, that mouthwatering taste, I must have more,\" Jane mumbled to herself. Jane still was under the allure of the liquids aroma. She was so lost in its trap, she didn't even notice Mara was there. Her only concern was getting more of that delicious smelling and tasting goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile struggling to hold Jane in place, Mara wondered what smell the rogue was talking about. Mara assumed the rogue tried this goo, and was charmed with some sort of addictive flavor. However it would seem the liquid also had an addictive smell to it, which Mara could not smell in the slightest. While the taste would obviously elude her without trying some, she should still get a whiff whatever this aroma is. Obviously the elf was thankful she couldn't smell the scent, lest she end up like her hunger crazed companion, but she hoped she could find some key to curing Jane with her immunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's struggling to get to her delicious treasure, unintentionally gave a swift elbow jab to Mara's jaw. Mara yelped in pain as her head was knocked upward but she maintained her hold of the entranced rogue. This knock upwards shifted Mara's view from the addictive goo on the floor, to the strange trees the liquid came from. She only had a quick glance at the trees before finding Jane, but now getting a better look she noticed how odd the trees were. The trees were completely purple, almost like someone had splashed paint all over them. The elf had seen purple leaves, before but never purple wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mara pondered at this strange tree a small spark clicked in the her mind. The fruit she just picked, didn't it have that strange violet marking on it. Mara quickly reached into her bag to grab one of the fruits, which unfortunately let the struggling Jane inch a little closer to her prize before Mara's arm returned to its hard grip. Inspecting the fruit again she noticed that the design was very close to the shape of the strange trees before her. The fruit must have been what kept her from being trapped by the strange sap. Maybe it could cure Jane? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf tried to shove the fruit into the Jane's mouth, but could find no way of moving her hand close enough without letting the rogue run free. The elf didn't know how long the fruit's effects would take, not wanting Jane to get addicted again before it worked its magic. Still not wanting to use magic on Jane, from fear of hurting her, she decided to trip the girl instead and rush her. With a quick shift of her grip from Jane's upper body to Jane's legs the entranced rogue quickly fell down, landing on her filled bellied which proceeds to jiggle from the impact. Before Jane could recover, the elf sat on the girl while proceeding to cram a fruit down Jane's throat. With something to eat again in her mouth's vicinity, she happily chewed down on the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" groaned Jane. \"What did you make me eat, it tasted like dirt had a baby with mold?\" inquired the Rogue, as she tried to brush her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane are you okay?\" asked the worried elf, thankful to finally get a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides needing soap to wash the taste outta my mouth, I'm fine. Where are we anyway?\" Jane replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure, but Jane you don't remember? You were in some kind of trance and ate tons of that strange goo,\" a confused Mara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really. All I remember was this great smell and..... wait did you says tons,\" exclaimed a now panicked Jane. Looking down Jane could see the damage that was done to her figure. An extra ten pounds seemed to be added to her already chubby body and  straight on her gut, much to the girl's dismay. The girl's emotions quickly turned to anger from this realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dam tree in this dam god dam forest with its god dam fattening magic,\" cursed the rogue as she stomped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if only I was quicker,\" the elf sadly stuttered. Mara proceeded to slowly look downwards, carrying a gloomy expression on her face. Jane eventually caught a glimpse of this in her rage. She had forgotten about the delicate side of the elf, she encountered the first night. Not wanting her bad temper to scare off her companion she quickly cooled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's not your fault. My own stupidity got me stuck in this mess,\" Jane reassured the elf. \"Besides look at the bright side, when the plants are trying to fatten you up the lipomancer's lair can't be that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess your right,\" Mare replied shyly.\"But still maybe if I was around I could have ...,\" Mara started to say, before she was met with finger on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush you, don't go blaming yourself for everything. I'm the experienced adventurer here,\" Jane proudly stated with a smirk.\" Your allowed to make mistakes, while I shouldn't be making such silly ones. So the only blaming around here should be directed at me, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam,\" Mara replied with a small smile. \"And thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enough non cursed food to last them a while, the two set off towards where Mara believed the lair to be. On there way they passed dozens of clusters of the purples trees, all erupting with the same strange addicting liquid. Jane shuttered at thought of what one tree did to her, let alone if she had lost control here around all these trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sure those weird fruits you have will keep working right,\" Jane sheepishly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so, I'm not really sure,\" replied Mara.\" But someone or something obviously wanted to show us that they protected against those tree's effects. I doubt they would go through all the trouble of marking them all if they didn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky quickly grew dark and the two were forced to set up in a nearby cave. Unfortunately for them, they were still right in the middle of the strange purple trees but they could travel no further. While Jane was concerned about falling into another trance, Mara was confident that the fruits would last the night. Just as a safety precaution though, the two stuffed their noses up with cloth and ate a little more of the fruit before drifting off into slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the lack of extra blubber on the girls, it was clear that the fruit did the trick for protecting them from the tree's magic. They were about to head out from the cave, when the sounds of a thunderstorm echoed in the distance. With the dark clouds coming closer, they decided that it would be smarter to wait out the storm in the safety of the cave. The two girls quickly found themselves in a situation of awkward silence. While they both had spoken to each other before, it was generally about the adventure or some trap. They both realized they really didn't know much about the other, not having time to have asked questions with all the craziness of the past few days. Finally getting sick of the silence, Jane decided to be the one to start the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mara, since we have some time to kill why don't you tell me about yourself,\" Jane curiously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well there isn't really much excitement to tell,\" Mara bashfully replied. \"What exactly would you like to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, why don't you tell me about your home town. You said it was called Elysian correct?\" the Rogue inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and the name does not lie. The town really did feel like paradise, at least to me,\" Mara stated. \"As you properly guessed, the town was in the middle of a large beautiful forest. Some of the buildings were actually built into and on the trees. We also had a river that ran straight through the village, eventually becoming a small lake we used as a pool. As for the village itself the food was delicious, everyone was kind and there was always something to do for excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you had some family and friends in the village?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I'm part of a family of 5. There are my two parents Seith and Azura, my younger brother Erlan, and my younger sister Ava. As for friends most of the village was friendly towards each other, but my best friends were Elora, Jill and Rhys. There was also my close friend Grunger, a dwarf from far North, but he had to move back home eventually. We all used to have so much fun, going on pretend adventures in the woods, mock battling each other or trying to make crazy devices.\" Mara quickly seemed to get lost in thought, remembering the good old days when life was simpler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you leave anyway, seemed like you had it pretty made,\" Jane jokey asked. She quickly wished she hadn't however, as an aura of gloom seemed to cast over Mara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eventually my parents discovered I was a mage when i was around 16. When I was finally of age, I was sent to the academy to train my skills,\" Mara stated , with a look of pain quickly developing. \"And I ... I don't really want to go into the rest. I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara seemed very uncomfortable Jane noted, as the elf seemed to visible shrink and turned her gaze from Jane to the empty cave floor.  She felt bad for quickly ruining the mood, but in her defense she didn't know. Jane proceeded to walk over to where Mara was sitting, given the girl a reassuring pat on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's okay, you don't have to go into anything you don't want to talk about,\" Jane insisted. \"Were friends after all and friends respect each others privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara turned her head back to Jane with a bewildered expression on her face. \"Were friends? I mean you want to be friends with me?\" Mara stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why wouldn't we be friends?\" asked a confused Jane. \"You seem to be pretty friendly and considerate. Not to mention you probably saved my life earlier, or at least my waist. Of course were friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mara began to process Jane's statement, a broad smile started to quickly form on the girl. It was a smile that Jane hoped she would see a lot more of on their travels. While Jane already thought the elf girl was attractive, she seemed even more beautiful then before. However more importantly, this seemed to be the first time on their adventure that Mara seemed truly just happy. Not worried about some danger or in pain from some unknown past, just happy. Mara suddenly gave Jane a quick hug, causing the unsuspecting rogue to develop a small blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I've been traveling alone on the roads for a while. It's comforting to have a friend again,\" Mara revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um yeah, of coarse,\" Jane coughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it seems the storm is gone,\" Mara exclaimed. \"We should head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate a small chunk of their protective fruit, and quickly set out. As they walked Jane continued to ask Mara questions about her village life. Mara began to tell all sorts stories of her youth, like her adventures with her friends, or her mischief with her siblings. After a while, Mara eventually ran out of stories she could remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now you know a little bit about my youth, what about yours?\" Mara questioned. \"How did you wind up becoming a rogue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I.....,\" Jane began to start, before getting distracted. \"Hey Mara, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance lay a mysterious looking house. While it seemed strange that someone was living all the way out here, the architecture of the house was the more peculiar part. The design of the house was normal enough, but the material it was build out of looked abnormal. Neither girl could say for certain what the house seemed to be made of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided that despite the strange appearance of the house, the house seemed normal enough. They hoped that whoever lived their was home. A local would be great help with navigating the forest or getting a better idea of where the lipomancer's lair was. The two companions made there way over to the door and knocked. Suddenly the door opened....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door slowly opened, revealing a tall young human woman. The 5\u20197 woman was wearing a linen shirt with a purple skirt, which had a floral design too it.  Besides a little pudge in the stomach area, she seemed to be in amazing shape. Being in shape would definitely help carry her big breasts, she barely contained in her shirt. Her face, in contrast to the rest of her body, made her seem very delicate with all the fine features it held. That same face now held a surprised expression on it at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is unexpected. I rarely get visitors, specially such adorable ones,\u201d the woman stated with an almost sultry tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, uh miss. I\u2019m Jane and this is my friend Mara. We were wondering if you could give us some directions,\u201d Jane replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, how could I deny such friendly and cute guests. The name is Astra by the way,\u201d the woman answered. \u201cNow where are you two little ladies goi\u2026. ,\u201d the woman began to say before suddenly halting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay,\u201d Mara questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two, inside now,\u201d Astra barked. Her previous tone now completely replaced by a serious one. The two girls wondered what changed in the few moments of their conversation to cause this shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on,\u201d Jane demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what is going on,\u201d Astra whispered as she pointed behind them. As the girls turned around, their expressions dropped. In the distance roamed what could only be describe as a massive blue monster filed with some kind of liquid. While it seemed to currently just sitting there, who knows what it would do if it saw them. The two girls decided they rather not take that chance, proceeding to follow Astra into her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure were safe in here from that thing? It\u2019s almost as big as your house,\u201d Jane inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, were fine. My house is made from materials that seem to ward away the monsters,\u201d Astra insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that massive creature a slime?\u201d Mara asked. The elf on her many travels has seen some crazy creatures. On one such trip she had encountered some slimes. The ones she ran into  were small and adorable, generally made from human wizards practicing animation spells on water. Creating life takes a lot of energy, so most animation spells at their biggest wind up human size. The amount of power that would be required to make one that size would be enormous, requiring a seriously skilled magic user to produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly I have no idea and no desire to get that close to find out. Well, on the bright side I now have plenty of time to give you guys directions,\u201d Astra joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather then stand in the door entrance all day, Astra lead them to a living room area. The room, besides the small pieces of furniture to sit down on was mostly empty, suggesting Astra had not lived here for long. The room also had door that presumably lead to the sleeping quarters. While Mara and Jane sat down, Astra quickly went to the kitchen to get some refreshments for her guests. She eventually returned with some bread and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where are you guys headed anyway? I\u2019m honestly surprised two young ladies came to woods like these,\u201d Astra questioned as the girls began to munch on their bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane slowed her chewing down, trying to come up with an answer to the woman question. While she seemed nice, her run in with the townsfolk made her wary of the people here. They could all be working for the lipomancer. Before she could come up with a response however Mara blurted, \u201cOh well, were looking for the lair of the lipomancer.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane could only face palm at the nativity of her partner. Astra on the other hand was startled by this statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why would you wanna go there? Do you know how dangerous it is,\u201d Astra harshly exclaimed. \u201cYou should just go back to wherever you came from, it's not worth going there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I will have you know were experienced adventurers. We can handle anything the lipomancer can throw at us,\u201d Jane argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what Lana said before she went missing,\u201d Astra countered with a deflated expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is Lana?\u201d Mara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLana, she is my sister,\u201d Astra sadly replied. \u201cShe was an adventurer as well, and thought she could claim the treasure of the lipomancer to help out the family. That was a month ago and we haven't heard from her since. That is what is in store for you too, if you follow this foolish quest. I came out here to try to find her, but haven't had any luck getting past all the traps and monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want we can help find your sister,\u201d Mara offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no, I don't want more people to share her fate,\u201d Astra yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen you can\u2019t stop us from going out there to find the lair. We are gonna go there with your help or not. So instead of this non sense help us get there and we will more then happily look out for your sister on our travels,\u201d Jane declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra sighed, knowing that she could not persuade these two to give up their quest so easily. It seems to be a trait in all adventurers to be stubborn as mules, just like her sister she supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right fine, you win,\u201d Astra conceded. \u201c While I don't know the exact location, I know which direction to head from here. If you promise to bring my sister home, I\u2019ll help you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal,\u201d the two girls replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note Astra offered to let girls stay the night to rest and prepare for their journey. Knowing this might be the last nice place they stay at for a while, the two girls accepted. The three proceeded to eat some dinner that Astra cooked, while she told them about how she winded up here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstra was part of a family from SummerStone. The whole family worked, her father as butler, mother as a cook, her sister trained to become a knight, and she herself as a builder. Everything was fine until her father became ill. Most of their income had to be transferred to his treatment, leaving not a lot left for the basic necessities. Lana, hearing a rumor of the fabled lipomancer treasure stash, decided to set out to find it to help out her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her father did start to get better, no one heard back from Lana in over a week. Worried, Astra set out to try follow her sister\u2019s steps from what she had been shown. When she reached these woods, she immediately fell victim to the same trap that Jane fell to. Thankfully for her one of the fruits that cured the affliction fell into the liquid she was devouring, snapping out of her state. Eventually after nearly running straight into big blue, she decided she needed a safe haven. She proceeded to build a house from the strange purple trees in a few days. Luckily for her the wood seemed to have a weird effect of scaring off the monsters. She continued her search but ran into more obstacles everyday. She was actually starting to run out of time, needing to go home to help pay the bills while her father recovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Astra showed the two to their quarters, her room in fact. She insisted that as the host she could not make her guests sleep so uncomfortably, and that she could sleep on the couch one night. The two thanked her hospitality and said their goodnights to the Astra as they prepared for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we are helping her,\u201d Mara stated, as she prepared her bed. \u201cI couldn't imagine what I do if one of my siblings went missing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but hey Mara listen,\u201d Jane replied. \u201cYou gotta be more careful about what information you tell people. While Astra turned out fine, what if she was like the villagers or a minion of the lipomancer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had not even thought about that,\u201d Mara admitted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I'm not really good at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just be careful from now on all right?\u201d Jane repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll try to be more careful. Good night Jane\u201d Mara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two adventurers went to bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun slowly started to rise, casting a dim light in the woods. The sunrise bounced off the morning dew, creating bright glow in the woods. Birds were chirping, a nearby stream was trickling, and insects were humming. If one did not know the dangers that lurked in these woods, the forest would seem very peaceful and an inviting place. The peace definitely did help make sleeping easier, as the two girls continued to slumber in Astra\u2019s bed. That was until a loud noise stirred their slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOwww, god dam it,\u201d Astra cursed in another room in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud shout was enough to slowly wake Jane and Mara from their deep sleep. The two groggily opened their eyes, until they were met with a surprise. When they went to bed, the two tried to give each other as much space as they could on Astra\u2019s bed. Awakening, they found themselves inches away from the other\u2019s face. A small blush formed on the two girls, each of them quickly trying to come up with a response to this awkward situation. Jane, staring at Mara\u2019s stunning face, was starting consider just going straight in for a kiss, but Mara beat her to action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mara exclaimed, jumping out of the bed. \u201cGuess I\u2019m a bit of a bed hog,\u201d Mara joked, as she nervously scratched the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shock of the situation passing, Jane\u2019s natural roguish charms were given time to work their magic. \u201cIf it means I get to wake up to such a beautiful sight, you can hog my bed anytime,\u201d Jane teased as she slowly got up. Mara\u2019s blush, turning a deep crimson, was all Jane needed to see to know she still had game. Deciding that to be enough for now, the rogue fixed up her bed hair and proceeded to her pile of cloths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Mara, lets go check if Astra is up,\u201d Jane said, as she started to dress. Mara, who was still flustered from Jane\u2019s comments, slowly proceeded to ready herself for the day as well. With the girls finally dressed, they proceeded out of the room to search for Astra. Eventually they found her, with a pained look on her face as she held her left hand in a bucket of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAstra, are you okay?\u201d Mara inquired, as she rushed over to the builder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm fine,\u201d Astra asserted. She raised her hand from the bucket, showing the hand to be a little red and swollen. \u201cI\u2019m just a bad cook is all. Tried to make something since you guys are my guests, wound up cooking myself instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere I can stop the swelling,\u201d Mara offered. Taking Astra\u2019s hand, the mage began to cast a spell. The effects were immediate as the hand proceeded to shrink in size, though maintained its red color. \u201cThe rest should heal shorty. Now no more cooking, we can handle it,\u201d Mara declared, already making a beeline straight for the cooking area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, I appreciate the help,\u201d Astra replied. \u201cLana was always the one that cooked with mom, I'm afraid I'm not as skilled in that regard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mara prepared breakfast, Jane started going over directions with Astra. Lana had carefully done her research before heading out. Eventually, Lana had made a map of where she believed the entrance to the lair was located. While unfortunately Lana still had that map, Astra was present for a lot of her sister\u2019s work and was able to piece together a lot of what she remembered. Before the two girls arrived she had mapped out a lot of the forest, getting a good idea of what area to head to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome point during their conversation, Mara had returned with a delicious meal for the three. Some fluffy pancakes, some warm soup, and even chopped up some of that weird fruit they still had. Eagerly, the three chowed down on their meal, commending Mara for her good cooking. At some point Jane noticed that Astra had stopped eating. A distant stare plagued her face as if she was in deep thought, contemplating something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJane, can I ask you a question,\u201d Astra abruptly asked. With a pancake stuffed in her mouth, Jane proceeded to nod for her to continue. \u201cI just don't get why my sister does this all the time. She keeps going off on these wild adventures without regard for anything else. It is constant danger she doesn't need to put herself though, I mean she has a job lined up in the city. You are an adventurer too, why do you do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it kinda started by necessity,\u201d Jane began to explain. \u201cWhen I was a young, my father died in battle. While we had money for a while, raising three kids as a single parent was hard. The situation became a lot worse, when one day we were robbed by bandits. The worst part of that was they stole my father\u2019s sword and watch, the only two items I had left of him. Enraged and determined, I vowed to get back our possessions from these no good thieves. Unfortunately for me the clever bastards had already sold off our stuff to merchants. Eventually, I tracked down the one of items to a small house in the woods. At the time I did not know the house belonged to an old ranger, who quickly took down me as I was inexperienced. When I explained my plight the old man took pity on me, deciding to train me so I could finish my quest. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane paused for a second, to drink some of her water. The others had stopped eating, enamored by her tale. She was confused why Mara was so surprised from tale before remembering she hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to tell this story yet. Feeling refreshed from the water, she continued on with her yarn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow with proper training, hunting down the rest of the stolen goods was a lot easier. I was able to get back most of our stuff including my dad\u2019s longsword, though I was never able to find what happened to my father\u2019s watch. When I returned home, while proud of what I accomplished, I noticed that something felt missing. I missed the excitement of travel, the thrill of danger at every turn, and the feeling of accomplishment from a hard mark. So I continued my work, taking contracts to steal items or just exploring ruins on my own for treasure. It\u2019s not really about the cash, I don't keep most of my scores. I send most of my loot back to my mother to help take care of my younger siblings. It\u2019s more about the excitement, the thrill from it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound like a danger junkie,\u201d Astra jested. \u201cBut I kinda get where you are coming from. Though still doesn't sound that appealing for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, it's not for everyone,\u201d Jane replied with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it hypocritical of you to steal from others when you were robbed?\u201d Mara inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only steal from thieves or people with so much stuff they don't notice something is missing. Totally different scenario,\u201d Jane insisted. Mara about to respond with a rebuttal but when she noticed Jane was back to eating, she decided to let it go.<br>\r\nAfter finishing breakfast, the two girls got ready to head back out. Astra helped the two pack, even kindly giving them some of her extra supplies. With there bags all packed, it was finally time to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, so much for your hospitality,\u201d Mara said. In tradition with elf customs, she proceeded to bow, showing respect towards her host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and thank you for the supplies,\u201d Jane added, giving the host a more casual thanks with a friendly handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you two find my sister, that is all the thanks I need,\u201d their host replied. \u201cYou two are welcome to come back if you need to, I should be here for a couple more days. Also when you two find my sister, tell her she better be ready for an earful when she gets back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note the two headed back into the woods, continuing on their adventure. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Loud laughter broke the silence of the otherwise peaceful forest, as the two girls continued their trek. The companions had set off following Astra\u2019s instructions carefully, and so far had not run into trouble. To pass the time, Jane began telling tales of her previous heists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean they had no pants on?\u201d Mara giggled, as small tears began to form on her eyes. The elf was so distracted that she almost walked into a low branch, only managing to  duck at the last minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful there giggles, trees can be deadly,\u201d Jane joked with a big grin. \u201c I figured if they couldn't find there pants that would slow them down. The guards must not have noticed as they busted straight out of the building after me. Was totally worth it though, as after I lost them I heard a loud scream from a woman behind me, followed by someone yelling \u2019You perverts, put some clothes on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s awesome, I\u2019m sure they sure weren't ready for that huh,\u201d Mara chuckled, starting to wipe away the tears. \u201cThat reminds me of a spell I once read about that makes clothes invisible. Always wanted to try it on mean girls at school, but never had the balls to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what, there is a spell for that?\u201d Jane exclaimed, turning her head towards Mara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know right, it's so oddly specific. Though to be fair, we are chasing someone who specializes in fattening magic,\u201d Mara argued, with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a useful spell to know when sleeping next to a lovely lady such as myself,\u201d Jane teased, as she wore a devil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara\u2019s face turned a deep crimson, a wave of embarrassment rushing over her. \u201cWhat, wait no, I would never,\u201d Mara stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wanted to see me without clothes, all you had to do was ask,\u201d Jane replied with a sultry voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hoping over a small puddle, the rogue turned back towards Mara to check out her work. Mara was so easy and fun to fluster, even if Jane did sometimes mean what she said. The elf was currently speechless, with her head lowered to hide her massive blush. Unfortunately for Mara, with her head down she could not see a low hanging branch, walking straight into it instead. With a smack, the mage was knocked down straight into the puddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane rushed over to her friend, feeling a little guilty for distracting the girl. \u201cMara, are you okay,\u201d Jane asked, as she extended a hand out to help the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I\u2019m fine, just a little wet you jerk,\u201d Mara retorted. With help from Jane, the girl got up and proceeded to check out the damage done. The two were met with a surprise as Mara was completely dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir confusion was answered as they noticed a small stream of liquid returning towards the puddle. Jane previously assumed the liquid was normal water, but now that she wasn't distracted she noticed the liquid was not transparent but a neon blue color. The stream quickly gathered into the puddle, which suddenly started to pulse. Assuming the worst, the girls quickly got into a battle stance, ready to face this new foe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pool of liquid shot straight up, starting to take on a humanoid form. As the transformation continued the gender of the creature was quickly cleared up as huge breasts and a sizable ass formed on the slender body of the individual. Finally the head formed on top of the blue body, which sported an almost childlike face with long flowing neon blue hair. After letting out a loud yawn, the woman seemed to squint her eyes while scanning the area. Once she spotted the duo a huge smile formed, as she slowly made her way over to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy travelers,\u201d the liquid woman exclaimed. \u201cMy names Lily, what are your names?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Jane and this is Mara,\u201d Jane stated. The two girls remained in battle stances as they were still a little cautious of this strange girl. \u201cIf you don't mind me asking, what are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a slime girl silly,\u201d  Lily replied. She proceeded to jiggle her whole body as if to validate her statement. \u201cNow what are two cute girls such as yourselves doing in these woods?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are looking for a missing woman,\u201d Mara replied, starting to lower her staff. \u201cOh, we are also looking for an entrance to the lipomancer\u2019s lair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the only people I have seen I'm afraid,\u201d Lily replied with a pout. \u201cBut if you are willing to follow me I can get you guys to that lair thingy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara and Jane exchanged skeptical glances at each other. While Lily seemed nice enough so far, she still was a monster girl. Monster\u2019s can be nice sometimes but can easily be very conniving. Seeing no risk in giving the slime girl a shot, they agreed to follow her lowering their drawn weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ecstatic expression overtook the girl as she hopped up and down, shaking her whole body in the process. \u201cOh boy my master will be so proud of me, gathering up to girls for him,\u201d Lily exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Jane barked, rapidly drawing her daggers back out at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shocked expression appeared on Lily\u2019s face, her mouth was wide open. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just said that out loud,\u201d Lily solemnly stated. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid,\u201d she exclaimed as she began to sob. The slime girl collapsed on the ground, tears flooding from her eyes. The sight was strange as her tears were made of the same liquid as her body, causing her to begin to shrink in size. The flying liquid seemed to slowly trickle back to the sobbing girl, to continue the cycle. \u201cNow the master is gonna kill be for sure. I\u2019m so stupid, stupid, stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour master\u2019s not gonna get the chance after I\u2019m done with you,\u201d Jane threatened. This only made the slime girl weep even harder. This earned a quick bop on Jane\u2019s head from Mara, who gave a \u2018you're not helping glare\u2019 to the rogue.  <br>\r\nMara began making her way over to the remains of the Lily\u2019s body. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. We are not gonna hurt you,\u201d Mara softly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara\u2019s words seemed to ease the slime girl as the tears slowed down, giving the girl\u2019s body a chance to mostly reform. \u201cYou, mean it?\u201d Lily murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, just give us some information and we will leave you alone,\u201d Mara affirmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the slime girl gave the elf a surprisingly strong bear hug, smothering the elf\u2019s head into her chest. \u201cOh thank you, thank you, thank you. You won\u2019t regret it,\u201d Lily happily exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane began to chuckle as Mara attempted to free herself from being smothered by Lily\u2019s breast, eventually escaping the girl\u2019s strong grasp. \u201cWhy don't you tell us about this master of yours, the one you were gonna take us to,\u201d Jane inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh him,\u201d Lily stated bitterly. \u201cThe self pronounced slime king. I thought he be nice to me as I he created me, but I couldn't have been more wrong. All he would ever do was yell at me and boss me around. He told me if I didn't find people to bring to him, he would absorb me.\u201d The slime girl began to shutter at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is the slime king?\u201d Jane questioned. \u201cIs he a servant of the lipomancer or something? What does he want with all these people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl seemed overwhelmed from the barrage of questions, shaking her head in pain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I don't know, I was only made a week ago,\u201d Lily shyly replied. \u201cI wasn't even conscience for half of that time, those first three days are a bit fuzzy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you're really young then,\u201d Mara exclaimed, examining the blue girl. \u201cYour species must age really quickly, for you to be this developed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, you say the nicest things miss,\u201d Lily bashfully replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what can you tell us then Lily?\u201d Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019ve mostly been here, waiting to find some travelers to save myself,\u201d Lily sadly replied. \u201cI can warn you that there are some scary creatures that roam these woods at night though, so you should be careful where you sleep. Also you should avoid running into the slime king, he isn't a friendly guy. I\u2019m sorry I don't know more, that is enough for you to not hurt me right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, we promised didn't we,\u201d replied Mara, with a cheery smile. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell your master you saw us okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane proceeded to return back to their original path, beckoning Mara to follow. \u201cCome on Mara, I think that is all were gonna get from the girl. We should keep going if we wanna make some distance before nightfall,\u201d Jane called back. \u201cSee ya around slime girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah your right,\u201d Mara admitted, though she did not want to leave this girl so soon. \u201cThanks for your assistance Lily.\u201d As the elf attempted to catch up the rogue a blue arm grabbed her hand, holding her in place. As Mara turned she spotted Lily holding onto her with giant puppy dog eyes resting on her face. \u201cWhat is up Lily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if I could go with you guys,\u201d Lily timidly asked. \u201cThe slime king is really mean to me and I don't wanna work for him, but if I'm alone he might try to kill me. You guys seem like your tough so you could protect me from him.\u201d The slime girl proceeded to go down on her knees, starting to get into a begging position. \u201cI can be really helpful as well I'm flexible, I don't need much food and I\u2019m pretty strong. So can I come with you guys?\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCan you excuse us for a moment,\u201d Jane asked, dragging Mara away from the slime girl. When they were out of earshot range of the girl, Jane began to show her annoyance. \u201cShe tries to capture us, and then expects us to trust her enough to travel with us? She clearly is not the sharpest tool in the shed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey don't say that, that\u2019s not fair,\u201d  Mara argued. The mage took a quick glance at the monster girl, making sure she didn't hear their discussion. Lily seemed to be in her own world, gleefully observing a nearby butterfly. \u201cShe may seem developed, but she is still fairly young for her species.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come Mara, don\u2019t tell me you bought all that,\u201d Jane jeered. \u201cShe just was making excuses once she realized she messed up. Probably wants to come with us, just to slit our throats in our sleep.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you're being a bit dramatic. She is harmless, naive but harmless,\u201d Mara rebutted. Her normally calm and pleasant demeanor slowly shifted to visible frustration, though she was trying her best to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are still forgetting that this isn't a normal girl, it\u2019s a monster,\u201d Jane retorted. Jane\u2019s statement seemed to hit a nerve, as the previously irritated elf was now steaming. The change in her friend\u2019s attitude continued to be lost on the rogue, who was too distracted with the conversation. \u201cMonsters are know for backstabbing wanderers. Come on Mara you know this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about her background, she deserves a chance just like everyone else,\u201d Mara yelled. Jane had apparently completely set the fire completely ablaze, as Mara looked furious. If looks could kill, daggers would be flying from her eyes, not that she would need them with her fists tightly clenched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the dramatic change in tone, Jane finally took a moment to observe her companion, and what she saw was concerning. She was very familiar with angry people, most of them were the individuals chasing after her to get back the rogue\u2019s prizes of the night. However seeing the normally kind hearted elf get this worked up so quickly unsettled the rogue, as generally this had to be caused by something. It would seem that not everything was sunshine and rainbows like Mara\u2019s stories suggested, as the girl looked to carry some baggage from her past. Jane hoped in the future the mage would share that baggage with her, but for now decided to concede their argument, not wanting to upset the girl further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess your right,\u201d Jane sighed. The red head nervously scratched the back of her neck, trying to come up with the right words to say next. \u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara seemed to relax at the sound of Jane\u2019s surrender. This new calm feeling was quickly replaced with a one of awkwardness, as she now realized how worked up she had gotten. \u201cShe could come with us or at least stay with Astra,\u201d Mara sheepishly replied. \u201cWe can ask her which she prefers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll right sounds like a plan, lets go tell our anxious guest,\u201d Jane stated. She began to walk back towards Lily, when a she felt a small tug on her hand. Jane turned to find Mara holding her hand, with an embarrassed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for yelling before,\u201d Mara blurted, her head starting to lower. \u201cI just \u2014\u201d She tried to continue her thought but the words seemed to be lost on her. A sudden force on her shoulder knocked her out of her daze, as she raised her head back up to meet eyes with a concerned rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara listen, I know something is bothering you,\u201d Jane softly stated. \u201cYou are not that good at hiding it and you shouldn't hide it from me, I can help.\u201d A look of guilt seemed to manifest on Mara\u2019s face. \u201cBut, I know it can be difficult to share these emotions, so I don't expect you to just blurt out everything. I just want you to know, when your ready I\u2019ll be here for you. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile started to etch its way onto the mage\u2019s face, as she slowly hugged her friend. \u201cYeah I will,\u201d Mara answered. \u201cThank you, for being so understanding.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the decision made, the two companions made their way back over the awaiting slime girl. Lily must have been bored waiting, as she now was morphing her body into various shapes. When she heard approaching footsteps, she quickly reformed into her normal form and started walking up the girls with hopeful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right Lily, here is the deal,\u201d Jane declared. \u201cYou can come with us where we would expect you to pull your own weight and contribute to the team. It will be a dangerous, hard, and long adventure. Alternatively, you can go to our friend Astra\u2019s house here in the woods. She will take care of you, and when she leaves you can go with her to find a new home. The choice is up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime girl pondered her options, before finally coming to a decision. \u201cI would rather go with you two then some stranger,\u201d Lily admitted. \u201cSo I guess count me in on your adventure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen welcome aboard,\u201d Mara exclaimed. The elf proceeded to give a hug to their new companion, which quickly turned into her slowly sinking into the slime creature. The process only quickened when a confused Lily hugged the girl back, accidentally pushing Mara further inside her body. The slime girl was so excited about being part of the group, she didn't even notice when Mara started struggling to pull herself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane could only chuckle at Mara\u2019s sad attempts to free herself, before deciding to help the elf before she was completely submerged. Jane tried to pull the girl out but was having no such luck, causing her to tug harder. Unfortunately when the rogue gave an especially strong tug Lily had realized the mage was stuck inside her and released her, causing the elf to go flying straight into a nearby tree. After a loud thunk, the poor elf landed on the ground, a lot more disoriented from her unintended flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are so silly,\u201d Lily chuckled. The slime girl began to head over to where Mara landed before a nearby bunny distracted her. \u201cOh, it's so cute. Lemme give it a hug.\u201d The girl proceeded to chase the rabbit, completely forgetting about the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue proceeded to head over to her dazed friend, still laughing at the whole ordeal. \u201cYou are right, she is totally harmless,\u201d Jane joked, receiving a groan as a response from Mara. Jane then helped Mara stand, checking for any injuries. Besides a small headache, the mage was perfectly fine. After giving the elf a couple minutes to recover her senses, the three set off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued following the instructions given to them by Astra, though at a slower pace due to Lily\u2019s fascination with seemingly everything. Jane was beginning to get frustrated from their slow pace and was about to say something to the slime girl, but was interrupted by a soft bop from Mara. \u201cPlay nice,\u201d Mara warned. Thankfully Lily seemed to notice Jane\u2019s growing anger, picking up her pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a some walking the group stumbled across a small lake. Deciding not to waste the good fortune, Jane and Mara proceeded to fill up on water. Lily on the other hand paused at the sight of the lake. Something about this area was familiar to her, but she couldn't quite place it. After several scans of the area, the gears started turning in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys we need to leave,\u201d Lily exclaimed in a panicked voice. The other girls quickly stopped what they were doing, turning back to their companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe slime king\u2019s domain is just past this lake,\u201d Lily explained, pointing to the far side of the lake. \u201cI remember coming here to fill up on fluids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's just typical,\u201d Jane complained. \u201cThat is exactly the direction of where our friend\u2019s sister supposedly went.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe might have gotten captured by him,\u201d Mara stated. \u201cWe should probably head that direction and check.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat no, you two said you would keep me safe from the slime king,\u201d Lily cried out in fear. \u201cHe is very strong and dangerous, especially in his domain. We shouldn't go anywhere near it. Besides I haven't even seen anyone head that way. Your friend must have gone around the area.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAll right, we will go around for now,\u201d replied Jane, much to Lilies\u2019 delight. Mara on the other hand, judging from her shocked expression, was not as thrilled from this outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn't we follow our best lead \u2026 ,\u201d Mara began to chide, before being interrupted from a swift finger to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeyword Mara, for now,\u201d Jane reiterated. \u201cWe will check the safer way first, and if we don't find her there we can always try that direction next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if this slime king captured her, she might be in serious danger,\u201d Mara countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason to not head the same direction she did if she got captured. If she got caught the path is mostly likely a booby trapped,\u201d defended Jane. \u201c I know you want to help find the girl, but you cant act with such reckless abandon.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess thats true,\u201d Mara conceited in a low tone. She hadn't really thought about the risk of rushing in, as she was more focused on finding the lost sister then their own safety. Realizing how inexperienced she must have sounded to Jane, she started to feel a bit self conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis internal conflict went unnoticed by Jane, who was busy trying to map out their new path. Making a completely safe path through the woods was challenging, as she could only get small bits of the forrest\u2019s layout from limited information that Lily knew. The slime girl knew that the other path lead straight towards the king\u2019s lair which they would try to avoid for now. She also provided more good insight about some deadly predators that lurked to the East and some more of those addictive trees to the South. It would seem the only direction to head towards was a northern path, so on that note they started to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple strides later they could no longer see the blue shimmering lake through the heavy tree line. Said tree line also prevented much light from reaching the bottom layer of the woods, creating a creepy tone to the path. The eerie atmosphere was only enhanced by the small amount of creatures that lived in this part of the woods, only running into a family of squirrels that enamored Lily for a couple minutes. Mara went back to asking Jane about her own past adventures, partially trying to ignore the ominous environment but also wanting to improve her own skills from hearing about Jane\u2019s past experiences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all changed when the group heard a loud scream in the distance. Jane, ready for trouble as ever, quickly drew her weapons out and started scanning the area. Lily on the other hand, quickly turned back into a puddle of slime out of fear of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that Astra?\u201d Mara exclaimed, dripping with worry. Astra seemed tough enough to be able to survive on the woods by herself, but maybe she ran into this slime king or something even deadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, her house was back that way,\u201d assured Jane, who was pointing her thumb behind them. \u201cThe scream seemed to have come from up ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what are we waiting for,\u201d Mara exclaimed, gathering out her own equipment. After pulling out her staff she started to run to the origin of the scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara wait,\u201d Jane yelled, but it was already too late. The elf girl was already yards ahead of the group, much to Jane\u2019s dismay. She knew Mara was the type of person who would rush to others aid, but out here that can easily lead to danger if you are not careful. With a sigh she turned to the small pond that was her other companion and started poking it with one of the ends of her bow. \u201cCome on Lily, we have to go make sure she doesn't get into trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good distance ahead of them, Mara continued her fast pace in the jungle. While normally she would not be so rash in her decisions, she was too distracted out of concern for the woman in question. Not only that but a nagging worry in her head was starting to get more vocal. Jane seemed like a such a hardened adventurer, while she had never been on an adventure before. The elf\u2019s mind started to betray her with thoughts of Jane wanting to leave the inexperienced girl, as she would just weight the mighty rogue down. Mara wanted to prove to the Jane, she could be a capable assist to her quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some running, Mara could hear a faint cry for help nearby. The voice seemed to be coming from around the next bend, pushing the girl to increase her speed. After turning around the corner\u2026. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Mara rounded the corner, she could finally see where the sounds had been coming from. Just ahead of her laid a passed out girl, who seemed to have collapsed mid way through a bush. The upper part of her body was the only part only visible to elf, giving not a lot of information about the girl in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fallen woman seemed to be wearing commoner\u2019s clothes though a little torn, suggesting she was from one of the towns nearby. There were no weapons nearby, so unless they were still hidden in the bush, it seemed unlikely that they were an adventurer of some kind. Besides the Emerald hair the woman was striking, she seemed to be a typical villager. None of that mattered to Mara of course, who quickly went to try to shake the girl from her slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Hey, miss are you okay?\u201d babbled the elf, hoping she wasn't too late to save the girl. After a couple shakes, fear was starting to creep in Mara as she was yet to get any type of response from the victim. Deciding she couldn't put it off any longer, she went for the girls hands to check for any sort of pulse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as Mara was about to touch the girl, life seemed to spring back into the body as Mara found her arms quickly locked by two strong hands. Before she could even react, the elf found herself being pulled into the bush that the girl was partially laying in. As the mage quickly found herself being detained by roots, she was having second thoughts about being so impatient. After a few seconds, Mara was in the center of whatever she was just pulled into. She proceeded to get holstered up, bound in a star shaped form, giving her a better view of the situation of hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first detail she noticed was the victim, or more accurately her captor, staring at her full of glee, like a little girl who just found a new toy. Now after getting a better look at her it was clear that she was no mere villager, as her skin was completely lime green. Not only that, but now that her lower half was no longer obstructed by the bush, it was clear that her lower body was the bush. Despite her bizarre features, the creature was absolutely gorgeous, with striking dark green eyes, smooth skin, and ample breasts. Mara got so memorized from checking the creature out, she didn't notice the girl start to move towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell well well, looks like I found a perfect toy for me to play with\u201d the creature seductively stated, as she slowly approached the elf. As she advanced towards Mara, parts of the bush started to flow towards the creature. The mass of bush slowly started to transform into a human shaped bottom half for the creature. It would seem the creature took way too much mass to form her new lower half as it was very thick, though this could have easily been intentional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRealizing that the situation was quickly getting out of hand, Mara was about to scream for help but was interrupted by the bush girl gagging her with what looked like a berry. Mara tried to force it out with her tongue, but the berry grew vines to latch itself to her face. A couple seconds after the berry gag secured itself, it started pumping out gas down her throat. After a few hits of the gas Mara was starting to have a hard time concentrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere are my manors I haven't even told you my name. My name is Rose,\u201d the monster stated, growing a few roses in her outfit as if to make a point. \u201cYou my dear are a lucky girl indeed, you get to be my new pet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMara could barely hear what Rose was saying at this point as the second effect of the gas was activating. A strong desire was inching all over her body which desperately needed release. Since she was completely bound at this point however, all she could do was moan in frustration and give a pleading look to her capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDam that was fast,\u201d boasted Rose, as she examined Mara, \u201c My newest batch is definitely a huge success so far.\u201d She began to start groping Mara\u2019s body to size her up, only continuing to torment the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease\u2026.\u201d Mara tried to mumble though the gag. At this point she wasn't even asking to be let go, she just needed release from all this lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBe patient my dear we will have our fun,\u201d reassured Rose. \u201cAs long as you follow my instructions and please me you will get rewarded. Your assets are still a little small for my taste however, we will have to fix that when we get to my place. Maybe we can make a fun game out of it pet, would you like that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMara nodded her head , earning her a reward by Rose\u2019s skilled finger work. Euphoria overwhelmed the mage for a couple seconds, who let out a mini spasm form the release of all that pressure. The relief was short lived sadly, as Rose quickly removed her fingers while the gas continued to be pumped. Soon Mara was back to groaning in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlready so greedy pet,\u201d Rose teased, as her body shifted into a more mobile form. \u201cFollow my commands and there is more where that came from. Let us get out of here pet, when we get to my place the real fun can begin.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nDawn filtered in through the forest canopy, shining a radiant orange into the bedroom's easternmost window. Mara, as the elf she was, awoke first. The restful night's sleep came as a pleasant change of pace from the past week or so of uncertainty. Warmth filled her whole self. Though the origin of this warmth soon revealed itself as a soft tummy pressed against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's sawing snore only confirmed Mara's suspicions. The rogue began spooning her some time during the night. Not surprising, considering Astra only owned a single bed. A gentle smile spread across her lips, and after brushing a stand of crimson hair from her face, the elf craned her neck back to see the slumbering rogue. Jane's bobbed, raven hair lay in a tousled mess across most of her face, but Mara still saw the slight trickle of drool along the human woman's pillowy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Mara enjoyed the embrace. Her new friend's company assured them both of a comfortable rest. Yet, Mara's smile faded as thoughts of the trials ahead sank in. The lair of the Lipomancer was renowned as dangerous. This would likely be the last bed they slept in for some time. Clearing her throat, Mara gently shook the arm Jane draped across the elf's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBwuh?\u201d Jane groggily shifted, rubbing her eyes sleepily. After wrinkling her nose, she realised her position and scrambled over in bed. \u201cMy bad, Mara,\u201d the rogue grumbled and ran her fingers through her hair. Jane slid off the other side of the bed, wiggling her toes as she stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you are quite cute when you sleep,\u201d Mara mused, rising to her own side of the bed. She quickly tied up her hair in a ponytail. \u201cDo you think Astra is awake yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane shrugged lightly and pulled on her leathers. \u201cDon't know. She did promise to help us,\u201d Jane said, fastening her utility belt. Mara tied up her tunic, and with a wave of her hand, her enchanted staff slowly glided across the room into her waiting hand. Jane opened the room's door with a creak, and inhaled the scent of a hearty breakfast. \u201cMmm, seems she's expecting us. Last one there gets to clean up the dishes!\u201d Jane laughed and dashed toward the living and dining area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree steaming plates lay set at the modest, wood table. Each carried abundant servings of crispy bacon, cheesy eggs, and buttery toast. A small bowl of freshly-picked berries accompanied each plate. Jane licked her lips as a low growl gurgled up from the depths of her paunch. She heard a rumbling reply film behind as Mara entered the main room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear you've brought your appetites,\u201d Astra beamed as she entered from the kitchen. \u201cI may not fight as well as you two, but I cook as well as I build.\u201d While drying her hands on a dish towel, the hostess motioned for them to sit. Jane eagerly zipped into the closest chair, flashing Mara a mischievous grin. The mage curled her lips to the side, faced into the kitchen, and conjured an unseen servant to tackle the small mound of dirty pots and pans. \u201cOh! How thoughtful, thank you.\u201d Astra bowed her head before joining Jane at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to thank me, Miss Astra,\u201d Mara lifted her chin in feigned grandeur, \u201cwe ought to set out soon after we dine. Any expedience only aids in our quest.\u201d With that said, another growl rose from her plush middle, and Mara hurried to her seat in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio ate quietly, and the unseen servant finished tidying up the dishes and even dusted the hall by the time they were ready to depart. With rations packed, they set out into the mid-morning light. Thankfully the forest remained cool beneath the shaded canopy. As they traveled they each shared tales from their childhoods, but by noon, they came upon a broad clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d Astra paused and reached into her backpack, \u201cI hoped to use these if I ever found my sister out here, but I think they will serve you better.\u201d From within, the guide produced a pair of amulets on chains, each crafted in the shape of a simple face. Mara smiled and accepted the gift, but Jane, ever the skeptic, placed a gloved hand on the elf's forearm before she could raise it over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Jane asked as she dangled the amulet before her. Astra smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSending Stones. If you grasp it and imagine the face of whomever wears the twin amulet, you may send them one message of up to thirty words,\u201d she explained. Resting a hand on her hip, she stretched forth her other strong arm and pointed across the clearing. \u201cBeyond the tree-line you'll find an entrance surrounded by pools of that lovely sap,\u201d she mentioned with more than a little bitterness in her voice. A light slap to her flabby middle emphasised her point. \u201cDon't worry, some of that special fruit was mixed in with the berries, you haven't anything to fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nodded and looped the chain over her head, letting the amulet fall to her chest. \u201cWe can't thank you enough, Astra.\u201d Jane extended a hand toward their guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFind my sister,\u201d the buxom builder replied, clapping her palm into a firm handshake, \u201cthat's all the thanks I need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay the forest protect us,\u201d Mara spoke with bowed head, \u201cAll of us.\u201d Her silvery eyes met Astra's, and with that the two left their guide and struck out into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from breaking a sweat frustratingly early, the pair made good time teaching the second tree-line. That is, until they were ambushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeize them!\u201d A dozen men and women in bronze boar masks descended upon the hapless adventurers. Whirling about, Jane drew her daggers and widened her stance, sending her belly wobbling just slightly. However, the duo's increased girth didn't slow them down enough to be subdued easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegone, vile fiends!\u201d Mara shouted and slammed her staff into the ground, blasting back four of the assailants. One crashed into a tree, crumpling into a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane wasted no time in engaging several others, slashing her dagger across one arm, and burying the second into another cultist's thigh. The masked man howled and fell back as the others converged. \u201cThat all you got, freaks?!\u201d She snarled. Even with the women's impressive skill, the number of foes proved too much. One of the masked women at the rear brought out a blowgun and fired a dart at Mara's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYowch!\u201d She squeaked, hopping up. Jane rushed to her friend's side, arms wide defensively. Mara dropped a hand to Jane's shoulder, trying to steady herself. \u201cJane\u2026 I--\u201d but before she finished, Mara collapsed to the grassy forest floor. Jane stood over her friend, uncertain what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door slowly creaked open. The two looked for any sign of who or what opened the door, but could find no presence. All they were met with was a long hallway that ran until meeting an intersection of doors. While it seemed strange that no one was present, curiosity had gotten the better of the two as they slowly entered the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the hallway, they quickly noticed a huge difference of the house\u2019s inside from its outside. The interior appeared to be made of completely different material then the outside of the building. The walls were a lot brighter and way more colorful then the mysterious material from outside. However, one thing the exterior and interior seemed to share was its emptiness. Besides the doors down the hall, the room lacked any objects or decorations to indicate anything about the owners of the house, if the house even had owners. The girls were starting to get creeped out going down the barren hallway, wondering if they had made a mistake to come here. As the two reached the end, they yet again found another door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before Mara and Jane proceeded through the open door, this time finding themselves in a less creepy room. While still very bright and colorful as the hallway, this room at least had some furniture. A cherry red bench with fluffy pillows, a very full bookcase and an empty coat rack populated the left side of the room. The right of the room was mostly occupied by a large table, but still had enough room for an oil lamp in the corner. While a good change of pace from the empty hallway, the room continued to support the no one lives here anymore claim. The bookcase was full of dust, the coat rack was empty and the bench looked like it hasn't been used in a while. As the pair scanned the room Jane finally spotted some sign of life, a letter perched on the table. She began to read the letter out loud, hoping to get some explanation on the whereabouts of the owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Guests,<br>\r\n\tSince you have found this safe house, you assumedly are a fellow member of the merchants guild following the map we have given you. As you were told before, this safe house is to be used in dangerous circumstances such as storms, bandits, or injuries during travel. There is plenty of food to last a while in the larder, a well out back for water, and beds upstairs. Make sure to notify any guild hall which house you stayed at, so we can restock supplies if needed. If you not in the merchant guild we politely ask if you would vacant the premise. Realistically we know that this is unlikely, so we politely ask you to leave the place as it was before you came and notify the guild so we can resupply the location. Safe travels friend.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tSigned,<br>\r\n\tMerchant GuildMaster Karn<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cHuh, never knew the merchants guild had safe houses,\u201d Jane admitted. \u201cIf I rob Karn again I should look for that map, could be handy in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou robbed from the merchants guild?\u201d Mara exclaimed. \u201cAre you crazy, they hold serious grudges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you get caught they do, but I'm a professional,\u201d Jane boasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are very professional,\u201d Mara jested as she proceeded to poke Jane\u2019s gut, getting a glare from the rogue. \u201cSo why did you rob him anyway, was he a nasty person or did he just have a good stash?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he was pretty nice, and most of his wealth wasn't at that house,\u201d Jane rebutted. \u201cHe was just a victim of bad luck. He happened to buy a sword that, unknown to him, was stolen from my family. The heist was pretty easy all things considered. Waited for him to go on a business trip, snuck past some guards, and snagged the sword with no one the wiser. Well, almost no one. I did have to convince an adorable 5 year old girl, I was fairy and that she couldn't tell anyone about me if she wanted her wishes to come true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat little girl must have some warped perception of fairies now,\u201d Mara joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I could totally be a fairy, I certainly have the looks,\u201d Jane argued, striking a pose. \u201cAnyway, looks like we have a good base of operations or at least shelter for the night. Let us see if we can find any goodies in this place.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou are being too paranoid Mara,\" Jane argued. While normally Jane would have agreed with Mara on this being strange, she was just too hungry to think straight. \"I'm gonna go eat some free breakfast, you are welcome to join in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note the hungry Rogue approached the box of goodies, and what a box it was. Wherever this box was going it seemed to be for a rich client as the box was full of loads of different types of food. The box contained almost every type pie, ranging from blueberry to pumpkin to apple and many more flavors. There were massive four layer cakes, rich with frosting; the likes of which Jane had only ever seen at some weddings she crashed. Scattered around the box were little bags of cookies. From a quick glance, the rogue spotted chocolate and ginger cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hunger pain quickly snapped Jane out her gaze of awe, and back to the moment at hand. She decided on starting with an apple pie, being a favorite from her childhood. With one bite she was hit by a huge wave of pleasure. This was one of the most delicious pies she had ever eaten. With the next bite the same rush of pleasure hit her, quickly followed by another and another as she continued eating. Being continuously hit with this buzz was starting to overwhelm her. So lost in this feeling she didn't notice herself slowly losing control of her body, almost like she was being shifted to the passenger seat. Yet all these changes went unnoticed by her timid elf companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel Jane?\u201d Mara nervously asked. While a little miffed at the rogue not listening to her concerns, she still hoped her companion was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm perfectly fine,\" Jane replied in a closely monotone voice. The rogue proceeded to toss a bag of cookies to Mara. \"You should try some, they are pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still a little skeptical about the whole situation, Mara too succumbed to her stomach's demands. With Jane's seal of approval and her growing hunger she decided there was no harm in trying some. Just like with Jane, as soon as Mara took a bite she was hit by a wave of bliss. She quickly went for her second cookie followed by her third, rapidly emptying the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever unlike Jane, having a background in the arcane arts, Mara sensed the weird force try to take control of her. Euphoria from the food was soon matched with panic, as the elf realized she was right about the box. As she turned to her companion to try to warn them to stop eating, she was hit by another bag of cookies. Although her mind wanted to ignore the bag, her body on the other hand seemed to not share this interest. Mara found herself going to town on the new bag, with new waves of gratification hitting her. More bags found there way over to the elf, who eventually after many bags was drained of her power to fight back. She too was locked away by the same prison of pleasure Jane was trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely under the boxes spell, Mara dragged herself over to the food pile next to Jane. Jane, who now wore a blank expression, was still munching down on the pies. Mara proceeded to join her friend in feasting as she picked up some more food to devour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes went by and the two girls seemed to not make a dent in the pile. The food however was making quite the dent in the girl's figures. Jane gained a lot of extra chub all over her body but some areas got more love then others. Her former pot belly was now transformed into a muffin top, her thighs were thicker having gained some extra blubber, and her cup size increased from B to a C. Mara on the other hand seemed to continue her strange hourglass expansion. The elf's breasts now were almost the size of melons and her butt seemed to extend out a little more then before. She was not totally in the clear however, as she did now sport a minor gut that seemed to growing by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese gains were lost on the two girls who were still too overwhelmed by pleasure to notice anything. As time goes on ....</span></div></div>",

As much as the two girls tried to suck in their guts to squeeze through, they could not make it. Jane cursed herself for getting so out of shape from the inn, she could have easily made it through before. Not only that but with all the time they wasted, the voices were now all around them. Any chance of fleeing this confrontation was eliminated. After one last desperate try, Jane realized they would have to unfortunately fight their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope you know how to fight, because that is our only option now,\u201d Jane stated, as she prepared herself for battle. She quickly looked around for some kind of defensive position, sadly finding nothing sufficient enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can hold my own,\u201d Mara replied boldly. She took out her staff, and assumed a defense stance near the rock wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mara tried to hide her fear, Jane could easily sense Mara\u2019s nervousness from her periodic shivers. To be fair to the girl, she was dreading this confrontation as well. While Jane was not a stranger to fighting, she generally preferred to sneak by her foes. Even when she was forced into fighting, she always could scope out her enemy first or use her bow to thin the ranks out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this time everything seemed to be against her. The position they were in was poor, stuck in-between the woods and a rock wall. The forest was very thick, making her foe\u2019s location and numbers unknown to her. Without information about her enemy, her bow would be too risky to use. Her companion as far as she could tell, had not been in many or any fights before. With a sigh, the rogue pulled out her twin daggers and readied herself for one hell of a scuffle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no calm before the storm as the sound of nearby leaves rustling was shortly followed by people emerging. Despite not exploring the town much, the two girls could easily tell the individuals before them were from Little Silverhorne as many, if not all of their attackers were very fat. There seemed to be twelve of them as far as the girls could tell, but possibly more in the woods. Four members of that group came with what seemed to be guard attire, while the others only had pitchforks. As soon the group spotted the two girls, they grew small smirks on their face, clearing any doubt that they were here for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting them to get the chance to prepare or call for back up, Jane rushed straight into their group. Deciding that taking out the weaker ones first was her best option, she rushed one of the pitchfork wielding villagers. While a little slower from her gain in the town, she was still insanely quick, easily able to get the jump on her victim. With two quick strikes, her foe was knocked out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the townsfolk along with Mara were initially surprised by her attack, they quickly regrouped. Two of the guards now headed straight towards Jane, while six of the pitchforks charged at Mara. The remaining villagers seemed to just watch, as if they were waiting for something to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane, concerned for the vastly outnumbered Mara, started to make her way back over to the elf. She didn't make it far as the two guards now blocked her path. The guards both took a couple swings at the rogue with their swords, which the rogue easily dodged. Not only were their attacks slow from their weight but they were very sloppy, as if they had not done much training. With the next swing, Jane dodged under one of the guard\u2019s legs, proceeding to give a flurry to his exposed back. With a splash of blood, the guard fell. His comrade, now a tad angry, proceeded to avenge his friend before being hit by a flying villager, knocking him back a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane\u2019s confusion of this odd occurrence was put to rest as she turned back to her companion. Only three of the villagers who went after Mara were still present. Two were in various trees around the area and the third presumably knocked out her foe. The elf herself was currently muttering some kind of incantation, before releasing a burst of energy. Another villager was put on a free trip to painsville, as she flew several feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a few foes left, Jane was very hopeful that they could get out of this mess. That was until a familiar smell entered her nose. Fear spread across her face as she turned towards the stationary group, noticing a new member. The inn\u2019s waitress was now present, standing in front of the group with a huge amount of food in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was definitely the same cursed food from the inn, as she could already feel her mouth drooling. Jane\u2019s short time away from the inn seemed to not cure the curse, as she found herself slowly approaching the food. Behind her she could hear a cry of no, with the sound of tears shortly following. Mara as well was slowly being dragged by her body towards the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls eventually made their way over to the waitress. Without a seconds notice, the two went to town devouring any of the food they could reach. They did not eat for long though, as two quick strikes to the back of their heads knocked them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later, Jane groggily awoke with a splitting headache to an unfamiliar environment. She found herself on a bed, with a still unconscious Mara, in some large basement. Besides a huge table in the center and a staircase on the side, there was not much else to the room. As Jane recovered a little more, she swore she could hear the sounds of glasses, almost like a\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was now very wide awake. Knowing what would come soon the rogue quickly turned to Mara, attempting to wake her from her slumber. \u201cMara please wake up, we have to get out of here now,\u201d Jane begged as she shook Mara. While the elf slowly awoke from her forced nap it was not soon enough, as the door from the stairs opened. Dread filled the rogue as several waitresses came down the steps, each carrying large portions of food. After placing their food on the table, all of the group except for one member went back up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara now finally awake was able to take in her surroundings. As soon as she noticed the food and the waitress in front of her, she began to panic. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t be back here. I just got out of here,\u201d Mara cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning girls, breakfast is served,\u201d the waitress replied with a cheerful voice. To the girl\u2019s dismay, their bodies slowly forced themselves over to the huge pile of food. As soon as they sat down at the table, they quickly began to start their forced meal. Mara began sobbing as she began to wolf down some pancakes. Jane herself was tearing up, as the reality of the situation kicked in. Yet again they were trapped in the food induced hell and escape was unlikely a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush don\u2019t cry girls,\u201d the waitress continued with a sultry voice. \u201cWe know you two only ran away because we didn't feed you girls enough. Don't you two worry, we won\u2019t make that mistake again. I\u2019m gonna give you girls all of my attention and make sure you eat plenty.\u201d With that, the waitress left the two girls to their meal. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I came across a Magic Academy and became a Mage. I had just completed my studies and heard of the Lipomancer and his treasure. I did my research and set out for his lair, stopping at the inn to rest and... well, you know the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm Jane, and heard the lair was nearby, stopped there for food and was trapped too,\" Jane said simply, not wanting to tell Mara about her rogue ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was ready for adventure,\" Mara said, \"I'd trained for so long, but the food numbed my mind, I couldn't use magic or leave,\" Mara explained, \"If you didn't rescue me I'd still be feasting, probably till I couldn't move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about anyways, back at the inn? Who the hell were those people?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Followers of the Lipomancer. You saw the other women, all of them were fat, whether of their free will or not,\" Mara answered Jane, aware of those devoted to the Lipomancer and their ways, \"At least when I return home I have... 'proof' of my adventure...\" Mara said, squishing her large breasts together in an effort to inject some levity into such a gloomy conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is true,\" Jane couldn't help but smile a little at the elf's attempt to lighten the mood, \"We do need to move out at dawn though, we have no supplies and the exact location of the lair is unknown right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Mara said releasing her tits and allowing them to jiggle, the engorged mammories so swollen that they threatened to burst from her too-tight clothes, \"We should rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Jane fell asleep and wasn't awoken until the chubby elf was shaking her, telling her she found something.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jane, something weird is in the forest,\" Mara said, a look of confusion on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The rogue answered, a bit dazed from her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just have to see,\" and with that, the two headed deeper into the woods until Jane was met with possibly the most unexpected sight: A small festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What the hell is a fair doing here?\" Jane asked, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I haven't gotten close but it seems like no one is here despite there being recently lit candles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara was right. No one was in sight but the small pavilion was well maintained. Many striped tents were strewn about the forest path, as well as torches, booths, and even a small fenced-in area for animals. Yet there were no signs of life anywhere from either man nor beast. The fair seemed completely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll we need supplies so let's have a look,\" Jane said, getting to her feet and heading into the center of the fair. The two explored the various outdoors attractions, but nothing of use was to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's here,\" Mara said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we haven't searched in there,\" Jane pointed at the central tent, above which were the words \"Freak Show\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked into the tent, pushing aside the entry flaps as they stepped through to the interior, \"So just what is a 'Freak Show' anyways?\" Jane asked as the two continued through a hallway, letting the flaps close behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never heard of them? I'm not too surprised I guess, they used to be very popular across the lands, especially the Imperium after its collapse,\" Mara explained as they walked past sections of walls made if glass that looked into where the freaks would presumably be kept... if any were here. The place seemed deserted just like the rest of the fair. Above each pane of glass seemed to be plaques of wood where the names of the attractions would presumably be, but oddly enough each one was scratched beyond being legible. Each of the rooms they had seen looked like they had various furniture inside, including containers that might have useful supplies inside, but each and every one of the doors they came across thus far were closed and locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara continued, regardless of the chill she felt running up her spine at seeing the vandalized plaques, \"You don't really see them these days, at least not here in Bitemarsh, but back then they were kind of like travelling shows. They were really depraved and cruel though, I mean they kind of had to be, they were essentially created from the decadence of a fallen empire. They pretty much put those who were either malformed from birth, accident, or magic on display, or sometimes just people with unusual physical characteristics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like fat people?\" Jane said, looking back at the mage as she quirked her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, erm, yes. Usually people with girth are considered wealthy, well-off, or even lazy. After what happened in the old empire though, that changed somewhat for their culture... how did you know anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving looked through and walked past the various empty rooms, Mara and Jane came across the first named freak room, and once Mara had read its plaque Jane didn't need to say another word. Above the door was the word \"fattest lady.\" Looking through the glass, Jane saw a large bed big enough for four and a very big dining table. The two adventurers shared a nervous glance, Mara grabbing her curved belly in her hands subconsciously as they both pondered the implications of this. The door to the room was open however, unlike all the others, and the chance to search for goods was too much for Jane to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Might be something in here,\"</i> Jane thought. She walked inside the room as Mara looked around outside, the elf apparently too spooked by the sign to join her investigation and noticed that the glass was one way in this room. In here the glass wall was a mirror from the inside reflecting herself and the room. As she searched Jane didn't notice the door quietly shut and lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up from looking under the bed and put a hand on what remained of her leather armor: It felt even tighter than it did before somehow. Suddenly, Jane heard faint, tittering laughter, its tone feminine and mischievous, yet also haunting as it echoed hollowly through the room. Immediately the rogue's eyes were drawn to the two-way-mirror, the only possible source of the noise, and as she looked at the mirror in terror, she realized she had begun gaining weight impossibly fast. Her stomach was clearly bigger, her ample hips and butt pushed her armor to the limits and her comparatively smaller breasts were also swelling larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange laughter rang through the air once more, and Jane suddenly felt extremely self-conscious as the straps of her armor burst apart to reveal the pale, fleshy belly beneath as it continued to bloat. She ran to the door, feeling a rip down the middle of her leather pants as she did. She tried the door but it was horrified to find it was locked, \"Mara! Help!\" She yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara hadn't seen what was going on in the other room, having been too busy searching through a nearby stack of crates. As soon as Jane's screams had reached her pointed ears however, the mage leapt into action and ran for the door, her eyes widening and her heart pounding with fright as she saw a panicking and already fatter Jane on the other side of the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane could hear the sound of footsteps and after the door handle rattled from Mara's own attempts to open it, she heard the elf's voice, \"Jane! Hold on, I'm going to get you out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara's mind was racing, trying to figure out the best options. The fastest way to get Jane out of the room would be to simply blow the door open with a spell, which wouldn't be too hard for the experienced wizard. It might be dangerous for the rogue however, especially considering the small room she was in left very little space to take cover from the explosion. Alternatively, Mara had noticed what seemed to be an office at the end of the hallway that could very well hold a key to the room Jane was locked in, but the fattening rogue had precious little time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment, Jane heard Mara shout from the other side of the door, her reply comforting the helpless rogue whatever it was...</span></div></div>",

God,\" Jane wheezed, looking down at herself. She was now fat. Her stomach hung just below her crotch now and her leather pants and tunic had ripped apart completely, leaving her in her underwear. Strangely, she noticed that while she was fatter her breasts hadn't got saggy as they grew with fat, but instead they remained perky and round. Jane looked to weigh 300 pounds now and Mara looked about 250 pounds. Mara had gained mostly in her boobs and belly, her breasts also perky and bigger than Jane's, though her stomach was much smaller than Jane's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so heavy...\" Mara groaned., \"Hold on,\" She waved her arms and Jane felt the mage's magic energy coursing through her like a chill, though one that felt oddly comforting. The rogue suddenly didn't feel heavy any longer, smiling as she lifted her arms and flexed them, finding the extra fat to no longer be nearly as much a burden as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A strength spell,\" Mara said, regaining her breath. Suddenly the duo became aware of the large castle looming ahead of them on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lair of the Lipomancer.</span></div></div>",

The rogue was growing at an incredible rate, looking to be ballooning about two pounds every second. Tearing her eyes away from the glass, Mara began running up the hallway towards the office at the end of the freak show tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the \"fattest lady\" room, Jane was grabbing onto the end of the large table for support, her rapidly expanding girth throwing her off balance and the unrelenting weight gain giving her chubby legs no time to adjust. Another loud groan came from her armor as a new tear formed down the side of her large thighs. At this point her belly overhung her crotch slightly and rolls could be seen forming as the small remains of the armor on her stomach gave up. Her large butt wobbled as more flesh was magically deposited on her once thin ass and her breasts, which had always been small, were growing larger and stretching the upper part of her armor painfully as they filled out. All Jane could do was hold onto the table and stare at the mirror in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the room, Mara had finally reached the office and was met by a rather small room with huge piles of sheets on and around a wooden desk. She walked to the desk to see if the key was in one of its drawers, but her eye was drawn to a flyer on the desk. The flyer was an advertisement of sorts for the fair, an illustration showing the very room Jane was trapped in and in the picture was the fattest woman Mara had ever seen. She was on the large bed filling nearly all if it out and looked to weigh a ton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have to get that key before Jane ends up like that,\"</i> Mara thought, a bead of sweat trickling down her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she still wasn't nearly as fat as the girl in the drawing yet, things were becoming bad for Jane. Her clothes gave up the ghost as the final parts of her armor tore off with a rip, leaving her standing in her underwear. Jane was barely able to keep herself upright, even as she bent over the table, her rolls of fat pushing into its edges and her breasts (which mysteriously remained round and perky) were getting close to being able to rest on her stomach. Her rump and thighs remained only just smaller than her stomach by comparison and were gradually reducing her panties to a thong now, and with an almost bare and much thicker ass facing the one-way-mirror, the rogue felt a rush of humiliation coursing through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry Mara!\" Jane yelled as her grip slipped on the table and she crashed to the ground, sending her doughy body into a quivering mess, the feminine laughter growing louder and filling Jane with even more shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Mara exclaimed as she examined the golden key in her hand, the elf finally able to find it in one of the drawers. She couldn't be sure if it was the right one, but she didn't have time and hoped that all the rooms in the tent used the same locking system. She went bounding out the office towards the room, but was stopped almost instantly by a ghostly female voice coming straight from thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no...\" she heard it say, its voice patronizing and mocking as it let out its lunatic laugh once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara was about to ignore it and head down the hall once again, but suddenly felt a restriction in movement as her clothes slowly began to grow tighter, \"Oh gods...\" Mara managed, looking down to see her bust line swelling outward and just beyond that a pale orb of flesh was visible as her dress gave out, tearing right down the middle, \"Not me too!\" Mara groaned as she herself started rapidly filling out with fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing elf mage ran as fast as possible down the hall, every inch of her body bouncing with new blubber. Finally she got to the room where Jane was trapped and was horrified to see the human on her back, clothes ripped and underwear under incredible strain as her ever-enlarging behind reduced more of her panties and her breasts flowed over her bra, the string about to snap. All in all she must be 800 lbs by now, while Mara looked about 500 lbs herself. It seems whatever curse was causing the two to gain weight, it desperately didn't want Jane escaping, probably explaining how Mara was growing so fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara slotted the key into the hole and heard a click as she turned it and it unlocked. She flung the door open and ran to her burdened ally, \"Jane!\" Mara yelled at the immobilized woman before her. Just as Mara neared to help her up, a thunderous scream shook the room and the tent beyond, a raging, wailing voice shrieking, \"NOOOO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe howl echoed throughout the fair and a violent wind swept up into the room, the two girls covering their faces as their long hair whipped around in the turbulent gale. Before the screaming ended the two corpulent girls collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they regained consciousness they found themselves...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mara let out a groggy groan as she put her soft hands on her eyes and rubbed them. She remembered a blurry memory of Jane yelling for help, her running for a key, and then getting fat herself before collapsing. The whole memory seemed too awful to be true, but simply looking down at her body was enough to confirm that it was real. She was met with the two large orbs of fat her breasts had become and just beyond that the layers and rolls of her large stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara tried struggling to her feet, but sitting up from her current position proved nigh impossible. Her huge stomach pushed against her crotch as she tried to sit up and her jiggling boobs were pushed in her face. With audible effort, she rolled onto her stomach, the stone floor on her exposed and bloated belly making her shiver which in turn made the rest of her jiggle. She got to her feet and found that her thighs rubbed against each other as she walked and her arms pushed out to her sides due to the new-found flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled round to face the mirror, inspecting the damage done to her body. She was about 500 lbs now and her red dress was ripped down the middle, allowing her many belly rolls to hang free. The top of her dress hardly contained her engorged breasts, which threatened to spill out at the slightest provocation, and showed off a bit too much cleavage for her liking. Her dress was much higher now on her backside, only just covering the uppermost part of her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mara felt the new curves of her body and groaned, something on the other side of the room caught her attention. Laying on the floor was Jane, and the weight-altering magics of the room hasn't been kind to her. She was on the floor completely naked except for what looked to be the world's most strained bra and the rogue's stomach was so huge and gravid that Mara couldn't even tell if her panties had snapped off completely, or if they were just buried under all that belly flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara went to Jane as fast as her obese body allowed and leaned over her partner, \"Jane, are you okay?\" Mara asked, concerned for her large friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jane opened her eyes, she was surprised to see a large valley of cleavage and a pretty, fat face framed by long blonde hair, \"Mara?\" Jane asked, confused and hardly recognizing her much rounder friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane tried to move, but found it impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're not going anywhere big girl, stay still,\" Mara said, hiding a grin as she watched the corpulent woman try and roll around. Mara waved her hands until a flash of light rushed into herself and Jane. After a brief prickling sensation flowed throughout their bodies, the two girls immediately felt much less burdened by their ample proportions and Mara helped Jane to her feet now that she could stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mara,\" Jane said, grateful to be mobile, even if her ridiculous size made moving gracefully impossible, \"But what do you mean 'big girl'!? You can talk!\" Jane said taking light of a very... heavy, situation and poking Mara's exposed gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you looked in that mirror?\" Mara replied with a playful grin and pointed a finger towards the mirror, \"You're standing in your underwear!\" Mara added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane felt much more self-conscious as she saw the obese blob of a woman staring back at her in only a tiny bra and panties. The blubbery thief made a vain attempt to cover her exposed... well, <i>everything</i> with her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so embarrassed!\" Mara giggled \"Nudity isn't as shameful a thing to elves! It's actually quite common in paintings and statuary in our culture, so no need to feel like you're being taboo in front of me,\" Seeing that this hadn't comforted the larger girl, Mara added, \"If it's that big a deal, there are probably clothes in there,\" The elf said, motioning towards the wardrobe by the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls searched and found most of the clothes were too big to fit Jane, let alone Mara, though Mara said she didn't need new clothes right now despite the rip in her midsection. After a while they found a smaller dress and underwear so Jane changed into them. The clothes looked good on Jane, even though they hugged her plentiful curves, nicely complimenting them as though their previous owner wore them to show off her body. They grabbed a couple sets of extra clothes in bigger sizes in case the two ended up stumbling into even more situations like the one they'd just been through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't burst out if those,\" Mara joked, poking Jane's huge gut and sending it rippling like a jello mold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just jealous my boobs are bigger than yours now!\" Jane joked back, walking into Mara and pushing her huge stomach and mammaries into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara pushed Jane's bulk off of her, both girls laughing when they realized something: On the table behind them there were mountains of cakes and pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone really wants us to get fat...\" Mara said, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Jane said, frowning as she tapped her chin thoughtfully, cringing once she realized it was more a double chin now, \"I think they might have been meant for me.... It's a good thing you were able to find that key Mara... Otherwise I might have been stuck in this damn room forever and this might have been my dinner... and probably breakfast and lunch from now on too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara looked over at her friend, her eyebrows raising as she heard Jane's stomach growl, \"Bad news, but they might still be. We didn't really bring much to eat on this trip, and I think we're both pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry!?\" Jane shouted, shaking her head but clutching at her stomach as she felt it gurgle again, \"How the hell could we have gotten so fat and not even feel full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empty calories?\" Mara said, grinning sheepishly, \"Seriously though, this magic... or curse, or ghost... whatever it was it only made us fatter, it didn't fill us up with food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Jane said, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, they do look good...\" Mara reasoned, \"They might be like the food back at the inn though... but I don't think food like this, even if it is enchanted or spiked, would add <i>that</i> much more weight to us. We're big girls, we can handle it!\" She said, giggling a bit as she shook her flabby belly in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane smiled and nodded, \"Alright.\" She said, and the two big babes gathered as much food as they could. Too be honest, the two girls also felt a bit of temptation, unable to resist an excuse to eat desserts whenever they wanted. Being hundreds of pounds fatter than they were just hours ago was troubling to say the least, but if there was a silver lining it was the damage was done and now they could let loose a little without worrying <i>as</i> much about their figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fatties left the cursed fair, too focused on their goal to reach the lair of the Lipomancer and his hoard of treasure to notice that the tents and booths had vanished once they were almost out of sight...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane and Mara had been traveling further into the winding forest a few hours now, a feat made possible thanks to Mara's strength spell, and were feeling hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane heard her large stomach growl softly, she smiled sheepishly as Mara's smaller stomach gave an equally loud growl. \"Guess big girls need a bit more to eat than we thought.,\" Jane said, slightly embarrassed that she was starving after a few hours of slow walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and slim lithe things like myself need to eat too, believe it or not,\" Mara joked, striking a pose that stuck her over-sized breasts out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gave out a laugh as her large friend pulled her \"sexy girl\" pose, \"Okay, let's find a place to rest and make camp.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two weighed-down adventures went off to find wood for a fire, but came across a new issue. Jane bent over to reach sticks she had spotted, but she found herself unable to bend far enough to touch or even see her toes, let alone grab twigs. Embarrassed, the flabby thief rose back up, careful not to lose her balance, and turned to her eleven friend who was looking for fuel behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Mara... can, er, can you help me with something?\" Jane asked nervously, afraid her jovial friend would mock her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up? Clothes didn't rip, did they?\" Mara said with a mischievous grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I... can't reach the sticks...\" Jane half mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara stood still for a moment and burst out laughing. Jane stood with one porky hand holding her other arm, clearly upset at her friend's reaction. After what felt like an eternity of laughter, Mara half-regained her composure, \"I'm sorry Jane, I shouldn't laugh,\" Mara said, trying to sound sincere to cheer up her friend while at the same time trying not to laugh again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can hardly talk! Can you even see your feet past those over-sized crystal balls of yours?\" Jane said, trying to retain some dignity with an insult of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without a problem,\" Mara said irritatingly calmly, bending to pick up some sticks and giving Jane a eyeful of her \"scrying orbs\" in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara grunted as she struggled to reach the twigs though, her stomach and boobs in the way. With a guilty grin she stood up straight, wiping her hands on her clothes befor she weaved them through the air before her and muttered a spell. A blue glow surrounded the wood on the ground before the twigs floated up beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Mara said with a grin, clearly not embarrassed by Jane's own laughter now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked back to their camp, twigs floating alongside them, and made the fire with a bit of further magical assistance, of course. Once the fire was ready and aflame, Mara brought a large wedding cake out of a bag as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, who wants to get fat?\" Jane asked, smiling as Mara sat the cake down next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're hardly going to eat it all, and besides, I haven't had cake since my father banned the chefs from making it. Said I was getting fat. What was he on about?\" Mara said, patting her stomach and grinning at the thought of what her poor father would think if he saw her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had any before,\" Jane said, eyes glued to the large cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, dig in then!\" Mara said, grabbing a slice. Both girls bit down at the same time... and were completely overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food from the fattest lady room was just as magical as the room itself it seemed. The two girls were In a trance with only one instinctual thought able to rise to the surface of their spellbound minds: Eat as much as possible. In minutes, the two girls had somehow nearly eaten the whole cake and it was showing. The food was cursed with a fattening spell just like the room appeared to be, but an even faster one adding on pounds of fat with every bite. The effects were less obvious on Jane thanks to her clothes being a bit too big, though they weren't going to be nearly so loose for longat the rate she was wolfing down cake. Mara's own clothes were tight before, but now she looked ready to burst out. Her huge breasts finally escaped the confines of her dress and, due to her lack of bra, her large mammaries were on show for all the world to see as they bounced free of their confines, but neither of the girls were aware enough to notice much less care about Mara's current state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two growing girls finished the cake and ran to the two other bags of cake and pastries without even a second thought or hesitation. The higher thought-processes of their brains having been all but eliminated by whatever spell had been placed upon the food, the two once-athletic girls behaved like pigs at feeding time, demolishing the contents as they scooped messy handfuls of cake and sweets into their ravenous mouths, looking more like they were inhaling the food than eating it. At 600 lbs Mara's dress ripped down the side to expose the blubbery flesh of her belly and hips, the sudden noise and her slight elven immunity to magic finally breaking her out of the trance. She looked down, shocked by her larger body but quickly putting two and two together to realize what happened. She saw Jane was fatter however and still gorging, filling out her new clothes and already causing them to cling even tighter to her now morbidly obese form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane! <i>Stop</i>!\" Mara yelled, grabbing a cupcake out of Jane's pudgy hand. Jane turned to Mara with glazed-over eyes and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane turned towards Mara with a slightly surprised look as she realised Mara had no intention to eat the cupcake. This surprise quickly turned to anger as whatever possessed Jane realized Mara was free from the food's curse. With surprising speed, Jane slammed her now 900 pound body into Mara's, sending both girls to the ground with a loud boom, dirt and dust flying into the air from the impact of their massive bodies. Mara saw black spots as she hit the ground and struggled for air as Jane re-adjusted her bulk so that her giant behind was on Mara's fat stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane! What are you doing?!\" Mara gasped, the air forced out of her by Jane's ridiculous weight. Before she spoke, Mara knew what was wrong: Jane's eyes were still glazed over and her gaze distant, the tell-tale sign of possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh little elves are always so much trouble,\" Were the words that came from Jane's mouth, although the voice wasn't hers, it had a deeper and more seductive quality to it, \"And elves can never appreciate a real woman...\" Jane said sensually, running a finger over her breasts and down to her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you,\" Jane continued, \"So thin... well don't worry, we will fix that,\" Jane said, a viscous grin on her face with no friendliness behind it whatsoever. Jane turned around, not removing her giant rump from Mara, and grabbed the two large sacks of food, \"Let's add some curves to this elf,\" Jane said, smiling evilly and leaning in so close to Mara's face that her generously bloated breasts touched Mara's slightly smaller exposed ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara began panicking as Jane forced large amounts of food into her mouth, and the food was so good Mara had no choice but to swallow. With each bite, Mara could feel herself growing beneath Jane's bulk. The rogue herself never stopped growing either, Jane taking regular bites out of the fattening food to make herself grow bigger and heavier. Almost the entirety of the two sacks were forced down Mara's throat with Jane's help, and the elf was now on the ground at 800 lbs. Her clothes had ripped completely at this point, leaving her totally naked on the floor. Her breasts were now triple the size of her head, and were so heavy and bloated that they were completely obscuring her view of the rest of her body from her current position. If she could see, she would know Jane was much higher off the ground now thanks to Mara's expansive stomach, and even her butt and hips were becoming so incredibly large and round that they even lifted her incredibly hefty bulk off of the ground. Even lying in her prone state now, Mara could feel her fat-swollen, cellulite-packed thighs crushing against one another, and no matter how far the now morbidly obese elf mage tried to spread them apart, they still seemed to touch and bump against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how monstrously fat the elf girl was becoming however, Jane was still much, much worse, and even though she was growing at half of Mara's rate she was still bigger. Jane finally had hit the half-ton mark at 1000 pounds and her clothes showed it. She had multiple tears all across the clothing she had taken from the fair and her pants had ripped at her gigantic buttocks, putting her strained panties on show as they sunk deep between her blubbery cheeks. Her stomach was a rolling sea of fat, breaking down into a quivering and jiggling mess at the slightest provocation, and her breasts too were large, bigger than Mara's, but still looked small compared to the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Jane, we're going to get trapped here!\" Mara sobbed, unwilling to blast her friend away with magic but fully aware they were both, especially Jane, close to being stuck on the ground. While it was true that the mage could cast another spell to increase their strength, even magic had its limits, and Mara was still an inexperienced spellcaster. The pinned and force-fed elf girl had no idea how many more cakes Jane had left, nor how much weight they could carry even with magical assistance... and even if her spell did work, magic like that was still powerful enough to take a heavy toll on the young mage's mana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter elf?\" Jane said in that alien voice, spitting the world elf like it was an insult, \"Miss your perfect body?!\" She jeered, voice rising in volume as she forced more food down into Mara's gut faster and faster, crumbs and frosting smearing and spilling over the elf's newly-forming triple chin, \"Can't stand the thought of being imperfect like us humans?\" Jane screamed, forcing more food into Mara's overstuffed mouth, no longer eating the food herself anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you stupid elves always <i>hated </i>humanity!\" Jane screamed, nearly choking Mara with the amount of food she was unrelentingly shoving into her. \"You have always mocked us with your perfect, <i>thin</i> bodies and <i>huge</i> tits!\" Jane screamed, actually beginning to suffocate Mara as she gagged, kicking her fat and growing legs. Between Mara's own heavy rolls of fat smother her body, the even fatter rogue sitting on her gigantic gut, and the food that was now blocking her mouth up, the weary elf was starting to grow red in the face, her heart pounding wildly in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are going to be a festival balloon when I'm done with, <i>AHHH!</i>\" Jane was cut off by Mara blasting her back into a tree with incredible force, the spell powerful enough that it slid Mara herself back a couple of feet along the ground. Mara heard a dull thud and then a loud <i><b>CRACK</b></i> as Jane hit a tree and then the ground, a few splinters of wood flying off the tree's bark as the half a ton girl hit it and almost broke the thing into pieces. Mara saw all of this happening for only a moment as she fell unconscious from the amount of power she just had to use combined with the effects of Jane smothering the air from her heavy body, the two girls now lying slumped onto the ground and knocked out...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking over to the tree where she had blasted Jane, Mara was horrified to see that Jane's half-ton form lay on the ground, unmoving. With a loud yelp, Mara waddled over to Jane as fast as she could, the effort of just those few steps leaving her panting. Mara leaned over to look at Jane's face, her breasts pushing into Jane's slightly smaller pair as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Jane,\" Mara gasped out between heavy breaths, \"please be alright. I wasn't trying to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a load groan, Jane opened her eyes and put a hand to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, I feel like i just lost a drinking contest to an orc,\" Jane said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have blasted you like that,\" Mara quickly apologized, \"but Jane, you were possessed by something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing i remember is chowing down on the food we got from that fair,\" Jane said as worry creeped into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever was possessing you made sure I got way more than my fair share of it. Didn't help that it was cursed either,\" Mara said while looking down at her 1,000 lbs body, courtesy of Jane's force feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane finally realized how much larger both she and her comrade had become, and how they had both shredded their garments completely. Her eyes were suddenly drawn downward to gaze at Mara's enormous breasts, which had grown to quadruple the size of her head, capped with huge aerola and nipples that could possibly be used for penetration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was staring, Jane blushed furiously and looked down, only to be met with the sight of her own huge breasts, only half a head smaller than Mara's. She looked up to Mara's face as the safest spot to gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, we really got big didn't we,\" said Jane, \"Might not be a good idea to try and go after this Lipomancer guy when we are already the size of some of his victims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we are already within his sphere of influence,\" Mara said, \"It's highly unlikely we will be able to leave it. I've just never heard of a wizard having such a huge area of an influence. A legendary castle, a large fairground, and even that town farther out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there spells that can prevent people from leaving a large area like that?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara nodded her head sadly while standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That settles it then,\" Mara said, \"We've got nowhere else to go, so lets find that damn castle and take that damn Lipomancer's treasures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jane could respond, a low rumble of thunder made itself known. Jane tried to look up at the sky, but found herself looking straight at Mara's giant breasts. Said breasts were looking strangely tempting, and Jane blushed profusely as she held back an urge to grope her newest friend, not entirely sure where the urge came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mara, can you please step back?\" Jane asked, \"I can't see past you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small \"oh\", Mara stepped back, and then helped her flabby friend get to her feet. Now both of the adventurers could see the storm clouds that had rolled in while they weren't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we better find some sort of shelter. It doesn't matter how much fat we have to insulate us, staying out in a storm is still a bad idea,\" Mara stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oversized duo started moving down the path they were on as fast as they could. Sadly, this wasn't fast at all,as Mara's magical energies were quite taxed giving the two women mobility at all. The weak spell and the sheer size of the pair forced them into a slow wobble that had them stumbling from one side of the path to the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours, the pair finally reached what could possibly pass as shelter from the heavy rain and lightning that had caught up to them. Completely tired out, the sweat and rain soaked bodies of the two obese girls dropped to the floor of their resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls were now inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mara and Jane stood in the middle of a large cave, panting heavily as rainwater trickled out from beneath their abundant rolls of flesh. As lightning flashed outside, the duo thanked their lucky stars that they had managed to find a shelter big enough for them so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we made it out of that storm,\" Jane said after she finally caught her breath, \"It looks really bad out there now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely a lucky break,\" Mara agreed, \"There's so much water out there that we would have slipped on something before long, and then even my magic might not have been able to get us up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might not be able to get up if we sit down here. Featherweight potion or not, we both take up more space than a cart,\" Jane cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud gurgle from her belly emphasized Jane's statement. Mara's belly gave a similar complaint, as while the girls had accumulated most of their size by magic rather than overeating, the magic had gifted them with the hunger to match their engorged stomachs. As the sounds from their bellies echoed deep into the cave, the sound of heavy footsteps made its way to the two girls. Mara began preparing a magic spell, while Jane made ready to tackle whoever was in the cave with them. Then a sultry, feminine voice echoed throughout the cave, sounding closer with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, who do we have here?\" the voice asked rhetorically, \"Two lost travelers, starving and naked, with no one to guide them or take care of them. I'd be a terrible hostess if I left them standing in the receiving room all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shadows of the cave emerged a massively obese succubus that was even larger than Mara and Jane put together. The first part of the demoness to appear were the twin globes of her enormous breasts. Each globe of pale blue blubber was nearly ten times the size of an average woman's head. The orbs jiggled in time with the succubus's slow waddle forward, huge drops of milk spilling from nipples twice the size of a fist with every bounce. Completely dominated by the twin mountains, a belly twice the size of Jane's could just barely be seen dragging along the floor of the cave. Slowly propelling the barely mobile demoness were two legs wider than the stone columns of a temple. Each leg was so overstuffed with blubber that it could barely move past the thigh of the other leg, and even when it did squeeze past, the succubi's womanhood was stimulated to the point of nearly causing the woman to lose her balance from the spikes of erotic pleasure being hammered into her. The huge ball of belly fat slamming into her crotch from the backswing of each step only worsened the issue, causing the  succubus's womanly nectar to add itself to the puddle of milk the woman was already trailing behind her. Atop the woman's mountainous mammaries lay a pair of arms swollen to the point that they could only move from the top half of a breast to the woman's mouth, connected to shoulders that had become nothing more than oversized pillows constantly pressing against her head. The last part of the succubus to come into view was an entire table of ass fat divided into two spheres nearly as massive as her breasts, wobbling with every pleasure inducing step. Overall, the woman easily weighed over a ton, and was happily working towards piling on a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the gargantuan succubus fully emerged from the shadows, she addressed Mara and Jane once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings brave travelers,\" the succubus's huge cheeks and multiple chins jiggled as her seductive voice emerged from deep within her chest, \"Please allow me to provide you with food, shelter, and clothing for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mara and Jane longer than either was willing to admit to drag their gaze from the succubus's breasts and reply to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is most generous of you miss,\" Mara said, \"May we know the name of our gracious host?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, although I will require your names in return. My name is Akasha,\" replied the female fiend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jane, and my friend's name is Mara. Thank you for your aid tonight,\" Jane said while tilting her head in respect rather than bowing, which would have surely been a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that the pleasantries are out of the way, let's get some clothes on you,\" said the succubus as her voice gained a note of enthusiasm, \"I've got one of the latest fashions from the first circle of the abyss just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of the adventurers could protest, the massive succubus was making gestures and speaking short incantations of Abyssal. A cloud of smoke shrouded both girls for a second before falling away to reveal the duo in identical sets of garish red undergarments. Two mirrors nearly twenty feet in length and width popped into existence on opposite sides of the cave shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can take a look at yourselves over there,\" Akasha said, \"I am going to the back to make us a magnificent meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkasha turned to slowly waddle back into the deeper part of the cave, giving Mara and Jane a perfect view of her gorgeous ass that they couldn't turn away from until the gyrating orbs fully disappeared into the shadows. Once their eyes were free, the pair waddled towards the mirrors as fast as they could. Succubi were notorious for their hyper-sexuality, so they would only willingly wear clothes that made them look even sluttier than their preferred state of nudity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara was the first to reach the mirrors and the bra she was wearing unsurprisingly looked as if it was painted onto her breasts rather than containing them. It had certainly felt skin tight when she was waddling over. Written in large letters over each cup of the bra were the words \"Free Nectar,\" and her large nipples were nearly penetrating the thin fabric at the middle of the cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it isn't as bad as I though it would be,\" Mara told her friend, \"I honestly expected there to be holes at the center of this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's much worse, take a look at our panties,\" Jane choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane had cleverly utilized the double mirror technique to see what her new panties looked like, but had instantly regretted it. The panties were in fact large enough to provide a proportionally normal amount of coverage, but for an extremely raunchy purpose. In the same large lettering just below the top of Jane's cheeks were the words \"Minimum manhood requirement: Are you worthy?\" Below the letters was a picture of an absurdly large cock painted in black across the majority of the red fabric. At least four feet long, another foot wide, and covered in swollen veins, the image was obviously meant to be an accurate estimate of how large a man would need to be to fully penetrate and pleasure the Rogue's behemoth butt. Even more obscene was the fact that the picture was magically animated, with the veins pulsing to an unheard beat, and droplets of liquid larger than most men's entire load pooling at the puffed up head and spilling down the massive member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, that's pretty bad,\" Mara said while blushing at the lewdness of their new clothing, \"But I can't even reach far enough to get them off. I think we are stuck with these for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair sighed in acceptance, the unmistakable smell of well cooked meats and freshly baked pastries wafted through the cavern. Their bellies rumbled as they were reminded of their unfed state by the tantalizing scent. Turning away from the mirrors, Mara and Jane began to slowly lumber into the inner cavern. What would have taken most people seconds took ten minutes for the blubbery beauties, and by the time they reached Akasha's feasting room, the pair were exhausted. However, even exhaustion couldn't keep their amazement at what had been prepared for them at bay. In the middle of the torchlit cavern, two great tables made of dwarven steel were overflowing with meats, pastries, candy, ale, and wine. Akasha sat on the ground a few meters away, her enormous tits covered in a similar spread that she was rapidly diminishing. Seeing that her guests had arrived, Akasha momentarily paused in her feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for starting without you, I just can't resist my own handiwork,\" Akasha said after swallowing her current morsel, \"Please eat as much as you like, no sense in starving yourselves on the road.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally, at least Jane would have been suspicious of the obviously conjured up and probably enchanted food. Unfortunately, the demands of their stomachs had been increased dramatically by the cursed food from the fairground, and the organs themselves had been engorged significantly, leaving the two girls constantly hungry, if not ravenous. Add the fact that both the presence and voice of a succubus eroded willpower even when a succubus was making light conversation, and it was really no surprise that Mara and Jane basically collapsed upon the first table and began devouring everything that wasn't buried under their fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair may not have been experienced gluttons, but they made up for it with natural talent. Each girl encircled enough food to feed a family with their pillowy arms and dragged it into comfortable eating range. Then the pair proceeded to grab a different item with each hand and began alternating bites between the morsels unlucky enough to be the first grabbed. The second a hand was empty, it was reaching back down for a new treat. After they ran out of food within their feeding circle, they reached out and repeated the process. The only reasons the girls didn't start fighting over who got what were that both girl's favorites were different,  and that they were slowly moving in opposite directions around the table. Mara had not had much experience with meat before leaving elf country, and the wonders of cooked animal flesh had completely enthralled her. Jane on the other hand, was from a rather poor background like most rogues, and was thus focusing on the sugared and stuffed pastries. Neither Mara nor Jane went without more than a fair share of each kind of food on display, from pies bursting with filling, to slabs of fresh chocolate, to overstuffed sausages fatter than their arms that were gulped down by the chain in a manner that would have made Akasha jealous if she had been watching. All of these were washed down with excessive amounts of alcohol, although it failed to intoxicate them due to their extreme size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor over an hour the two girls continued to binge, every part of their bodies swelling with new fat as enough enchanted food to feed a village for weeks was absorbed into their girth. The only break in their feasting came when they had to switch to the second table. Once every scrap of food had been devoured, each girl slowly stood from the second table, their taut, overstuffed guts resting on the floor. However, a burning sensation soon made itself known in their mouths, and beganm to grow stronger as they lay there. Unknown to them, Akasha had quietly used magic to heavily spice the last few scraps the girls had shoveled down their maws. With all the alcohol gone, the girls eventually had to ask for the only source of liquid left in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akasha, some of that stuff was a bit strong for me, my mouth is on fire,\" Mara said while trying not to offend their host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have more drinks?\" Jane asked outright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more my friends, that's what these lovely things are for,\" Akasha answered while thrusting her breasts out proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two women could say anything more, Akasha had quickly heaved herself in front of them, and had forced one of her nipples into each of their mouths. Both women began to greedily suckle her as thick, creamy milk gushed into their mouths. The two girls moaned in delight as the warm milk soothed their tongues. Then the taste hit and kept them drinking. A nearly overwhelming sweetness, almost like liquid sugar, was present in the succubus's milk. With every gulp of milk they swallowed, the girls ballooned even larger, their bellies softening despite the strain from their contents. Their breasts and butts bulged outwards by several inches with each passing second, forcing Akasha's own fat balloons higher as she fed them. No part of them was left untouched by the fattening liquid. The girls were aware of what was happening to them, but the taste of the milk, along with Akasha's aura convinced them to ignore it. The milk finally ran dry several minutes later, much to the disappointment of all. Mara and Jane reluctantly released her, and stepped back to give themselves room. However, as they were unaccustomed to their new size, they both stumbled and lost their balance. Arms flailing uselessly, they toppled backwards and fell onto the tables. A terrible squeal came from the overburdened metal as the tables strained to hold their new loads. As hundreds of pounds of butt and thigh blubber oozed over the edges, and huge bellies slammed into crotches, both girls orgasmed from the violent compression of their sensitive new flesh. Their enormous breasts cascaded over the front of their guts, adding to their pleasure. The resulting shudders from their climaxes sent their bodies into wild jiggles and gyrations. Their love juices gushed from beneath their bellies as they lay on the raised tables, the entirety of their massive, lewd bodies presented to Akasha like pigs at market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls struggled on the tables, trying to lift themselves up. Their efforts were wasted though, as even without the impending food coma from their gorging, the pair were simply too fat for Mara's magic to support them. All they accomplished was sending more ripples through their oceans of flab. Between groans of post gorging pleasure and gasps for air, the pair managed a few words to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I think we fell for another trap Jane,\" Mara gasped out between labored breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gave it away?\" Jane asked sarcastically, \"The fact that we are too big to move again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the food was just so wonderful. I didn't want to stop at all,\" Mara said while trying to reach her gut to soothe its grumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, it was definitely worth it, especially that milk. I could drink that stuff all day,\" Jane agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, I've never tasted anything like it back home,\" Mara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Akasha heard the conversation switch to her milk, she waddled to the edge of the tables, eager to sing her own praises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear you girls appreciate the finer things in life. I always find a good draught of milk to be the most pleasurable way to end a meal,\" Akasha said, emphasizing the word pleasurable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can drop the friendly act Akasha,\" Jane said with a sigh, \"We fell for your trap and nearly gorged ourselves into a coma, so if you are gonna drag us away to a sex dungeon to fatten and fuck us for the rest of our days, you had better get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkasha froze, confusion evident on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trap? What trap? I didn't set any traps. I mean sure I got you to drink some milk, but I didn't... oh,\" Akasha rambled protests for a bit before her face fell, \"I forgot to disenchant the food, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying you didn't mean to give us food that would turn us into land whales?\" Mara asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see, it's so hard for a succubus to gain weight, let alone keep it on, that I have to heavily enchant all my food with the strongest weight gain magic I could get my hands on. Add the fact that body alteration magic only works half as well when you cast it on yourself, and I can barely gain a few pounds a day,\" Akasha explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the milk, I'll admit that I spiced the last few crumbs of your dinners with magic to get you to try some, but you were just talking about how it was the best thing you had ever tasted,\" the succubus continued, \"Plus, with how big you were when you got here, as well as how eagerly you attacked that feast, I thought that my ideal of beauty was finally catching on. I thought you two would want the extra pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were threatening to spill down Akasha's chubby face by the time she finished. Both immobile adventures began to feel quite guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Akasha, we don't hold it against you,\" Jane said, \"We can't blame you for our lake of restraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not even the fat that bothers us,\" Mara added, \"These tits are pretty awesome to be honest. It's not being able to move that's the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkasha's face brightened instantly at their words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help with that!\" she said happily, \"I learned a super strong mobility spell when I started gaining. It even increases stamina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be really helpful Akasha,\" Jane said, \"How soon can you cast it on us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can cast it tomorrow, once I've digested all of this food,\" Akasha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, we can keep heading towards the Lipomancer's castle tomorrow then,\" Mara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be alright if I joined you?\" Akasha asked, \"Going through his dungeon would easily make me the fattest, sexiest succubus in the world, not to mention the chance to play the ultimate game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ultimate game?\" Both girls asked, confused about what the succubus had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, a drow priestess that stayed here a month ago said that her goddess had told her that somewhere in the Lipomancer's castle, a game of magic, adventure, monsters, skill, and cunning is played,\" Akasha informed the duo, \"Losing leaves you at his mercy, but the reward for winning is the greatest treasure of all, a wish spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wish spell?\" Mara nearly choked when she heard this, \"The Lipomancer can grant wishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, the priestess was quite adamant that Lolth herself told her of the reward. It was all she talked about between her moans of delight, both from feasting and other things,\" Akasha rubbed her thighs together at the memory of all the things she had done with the priestess, and at how big the drow had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wish spell, imagine that Jane, \"Mara said just before her food coma finally overtook her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" Jane yawned before nodding off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting her new friends to wake up stiff, Akasha transformed the tables into giant mattresses before sleep claimed her as well. All three blubbery behemoths were quickly immersed into wild dreams of what they would wish for, with Akasha's aura quietly working away at the rogue and mage who slept beside her.</span></div></div>",

The hut was huge,easily housing  20 people which was bizarre to Mara which she quickly pointed out to her whale of a friend:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Ah who cares anyway Mara? We're both huge and stuck in the rain,nude and tired,if this is a trap then the Lipomancer is crueler then they say,let's just go inside i could fall over at any second...and given my size i don't think i could get up again!'' Jane chuckled to herself still somehow upbeat given the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara was also tired so decided to drop her guard as well,after all that she had been through today surely nothing worse could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way inside and saw that the hut was empty but there was everything that they could need..new fire,beds,healing potions and even clothes and underwear that fit them nicely making Jane  not stare (as much) at Mara's huge chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-''Boy this is a nice change from the stuff we've been through eh Mara?'' Jane said,sitting down on a comfy chair across the fire from Mara who was inspecting the potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-''Yeah i guess so Jane,still i think that it's a bit weird that the Lipomancer has this in his domain...it's weird no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Nah! He's just rewarding those who made it this far! You can't say we deserve a break given our ''situation''! Jane said as she slapped one of her belly rolls to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"I guess,still  i think this has had an effect on you Jane...\" The mage said putting the potions back in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What do you mean Mara?''

I WANT TO GROPE YOU AND FEED YOU AND LOVE YOU AND DO EVERYTHING TO YOU MARA!'' Jane confessed,blushing quite a lot but relieved that she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara was in shock and started blushing also..she didn't expect that.After a bit of thought she says calmly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Jane i think these urges are due quite...special and i can't think of any spell that could make these disappear but i think that these urges don't change a thing between us.We'll keep adventuring just the same.The fact that you told me this means that the Lipomancer doesn't control you now so i know that i can still trust you just the same,best friend.'' The elf said and got up from her chair and hugged Jane for a while and added quickly ''I don't mind you staring anyway.You're my friend Jane and you gotta look if you wanna compare no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was so happy.Mara was such a nice person.She knew that she could trust her with her own life and that she trusted her just the same.She was the first adventuring buddy,no person who Jane had ever trusted so much.She had a massive smile on her face as the hug separated.She'd found a friend and maybe something more...she wasn't sure herself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Thanks Mara,I knew i could tell you anything.You're my best friend.I'll trust you till we die or this quest ends!'' Jane proclaimed to Mara,who also had a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"No problem Jane.But if anything comes up like these urges tell me straight away! The Lipomancer can attack your mind directly when in his domain.\" The elf was relieved.She was still with her friend.She wasn't taken by the Lipomancer as she suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Right well i think we should go rest...we'll need all our energy to move these lard covered bodies to The Lipomancer's Lair tomorrow!'' Jane suggested to Mara and Mara quickly responded with a yawn:''Yeah you're right Jane...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went into different rooms and fell onto their beds and thanked their respected gods for giving them such a good friend to rely on then they both fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...</span></div></div>",

No that can't be possible,I believe Jane's will to be strong enough to fight back against him for now..so why the hesitation...could it be those urges again...I think so. They seem pretty innocent to me because she admitted them to me.I suppose she's just embarrassed about the idea of doing them,well I don't mind them and I'm getting the impression that these urges really suggest that Jane has fallen for me...and I think I have fallen for her. <br>\r\nWe elves usually get lots of human attention but..I mean  do have  feelings for her..but most of the time if an elf falls for a human they outlive their partner..I want to accept Jane but unless I can make Jane into an elf or give her a long lifespan somehow..the years of suffering far outweigh the years of happiness we could have..sure we would have the best time of our lives..but what for only 60  to 80 years..and we elf usually live up to ages in the thousands of years.<br>\r\nWait a sec.I just thought of something..my clan always told me about a legendary item that can grant long life but I don't know if it works on humans...maybe I can live along with Jane but can I risk loving her and risking years of pain if the item doesn't work on her. Ah the dilemma!<br>\r\nWait..right now we need out of this hut and if to do that I need to love Jane,and express my feelings and accept the chance of years of suffering..then I gladly accept to take that risk: either we'll get out and be happy for a few years,get out and be together until we both die really old..or we don't get out but we'll still be together..hopefully.Alright Mara,let's do this! <br>\r\nWell I never thought I'd find a partner while adventuring,but looks like I've been given this ball of joy,kindness and cuteness, while she may be not the brightest, I trust her with all my being and i know she does too. Now how to put these feelings into words and make her eat with me. Oh i know...do it!. I need a bit of time for this..so then let's make an excuse for time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Jane,before we do all this,could you go and pack all our stuff..I need to double check my mind for any other solutions.\"<br>\r\n-\"O-Oh yeah sure\" <br>\r\nA quick response from the flustered rogue,happy to have a way out of that awkward situation,hoping that Mara didn't get creeped out by her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the rogue returned slowly and dropped the bag in the lounge and returned to the kitchen,which bizarrely had the lights off,lit only by candlelight,with all the food on the table.A bit confused,Jane entered the room and sat down on the chair and started calling for Mara:<br>\r\n''Mara?You here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was getting a bit scared,being alone and Mara having apparently disappeared.A few moments past and then Jane felt something happen to the clothes she was wearing,having found them in her room last night..they were disappearing.Her top was melting into nothing,blowing off like the wind,quickly followed by her bra,pants and panties..<br>\r\nJane was completely nude in the gazebo,trying to preserve her modesty in case Mara came back,she covered her boobs with her hands and crossed her legs.<br>\r\nSurprised,Jane knew this was only one thing:The Lipomancer. He did something to Mara and was now toying with her.<br>\r\n\"Mara!If you can here me I'm right here and the Lipomancer is attacking us!We gotta do something!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was terrified now,and tried to get up from the chair,but she couldn't! Her butt was stuck to the chair!<br>\r\n''Oh god please no..i think i know where this is going...no no no no!'' Jane was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a warm and familiar voice filled the air:<br>\r\n''-Don't be like that Jane,it's not the Lipomancer,I just thought this would be better so I could talk to you honestly.'' <br>\r\n\"-Mara?What do you mean?Where are you?\"<br>\r\n\"-I'm right here silly..''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing her illusion magic,Mara revealed herself in a corner of the room with a pile of clothes,Jane's.<br>\r\nMara waddled behind Jane,pulled her chair back a bit to make room for her to stand in front of Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Jane relax...I did this.\"<br>\r\n\"-Why?\"<br>\r\n\"-Simple Jane,so I can be honest with to you and you with me'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this Mara began charging a quick spell and released it: \"Clovius Marego!''<br>\r\nInstantly the spell started to take affect,making her clothes begin to disappear and re appear in the corner of the room.Her robe began to disappear and the young elf found herself completely naked and she also kept some of her modesty covering her boobs and privates.Both of the girls were  clearly a bit embarrassed so Mara decided to break the ice and be honest with herself,and got straight to the point:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Look Jane,I know you've had these urges towards me as you said and feared it to be the Lipomancer..but Jane..I...I don't think the Lipomancer did anything.These urges to protect me,to..touch me..they don't come from him.They come from you Jane! I'm not sure if you realize it yourself Jane but I think,no I know that you've fallen in love with me! <br>\r\nSo Jane,I wanna tell you straight up,it's ok to feel these things Jane because..because..Jane iI love you! I don't know why or when i fell in love with you, even though it's rare for my kind to fall for a human,but Jane you're just..so special to me. You make me happy that I went to the town and<br>\r\nthe inn.Even though we've both changed so much physically you're still the same Jane..the same supportive,caring and charming young woman who came to my rescue at the inn.Whenever you're close to me I feel like I need to do everything to protect you! I wanna be with you Jane..so will you be with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Mara..I-I..don't know what to say,I'm so scared of losing you..so I don't wanna get too attached to you..but it seems that it's too late..I can't stop thinking about you recently..I wanna do everything for you,make you happy,keep you safe,no matter what,even if it costs my life: Mara, I love you with every part of my being.<br>\r\nI want to be with you now and forever.I'm relieved you feel the same way Mara.But this is all so much for me..I don't deserve this...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jane began crying again,Mara moved in close and pulled Mara's arms apart with her own and held them.They both  looked at each other's eyes while Mara slowly climbed onto Jane and leaned in for the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey held each other passionately and embraced each other fully,kissing slowly at first and closing their eyes before the kiss picked up intensity as this was in fact both girl's first kiss,they were lost in each other,they never wanted to be apart again.This was heaven,their heaven.Due to her inexperience,Mara didn't hold back during her kiss,and just as the kiss was ending Mara pushed too much and the chair crumbled under their combined weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls fell with the remains of the chair behind them, and Mara landed on top of Jane,and their boobs jiggled into each other, with Jane's hand landing awkwardly and slapping Mara's butt,much to the elf shock and delight and Jane's ass being slapped playfully in return.The girls bellies were rubbing along side their boobs and for both of them it was quite an arousing sensation,the girls were ready to going at each other at this point..Jane even teasing Mara:<br>\r\n''Oh Mara you know how to get a girl going,now can you let me return the favor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Mara wanted to lose her status as a virgin,she knew what had to be done first and spoke through her panting:<br>\r\n\"-Tell you what Jane...if we finish the food...we can go all night...\"<br>\r\n\"-You playful minx...fine!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls,after a lot of struggling and slaps and touches on each other's nude bodies,got up,dressed again and sat back at the table set up by Mara.<br>\r\n\"-Ok,Jane you take the left half and i'll do the right\"<br>\r\nThe girls got to work,while Mara's idea of surprising the Lipomancer by voluntarily eating sounded good in theory it made no difference,the food was super fattening and addicting of course,unfortunately for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls sat across each other and looked at each other the whole time,while at first,they ate in a civil manner,they began shoveling it down their throats.They both expanded at a rapid pace but again in different areas:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane ate all the pastries and most of the weight went to her ass,which creaked and eventually burst her pants and panties(again) and started to sag more and more down the side of the chair,she broke the chair and picked up food off the floor,and ripped out of her top and bra again,going up a few sizes,and her belly pinned her down fully with a triple roll,the already huge girl would of been immobile if it wasn't for Mara's magic.Jane was nude again but stuck on the floor exhausted and bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara ate all the sweets and the fat went to her boobs, her robe ripped quickly at the top and snapped her bra,making her boobs bounce and jiggle furiously with every movement,trying to keep up with her.Boobs leaking and aroused,she kept going,going up 3 whole breast sizes,now bigger then her belly which was huge at this point,catching up to Jane quickly,same with her ass,also leaving her nude and on the floor but Mara could still stand without magic,barely,sweating so she soon fell down and rubbed her belly and Jane's with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell was ready,but the Mara promised to make love with Jane, so Mara waddled over to Jane got on top of her massive belly again like before,rubbed it,played with her boobs,and started shaking her own body on top of Jane,with her smooth skin,clearly arousing Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mara was barely aware of anything around her other than the deep, black void of unconsciousness. Slowly, she began to hear something creeping into the fuzzy darkness of her perception. Her mind fumbled, grasping at the noise in order to identify it like a blind man might do with an object he\u2019s unfamiliar with. Cutting\u2026 clawing\u2026 <i>scraping?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara forced her eyes open, even though they desperately desired not to. Most of her reluctance to awaken was likely due to the overwhelming sense of fatigue that now filled her body for some reason, but perhaps she was afraid she\u2019d find out just where that scraping was coming from. Unfortunately, once her eyes adjusted to the dim light from a candle on the nearby table, the first thing she saw was this fear becoming realized right before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room sat a man, a large, hunched man leaning over something he held in his clutches. The figure was obscured both by the shadows of the corner he sat in and his choice of attire. The scraping thing across the room was draped in a long, dark overcoat, covered in stitching and mildew showing the obvious signs of aging and abuse the garment had been through. The hat that it wore shrouding its faced hadn't fared much better, the brim littered with holes and the basket so beaten and worn that it was difficult for Mara to identify it as a top hat, much like those the nobility sometimes were keen to wear around these parts. As the man looked up at the elf, however, she could immediately tell his clothes were perhaps the least frightening aspect of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are awake then,\u201d He said, his voice gravelly and course, sounding almost more like a hand sifting through broken glass than natural speech, \u201cI was wondering when you might do that, but I cannot blame you after the things you have been through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing across the room leaned forward now, further into the light, and Mara saw what looked like a canine of sorts. After a few more moments, she was able to identify this particular form of animal man as a hyena, though much like his clothes and voice, his body seemed\u2026 off somehow. His fur looked patchy and musty, almost more so than his jacket, and even from what she could see that wasn't covered with clothing it looked like there was something wrong with how that fur settled on him. His pelt appeared lumpy and misshapen, as though he was afflicted with some kind of disease. Then there were his eyes, his strange, blue eyes. The more she looked at them, the more they seemed\u2026 odd somehow, as though they were askew, or perhaps slightly too large or too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you then girl?\u201d It muttered before leaning back into the shadows, cloaking himself once again in shade, \u201cCan you not talk, or has your tongue become as swollen with fat as the rest of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fat\u2026?\u201d Mara whispered, pushing herself up from the bed she was lying on. Oddly, she found it harder than it normally would have been, reminding her of the mornings she would wake up at the inn at Little Silverhorne, when she was captured and ballooning with new weight each passing day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, fat\u2026\u201d The hyena said, a wide grin peeling across its lips, \u201cHow does it feel little elf? So different, I am sure. You elves are always such tiny creatures. Not you though, no, no, not you\u2026\u201d It chuckled, the laughter reminding Mara of an out-of-tune harp her parents had owned once long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026 no! This can\u2019t be happening...\u201d Mara said as she finally pulled her bulky body into a sitting position, flabby belly rolls spilling over her lap from a tear in her dress. The elf then drew her attention away from her stomach and the scraping man, noticing for the first time the large mirror that spanned the wall across from her, almost from the corner to the door. The same kind of mirror that was in the \u201cfattest woman\u201d room. Seeing her whole body now, Mara\u2019s heart sunk, realizing that the tubby elf mage in the mirror was almost unrecognizable. While the poor elf might have passed as chubby before arriving at the fairgrounds, she was now undeniably fat, obese even, \u201cI was already so fat before! How could I get so HUGE!\u201d She cried, grabbing at the exposed flesh of her stomach and wincing as how soft and heavy it felt in her plump fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrightening,\u201d The hyena said, his grin only widening, \u201cYes, I am sure that is one way it feels. Very, very <i>frightening</i>. Changes like this can be so frightening, can they not? Especially when they are so hard to reverse\u2026 the change becomes almost permanent even. The more and more you fatten, the harder and harder it is to stop, and it is <i>very</i> frightening. Unfortunate for you then, I feel. You have only just begun your change. After all, you can still move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara let go of her stomach and looked back at the man across the room, \u201cDon\u2019t say that\u2026 Why would you say that? You\u2019re the one who did this? <i>You're</i> responsible for this spell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing chuckled again before returning his attention to what he held in his paws. Mara could now see that it looked like a wooden board of some sort, and that the man was carving something into it with its claws, \u201cMmmmm, yes. I suppose you could say that, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 how does that make sense?\u201d Mara said, remembering what she had experienced before she had passed out, \u201cThere was a woman\u2019s voice\u2026 a horrible scream, it all seemed like it was\u2026 like it was some kind of ghost,\u201d Mara frowned as she looked at the stone floor, recalling her teachings from when she was being trained at the mage academy, \u201cNecromancy. You\u2019re a necromancer.\u201d She said, the thought of such forbidden things sending chills through her as though her veins were flowing with ice water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that how it appeared to you, silly little elf?\u201d The man said, laughing even more to himself as he continued to carve, \u201cI can assure you I am no necromancer. It is not within my nature to perform such wretched things. Not things like that, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis explanation only made Mara\u2019s skin crawl even more, \u201cBut then\u2026 how?\u201d she asked, her voice barely a whisper but growing louder as she remembered her friend, \"And what about Jane? Where is she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena looked away from his plank and directly into her eyes, and Mara couldn\u2019t help but break eye contact immediately with him, the brief glance they shared enough to make her regret even asking him, \u201cFoolish, dumb, little elf. Why would I ever tell you that? Maybe you should ask me another question, do you not think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What question\u2026?\u201d Mara whimpered, her eyes fixated on the floor where they would not meet with anything too horrendous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Why?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara thought to herself for a moment, before parroting the man, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d He said, smiling, and for a moment Mara was less afraid of the hyena than she was frustrated with it, \u201cWhy should you be thin instead of fat? Is there something wrong with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d She snapped, glaring at the hyena\u2019s boots, its footwear just as disheveled as the rest of him, \u201cNormally not\u2026 sure, but it\u2019s wrong when I don\u2019t <i>want</i> to be fat. It\u2019s wrong when I become so fat I can barely move my body! When I\u2019m so heavy that it starts to weaken my health! So yes, it\u2019s wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting aside his carving, the hyena stood up, his movements stiff and forced as he shambled towards Mara slowly, \u201cOnly because you do not understand\u2026\u201d He said as he drew nearer and nearer to the terrified elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay b-back!\u201d Mara said, pushing her fat ass across the bed and away from the shuffling hyena man, only too aware of how much her bulk made her sink into the plush mattress as the rolls of fat on her back pressed against the wall behind her. The elf mage screamed as she realized she was cornered by the still-approaching figure before her, every monstrous detail of his body only growing clearer as he filled her vision. The mage pulled herself together fast however, survival instincts taking over as she murmured an incantation and her fingers tingled, flames leaping alive in her palms to enshroud her chubby hands, \u201cCome any closer you horrible bastard and I\u2019ll turn you into a stinking pile of ash and rags!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena let out even more of that filthy, broken laughter again, but he obeyed, stopping just before the large bed the elf was curled up on, \u201cAh yes\u2026 <i>magic</i>. I had almost forgotten that, it complicates things does it not? There is no need for violence. I merely wish to enlighten you, fool elf. It would make what your body must endure less miserable if your mind knew why it must be such\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, <i>you're</i> going to listen to <i>me</i> now!\u201d Mara hissed at her captor, the flames only growing brighter in her palms, \u201cAnd I am not going to gain another inch of fat, how\u2019s <i>that</i> for \u2018enlightenment\u2019?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the hyena\u2026 or whatever it was, before her, Mara had decided that she shouldn\u2019t take any chances. The mage had been forced to use her powers in combat before, but she had been lucky enough to never find herself in a situation necessitating her to kill someone. Now though, it seemed as though there were no other options, but Mara gave the animal man one last chance, \u201cPlease\u2026 You do NOT want to tempt me, let me and my friend out of here now or I will force my own way out, <i>especially</i> if that means going through you to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena grinned and shook its head, \u201cI am sorry, but I will not let you leave.\u201d He said, \u201cAs I told you before however, I can make everything very muc-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara wasted no more time, worried that if she continued to let him talk, the hyena would try and attack her. The flames she held in her palms roared higher into the air before she flung them towards her captor, the spot where he was standing immediately becoming consumed in a tremendous fireball. Mara shouted in shock as her own blast threw her heavy body against the wall, causing the planks to creak as she slid down them and fell against the bed. She panted heavily now as she watched the flames burn, the already powerful and destructive spell having drained her even more than it normally would thanks to the effect all the burdensome fat had on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flames and smoke cleared however, Mara realized that the only remains of the hyena seemed to be a round scorch mark on the floor, \u201cWait\u2026\u201d She said, sliding off the bed and getting shakily to her feet, \u201cThe spell wasn\u2019t <i>that</i> strong\u2026 it's not supposed to be like that!\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had stood up, she looked towards the corner where the hyena\u2019s chair was and saw him leaping up and reaching for her neck. Her screams of terror and surprise died in her throat as the hyena wrapped his clawed fingers tightly about it, his paws leathery and rough as they squeezed against her windpipe, \u201cLook at me.\u201d He growled, as though forcing the words from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara knew she shouldn\u2019t, that she had to ignore his commands, but as she refused the hyena\u2019s grip tightened and she complied. As she looked into the thing\u2019s horrible, piercing gaze, she saw not the blue, relatively normal irises she had glimpsed before. Instead the ones that leered back at her were huge, distended far more than any man or beast\u2019s she\u2019d ever seen and the pupil within them dilated to a ridiculous degree. The color of its eyes not blue but a raw, vibrant purple now. As Mara continued to look into those strange, violet pits she could feel all thought slowly leave her besides the dull and ever-present terror that the hyena\u2019s presence seemed to fill her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will listen to me, elf girl,\u201d It hissed softly to her, his tight, strangling grip loosening. Instead those strange, horrible rough paws began to stroke Mara\u2019s fat cheeks, \u201cAnd you will not use your magic again\u2026 do you understand now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please\u2026\u201d Mara whispered, unable to look away from the creature\u2019s gaze, \u201cPlease\u2026 just let go of me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have,\u201d The hyena said, smiling as he held up his hands. Mara gasped as she tore her eyes free from his, panting heavily as she caught her breath and fell back onto the bed, \u201cGood\u2026 You will behave now I hope? I do not wish to be cruel like that, but I was left with no other option...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara returned her eyes to the floor again, but nodded in compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, <i>very</i> good,\u201d the Hyena said, smiling as he once more sat down in the chair across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to tell me why the hell you\u2019re doing all this then?\u201d Mara said, rubbing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena was already back to his carving, the scraping sound once more filling the room, before he answered, \u201cNo\u2026 I will not. That information is not useful to you in your current situation little elf. No, instead I will tell you something you will find much more helpful. Why you should want to do this\u2026 and why it is in your best interests\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara glanced up at the hyena, seeing that his face was once more obscured by the brim of his hat, \u201cI really doubt there\u2019s anything you can say that would make me, or <i>anyone</i> agree with that. What could you possibly say that would make me <i>want</i> to become a giant ball of lard?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the goddess wills it\u2026\u201d the hyena continued, its voice suddenly sounding like it was filled with what Mara could only assume was something close to adoration, \u201cThe goddess desires all to be this way, all to be like what you will become. You should take pride that you are fulfilling an ideal that my kin and I cannot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is of little comfort to me, you wretched man\u2026\u201d Mara spat at him, \u201cWhat kind of goddess would something as terrible as you worship anyways? One of death? Of madness? Of chaos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf life\u2026\u201d The hyena said, grinning, \u201cOf all that lives, and all that is beautiful about life. Tell me, my dear elf, even one as stupid as you has heard of Lady Yewthorn, yes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I have, yes,\u201d Mara said, frowning a little, \u201cShe\u2019s just a boogeyman though. A silly tale told to scare young children from straying into the woods\u2026 and to warn those who are too gluttonous of attracting her attentions\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...\u201d The man nodded, \u201cFor she desires life. More you means more life. More fat means more you, does it not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara sat still for a moment, not fully understanding what she was being told by this strange monster, \u201cBut she\u2019s just a dumb fairy tale! This\u2026 all of this is just nonsense!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot everyone calls her that, of course. She has many, many names, though none are the true one. The closest your kind can come, perhaps, is a common one used in the east, Y'go-Shg they cal-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Mara said, holding up her hands, \u201cWhatever designs you or your \u2018goddess\u2019, or <i>whoever</i> have for me\u2026 there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll ever be able to convince me to go along with them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena licked its lips just then, its pale tongue\u2019s color bringing back ill memories of the creature\u2019s violet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Lipomancer, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe\u2026 The Lipomancer?\u201d Mara said, shivering as she once more felt an unpleasant rush of discomfort from this thing\u2019s words, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not play stupid with me <i>girl</i>\u2026\u201d The monster growled, anger, or something like it, filling his voice, \u201cYou do not need to <i>pretend</i> for that, we both know. We both know as well that you and the rogue seek the Lipomancer, his lair, his treasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait... How could you tell that she was a rogue?\u201d Mara said, looking up at the man across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena man only chuckled before he continued, \u201cIf you would not listen before, then listen to me now elf girl. I want the same as you. I want to see the Lipomancer for myself. To seek an audience with a powerful sorcerer such as he however, I need something to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara felt like she knew where this was going, but asked anyways, \u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo very fat, very foolish young women. So here is my bargain, stupid elf: Play along with my plan, the goddess\u2019s plan, and once it is through the two of you will be delivered safely and soundly into the very heart of the Lipomancer\u2019s stronghold. Do you agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Again</i>, why would I agree to something like that? You\u2019re asking me if I\u2019ll agree to not only let you fatten me up until I literally can\u2019t move, but to let you do the same to somebody else. That\u2019s insane!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well\u2026\u201d The hyena said as he stood up once again, still holding the carving he was working on in his paws. The creature growled softly to himself as he spun the plank about in his claws before he glanced at Mara, long enough so that she could catch another glimpse at those unnerving eyes, \u201cI can ask the other girl as well, if you agree\u2026 in any case, I can see that you need more time\u2026 to consider. I will let you think, girl, but please <i>do</i> think. You may not be able to choose if you wish to gain or not, but you can choose if it will be easy for you and your friend\u2026 or decidedly forced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf girl wanted to say something, wanted to further voice her objections to her captivity or ask the man questions, but she found her words caught in her throat. She sighed in defeat and slumped back on the bed, causing it to creak and groan as the hyena left the room, locking the door behind him. Mara stared at the ceiling as she laid in the bed, trying to think her current dilemmas over, trying to think of a way out of this place. She could only try however, as her thoughts were shattered by a loud thudding coming from the other side of the mirror, and Mara knew it could only be the hyena hammering that damnable plank above its frame. The mage could only catch a glimpse of the sign as the hyena was twirling it about earlier, but it was enough for her to see what it said, her stomach sinking as she merely thought of the words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFattest Elf\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She groaned as she uneasily pulled herself into a sitting position, her mind tumbling with memories she\u2019d have rather forgotten as her now fat belly poured over her lap. She gripped the large, rounded orb, grunting in shame as she hefted and dropped it only to feel it jiggle. Looking up at the entrance to the room though, she was momentarily filled with hope as she remembered Mara\u2019s attempt to rescue her, but found that hope immediately dashed when she saw the door was once again closed, and most likely locked. Jane could find no trace of the elf girl anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods, how could I have let this happen\u2026?\u201d She hissed at herself, pudgy fingers continuously rubbing across and massaging her fat, tender gut as the rogue was beginning to realize just how much more of it there was. She forced herself to stop, pulling her hands away, the tubby girl hoping it would delay her understanding of how fat she had become and of how much she had screwed up her journey already, \u201cI\u2019m such a moron\u2026 shit! You\u2019re going up against a guy called \u2018The Lipomancer\u2019, you should have realized a room marked \u2018fattest woman\u2019 would be a godsdamned <i>trap</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue cringed as her eyes wandered over to the large \u201cmirror\u201d across the room from her, and the reflection that looked back. All that weight the thief had gained while stuffing herself at the inn had been bad enough, but that was nothing compared to what Jane had been through now. She was a complete and utter porker at this point, almost 800 pounds of blubber sitting on her fat, fleshy ass that spread over the cold stone floor while her heavy, sagging gut did the same before her. Sitting atop the avalanche of fat that was now her belly were her breasts, still managing to remain round and shapely even as they sunk into her soft belly rolls and strained the simple black bra she wore. The rogue lifted her arms up to her face, her breath quickening with shock as she saw not only how much fat hung and wobbled from them, but also at the sight of her sausage-like fingers; the plump digits seeming barely able to grasp a lock picking set at this point, let alone handle them with the finesse she had trained years to earn. This thought also brought Jane\u2019s mind to her thighs now, and while much of them were obscured by her immense belly, she knew by the look of the fat rolls swaddling her legs that they must be huge\u2026 there was no way she\u2019d ever be able to run or sneak like she used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHow could you let this happen Jane!\u201d</i> She thought to herself, clenching her teeth as she struggled to hold back tears, <i>\u201cYou might have figured putting on some pounds was a risk with this mission, but to be put out of the game so early? You\u2019ll never be able to lose all this weight! You\u2019ll never be able to pull off another heist ever again! You\u2019re a whale, a completely useless, lardass WHALE and you\u2019ll be stuck like that for the rest of your life! Then again, maybe you deserve it for fucking everything up as quickly as you did, for what your stupidity cost not just you, but Mara too\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was the elf girl now? Captured just like her? Jane tried not to think about it and instead ground her teeth hard against each other. Her rage at herself welled up through the tears in her eyes and a roar bubbling up her throat before she let out a scream roiling with her loathing and despair. She clenched one of her fists in frustration, raising it only to strike it uselessly against the floor, pain smacking through her chubby hand as she heard something rattling on the nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling a bit and wiping the tears from her plump cheeks with flabby arms, the rogue forced herself to stand, unable to ignore how much effort such an easy task took now. She wobbled a bit on her feet, gut swaying as she found her balance, and looked over to the table curiously. What she saw made her heart sink, but didn\u2019t surprise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on the table were piles and piles of sweets and desserts, each large platter of food seemingly calculated to hold as many fattening and unhealthy treats as could fit upon them. Whole cakes sat stacked atop one another, mounds of \u00e9clairs and cookies rolled over each other to create mountains of junk food, and cupcakes and sweet tarts were arranged in monolithic pyramids that made their number uncountable. There was so much food that the surface of the large dining room table could barely be seen beneath it all, save for one spot cleared in front of the sole, sturdily built chair that was seated before it. As Jane looked closer, she saw the space was occupied only by a plate with a single cake slice and fork lying plunged atop it, and a note that merely said, \u201cEat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane suddenly felt cold as sweat began to roll across the curves of her obese body, unable to look at the food in disgust but at the same time slowly becoming aware of the hunger that was starting to fill her fat, gluttonous belly. Even though she was already massively, morbidly obese at this point, it seemed clear that somebody wanted Jane to get even fatter, a thought that made her feel sick in her guts. The rogue once more remembered the words \u201cfattest woman\u201d that hung outside of her room, and realized that whoever or whatever had trapped her here, it was taking those words very seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cBut why should you be so appalled?\u201d</i> She thought now as she glanced at the food, <i>\u201cWhy does it matter Jane? It does not, does it?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not,\u201d Jane mumbled to herself quietly as she lumbered closer to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou\u2019re already so fat anyways, are you not? One bite is not going to matter.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne bite\u2026\u201d Jane sighed as she pulled the chair out and sat down on it, her almost bare buttocks spilling over the seat and causing it to creak beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYou deserve it anyways, do you not? For getting into such a mess, for what you let happen to your friend? Yes, you deserve a bite or two, maybe a cake, maybe all of it you fat hog\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Maybe\u2026\u201d Jane whimpered as she picked up the fork and scooped a chunk of cake past her plump lips, \u201cMaybe all of it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara laid in her bed, but she didn\u2019t sleep at first, her mind was too busy for that. The events at the fair, the things the hyena had told her, and the reasons behind their captivity all swirled through her thoughts like a maelstrom. She tossed and turned on the mattress, not because it was uncomfortable but simply because she was too plagued by the anxiety and despair brought on by her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she curled herself up for what felt like the hundredth time that night, Mara was beginning to think of something else with a little more hope behind it: An escape plan. The door looked sturdy enough, but Mara felt she could break it down anyways, especially with a spell or two. She would likely need to do the same for Jane\u2019s room as well though, which could be dangerous, but there was likely no way she\u2019d be able to go for the keys again. Still, the elf was getting tired and perhaps it might be a good idea to rest. She\u2019d need all the energy she could get if she was going to make a break for it, especially if she was going to use magic to do so\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was already tired from her previous use of magic, and then there was that hyena... Mara shuddered at the thought of that mangy mutt with his piercing, horrible eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara shook her head to clear the image of the abomination, sending her fat cheeks wobbling, \"No, I need to rest and wait\u2026 tonight's not the right time,\" Mara thought, easing her large bulk into the huge bed and feeling suddenly tired, <i>\"And anyways\u2026\"</i> she thought <i>\"This bed is comfortable... and big\u2026\"</i> and with that Mara drifted asleep in her huge bed, not bothering to lie under the covers, the tatters of her clothes the only things covering her blubbery form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Jane was not getting a bit of rest herself, the rogue far too busy gorging herself upon the mountains of food in her room. She piled morsel after decadent morsel into her mouth, her mind screaming with bliss, <i>\"Its all so good! \u2026And you\u2019re a fat hog anyway, may as well enjoy it\u2026\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese mental taunts and rationalizations flooded Jane\u2019s mind as she gave into her gluttony, a reassuring chorus amongst the symphony of slurps, gulps, and occasional belches while she stuffed her greedy face. Jane was already making an impressive dent in the mountain of food and it was showing. The food even seemed to fatten her as she ate, but with the depression she was in, the now obese rogue could only barely take notice of it, and even then Jane's mind only taunted her telling her she deserved this. Jane was slowly filling out the large chair, causing it to creak and groan as she shifted her massive bulk and swung her fat arms to grab food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Jane, through the mirror two blue eyes watched as the rogue gorged herself, a sinister smile on the hyena\u2019s face as he observed Jane\u2019s \u201cdinner\u201d and her subsequent growth He shook his head as he took stock of what remained of the woman\u2019s clothing, her bra barely covering her breasts, and he panties hardly evident as they were consumed between her ballooning ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, that just will not do\u2026\u201d He sighed as he lightly scraped a claw against the glass, right over the image of the slowly bloating but unaware woman behind it, \u201cYou must remain\u2026 decent, if we are to draw a crowd\u2026 I will need to get you a new wardrobe my dear...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually the rogue\u2019s senses, honed over years of sneaking past guards and skulking through shadows, would have easily alerted her to the hyena man\u2019s presence, even behind the two-way mirror. What a shame then that those senses were dulled by distraction and indulgence as Jane crammed another moist cream-stuffed \u00e9clair past plump, drool-soaked lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\u2026 just the elf\u2026\" The hyena croaked as the rogue continued her feast, a single tear rolling down her fat cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara woke up and felt... off. She sat up with great effort and struggled out of bed so she could stand up in front of the mirror, \"No, there's no way\u2026\" Mara said in denial, inspecting her obese form from all angles, \"Damn!\" Mara exclaimed seeing why she felt strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvernight she had somehow grown fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?!\" Mara yelled, lifting her large belly which looked fifty pounds heavier, \"How do I avoid becoming an immobile sacrifice for that deranged dog if so much as sleeping makes me fat!?\" Mara yelled, hardly able to believe that she was even fatter. The mage looked herself up and down, her stomach a sea of fat hanging over her crotch and rumbling from hunger, \"\u2026can't think of eating,\" Mara said through gritted teeth, continuing her inspection.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMara's arms had fat hanging off of them, something that might no doubt make moving her arms swiftly, and by extension spellcasting, a challenge. Her thighs rubbed as she turned and her butt was a wobbling mess. She was most drawn to her breasts though, which sat atop her stomach and were more than twice the size of her head, \"Well, I guess I don't mind these extra womanly curves...\" She muttered, pushing her tits together and enjoying the size of them, \"\u2026no Mara, don't think like that!\" She told herself, releasing her breasts and letting them wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around, feeling much more momentum thanks to her added weight: She couldn\u2019t be sure of course, but if she had to guess, she must have already been just over six hundred and fifty pounds. She didn\u2019t have long to ponder her weight though, for as soon as she turned around she was terrified to see the hyena sitting in the corner once again. Mara jumped back a bit in fear, but regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Like your new curves then?\" He mocked, seeming to choke as he forced the words to pass his disfigured lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What did you do?\" Mara demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, you can agree to help me and I help you, or you refuse to assist in my cause and things get uncomfortable for you and your friend.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't agree to help you but don't you dare hurt Jane,\" Mara said, sounding more desperate than she intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheh\u2026\" he chuckled, the laughter sounding more like a sound of pain, \"Your friend has already decided... and she is being <i>quite</i> helpful\u2026\" The hyena smiled, showing yellow teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-She wouldn't\u2026\" Mara said, shocked at what he was implying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has, so I ask again\u2026. Will you help?\"</span></div></div>",

So when I promised a safe way in she knew it was the only chance for both of you\u2026\" The hyena said, moving closer to Mara, the clearer lighting only emphasizing his terrifying features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane wouldn't let you make her an immobile blob, how would we even move to the treasure let alone leave?\" Mara argued, bewildered by the thought that the hyena honestly believed his plan made sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had enough, little elf,\" The hyena growled, putting one filthy claw under one of Mara's many chins, \"I gave you plenty of time to accept my\u2026 offer... but you refuse time and time again. You will eat until you are the true embodiment of beauty\u2026 because you have three days to gain as much weight on that little figure of yours as possible,\" The hyena said, giving a vicious grin, clearly aware he had won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would I do that?\" Mara asked with a gulp, afraid of the mangled creature\u2019s response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because at the end of the third day, I will see which of you two is bigger\u2026 and the thinnest one will have their weight doubled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara froze, now knowing she had no choice but to become this deranged creature's blob of a sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena hobbled towards the door and turned to say, \"You may want to eat up, she is much bigger than you already,\" And with that the door locked shut. Mara became painfully aware of the mountainous breakfast on the table behind her and her giant stomach gave a growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What do I do?\"</i> Mara thought, panicking, <i>\"If I don't gain enough weight I'm unlikely to be able to move, but if I do gain enough weight Jane will get so fat she can't move. We have to leave before that mutt can make us immobile... but maybe not before breakfast\u2026\"</i> She thought, her mind becoming slightly hazed, overcome by a gluttonous desire to demolish the pile of food that lay before her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she passed through, she scanned the room for sign of her informant from last night, but didn't see him. She wasn't that disappointed though, she figured he'd be gone by now, but if she could have found him, she might have been able to grill him for more knowledge. She made her way out the door, not wanting to draw any attention from a bar room filled with men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped out the door and onto the city's cobblestone streets, she felt a rush of excitement tingle down her spine when the chill of the cold, winter air hit her face. It wasn't snowing at the moment, but it had recently, and it was a rare moment for this town to not be covered in the stuff. Yet despite the harsh climate, Greatmanor was one of the largest cities Jane had ever seen, and the bigger the population, the better a chance that somebody would know something about the tale of the Lipomancer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and down the street, trying to decide where she should start. She could always try to get somebody to talk, but if a person knew information about a hoard of immense wealth, chances were that they wouldn't be giving up such information so easily. In any other town, the vicious rogue could likely use intimidation to get what she wanted, but that wouldn't work too well here. She began to walk down the road as she thought about what she would do. Most of the population of Greatmanor was either made up of gruff, strong, burly men and women with long blond hair, or equally large and intimidating lupines, the indigenous white furred animal people who would likely tear your throat out if you even looked at them funny. Yes, trying to get information would be difficult... But as difficult as going into a town blind? For all she knew, it could be a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in her tracks as a little shop to her left caught her eye. The sign read \"Marcus's Exotic Imports\", nothing too out of the ordinary, but it would be a good place to start. If anybody was likely to trade with the town of Silverhorne, it'd likely be this guy.</span></div></div>",

She pulled back her furred hood and attempted to navigate her way through the store, hoping to find the owner somewhere around here. The place wasn't that big, really, it was just all the crap lying about which made it difficult to maneuver through. Over there were piles of plates: tin, wooden and chipped and fractured china, over here stacks of old and musty books, most made illegible by grime and age. After passing the shelf full of scrolls and the barrel stuffed with broken farming implements for the third time, the brunette finally admitted to herself that she was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood still for a moment, trying to get a sense of her location, listening to the silence... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she heard something: Footsteps against the stone floor! She slowly followed her keen ears as they led her past towers of trash and piles of worthless minutiae until she finally found an aged wolf sitting at a wooden counter. His fur looked gray and somewhat mangy, his muzzle scared by old wounds, the most prominent of which led up to his left eye which was covered by a black, worn eye patch. The rest of his wardrobe was mundane in comparison: He wore a dusty looking black vest over a somewhat frilly, yet dirt-stained white shirt, and black pants with gold embroidery, as well as several stitch marks and mismatched patches covering tears and holes. It seemed to Jane that the store's owner was about as old and battered as half of his wares on display were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf seemed almost surprised to see a customer in his shop, eyes... or eye rather, widening as he held his head in a grimy paw and smiled, \"Why hello there... young lady... hehe, what might you be buying today, hmmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said I was looking to buy anything...\" She said sternly, \"I assume you're the owner then?

What appeared to be a long, tentacle-like tongue protruded from the figure's hood, snaking into the woman's mouth. Jane wasn't sure, but the expression on his victim seemed to be more of ecstasy than agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver went down Jane's spine. \"Revolting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus nodded. \"Mm. Looks like some kind of votive idol to me. Y'know some folks, secretly, worship this guy. Form cults dedicated to him, clandestine rituals, all that stuff. Personally, that seems like a bit of inflation... But maybe, there's a point where a man can gets so powerful that he might as well be called a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue just rolled her eyes. \"Some idiots will worship anything. I once had to infiltrate a cult that worshiped a potato. Not even a potato that looked like anything, just a potato. I'm not impressed.\" Marcus shrugged. \"Believe what you want. I, personally, only believe in one thing...\" The aged lupine rubbed a piece of gold meaningfully in his hand. \"Man that sold this to me was some kind of wandering sellsword. Said he'd gotten it from the Lipomancer's lair, that he didn't want to look at it anymore. Apparently brought up bad memories for him. He left town this morning, heading south. You can probably catch him, if you hurry. As for the statue... This'll be more than enough to pay for the nasty little thing, and that juicy bit of information.\" Marcus chuckled as he brought the bag down behind his counter. \"Anything else, lassie?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane held the statue in her hand\u2026 not liking the way it felt in the slightest. She was beginning to regret her purchase, not only due to the bizarre and disgusting subject of the sculpture itself, but also because it felt that, despite the hooded statue\u2019s lack of eyes, that the tiny Lipomancer was watching her intently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with this guy and fat women anyways\u2026?\u201d She asked nobody in particular before stuffing the disturbing idol into her pack with a grimace: She didn\u2019t really want it, but after paying that much gold for so little information she wanted SOME form of compensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026? What was that you said\u2026?\u201d Marcus asked, tilting his head to one side quizzically while once more leaning against his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing at all Wolf, I won\u2019t be needing anything else, thank you\u2026\u201d She said, bowing slightly before swiftly leaving the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to make her way back through town, hoping to find at least another lead before she set out. It had begun to snow now as she made her way through a twisting, yet deserted alleyway, and she still could not shake her sense of discomfort. Finally she stopped, pulling the marble statue from her pack before tossing it into a snow drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2026 that feels a bit better\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued on her way, but did not get far before she felt a strong, firm grip on her shoulder, stopping her dead in her tracks. Was she that distracted that her keen senses hadn\u2019t warned her of somebody else in the alley\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me miss\u2026\u201d A deep, but calm voice said from behind her before the hand on her shoulder withdrew itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane turned around, looking up slightly to see a rather large, black furred bull man standing before her. He wore a dark green robe, but this did little to hide how spectacularly obese the beast man looked. Yet he had a kind expression on his face as he looked at her, \u201cI believe that you dropped this\u2026\u201d He said before presenting her with the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue was quite shocked, she was almost certain that nobody had seen her disposing of it, yet here it was again, \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you mean\u2026 that\u2026 that horrid thing doesn\u2019t belong to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull merely smiled before gently, but firmly placing the statue in Jane\u2019s hands and cupping them forcefully around it, \u201cYou should be more careful with these things\u2026\u201d He chuckled before moving past her to walk out the mouth of the alley.<br>\r\nJane\u2019s eyes were wide with shock as she looked at the statue she once more held in her trembling hands, and then to the street that the bull man had disappeared to. She considered once again trying to throw the thing away, but she knew that somehow it would find its way back to her. She just shoved it into her bag once more and turned right at the street ahead, the opposite direction that the bull had left through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked down the street, trying to think of other ways to be rid of the creepy object. Perhaps she should drop it down a well? Or sell it to some other vendor\u2026 As she was thinking to herself, she once more felt as though she were being observed, though not by the statue this time. She stopped and looked across the street as she noticed a rather mangy looking young wolf man staring at her, but as she tried to catch any more details about him a horse-drawn carriage interrupted her line of sight. When it had passed, the lupine was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pervasive sensation of being spied upon, however, remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickened her pace down the busy street, slowing only when she had neared a blacksmith\u2019s open air shop. She looked around, being certain that nobody she could see was looking before she snatched one of the small, but sturdy hammers from a table before moving on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned into the next alleyway, following its passage until she found almost exactly what she needed: A nice, secluded place to smash the heinous idol into oblivion. Sure, it was a crude solution, but it seemed to Jane to be the simplest and most effective. She soon came to a quiet hidden little courtyard garden with a lone tree stump in the middle. There were windows looking out from the posh looking residences onto the courtyard, but Jane made sure that nobody was looking before she laid the statue down upon the stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, the rogue pulled out the hammer, raising it high above her head before bringing it straight down through the statue. The thing seemed to break all too easily, but Jane ignored this oddity, glad to be rid of the accursed object as she kept striking it, pulverizing the idol into dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted a bit from exertion as she let the small hammer slip free of her grip to the cobblestone path of the garden, giggling a tiny bit out of ecstasy, \u201cI knew I\u2019d be rid of that stupid thing soon enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment, goosebumps sprouting across her fair skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have been too excited to have felt it before, but her keen instincts were telling her that she was being watched once more. No, not just watched, examined. As a rather attractive woman, Jane had felt the gaze of plenty men over her slender, exquisite body\u2026 but this felt even more intense than that. She looked about herself, checking each branching alley, each shady window until she caught sight of a gaunt, reptilian face staring out at her from a second story flat, just moments before it retreated into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane made her way out of the courtyard as soon as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette5.png\" alt=\"*Vignette5*\" title=\"Vignette5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette5.png\" alt=\"*Vignette5*\" title=\"Vignette5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette5.png\" alt=\"*Vignette5*\" title=\"Vignette5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of being observed wherever she went on the city streets continued to follow her, but the rogue kept looking for hints and leads about Little Silverhorne or the Lipomancer. She was more than a little put off by what was happening so far in her search, especially by the statue that still seemed to haunt her mind even after its destruction, but her greed for treasure and wealth kept her going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had checked in various pubs, taverns, and even some libraries for information on the town, but all she could gather about the Lipomancer was that he hoarded more riches than could be imagined, and all she found out about Little Silverhorne was that it was simply a rather small, normal farming community.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as the sun began to set on the cold, large city of Greatmanor, Jane decided that it was best if she got some rest at the inn and set out on her journey the next day. She passed quickly through the bar, making her way past the mob of patrons who were too busy singing to notice her before she had reached the stairs. She entered her cozy little room, flung off her cloak, and collapsed upon her soft, comfy bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to try her hardest not to scream when she saw the marble statue waiting for her on top of the dresser.<br>\r\nYet she quickly noticed that it wasn\u2019t the same one as before. The figure that the Sitharli held in his clutches was different, most noticeably fully clothed and thin. Yet he held her arms firmly in his grasp, his tongue still snaking out from beneath his shadowy hood, but instead of slithering down his victim\u2019s throat it ran down her exposed cleavage, slipping between her ample breasts. The victim\u2019s eyes were squeezed shut, a grimace of disgust and terror upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to her horror, Jane recognized the face, the clothes. They belonged to her, sculpted perfectly in tiny marble form was a tiny marble Jane held helplessly in the clutches of a tiny marble Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the door. She should lock it, stay inside until the sun rose and it was safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she thought about who might have done this. It was quite obvious that it was either a cult, a lone worshipper, or\u2026 she shuddered to think, the Lipomancer himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was the case, somebody must have told them that she was searching for the Sitharli, somebody had talked.<br>\r\nAnd Jane was almost certain who it was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stuck her head out the window to look about, noticing that the snow was coming down much more heavily as night fell before pulling herself back inside. Nobody was below her window, so she simply tossed the terrible sculpture of her and the Sitharli out the window, sighing as she heard the satisfying crack of the statue\u2019s destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then threw her cloak back over her shoulders, making sure that the fur garment was wrapped tightly about her skimpy leather armor before she made her way out the inn and towards Marcus\u2019s shop. When she arrived, she noticed that no lights were lit inside and that the door was ajar, slamming back and forth from the frigid northern winds. She pulled the door fully open, stepping inside the cramped little shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was quiet, and even with her trained hearing, the human rogue couldn\u2019t hear Marcus at all this time. Nevertheless she was determined to find him in all the junk. In her hurry though she almost stumbled over what she first thought was the wolf\u2019s corpse, but upon closer examination was actually that of the much younger wolf she had seen watching her earlier. She looked over his body, sprawled in a pool of blood, clutching a dagger and sporting sword wounds of his own. She stepped around the corpse and soon arrived at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t find Marcus however\u2026 instead she found something much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another statue like the others, hewn from marble and depicting the Lipomancer clutching at a woman. Once more, the female depicted was Jane, but this time the rogue looked nothing like her current state\u2026 She was now completely naked\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t what made the rogue sick to her stomach\u2026 it was the fact that she was now easily the largest part of the sculpture. She was fat, obese, whale-like, even more rotund than the woman in the statue Marcus had first sown her. The Jane depicted in the marble looked as the she could barely stand, her entire body burdened by rolls and rolls of chiseled blubber. A tiny, stone tear rolled down her marble twin\u2019s plump cheek as the Sitharli held her from behind, one gnarled hand greedily clutching her sagging, bloated breast as the other sank into one of her disgustingly large buttocks. His tongue was, like the first statue, entrenched deep within his victim\u2019s mouth, though unlike the other woman it was also wrapped about Jane\u2019s flabby neck and chins in a gesture of dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gagged in pure revulsion, covering her gaping mouth with a gloved hand as she backed away from the obscene depiction of her. She shrieked in shock as she bumped right into something behind her, but her first guess at it being one of the various stacks of junk was soon proven wrong as a pair of arms ensnared her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me! What are you doing?!\u201d The rogue shouted as she kicked and struggled against her attacker. Usually she wouldn\u2019t react so excitedly to a situation like this, but seeing an even more grotesque idol of her had put her nerves on their very edge, \u201cGet off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful\u2026 isn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201d The man holding her calmly whispered into her ear, his voice serpentine, \u201cMy master willed me to make it\u2026 and the one you so cruelly shattered on your way here\u2026 Oh, but it is only a preview my dear\u2026 yesss\u2026 a preview of things to come\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about you sick freak! You let go of me, right now!\u201d Her mind was still reeling with terror and shock as she kicked and grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Sitharli my dear\u2026 he has seen you through my work\u2026 he has great plans for you\u2026\u201d She felt the man\u2019s warm, long, wet tongue slide over her bare shoulder and under her chin, mirroring the statue on the shop counter, \u201cBiiiig plans\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was about to protest even more, but a wolf in dark robes walked in front of her now, pressing a cloth into her mouth before tying it about her head to silence her. Jane could only grunt then as a burlap sack was brought over her head, her arms were bound tight in rope, and she felt herself thrown into the grasp of a stronger man before being lifted onto his shoulder and carried out of the shop.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, the man carrying her reacted, tightening his grip on her back and thigh respectively. She heard the bell at the shop door ring before feeling the cold chill of night passing over her, much of her cloak now draped over her head to leave her shapely legs exposed to the falling snow. She wondered why there was nobody to help her, hoping that the streets were merely abandoned, denying the possibility that perhaps whoever saw her was too afraid to assist. Still, she continued to struggle, kept trying to scream, even if it was truly futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is probably another stupid cult\u2026\u201d She thought to herself while wriggling in her abductor\u2019s grasp. Jane had the dubious pleasure of encountering many cults and deranged secret societies over the years. Usually to Khorrus, or some other rage or death god, but occasionally there were even loonier ones who fervently worshipped something more idiotic, like the one that bowed to a bottle of elk phlegm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here\u2026\u201d She heard a hoarse voice whisper before once more she felt herself being carried through a doorway, leaving the frigid outside world behind, possibly for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t just in another building now however, the damp air giving rise to her suspicions, the horrible smell confirming them. They were now moving through the sewers, and from the many turns the group of kidnappers were making, it was a fairly large one at that. Jane tried to remember the lefts from the rights, but in the end there were far too many for her to keep track of, especially in such a panicked state. The constant threats from the serpentine sculptor didn\u2019t help all that much, and Jane found herself dismayed to realize that they\u2019d be less ominous were they simply planning to murder her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour body is <i>perfect</i>\u2026\u201d He whispered as he kept pace behind the brute holding her, right by her ear, \u201cPerfect clay to sculpt into perfect as we add more and more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a simple stone block right now, but I can see, oh yes. There is voluptuous behemoth, waiting to be brought out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nThey turned right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his hand, scales clearly felt upon its palm as they rubbed roughly along her cheek, \u201cYou will be so beautiful, so massive\u2026 perfect for <i>his</i> desires!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! They turned\u2026 left? No! Right?! Did they turn at all\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing quickened, growing out of control far too easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your small frame now my dear, for we draw close, and this is the last chance you will ever have to remember it.\u201d<br>\r\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, shivering as she heard the large figure carrying her let out a deep chuckle. She still tried to maintain her composure, knowing that even if she couldn\u2019t remember the path they took that there was always another way out of these places, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, they passed through another doorway, Jane hearing it creak loudly on rusty hinges as it was opened, and then another, and another. There were more people here, she could hear them muttering amongst themselves before she was taken through yet another door and thrown from the man\u2019s shoulder, roughly landing on a cold, stone floor.<br>\r\nThen the burlap sack is suddenly pulled from her head, and as her vision adjusts to the dim lighting of whatever dungeon they\u2019ve brought her to she begins to make out\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There must have been dozens of people at least, all crammed in the rather large, stone vault she now found herself in. It was still very dark, only a few torches high up on the walls to dimly light the place, but from what she could see, many of the gathered men and women looked like ordinary citizens, perhaps even ones she had seen, quite a few of them appearing overweight or larger. Some, however, chose to wear dark robes over themselves, the cowls hanging over their faces to obscure them from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was any doubt before, now it was long gone: She was the prisoner of a cult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane chewed at the cloth wrapped about her mouth nervously as they walked her out onto the stage. The crowd seemed calm and quiet, so she looked towards her right, examining the stage itself. It seemed rather large, though a stone podium at the front of it was the only thing standing upon it besides her and her abductors. It became obvious though that this was more than just some sort of theater or common hall when she looked towards the ceiling. Emerging from the wall was a statue of the Sitharli, and though it was only of his upper body, it was incredibly large, looming over the stage, its robed arms almost spanning the room as its giant hands seemed to be reaching towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat concerned her most right now though were two long chains hanging limp from the statue\u2019s arms, the manacles at the end swaying lightly back and forth. Jane was held in the middle of them by the brutish man who had carried her here, a shirtless blonde in ragged pants with a look of blind obedience on his dumb face. As she was held still, another cultist cut the ropes binding her arms, two more bringing the manacles to her before clamping them down securely over wrists. After it was sure she wasn\u2019t going anywhere, the cultists cleared the stage quickly, leaving the still-gagged thief standing there before the gathered crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t have to wait long though, for as soon at those who had brought her here took their places amongst their brothers, a man larger than most of the others entered the room. The robe he wore was a regal purple, embroidered with gold trim, and he walked with a gait that projected confidence and power, as well as a slight elegance despite his large bulk. The man strode slowly onto the stage as the gathered crowd murmured loudly. Even before he stood before the podium, it was obvious that he was the leader of this bizarre organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGathered believers, loyal subjects and devotees of the Lipomancer,\u201d He announced in a deep, but familiar bellow, the crowd silencing as he continued, \u201cWe have all felt his presence, in some shape or form: whether it be in our bountiful harvests or the weight we carry in his name. We all feel respect and reverence for him, for we know what indulgences we may receive if we obey him, as well as what punishments await should we fail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mob of deranged fanatics muttered in simultaneous agreement, Jane only bit her lip. It was one thing to be kidnapped and put on display in front of these nutjobs like a wild beast, but having to listen to their boring, twisted sermons was already tedious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are some though, who do not understand his blessings: Those who do <i>not</i> respect him, nor see the beauty in his arts,\u201d He said, raising his voice and pointing a robed hand in Jane\u2019s direction, \u201cLike this one\u2026 She found herself curious about our master, but instead of seeking to join our family and receiving his gifts, she delved for secrets that were not hers to know. Not as an <i>outsider</i>. People like this, people who refuse to see his majesty, must be shown it\u2026 as unfortunate as it is\u2026 through force.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was now louder, more fervent muttering as the leader pulled back his hood. Jane frowned to recognize him as the black-furred bull from earlier, the one who had made her so uneasy, even though he had only been kind to her. He turned to Jane, smiling gently even as his eyes glared at her with a purposeful focus as he pulled dagger from the folds of his robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey must know his presence and become a part of his plan for all of us, willingly or not, for all must succumb to his blessing, or his curse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered now as he held the ceremonial dagger in the air before them, and as he turned and approached Jane slowly, her eyes widened in terror. She wanted to kick him, it should have been possible as her legs were still free, yet as she looked into his calm but determined eyes, she found that she was unwilling to resist, even as he raised the dagger before her. She couldn\u2019t even close her eyes to ready herself as he brought the blade\u2019s edge to the bare flesh of her arm, applying just enough pressure to break the skin and bring a small amount of blood to the surface. She bit at the gag in her mouth, yet was surprised to see the bull pull the blade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will feel his presence in many ways, through various methods, yet all will feel his burden in the end!\u201d He shouted, the room echoing with his voice and the chants of the others as he held the bloodied dagger towards the ceiling, towards the statue of their vile Lipomancer looming over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSi-Thar-Li!\u201d He boomed, his followers parroting the chant continuously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>SI-THAR-LI\u2026 SI-THAR-LI\u2026 SI-THAR-LI\u2026 SI-THAR-LI\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they chanted, a sickening, green sludge seemed to drip from the dark cowl of the statue to the floor in front of Jane and the bull. It became thicker as Jane looked up at the dark hole where the statue\u2019s face should have been before what appeared to be a gigantic, green, slimy tendril oozed out of the opening.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her head reeled as the green, gelatinous monstrosity coalesced before her. Although it had no <i>face</i> let alone any eyes, Jane knew it was aware of her, inspecting the tethered rogue with a tangible wickedness. Thumping like the fervent beat of a war drum, her heart seemed fit to burst from her chest! Panic washed over her like a bucket of ice water; there wasn't any time! Who knew what awful things the disgusting creature had planned! Fear flooded Jane's mind and she again tugged on her manacles. The right buckled some, and it was all the rogue needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today, cowboy!\" Another heavy pull and the chain burst free from above, crumbling the stone hand which had held it. Taken aback, the bull-man once more held aloft the dagger, ponderously striding toward her, shaking the stage with each heavy footfall. \"Come on, come on!\" the rogue growled through gritted teeth, clasping her right hand around her left wrist to re-double her efforts in breaking free. Seeing their sacrifice's rebellion, many of the less encumbered cultists now clambered onto the far side of the stage. Jeers of disapproval swept over the audience as the robed fanatics rushed toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seize the woman! She must not escape!\" The bull-man bellowed as he continued waddling toward her, weighed down by his surging gut. But his cries were too late, the left chain also gave way, causing an unready Jane to fall flat on her backside. She hissed and nursed her battered bum with one of her cuffed hands. Wasting no time, the robed minions had already halved the distance. No time to waste! Leaping to her feet, she turned about face and bolted for the opposite side of the stage, not wanting any of the creepy cultists to lay a hand on her. If anything though, Jane considered herself lucky that most of these crazies were too damned <i>fat</i> to catch her slender form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wooden door stood along the wall behind the stage, and Jane made for it, flinging each stride wide. \"Don't be locked! Don't be locked!\" Skidding to a halt, she fumbled with the heavy iron handle, and to her salvation it was indeed unlocked! Flinging it wide, the rogue rushed through and slammed it shut behind her. Unfortunately she couldn't find a lock on the inside either, so resting would have to wait. Padding footsteps grew closer and clearly the crowd was out for blood. Typical cultists; they never do like it when you botch their rituals. Eyes darted over the newly entered passage and she could see through the low torchlight that the path diverged in three directions. \"Why are there always so many tunnels...\" Sprinting down the hall, she again slides to a stop just before the split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Why doesn't anyone use signs any more?!\" Throwing her hands up in frustration, she heard the door rattle back behind her. Crap! Those loonies had finally caught up! She had to make a decision and fast! No telling what they would do to her now that she tried to flee. And so she decided on the most ancient of decision-making techniques, passed down from the first men. \"Eenie, meanie, miney, mo...\" Reciting the short poem of her forefathers, Jane settled on the left-hand passage. After quickly wrapping the chains about her arms to avoid any dragging that might alert her pursuers, she sprinted once more into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter darting through the winding corridor, she soon felt winded. Surely she was tired, but she hadn't been running <i>that</i> long. Stumbling to catch her breath, she could have sworn the walls were... breathing? In the low light she could still make out the stone walls clearly enough, but they indeed looked to be pulsing. Such a strange notion had little time to grow, for she clapped a chained hand to the wall at her right, bracing herself. Dizziness overwhelmed her and Jane flopped her back against the cold stone, sliding down to rest on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What in the nine hells?\" Swooning, she reached her hand up to her face. At that moment, it caught her eye. Although only a graze, that dagger had indeed drawn blood. \"Poison...\" It must have been; the dagger was poisoned! If she didn't find an antidote soon, she couldn't say how much longer she'd be able to stay conscious. Thankfully she heard no sign of her unwanted cult following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to her feet, she slid along the wall, feeling the stone brush along her bare arms. While the coolness was a relief in her feverish state, it was coarse and abrasive, forcing her to wince through the staggering march. Jane only hoped that the corridor would lead somewhere, and fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another few minutes of slow marching, the rogue silently thanked her luck. Before her stood another wooden door, and from the gap along the floor, it appeared to be dark on the other side. Good. No surprise friends to worry about. Jostling the handle, she smiled weakly as the door creaked open. Jane reached back and removed a torch from its sconce before shambling into her new place of rest. As the light washed across the floor and barely reached the walls, she could see it was some sort of store room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSacks full of various dried foods were piled on her left, and in front of her was a stack of crates, each containing different bottled elixirs and potions. Some were marked with a skull and cross-bones, and others seemed to be for your everyday allergies. Odd... One crate, set alongside the poison, was entirely unlabeled. Jane found herself no longer able to stand, and crumpled into a seated heap, back once more against the wall as her manacled hand wearily flopped into the crate. Trembling fingers wrapped about one of the mystery elixir's bottlenecks, and she brought it into the light. The fluid within was a bright pink opaque potion. Something about it seemed to imbue a sense of trust in it, though that could very well have been her poison-addled mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was running short on her consciousness. She had to make a decision...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Darkness crept at the corners of her vision, and Jane knew she had run out of time. Sure she had no idea what this mysterious pink potion would do; it could be more poison or it could be an antidote. At any rate, it couldn't be any more dire than her current predicament. Right, she had no choice. Flicking her thumb, Jane popped the cork and brought the glass vial to her lips. The smell of freshly picked berries wafted up to her nose before the tonic touched her tongue. It was unlike anything she had ever tasted! One ought to call it a nectar, for it was far sweeter than any potion she'd ever drank before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the effects were far from delayed, cooling the feverish heat that wracked her body down to a more comfortable warmth. Jane's vision had not yet recovered, nor her sense of balance as the room continued its slow turn, but the throbbing in her head was gone. Not gone, but different... She could feel a slow pulsing warmth now, starting at her lips. The tingling sensation was likely a side-effect of the sweet antidote, but Jane couldn't fight the feeling that it seemed to be moving; slowly coursing down her throat. Her hand now leisurely dropped the vial back into its place in the crate before tugging at her leather tunic's collar. This newly arisen warmth worked down toward her stomach, and as the pulsing strengthened, the rogue clasped a hand to her middle with a wince. The pain! Oh, the pain! It was crippling! Perhaps this pink potion was indeed poison, for it hurt now more than her prior plight. Both shackled hands clawed at her tummy as the toned abs contorted beneath her tunic. Or so they should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening?!\" Jane's shot wide when her fingers were not met by a sinewy six-pack, but by a slight... softness? Blinking hard, the roguish woman dropped her gaze to her middle, only to see that what had once been a trim waistline now carried a slight insulation to it. The word that had never been used to describe her still remained inappropriate: she was far from being <i>fat</i>, but it looked as though she had possibly gained five pounds! On her slim form, even that much was visible to the naked eye. All of her toned muscles seemed distant now as she looked over her exposed arms and thighs, petrified at the thin layer of fat that now rested between her muscles and fair flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible! How in the blazes did this happen?! I haven't eaten anythi--\" A scowl tore across her countenance as she shot the silent crate of pink potions a venomous glare. The mystery tonic! That was the only explanation. Whatever this crazy cult had concocted, it seemed to have wrought this horrifying transformation upon her once perfect figure. Her quiet grumble echoed off the walls as Jane staggered to her feet. No matter. She was finally free from the disorienting poison and she could easily shed the extra padding in a week's training. The torchlight had waned some, and after scooping up the light source, Jane scanned the room once more for any supplies to come in handy. Her eyes glanced over the left side of the room and she briefly accounted for the surprising abundance of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low growl rose from the pulsing, warm pit of her stomach. The rogue's eyes darted over the food stores again, lingering a bit longer than she would have admitted. \"No no... no.\" Brows knit with melancholy as one hand rested against her flat, but soft tummy. \"We're not hungry. Not yet. Stop your whining.\" Although the possible meals looked marvelously appetizing, the thought of what other enchantments laid within the rest of the store room frightened her. What if the food was cursed? She could possibly balloon to the size of a whale at one bite! Or worse, Jane considered the possibility that she might lose all control if she were to even taste some of the savory... decadent-- no! \"Time to go. Right now!\" Her fingers hooked into a claw and she punished her softened middle into silence before the creaking of metal alerted her to her wrists. \"Oh yeah... I should probably fix this.\" Without further delay from poison or plumping pink poultices, Jane reached into her short hair and withdrew a simple bobby pin. Finagling it into one manacle, it quickly fell apart under her expert lock picking. In a flash, the second joined the first in a clash to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Onward and upward.\" The rogue sighed to herself and gripped tight on the door handle, allowing herself one final glimpse back at the delicious assortment of foodstuffs...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Temptation had been avoided, and Jane shut the wooden door behind her, torch still in hand. However, the hall from which she had fled before entering the store room was gone. \"What the...\" In its place stood a tall, winding stairwell. Clearly this place was out of the ordinary, and Jane blamed the likeliest of sources: magic. After all, she was meddling in the affairs of a cult, who knows what sort of black magic they practice to protect their secrets. But as a woman with no magical talents of her own, she had no choice but to play by their rules. For now. The sooner she discovered an exit, the better. This place gave her the creeps, the willies, <i>and</i> the heebie-jeebies all at once. Testing the path before her with one light tap of her boot, it was clearly no illusion. Jane offered a frustrated sigh before ascending the winding stairs. What bothered her most was her inability to see far ahead. <i>Anyone</i> could be waiting for her just up and around the corner, but thankfully the stairs did not continue on forever. At the crest of the ascension she finally saw the first open room since her escape from the fanatics. No door stood between her and the stairs, and so Jane slid the dwindling torch into a wall sconce. The tall windows along the stretched walls offered enough pale moonlight to see and she had no intention to draw attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ceiling sloped high and the room as an entirety sat decorated with lavish paintings of disturbingly large women and men gathered around feasting tables. Several busts and statues also adorned the room, many depicting the wicked Lipomancer himself standing victorious alongside one of his many victims. His hand explored the rolls and curves of their bloated bodies, carved to appear as though sinking into soft flesh around their burgeoning bellies and mammoth mammaries. The poor women each held twisted expressions of utter defeat, none pleased with their fattened frames. Jane shuddered, recalling the miniature statue in her own likeness that haunted her still. Almost out of reflex, she again pressed a hand to her soft but flat tummy. Jane would not allow herself to end up the same way. No amount of treasure was worth that. As her eyes continued to pour over the dim room, the rogue realized that no one else was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empty. Where is everyone?\" She whispered in a hushed voice. Keeping her back to the wall, Jane slunk into the vast chamber, avoiding any pools of window light. To her dismay, she felt the cool stone scrape against her modestly plumped posterior. She couldn't stifle a grimace at the thought of all the squats she'd need to do when she got home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three continue the search, she could not have gone far.\" The rogue froze and leapt behind one of the widely curved statues by the wall. Peeking around the corner revealed a handful of the robed cultists now entering the room, many sporting full figures of their own. They'd be slow, but Jane could not risk being seen. She still had no clue how many of them were patrolling the halls, and she didn't want to get herself surrounded again. As the group split, three began walking the length of the room, each bearing a brightly lit torch to aid in their search. The two others strode ponderously across the width of the room and exited another doorway, opposite the one through which they'd entered. Huddled behind the heavy stone sculpture, Jane merely watched as the trio dispersed across the grand gallery. Just now did she realize her palm rested atop the carved woman's bountiful buttocks, and she retracted her hand in disgust. She had to get out of here! Now! The torchlight faded as the obese men made their way to the far side of the room. Jane seized the opportunity and dashed from behind the statue, staying low and out of the moonlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo options were now possible. She could pass through the door from whence the cultists came, or follow the pair through the other door. Deeming it unwise to possibly throw herself into the <i>thick</i> of the cult's numbers, Jane opts to follow the pair of portly fanatics to wherever they were headed. As she nears the exit, she presses an ear to the door. Only the sound of soft banter growing increasingly quiet came through. They were obviously still heading away from the door, so she had to act while the chance remained. Gnawing on her lip, the rogue grasped the brass doorknob and turned it. A small creak followed when the door began to swing open, but to her fortune no one came running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now beheld an open courtyard. Could she really be so close to escape? Feeling for the door behind, her hand was met with nothing but stone. A short panic rose in her chest, and in a whirl she stared at the blank surface of a tower's stone outer wall. More of the blasted magic. In fact, it appeared that the large hall from which she came was nowhere in sight, just this odd tower and the courtyard before her. It was surrounded on her left and right by identical, small domed buildings, each providing a wooden door for her to try, though where they led could have been anyone's guess. Across the way stood what appeared to be an outdoor amphitheater, now full of the hooded cultists. From what she could see at her present distance, they each appeared to hold a votive candle for light. Jane scowled at the familiar bull man that stood in the amphitheater's center stage. His words were loud, but lost on the cool night wind. Surely he was spewing some other fanatical nonsense. Jane couldn't help but crack a vicious grin while tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"Oh I bet he must be furious! They just can't seem to find little old me. So sad.\" An aloof scoff rises from her throat, and she saunters toward the courtyard's center, still careful to keep to the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her now stood a most unusual ornamentation. The courtyard's center held a large stone fountain, though it looked as though it hadn't sprayed any water for decades. Each step nearer fed her curiosity, and Jane peered over its edge. Within the moat-like trench encircling the fountain's base sat a vibrant, green liquid. Strange... it seemed vaguely familiar. And as the fountain's contents began to move on their own accord, it struck her. The ooze. This stuff was the same ooze she saw when she first arrived! Jane let out a small cry as the previously ponderous substance now leapt from the trench, straight for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue's agility proved greater, and she managed to hop back far enough to leave the ooze splattered in a small puddle before her feet. Close call! Yet the day was not won, for the green gelatin swirled in on itself, regaining its form, stretching up to the height of a man. Whatever the hell this stuff was, it was persistent. She drew her daggers and hissed at the creature, splaying her feet wide in a battle stance. This thing had terrorized her long enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane watched the writhing mass of goo warily, sizing up her opponent... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For now, it is best she find a way to retreat and when she see the opportunity, kill this gelatin monstrosity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the stone fountain as a temporary obstacle for the ooze to work over, Jane waits for a chance at escape. With her speed, she could easily outrun the ooze once it lunges toward her again. The rouge's confident that she will easily escape this conflict intact and still with a limber, thin body. Suddenly, heavy footsteps enter her ears. <br>\r\n\"Ugh, here comes the reinforcements.\" Jane grunts never taking her eye off the slime. The footsteps are still far away so she has some time before the cultist join their monster companion. As a rouge Jane has learned to keep track of several things at once using her other four senses when her sight alone is not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the footsteps get louder from across her gelatin enemy decides to lunge at her once more perhaps confident it's allies would back it up. Unfortunately for the slime however the cultist sound quiet tired based off the wheezing and gasping Jane can hear.

They seemingly also lack long range weapons or magic staffs most likely due to their bull leader wanting her alive and uninjured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fools, they seriously think to catch me with just their fat bodies?\" Jane chuckles softly, using this chance Jane runs toward the nearest door on her.....</span></div></div>",

Slamming the door behind her Jane finds herself surrounded by stone work and a stone floor. A desk sits in the middle with several bookcases sitting along the wall as a cold wind comes through the few narrow windows the align several inches above Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to waste, Jane checks the door hoping to see a lock or something to bar it.

Staring out, the rouge only sees the sky. Looking down, she sees how small everything is even the courtyard with the empty fountain is far away from her eyesight. Beyond that is a thick fog so she can't see beyond that. She must be at the top of the strange tower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least they won't find me here for a bit....I think.\" Jane sighs as she sees only one entrance leading to a stairway going down.

Escape fits a rouge despite Jane wishing to find the cult leader and ripping them a new one. Taking a deep breath, Jane exhales her frustrations not allowing it to harm her judgment. First the apothecary then find the exit of this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting used to her new weight and the tightness of her once comfortable tight clothes, Jane moves to the stairwell and peeks out seeing if there was someone outside. Seeing no one or nothing except a regular old stairwell made of stone. Feeling that this too suspious, considering the mass of people chasing her, Jane slowly makes her way down, careful to look out for traps or a noise that signals the approach of anything. Her curves jiggle as she steps and her stomach peeks out showing her pale smooth flesh underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a wooden doorway to the right, Jane hears some noises behind it. Curious and cautious, the chubby rouge puts her ear to the door. Because of the thick wood of the door, most of the noise is cut out but still Jane can still make out two voices speaking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure the Avatar came this way?\u201d Jane recognizes the voice; it was that bull man that leads the cult! Or at least is one of their leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doorway she went though leads to the great Lipomancer\u2019s study sir!\u201dAnother voice that heavy and exhausted, most likely belonging to one of cult members she ran into in the courtyard. \u201cWe also received a report that-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorway muffles the sound so Jane does not hear what is said but it causes the bull man to laugh heartily.\u201dThen that is good for us that she took the blessing, as our work is partly done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing they are talking about her, Jane moves just a bit closer to the door ignoring how her chubby stomach beats her face just a bit more. \u201cYes, I believe the blessing will be effective in her capture but it only works more effectively if we can get her to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, footsteps are coming closer to the door! They are coming this way! In a panic, the rouge looks around the stairwell looking for a place to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there are relatively few hiding places for Jane to hide at. One spot is between two statues similar to the one in the main shrine, twisted and bloated creatures that no longer seemed to look human, and based off the wings, they seem to be some kind of divine creature. However with Jane\u2019s chubby bulk the fit will be tight. The other possibility is to hang off the stairwell and hope that she is not seen.

However the rouge forgotten her increased weight and is surprised at how much more effort it takes to hold herself in place. She almost wants to just to test her luck in just running for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is what ten pounds can do to a girl eh?\u201d She thought with sick humor. If it continues, doing things like this will become short of impossible. Jane tightens her grip, just then the heavy door opens and a pair of footsteps is heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is close to where she was taken my lord.\u201d A male\u2019s voice speaks out in confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, I will take the great one\u2019s study you will see to the lower levels.\u201d The bull speaks out. \u201cHowever if you find her don\u2019t take her back to the shrine, make sure you take her to that place.<br>\r\nThere is hesitance in the other man\u2019s voice,\u201dT-there sir? But that place is-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane listens intently, however her hands her becoming sore and her arms are losing strength faster then she accounted for. Her thicker legs cannot find anything to grip to give relief to her tiring arms, making this a race against time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know that place is reserved for only the most severe of punishments. Despite going to receive the greatest of blessings from our liege she has humiliated him and spit in his face.\u201d The boar man sounds a bit scared as he continues,\u201d Due to this, Lord Lipomancer has spoke to me and wishes for me to drop her there. If we let her escape, we are to forfeit our lives or worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane holds in a groan as she comes closer to slipping barely listening in on the pig\u2019s words.\u201d Can this dang pig just shut up and get moving already?! \u201cBeads of sweat grace the rouge\u2019s forehead and the grips of her leathers are gradually slipping making this a race against time on who goes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cV-very well high priest, I will make sure to find her!\u201d The fellow eeps a bit before tumbling down the stairs. Or at least that how it sounds to Jane. The boar man sighs and stands for a few seconds before his footsteps are heard ascending the stairs. Each foot step is like a choir of angels to the rouge because soon this torture will end. As soon as the footsteps are far enough away, Jane tries to make her way over the stairwell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to find that she no longer has the strength to lift herself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the goddess, I cannot fall here!\u201d Jane yells embarrassed, not caring if someone hears her. She squirms her legs trying find something to rest her weight on, not caring if she looks like a dying walrus trying to climb a wall. Thanks to her squirming lower limbs her grip is loosened, one of her hands falling off. Normally Jane would be able to grip the ledge once more but her arm feels tender and sore making it hard to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything down there?\u201d Jane thinks quickly and peers downward. There is small pathway but if the rouge lets go and drops down she will only injure herself. However before she could despair she sees a familiar ooze slowly crawling by. The ooze should soften her landing but if she will only find herself captured. But if she uses her bulk as a weapon there is a chance she could stun it just enough to escape its grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looks around for another option as her only hand hanging on the ledge starts to fail. There is another ledge nearby, an outcrop with a way that Jane can rest her hands. However the distance she could clear easily is now a daunting task for the rouge with her extra ten pounds of baggage. With no choice the rouge-</span></div></div>",

Left with no time to prepare Jane throws herself off the ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flies like butterfly, a chubby butterfly but a butterfly nevertheless. However, it is not enough as the rouge begins to fall faster then she intended. It is only to luck that Jane manages to  barely land. Her balance is perilous but she manages to stable herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close, too close for me.\u201d Jane sighs as she clings to a pillar. The rouge looks around taking in the sights before a loud groaning sound comes from her stomach. Thankfully this time there is no pain, perhaps due to her body becoming now accustomed to the pain. \u201cNot here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach continues to grumble as it expands, her skin stretches as her belly button pops out of its cozy home and into the cold stone. Her tunic has become a top as her breasts swell and fill her bra more, straining the hooks around her shoulders. Rips form on the increasingly tight tunic as breast flesh escapes through the newly formed holes. Her thighs are now barely pressing together despite them being spread apart. Jane\u2019s ass is now peeking out from the few holes in her tights as her undergarment digs into her butt struggling to hold her no longer tight butt. Her cheeks re now visible puffy like a childs while a second chin barely makes herself noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rouge almost wants to cry, it will take her a long period of time to work this weight off! That is if it stops there. Perhaps if she can escape she can find somebody to fix this\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no time I need to get going\u2026\u201d Jane mutters as she scoots down the wall, ignoring the pleasure in her bosom as it squishes against the stone. Her stomach now presses against the wall and her thighs jiggle as she moves her legs. Doing her best to find an entrance the rouge hears a sound above her. Seeing the green yellowish hue, she realize the ooze from earlier is above her! Before the rouge could even wonder how it moved here so quickly, it\u2019s too late for Jane to react as the slime wraps itself along her puffy wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you let go!\u201d Jane yanks her wrists but the ooze just follows as it works it\u2019s way up her arms slowly, obviously enjoying its victory over the rouge. Suddenly it surges forward into Jane\u2019s screaming mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cOMMPH! \u2026UMMPG, GUUUMPG, UGUUUMMM!\u201d</b> Jane struggles to spit out the slime. But it fills her cheeks to the brim and has no choice but to swallow. <b>\u201cGULP, UMMP, UUMM!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime\u2019s taste is not horrible, it\u2019s terrible sweet. It makes her stomach feel comfortable and warm. Knowing that this slime will fatten her up makes Jane struggle; her lower body untangled by the slime as she gradually loosens herself. The slimes cannot grab hold due to having to keep itself stuck to the wall. When Jane finally pulls free, the force makes her step back. Unfortunately, there is nothing for the poor rouge to grab onto as she falls, bits of ooze falling from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane falls until she hits a pool of water with a loud splash. The cold water shocks her consciousness  as she swallows water. With no air, the tubby rouge breaks to the surface gasping for air. She can hardly see due to the darkness but based off the feeling of stone it would seem that she is in a cavern of some kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her chest feels sore and tight as if something is squishing it. She feels a snap underneath the water as her bra comes off and floats to her faces as if insulting her for gaining weight. With her puppies free to breath Jane should feel some relief from the tightness but it remains. Obviously, that slime did something to her but a light distracts her from her musings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance there is a group of torches. Jane knows these are not allies as she is still in the cult\u2019s territory. Despite that, it seems there is only place of dry land that she can see so Jane has no choice but to swim quietly toward the light. Approaching as stealthy as possible and hiding behind a rock outcrop, Jane sees two individuals wearing the same cloak of the other cultist ahead of her dipping steel cups into the water and then putting it to their mouth. She could probably take them if she wished. There are no weapons in sight and she is skilled in close combat. However her weight would be a disadvantage to her and there is her chest that still feels tight and sore despite being free from her constricting bra. Hiding till they leave may be the best option for her\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of waiting, the men still haven\u2019t left Jane decides to-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She ignores her increase in weight as she hears a few introducing themselves on her leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Jane finds a crate full of supplies. Looking inside it she finds nothing more than steel cups with a strange logo of an obese man.\u201dSome kind of god?\u201d the rouge thinks before setting it back in. There were several other crates filled to the brim with ropes and other currently necessary needs as well. She needs something at least, so Jane ends up taking a rope with her wrapping on her thickened shoulder and her pot belly. It might help climb or at least assist her in choking the life out of these pricks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving down the to the entrance of the cave she has fallen in, Jane peeks around the corner to see if anyone was coming. She sees ahead two pathways but no moving objects. Taking a deep breath that reminds the rouge of her puffier cheeks she moves down the hallway being careful with her new bulk not to make a sound. The only sound that accompanies her is her heartbeat that sounds like everyone can hear.

However this is due to her increasing hunger. Ignoring that thought of eating anything at this moment though makes Jane sick however. Who knows if the food is cursed or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thankfully for the rouge that is proper picking tools are not needed, the door was unlocked. With a huff of exertion <br>\r\nJane manages to force the door open, hoping that no one hears the loud groaning of the door. Upon opening it, Jane steps inside and carefully closes said door. The room is large as crates and pots line up just about everywhere however in the center of the room is a decent size pool of pink fluid, that actually looks similar to the anti poison that Jane took earlier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that-\u201cJane curiously opens a crate a bit and sees bottles of various sizes holding the pink liquid. \u201cSo this must be the source\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, this is the source of Lord Lipomancer\u2019s  all cure.

From beyond the pool, a female figure appears in warrior wear covered in leather armor and a mace held in hand. Her long blonde flows down to her shoulders. However while the warrior is formidable in her armor she had a thick layer of fat showing on her body with chubby cheeks and a slight second chin, not to dissimilar to Jane\u2019s own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll cure?

She scoured the full sacks of food, some were filled with bread, others contained vegetables, until she did find something truly decadent..... Sweetbuns! Her favourite treat! She snatched a bun from the top of the nearest sack, holding it up and regarding it's sweet exterior. It was about the size of a fist, topped with a glaze of the traditional pale blue icing, and it looked positively yummy to Jane! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane scoffed down the sweet treat quickly, in just a few bites. \"Hmmm.... Maybe I could get away with one more...\" she thought again. But she was soon reaching for a third bun, then a forth, a fifth, and a sixth.

Until she'd eaten the entire sack of buns. \"Ooohh...\" Jane pouted in disappointment when she realised the sack was empty. Her stomach gave a groan, and as she moved her hand to sooth it, she was shocked when her hand met her stomach sooner than she had expected, and it didn't feel flat anymore!

I'm fat! How? I'm... I'm......\" she looked down again at her plump belly, biting her lip, she murmured, \"I'm not big enough...\". With that she grabbed another sack of sweetbuns, tipped it to the ground and sat herself beside it. As she continued with her bun binge it was now clear, the pink potion had slowly but surely altered her mind to suit the cultists' requirements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to stuff more buns into her mouth, her belly continued to grow. By the time she'd finished the second sack of sweetbuns, her stomach almost looked like it was at the nine-month-stage. Jane was positively chubby now, her growing belly had begun to sit in her lap, with her arms and thighs thickening too. Even her breasts pushed further out into her tunic. She began to explore her fattened belly and now larger breasts with inquisitive hands, moaning every so often at her own soft touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane ceased rubbing her belly and breasts and reached for a third sack of buns, but was interrupted by noise coming from the door, and it then swung open. She turned to look at the doorway, with it revealing the fact that the bull cleric and a handful of other cultists had found her. Jane turned back to the buns and again reached for the third sack but she was stopped when a pair of strong arms hooked under hers and hoisted her to her feet and away from the sacks of goodies. \"Nooo... Give me... more....\" she pouted, trying to stretch an arm to the sack. The bull walked round into her vision, the attacker behind still held her tightly. Standing himself in front of Jane, the bull now obscured her view of the bun sacks. \"Don't worry, dear,\" he said in a menacing tone, \"we have a very special purpose for you!\"</span></div></div>",

Still being held and guided by the strong-armed cultist, Jane had no choice but to continue along the route with her captors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back through the winding corridors was taking surprisingly longer than Jane would have thought. She began to daydream as she was lead through the poorly lit passageways. Jane began to imagine herself gorging on the sweetbuns once more, licking her lips, imagining the store room filled with even more and... Jane shook her head and tried to rid herself of these bizarre thoughts. Just then, the cultist holding Jane stumbled slightly, before stopping. \"Damn boot!\" he exclaimed, releasing his grip of Jane and stooping to refasten his bootstrap. \"No!!!\" the bull cleric yelled, seeing that his subordinate had let go of their captive. </span></div></div>",

The dim-witted cultist barely registered the slap, as he slid of his left boot and shook it upside-down for several seconds. \"Atlas, what are you doing?\", The bull-cleric asked exasperated. \"There be something in my boot, sir\", responded the tall muscular man. After a few more shakes, a small crumb tumbled out, undoubtedly from one of the many sweetbuns that Jane had consumed. \"You've endangered our operation.... for that!?\" the cleric yelled. \"Sorry Master Torro\", Atlas apologised, only to be met by another slap to his face. \"Now... Let's get after her! If we're lucky she'll have become lost!\" So Torro and Atlas set after their brethren, and the prized wench who was so vital to their ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jane ran through the twisting corridors as fast as her bulging belly would allow her to. At this point, she had no particular goal in her mind. All she knew was she was running. Slowly conflicting thoughts began invading her mind as the potion took hold again. <i>Stay and grow or run for freedom. Stay and grow or run for.... Stay and grow or run..... Stay and...</i> As these thoughts cycled through her mind she came to a door at the side of the corridor. She had taken so many twists and turns she couldn't tell if she'd been passed this door before, let alone been through it. At least she hadn't heard the cultists following her for a while now.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What's behind the door?</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(( Hi there, folks. I know I've just recently begun adding things to this interactive, and while I appreciate all of your patience in getting to \"the juicy stuff\", I decided to throw you a bone here and write up a <i>very</i> juicy Bad End. While I still intend to add to Jane's future, this is just a taste of the sort of transformations she's going to suffer for your entertainment. Enjoy! ))<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn second thought, they could easily have just forgotten to properly label the pink vial as poison. Judging on how these fanatics seemed to sacrifice their victims, Jane determined through the haze of the mind-numbing poison that her infliction was likely non-lethal. However, this mystery tonic could very easily be a more potent serum. Not willing to risk her life, she released the vial, allowing it to slide back into its rightful place within the crate. The darkness at the corners of her vision spread faster and finally the rogue surrendered. She'd feel much better after sleeping it off... right?<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nThe shrill ringing of a gong snapped Jane from her toxic slumber. Immediately, she realized that she was no longer within the comforting quiet of the store room. Groggily lifting her head, it quickly became apparent that she was lying on her back, shackled to a stone table. Her wrists were once more secured by chains, though these looked far stronger and likely offered no chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brothers and sister, fortune has brought our bounty before us once again.\" A deep voice boomed from beside the slab, and turning her head, Jane once more saw the obese bull man looming over her. One of his furry hands stretched out and caressed her cheek as his warm gaze met her own fearful eyes. He now spoke to her, lowering his voice to a deep stillness. \"Calm yourself, child. The master does not seek your demise; he only wishes to see you reborn, reshaped into a more beautiful form.\" She only offered her captor a scowl. Seeing her defiance, the bull man splays his thick fingers over her cheek before coursing them down her neck and around the curve of one breast. Jane could not stifle a trembled wince. This madman was touching her! <br>\r\n\"CLERIC!\" A thundering voice cracked across the great hall. Jane's eyes widened, fear inexplicably wracking her body. Her eyes stared up to the familiar outstretched arms of the Sitharli's statue. She could swear the thing was shaking as if struck in an earthquake. To her surprise, the bull man hastily retracted his hand from her breast and fell to his knees, prostrating himself before the grand statue. Jane took her chance to struggle against the shackles, but they hardly even budged. All that remained was to wait and hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Your Gloriousness! I meant no offense!\" Fear hung from each of the bull cleric's words. The restrained rogue could actually see him trembling beneath his robes. But before she could mock the cowering cow man, a glowing portal opened at the rear of the raised stage beneath the hanging statue. Jane stared at the rift, crackling purple lightning danced from its edges and after stabilizing into a perfect circle, the figure of a hooded man passed into the great hall in front of the kowtowing bull. \"G-Great Sitharli! Please! Have mercy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence.\" Formerly loud an booming, the mysterious lipomancer's voice now sounded raspy and dry. From within the veiled confines of his dark robe, only his hands could be seen, and they looked to be withered and sickly. Could this really be the same, powerful sorcerer that gathered a cult following? He didn't seem all that powerful. \"You have failed me, Cleric.\" The bull man lifted his head, opening his mouth to object, but with the raise of one thin hand, the lipomancer silenced his minion. \"You allowed our guest to escape, and now you sully her with your unworthy paws.\" Both ancient hands grasp the hem of his hood, and upon lowering it behind his head, it was clear this Sitharli was not well. Patches of gray scales and heavy wrinkles marred his gaunt face. The skin hung from his bones. He looked to be hundreds of years old, if the years were unkind to him. Jane squirmed in futility, her manacles and fetters jingling quietly. Still the old man paid her no heed. Stretching forth his hand, he placed it gently upon the bull cleric's head. \"This shall not happen again.\" And with those words, a jolt of purple energy blasted the bull man back from his knees to fall onto his round rump. The cleric clawed at his collar and wheezed in agony. his eyes bulged and grew bloodshot as his tongue lolled out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane gasped as the bull tore away his robes. His heaping mass of flesh that once hung from every inch of his body began to waste away, withering as steam rose from his ears and mouth. The flab around his arms and ass shrunk before her eyes. Soon his paunch had completely vanished and then the rogue could count each of his ribs. In the blink of an eye he was reduced to a withered mummified husk, finally collapsing to the side before shattering into dust. A hushed gasp fell over the crowd of cultists off stage. Now the lipomancer's piercing, ancient gaze fell upon Jane, and the blood froze in her veins. His wrinkled face twisted into a yellow grin. \"The Sitharli giveth, and the Sitharli taketh away.\" The bald, scaly old  man approached the stone slab and agonizingly slowly stretched forth his emaciated hand toward her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No! I don't want to be turned into a mummy!\" She wailed, shutting her eyes tight, trembling with fear. But the hand continued forth, finally resting on her middle. Curiosity supplanted fear, and Jane squinted her eyes down to see. The old man continued eye contact, staring into her soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, but for you, my dear, the Sitharli giveth. Your future shall be one of greatness.\" The hand on her tummy remained, but his free arm shakily raised aloft, leading Jane's gaze up toward the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mea--\" Her words were cut short as she saw it too late. With hand upturned, the Sitharli had conjured that same green ooze from the hood of his statue's likeness. And mid-sentence the vibrant aberration dropped onto her face. Eyes shut in reflex, but the agile gelatin succeeded in slithering into her mouth. Cries of protest fell muffled beneath the insurgent ooze. Though the process was absolutely horrid, Jane could not help but notice the sour sweet citrus flavor of the invader as it surged down her throat. Rapidly shrinking overhead, Jane could once again breathe through her nose and open her eyes in time to see another jolt of purple magic blast from the Sitharli's fingertips and into the slow swelling of her middle. It hurt initially, but the pain subsided into a sublime warmth, flooding Jane's mind with a minor euphoria. Her jaw fell slack, and the slime increased its rate of conversion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now the rogue's ballooning belly pressed taut against her leather tunic, stretching the once form-fitting top to its limits. Jane's sheer willpower returned her to her senses in time to see the rising dome of her bloated gut between her breasts. Again she failed to scream, the pressure of the green slime too great in her throat. She shut her eyes and thrashed beneath the assault, bucking her back up and down off the stone slab. This, however, proved futile, as the increasing weight to her gravid belly only resulted in sloshing it about, side to side. And as the last of the ooze slide down her esophagus, Jane let out a defeated whimper. She was positively pregnant with the insidious ooze; her swollen tummy ached under each breath, and as she let out a slight groan from its shifting contents a small tearing sound ripped up her chest. At last her tunic had lost the battle, its leather splitting along the seam, falling away from the mountainous dome of her pale belly. Each heaving breath sent the rise of white flesh churning. From what she could see she looked to be nine months pregnant. But she knew she wasn't pregnant, just bloated. So very, very bloated. His hand finally removed from her distended middle, the lipomancer gingerly peeled away the tattered remains of her tunic, now exposing all but her linen bound bosom. Sweat gleamed over every inch of her drum tight tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What... did you do to me?\" Jane panted. Again she took in the sight of her immense belly and let out a quiet sniffle. There was no way she could run like this, let alone sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am preparing you, my dear.\" His raspy words slithered like serpents from his withered lips. The thin fingers of his hand traced comforting circles across her stretched skin before both hands reached up to rest over her navel. \"You shall be perfect.\" With that, the Sitharli shut his eyes and lifted his head. An incantation followed in a language Jane didn't recognize; it sounded ancient and menacing, heavy with sharp words and hissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! S-Stop that!\" But her words fell on deaf ears. Purple flames consumed the candles that had been lighting the room, and a pale light rose from the stone slab beneath her. Craning her neck sideways, Jane could make out what appeared to be runic inscriptions along the entire altar. It looked like they formed some sort of complicated pattern. Oh no, she had heard of this sort of magic. This was a ritual! But what sort of malevolent magic did the lipomancer have in store?!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Then she felt it. Subtle at first, but the warmth poured into her tummy, as if funneled through her navel. It spread down and out across her whole body, leaving a slight tingling sensation in its wake. Jane's breathing hastened, and her chest wobbled in its top. Wait... wobbled? Glancing downward, she gasped at the sight of her swelling bosom. What was once no more than a solid B cup now looked to be encroaching on a D! Tightness threatened to suffocate her as the soft mammary flesh spilled up and down around the linen bindings that once held her perky tits in check. The rogue groaned in agony, gnawing on her lip as she arched her back again. Finally the fabric gave way, splitting into pieces. Her engorged melons flopped free, settling down to either side of her painfully distended belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the pain in her chest had subsided, Jane squeaked with panic after dropping back down onto the slab. She felt her toned behind slap the altar awfully early, and it sent a ripple of jiggling around the swollen flesh of her rump and thighs. Her thighs! Those toned legs of her were once her pride and joy, but even without looking she could feel their flesh rising like dough over the hem of her thigh high boots. She kicked her legs against the chains, again to no avail as the wiggling jelly of her softened frame jostled with each kick.  Last time she managed to escape by pulling her arms free! Trying this again only left the rogue with a lump of sorrow in her sore, stretched throat. Tugging on the manacles only sent a tremor through the flab that hung from her only recently slim triceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't be happening! She was supposed to come out here and strike it rich, not become some madman's sacrifice. And she most certainly was not supposed to lose her perfect figure! It would take months to work all of this fat off... if she ever escaped. Looking down again, she saw her splayed bosom round out like a wineskin filled to the brim. And just like an overflowing drink, they began to spill their contents. Milk! How was she lactating?! Nonetheless, her swollen teats rested on either side of her slime-filled gut, dribbling small streams of milk onto the slab beneath her. More and more of the cold stone could be felt beneath her backside as it undoubtedly spread outward, swelling with heavy lard. Jane was ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ritual is prepared. You should be honored, my dear. By your sacrifice, I shall be reborn!\" What?! So she really <i>was</i> pregnant?! That was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! How can that be?! All I did was swallow that filthy slime thing!\" Jane thrashed yet again, still to no avail. But the motions did ripple over her body, jiggling her milk-laden bosom and sloshing over her soft belly. Wait... soft? Soft! Too obsessed with her bloated breasts, Jane had not even considered the spell's effect on her stomach. Though still filled with the green ooze, a visible fatness now clung to her once flawless abs. The sheath of fat spread up and over her dome, leaving it looking much less taut, but equally swollen. At this rate she'd probably already gained over thirty pounds in just a few minutes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The aberration was but my avatar. With it I shall be reborn...\" His hand sunk into the doughty softness of her strained love handles. \"...through you.\" That yellow grin widened and the Sitharli moved from her sight, hidden behind the expanse of her heavy belly. Jane heard the tear of leather and fully felt the cold of the stone on her puffy backside as he tore away her pants with startling strength for one so withered. The rogue blushed and struggled to buckle her knees inward, hoping to hide her muff from the crowd that stood before the altar. Jane was never a shy girl, but to have your sex exposed to countless creepy cultists is a bit unnerving. A bawdy laugh rang out from behind her belly, and once again Jane could see her captor as he approached the audience. \"Brothers and sisters! Bear witness to this glorious event! Behold the reincarnation of the Sitharli!\" And with arms outstretched, he froze in place. His arms and scalp cracked and crumbled, falling away into the same dust as had the cleric before. Soon all that remained were his black and purple robes, now resting in a dusty heap before the altar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the sorcerer dissipated, so too did Jane's bindings. Her manacles and fetter disintegrated and she was finally able to clasp her shaky hands to the sides of her tremendous belly. It felt soft; softer than she had anticipated, and while rubbing small circles over the tempestuous dome relieved some of her pain, the extra flab only sunk her further into despair. She truly was ruined. Her life, her figure, all of it was gone. She was stuck here, not even able to stand under the weight of her newly expanded body. With a grunt, Jane rose to an upright seated position, steadying herself with one hand supporting her on the altar behind, and the other resting around the front of her gravid belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as quickly as it came, the calm of the storm faded. A sudden pain shot through her midsection and Jane arched her back, mouth agape and eyes wide. Was that a... contraction? She was going into labor! Though hoping to hold onto modesty, the coming birth forced her legs apart. Giddy gasps and whispers rose in small choruses over the robed audience. Jane's sweaty, flabby body heaved again as another contraction wracked her belly. Her twin teats sprayed a small arc of milk across her creamy thighs before subsiding to simply dribbling down the front of her pale, porcine potbelly. She didn't want to be a mother... not like this. Her hand rose to wipe a tear from her cheek, and she could only let out a wail as her fingers traced beneath an obvious double chin. She was hideous! She was a cow! No one would ever love her after this, and she'd never be able to work as a rogue again. Sniffling softly between contractions, she prodded her sausage-like thighs with a finger, whimpering in defeat at the sight of her dimpled flesh. Cellulite hung from the once tone legs like cottage cheese. But her sorrow was again interrupted by the heaviest contraction yet. Falling back flat again, Jane clasped both hands to the sides of her fleshy dome as it writhed and churned of its own will. Whatever was inside her now, it wanted out. Movement within her left her wide-eyed with fear. The runes beneath her blazed with purple light: the time had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's coming...\" She whispered to herself as the green ooze breached her labia, parting the puffy muff as it slithered free in one, long tendril. \"G-Gaaaaaaah!\" The unfit rogue shrieked and gnashed her teeth as the sensation of warmth poured out of her body. It was unlike anything she'd ever felt before, but thankfully the exit did not last as long as the ooze's entrance. After a moment, the green slime had completely pooled atop the stage floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's form rose and took shape as it slithered into the Sitharli's robes. Finally garbed, its hue changed to that of bronzed flesh. Muscled arms stretched out into the robe's sleeves, and the chiseled jaw of an exceptionally attractive man took form beneath a mop of rich, black hair. This man was nothing like the weak, old Sitharli that had passed. Revitalized completely, his voice boomed throughout the hall. \"Glory to the Sitharli!\" He shouted, and his fanatical following replied in kind, doubly loud. One hand raised, and the lipomancer turned to face his birthplace. Jane lay upon the stone altar completely exhausted, one hand rested upon her purged but puffy tummy, while the other lay with the back of her wrist over her eyes. Small tears streamed down her cheeks and she stifled her cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please... kill me.\" She mumbled. The handsome Sitharli leaned over her, tenderly brushing the hair from her face. His hand rested atop the loose, flab of her belly, stroking it gently. Why was he doing this? What use was Jane to him now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would I do that, my dear?\" He remarked, a surprising softness to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You ruined me. I'm nothing but a... bloated cow. No one will accept me after this.\" She whimpered after speaking her words, turning her head from him. To her shock, he let out a warm laugh, not a wicked cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you not understand?\" He tilted his head, and she finally lifted the arm from her eyes, gazing upon his radiant face. Wow. She didn't expect that. This guy was actually... good looking. Turning his head, he looked to his hand on her belly. Kneading his fingers into the soft, abused flesh, he actually mended the strain from her labors. She watched as his magic seeped into her belly, tightening its base, leaving the muscles beneath renewed, and an even more generous layer of flab atop them. Another pout of defeat fell upon her face, and he shook his head. \"Cease your despair, my dear. You <i>are</i> accepted. Look around you! I am the lipomancer, and you are a goddess among worshippers!\" Sweeping his hand over the crowd, the Sitharli's subjects only confirmed his claim. The entire chamber prostrated themselves much like the cleric had earlier, and their chanting reached her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Praise unto the goddess! All glory to the Sitharli and the goddess!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Together, you and I shall shape the world to our whim!\" His hand squeezes one of her pale belly's rolls, pouring a warmth into it unlike anything she'd ever felt before. It felt... amazing; like a nice, hot bath after a long night of passion. A pearly grin spread over his bronzed face, and his hands shift, one index finger slipping into her navel as the other palm slaps to one of her meaty buttocks. Jane couldn't hold back a small gasp and she blushed at the action. \"Together, we shall mold the world in <i>your</i> image.\" Seduction clung to his words like condensation in a steamy sauna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hands in place, another wave of pleasurable warmth seeped into Jane's growing body. The flustered rogue chewed at her lip and lolled her head back, squirming her thick, dimpled thighs together with each sensuous pulse. She could feel his magic taking hold as his navel buried finger wiggled about playfully, pooling more flab onto her burgeoning belly. Once svelte and toned, her pale heaping tummy now inched its way outward, forming a lateral crease along her navel, deepening with each passing second. A jolt of energy sparked into her middle, eliciting a small giggle from the love drunk rogue. Stacked like a pair of white, fleshy pancakes, her belly rolls now surged forth at an accelerated rate, but they were not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from her navel, the warmth settled in her twin globes of breast flesh. Though they had slowed their lactation, the welling magic within her body became evident in their trembling growth. Jane's bosom bloated outward as her nips and areola were soon the size of cocktail weenies and tea cup saucers, hanging down like a pair of swollen milk bags that could never fit into anything smaller than an H-cup bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand on her ass squeezed hard, sending an identical shock through her which left her loins a bit warmer than she'd like to admit. The bare flesh of her backside jiggled and quaked with each pulse of fat layered upon it like frosting on a very fatty cake. Jane giggled and ground her padded knees together as the shelf that was her bloated bottom pushed further back and sideways, slowly filling the altar behind her. Fresh cellulite hung from the rolls in her moonlight pale back like a second pair of love handles, arching up and around, trembling with each orgasmic spasm that rocked her body. Only at the sound of a soft cackle did she open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, my goddess. Your faithful await you.\" The Sitharli stepped away from her, releasing his her from his enchanted touch. With a slight bow, he offered the massive rogue a hand down from the altar. Finding herself surprisingly able to move, she passed the impossibility off as just more magic. With a soft squeak she slid from the stone slab and landed on her puffy feet, swaying for only a moment over her newly acquired cankles. Big would be too mild a word to describe Jane now. She had surpassed big, fat, and even large. A more appropriate word would be vast. Standing at a meager height for even a woman, she now bore well over three hundred pounds over her stout, jiggling frame. And without protest nor a word, she took her first step toward her life as a goddess. Just a simple motion as that sent jiggling ripples throughout her expansive form; sloshing her belly side to side, swaying her pendulous breasts up and down like small ocean buoys, and leaving her ass in a state of almost perpetual jostling, the dimpled flesh of her buttocks and thighs churning like a bowl of jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? A goddess?\" Jane turned to her Sitharli, resting a hand to his chest, her flabby forearm using his strong frame for support. His grin returned, and he stood behind her as if to present his queen to her people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You are beautiful. You are perfect.\" And as Jane looked out over her subjects, she was received with praise and applause. Why did she run from this? Wasn't this what she always wanted? The people loved her, adored her, and she felt better than ever before. Jane decided this was a life she could learn to love. And as if sensing her acceptance, the Sitharli clutched one hand beneath her cow-like teat, hefting it up for the crowd as his other hand sunk into the pillowy flesh of her swollen backside; just like the statue in Marcus' shop. But unlike the carving, Jane was not shedding tears of sorrow, but tears of joy. Long live the Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Bad End?</font></b></div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The brutes handling Jane brought her to her feet and pulled the canvas bag from her head. After a moment adjusting to the dim torchlight, her eyes widened, beholding nothing more than a filthy, minuscule cage. Even at her slight form it would be impossible to stand fully straight. It's floor area offered little more than room to sleep, a corner to shit, and a corner to eat in. And all of this was only immediately obvious due to the remnants of its former occupant. Worse, he or she was far from hygienic during their stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your new home, little wretch,\" one of the brutes chortled. The largest pair of the cultists stood broadly before her, neutralizing any notion of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?! Just let me go! I don't know anything!\" Jane charged away from the cell, but each of her arms were seized by the burly robed figures. They carried her back toward the damp, filthy cage and tossed her inside. To her mild fortune, she did not land in the corner with the excrement pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed behind her, and the serpentine cultist hissed through the door's rusty iron bars, \"Oh don't worry, we'll make sure to take good care of you down here, little piglet.\" Another hissing laugh, and he clicked his clawed fingers. Two of the relatively normal-looking cultists shambled forth with a bucket and a steel feeding trough. Jane reflexively crawled to the rear of the cage as each man approached the door. A loud clang echoed as the first slammed down the wide trough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane growled softly, immediately despising these two men. Her disdain elevated to disturbed at what followed. Henchman number two upturned his bucket, casting forth a tide of thick, soupy slop directly into and onto the trough. They kicked it under the slot at the bottom of her cage door and laughed wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, piglet.\" \"You know you're hungry.\" \"You aren't worthy of the master, piggy.\" \"Just relax. Eat. Fill yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane whimpered in the corner. The slop smelled like some sort of meaty stew. It didn't smell half-bad, but her precise instincts told her no. It was wrong somehow. It was evil. Still... she hadn't felt very full after breakfast...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the prison's door shut with a loud creak, Jane set to work devising a scheme to escape. She patted herself down, rummaged through each pocket in search of her thieves' tools. Her expression soured as she found no trace of her instruments. Damned fanatics likely pilfered them while she was bagged. Jane yearned for more pacing room, she did utterly despise such cramped quarters, but she would make do, sitting cross-legged atop her cot. Her eyes shut, and she delved deep into thought. Tactics and grand design flooded her thoughts, until another waft of the slop filled her nose. At once, her collected mind scattered, and she shook her head clear. Jane glared at the malicious meal. Something was terribly wrong about whatever they sought to feed her, but she refused to give them the satisfaction. She would triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet even the proudest will hesitates at times, and Jane's resolve shook with the rising growl of her stomach. \"My mind is useless on an empty stomach...\" she muttered softly, rubbing two fingers to each of her temples. \"Perhaps if I tried to seduce one of them--\" she pondered before another harrowing gurgle shattered her concentration. Silence followed, save for the dripping of water somewhere out of sight. The dim torchlight cast an orange glow across the minuscule cage, illuminating the increasingly appetizing trough of slop. Perhaps if she ate only enough to quell her pangs. Surely that would help her devise an escape plan. Sitting up, Jane rose to her feet and warily padded toward the cell door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't believe I'm doing this...\" she grimaced, crouching beside the trough. She brought it beneath her nose and wafted the meaty scent. It was still warm, and surprisingly enticing. It didn't smell as bad as it looked. In fact, up close... it actually resembled her grandfather's homemade chili. Strikingly so. Pausing, Jane inhaled again. \"I knew it! It even smells like his recipe!\" Salivating with nostalgia, she turned about and sat down against the barred door, placing the trough atop her lap. One distinct complaint would be a lack of utensils, but Jane quickly recalled her circumstances. Caution quickly fleeting, Jane shrugged and scooped a handful of the slop into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, a rush of warm, savory nostalgia swept over her. No longer was the rogue locked away in a dark, cramped cell. Jane closed her eyes and felt the warmth of the setting summer sun on her face. The sound of waves crashing on a nearby shore, and the laughter of her loved ones. Opening her eyes, she was nine years old again. The midsummer festival bustled with activity, preparing for the coming evening's entertainment of firedancing, singing, and storytelling. Rushing along the trodden path, Jane hurried around the side of the beachfront cottage. Her mother, sister, grandparents, and several other families from the village all sat gathered around a long table. Strewn atop it splayed an assortment of meats, cheeses, breads, pies, and all sorts of decadent desserts. More food than she ever remembered seeing at these gatherings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janie! Hurry up, now,\" her mother called and waved her over. She patted a seat between herself and Janie's grandmother. \"We were just giving our thanks for such a wonderful community.\" Bounding with excitement, Janie hopped into her seat, smoothing out her long skirt. \"Now, Janie, we know how much you love your grampapa's cooking. Why don't you have the first bite of his chili?\" her mother motioned to the black cauldron of meaty delight. \"It's right there in front of you.\" Janie nodded, and her mother ladled out a big bowl of the chili. Without hesitation, the eager little girl shoveled a big spoonful in her mouth. Just as she remembered... Opening her eyes again, Janie saw the bowl empty, and blinked in confusion. Her granmama patted her head and began piling several slices of various pies onto her plate, while Janie's mother began spooning out more of the chili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of food, mama.\" Janie stated, looking up at her mother in concern. Yet her mother only gave her a dismissive wave. \"I know how hungry you get, Janie. You'd better eat every bite, now. You don't want to make granmama sad, do you?\" her mother cooed, cupping Janie's cheek. The young girl nodded with determination as the sun finally dipped behind the horizon. As the girl began her gastronomical journey, a ring of torches sparked to life around the table, illuminating all of the decadent morsels. Janie ate, and ate, and ate. Though time began to blur and melt away as the food piled into her gullet. Despite her childish size, she never seemed to get full. Her clothing still fit, and she hadn't grown an inch, as though nothing she ate reached her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sneeze erupted from somewhere beyond the torches, followed by cursing and the sound of hushed whispers. Janie peered out into the darkness and shook her head. Nothing. After already consuming the full crock of chili, three loaves of bread, an entire wheel of cheese, and two whole pies, she stopped eating. Janie scrunched her eyes shut once more, and flung them open. Memories of summer fell away. Once more the rogue sat in her cramped, dirty cell. In her lap lay an empty trough, licked clean. Though... clean was hardly an appropriate word for the situation. Jane succeeded in emptying the trough, though some of it lay smeared across her front, as though it dribbled from her mouth, down her chest, belly, and into her lap. Wait, belly? Jane blinked, unable to recognize the tinge of softness enveloping her core. Everywhere her body strained against the confines of her leather armor. Not enough to hinder her movement terribly, but extreme ranges of motion could lead to popped seams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what happened to me? Where did I go? How did I...\" Jane gawked. Shaky hands pinched an inch, then moved about to her thighs and pinched a veneer of pudge up along her hips. \"What did you do to my body?!\" Her breasts too felt fuller, as did the breadth of her behind. Jane climbed to her feet, grunting slightly at the increased effort. Overall, it felt as though she must have gained about twenty pounds. But how...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hissing laugh erupted from beyond her cell. Snapping her eyes up, Jane realized that torches now encircled her small cage, much like they had the table in her vision. From beyond the ring of light, emerged a cloaked figure. Arms folded into the opposite sleeves hid any physical marker, but the hissing laugh confirmed that this was likely the sculptor from the shop. His hooded head sized her up and down with an approving nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me, freak,\" she spat at the ground, turning to face him directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are performing so wonderfully, my dear. In such short time your frame has begun to ripen beautifully,\" he hissed, gesturing toward her soft middle, which, now that she stood, appeared to have borne the brunt of the cursed flab. \"Do you submit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane leaned forward, and the reptilian man mirrored her, his scaly face now visible up close. \"Never,\" she whispered, and seized him by the collar, pulling him into the prison bars. His hood fell back, revealing his face to the light. Jane successfully pinned him to the cell door before three other hooded figures rushed them, prying her arms away. She growled and fought, but quickly released the man and retreated to the back of her cell, curling up on the cot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You have spirit! I am certain the master will enjoy breaking your will,\" the cultist hissed, adjusting his robes and once again donning his hood. Without another word, the lot of them snuffed out the torches and exited the room. However, before he shut the larger room's door behind him, the lead cultist glared at her from the hallway beyond. \"I look forward to seeing the results of your next feeding, insolent sow.\" With a creak and a slam, the room fell to silence, all except that perpetual, slow drip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane scowled at the door, still curled atop the cot. She loosened her stiff posture and opened her curled fingers, revealing one of the lizardman's ornamental earrings. She spread a sly grin before bending it into a proper lockpick. \"Time to go to work.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane was thrown roughly to the ground and the burlap sack was ripped from her head.  Disoriented, for a moment she could see nothing but an uneven string of stars glowing orange in the darkness.   She blinked.  No, not stars -- torches.  She was in the town square, kneeling uncomfortable on the cobbles, and surrounded by at least a dozen people dressed in all-concealing gray robes.   In front of her, standing on the raised platform where -- where <i>executions</i> would take place, she realized with a cold feeling in the pit of her stomach -- stood an imposing hooded figure draped in black vestments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring her forward,\" hissed the figure.   Two of the gray-robes stepped forward and seized Jane by the upper arms, heaving her onto the platform.  She landed heavily on her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was just unnecessary,</i> she thought in irritation.  Then she was being hauled to her feet by the figure in black.  Jane saw that it was a woman -- a rather chubby woman.   Sheer, midnight-black silk clung to every plump curve.   The dress must have cost a fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane felt her gag being loosened, and drew in air to scream.  She exhaled it again silently when she felt the sharp tips of a pair of daggers against her throat.   \"Damn.  Can't you give a girl a little space?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old Jane,\" sang a sickly-sweet voice.   Jane recognized that incongruous little-girl timbre, and knew what she'd see even as the figure drew back her hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nasha,</i>\" she growled.   The woman giggled.   Jane remembered her; they'd worked together for several weeks a couple of years ago.   Thief and necromancer, plundering the tombs of the dead for antiquities for a certain rich old weirdo.   It had just been another job for Jane, but Nasha -- the pale, skinny blonde was obsessed with death.  She was always fondling the skulls and climbing into the sarcophagi.  Jane shuddered at the memory.  She'd been happy to see the end of her employment.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubly happy, she realized with a groan, because it had ended with her walking off with Nasha's pay as well as her own.  Not the sort of thing you wanted to remember about someone who had you tied up and surrounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you remember me?\" Nasha singsonged.  \"I certainly remember you; and trust me, what's about to happen <i>couldn't </i>happen to a more <i>deserving </i>person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane would have happily grovelled for her life if she thought it would have done any good -- in her line of work, they didn't much care for silly notions like putting honor over survival -- but she <i>didn't </i>think it would do any good, so she didn't.  Instead she spat defiantly.   Thanks to the wind, most of it ended up back on her.  <i>Great.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNasha laughed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I die,\" Jane said, licking her lips, \"before I die, answer me one thing.  I don't care who's paying you or why they're doing it.  I just want to know how you managed to get so gods-damned <i>fat</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNasha laughed again, and patted her round stomach.   \"It wasn't hard, wasn't hard at all.  I've been waiting for you to show up so I could deliver it.   Waiting a long time.  It was small at first, but all the time, it was growing.  Stretching -- stretching me out.  I thought you wouldn't come.  Though I would be waiting until I burst.  But -- but you're here now--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, a horrible rictus that distorted the black briars tattooed on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--you're here now, and now <i>you</i> can <i>have</i> it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Jane asked.   And then something happened that she never would have expected in a million years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNasha <i>kissed</i> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stepped forward, took Jane's very surprised head in her hands, and planted a big, wet, open-mouthed kiss on the thief's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmmph?!</i>\" said Jane.   And then she felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was flowing into her mouth.  Filling it.   Forcing its way down her throat.  It tasted a little like warm, spicy bread dough.  It wasn't bad, but the fact that it was happening at all terrified her.  <i>What was going on?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute her stomach was full, but still the flow continued.  She tried to pull away, fighting against Nasha and her minions.  They held her fast.  She was in pain now, her stomach screaming.   Her throat convulsed, trying to eject the stuff from her body, but the inexorable force-feeding continued.   Jane was sure she was going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... she didn't.   Even though the stuff kept coming.   Her clothes began to feel tight, not just around her grossly distended middle, but everywhere.   Stiff leather creaked.  Laces came undone, or burst.   The ropes bit into her wrists painfully.   Already forced to breathed shallowly through her nose, she snuffled desperately, feeling as if she would suffocate.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when the pressure had grown almost more than she could bear, the horrible flow of sticky-sweet matter stopped.  Jane was dropped to the wooden planks of the platform like a sack of potatoes, gasping for breath and gagging.   She heaved, but nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, on a dare, she'd entered an eating contest against a rather large lion barbarian -- and won.   She'd been miserable for days afterwards, though.  That was the only experience she could possibly compare to this.  Except this was about a hundred times worse.  She felt -- <i>full.</i>   Really, <i>really</i> full.  And not just in her stomach; all over, as though she'd been filled like a wineskin.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, Nasha laughed again, and Jane looked up blearily to see those cold, blue eyes staring down at her from out of a -- slender face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what a <i>relief</i> this is!\"  the necromancer said, smoothing the fabric over her now-flat stomach.  \"I've had that thing in me for nearly a month, and I was getting better every day.   I almost regretted taking the job.  You really have no idea what it's like to be<i> fat</i>.\"  She grinned.  \"Though I suppose you do now, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, Jane looked down at herself.   It was true.  She wasn't just full.  She was fat -- so fat she was bursting out of her leathers everywhere.   She must have put on sixty pounds in a matter of minutes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ruined as a thief.  She wanted to cry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNasha kicked Jane in one chubby flank.  \"Aren't you the lucky one, though?  It's catch and release, today.  We're throwing you back until you get a little bigger.\"  She leaned close.  \"And you <i>will</i> get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you, you--\"  Jane was interrupted by the gag wrapping back into her mouth.   She tried to fight, but with her hands tied, the knots biting cruelly into her pudgy wrists, and weighed down, she couldn't manage much.  It must have been enough to make them nervous, though, because she felt something slam into the side of her head.  She felt stars, and then blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up back at the inn, with a splitting headache.  She only had to look down at herself to come to the gut-wrenching realization that it hadn't just been a nightmare.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane couldn't bring herself to get out of bed. She lay there simply staring in disbelief at the changes she'd undergone the previous night. How could this have happened? Was this some sort of spell? She raised her arm and whimpered at its weight. More so, she turned her wrist about, unable to see any muscle definition. Whatever had filled her up seemed to have settled, for she no longer felt inflated, just heavy. Then she recalled the spicy, doughy bread-like substance that poured down her throat. Maybe that wasn't magic at all. Maybe it was just some strange poison! Jane smiled and shot to an upright sitting position, only to frown at the sound of the bed's creaking frame. Adding insult to injury, the curve of her tummy poofed out and hid the view of her undergarments. \"Great,\" Jane began, \"I can move now, but on the off chance Nasha <i>wasn't</i> lying, I'd better find a fix to this and fast!\" Swinging her legs out over the side of the bed, Jane grimaced at the sensation of a slight jiggle to her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lazing around is the last thing I want to do in this state.\" The fluffy rogue rose to her feet and at last inspected herself in her room's standing mirror. She couldn't help but hold a steady frown. Although the weight was distributed evenly across her body, she had always been more of a slight pear shape than a true hourglass, even if it was almost unnoticeable in her former body. Whatever affliction that wretched necromancer placed on her had only amplified this part of her, and she could see her hips had widened significantly, with a healthy layer of fat piled around her thighs and rear end. This was not to say that the rest of her went unscathed, as she could no longer see her precious six-pack of abs, and her bosom strained against her linen chest bindings. Jane cupped her hands over her somewhat enlarged bosom and sighed. \"At least I still have my center of balance.\" She patted her backside and immediately flushed red as a small ripple spread around the point of impact. \"That witch is so dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the infuriating changes that had affected her physique, Jane hastily rummaged through her belongings, desperate to find anything that would fit her less-than-fit form. The rogue tossed aside a small pile of leathers before finally holding up a short, red tunic and matching skirt. \"My priestess costume?\" She had forgotten she still had that, but it looked loose enough to at least contain her small potbelly and wide hips. Without delay, Jane pulled the tunic over her head and slipped her arms through the long, wide sleeves. She couldn't help but notice her barely doughy upper arms pressed against the sleeves, but it was nothing too uncomfortable, and they wouldn't rip. The skirt, however, was another story. Jane managed to slip her feet through the top, but once the waist of the red skirt reached her thighs, the task became a bit more daunting. Inch by inch she slunk down into the skirt, only to meet resistance at her generous backside. Tugging the cloth up beneath the minor shelf of her ass sent a wave of jiggling through both cheeks, and Jane clenched her teeth in frustration. With one final yank, the skirt popped up over her buttocks, leaving Jane to sigh in relief. It was not the most comfortable, but it still fit her enough to allow for mobility. \"For now...\" Jane muttered, considering the warning Nasha had flaunted in her face. The rogue needed a cure as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter repacking her flurry of clothing and equipment, Jane fastened her dagger to one forearm for easy access, noting that the bracer was a little more snug on her wrist than usual. Packing complete, Jane stood and caught sight of herself in the mirror once more. \"Oh, come on.\" She had forgotten the openness of the red priestesses and the clothing that reflected their lifestyles. Jane's tunic fell short around her midriff, something she would never object to in her usual physique, but now it did nothing but put her pudgy tummy on full display. In order to better worship their fertility goddess, the priestesses also wear their skirts in the fashion of \"low-riders\" to better display their hips. With Jane's added poundage, this would allow onlookers to not only see the lower curve of her belly, but the clothing's tightness created a small muffin top around her hips and waistline. \"Perfect...\" Rolling her eyes, Jane immediately swaddled herself in her heavy, winter cloak before slinging the pack over her shoulder. \"At least it's cold enough to cover up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane locked the door behind her and marched down the stairs into the inn's main hall. The catlike innkeeper waved her down with one furry paw behind the bar, flung his dishrag onto his shoulder, and smiled as she approached. Jane did all she could to hide her softer face, and hastily tossed a handful of coins onto the bar along with her room key. \"Thank you for the room, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks needed, but are you really leaving us so soon? We barely had the chance to...\" Much like Marcus, the cat man gave her a once over before continuing. \"We hardly got to know you, miss.\" He casually rested an elbow on the counter top and twirled the key around his finger. \"Sure we can't interest you in some breakfast before you head out?\" As Jane shook her head, her stomach protested without missing a beat. The loud, churning growl could be heard across the quiet, empty inn. In response, the cat man flicked his ears and spread a fanged grin. Jane could only blush and turned away, looking to the door. \"Our special this morning is buttermilk pancakes with fresh fruit.\" He paused, teasing one whisker between two clawed fingers. Jane stopped, craning her head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pancakes?\" She unconsciously licked her lips. The thought just occurred to her that she didn't eat a proper meal the night before, other than that disgusting ooze from Nasha, and even though the thought of that <i>thing</i> pouring inside her nauseated Jane to no end, she couldn't help but feel a little hungry. \"Sure. Just one though. I'm very busy this morning.\" Without delay, the cat man nodded and turned toward the kitchen. He shouted something incomprehensible and offered Jane a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat, miss. I'll have them right up for you.\" He nodded again and returned to his work of polishing glasses from the night before. Jane wondered why barkeeps always seemed to have an endless supply of things to clean. Maybe it came with the personality of owning an inn. Who knew. All Jane knew was that she felt hungrier and hungrier as the seconds ticked by, and as the pain settled into her stomach, she found herself a seat to knead the dough of her soft tummy into submission. Jane looked around the room, and noticed it was completely empty save for herself and the innkeeper. Strange that no one would be up this early. Where were all of the other guests? But before she could think too hard on the matter, the innkeeper returned with a platter piled high with at least a dozen pancakes smothered in rich, golden syrup and heavy with butter. Each small pile was dripping with minced strawberries and blueberries. Jane's jaw went slack at the sight and she whipped her head to stare down the cat. He simply smiled back. \"Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said one! This is not one!\" Jane furrowed her brow and pointed tersely at the ridiculous portion of pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, miss. This is one: one order of pancakes.\" He raised a brow in confusion and folded his arms across his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sneaky bastard, I'm not paying for all of this!\" Jane placed both hands on the platter and grunted as she slid it away, only managing to move it a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you already have... breakfast was included in your room rental.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... really? Well, I am hungry, so I suppose I should at least eat some of them.\" She grunted again, sliding the massive mound of carbs back toward her. \"Thanks.\" She shot the last word back to the cat before completely ignoring him. He bowed silently and strode into the kitchen behind the bar, leaving Janeto her meal in peace. \"Wow... that is a lot of pancakes.\" As if to agree, her stomach immediately growled its impatience. \"All right, all right.\" The rogue scooped up her cutlery and began to slice up the first pancake. Dipping it into the rich, sticky syrup, she brought the blueberry laden bite to her lips and went wide-eyed as it hit her tongue. These were the most amazing pancakes she'd ever tasted! They were incredible! Chewing and swallowing, she wasted no time in carving up the remainder of the first pancake. Jane smacked her lips and nodded to herself. \"That should hold me over--\" But in defiance, her stomach growled violently. \"What? Oh, come on. One is plenty!\" Although they were awfully tasty, and she hadn't tried the strawberry pancakes yet...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would be a shame to waste so much\". Jane made a start on her second pancake, this one tasting even better than the first. Before she knew it, she had finished the pancake. Her stomach gurgled once more. \"Ok. Maybe one more\", she soothed. But three wasn't enough. She helped herself to another, and another, until she had finished the entire plate of pancakes. \"Whew! Those were good!\" Jane cooed, patting her stuffed gut. Her waistline now a couple more inches wider than after it's enhancement the previous night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should really start to ask around town and get some answers\", Jane thought to herself. Just as the thought crossed her mind the landlord returned again to where she was sitting. \"Ah good! I knew you wouldn't be able to help yourself\" the cat-man stated with a grin, almost menacingly. \"Oh yes they were lovely. Thank you\", Jane responded cheerfully. \"I really should get going now though\", she added, clutching her belly. The landlord moved closer to her, and in a tempting voice said \"but surely you would want to try our most highly rated breakfast? It's even better than those pancakes!\". \"Even better than the pancakes!?\", she replied quizzically, licking her lips sub-consciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane had some thinking to do.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane shook her head and prodded her belly into silence. \"One is enough.\" After a small fit of grumbles, her stomach ceased its retorts, allowing Jane to push her chair out and rise to her feet. As if on cue, the innkeeper returned from the kitchen accompanied by two of his kitchen staff, a pair of female cat people. Jane offered them a polite smile, but the only stared back. \"Thank you, but I'm not that hungry.\" No response. \"I told you I only needed one!\" She laughed her smoky laugh, but the joke was lost on them. Their stares turned sour, and the trio approached, setting the rogue on edge. \"What's wrong?\" They continued to close the distance, hands at their sides. \"I already paid for the meal, what's the big deal?\" No words, but the pair of females each drew a length of rope from behind their backs, and the innkeeper held out a very familiar burlap sack. That's when the realization hit her. The ceremony! How could she have forgotten? There were enough torches present for the whole... town. All three cats flashed their fanged grins as they leapt at Jane. She hopped back, but tripped on the hem of her long, winter cloak. Crashing to the floor, the plump rogue had no time to fend them off. Both staff members grappled for her wrists and held them fast. Jane thrashed her thick thighs, landing a direct hit into the cat's cajones. He yelped and crumpled into a heap at her feet. Both females almost had her wrists secured when the rogue relaxed her arms, only to catch them off-guard by quickly flinging them together, bashing both kitties' heads together. With all three incapacitated, the rogue scrambled to her feet and fetched her cloak. A light sweat broke out beneath her scarlet garments, and Jane knew she would not have been so winded if she were sixty pounds lighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go.\" Throwing the cloak about her shoulders, Jane set out into the bright, winter morning. The sun reflecting off the fallen snow nearly blinded her after the dimly lit inn, and the scent of the town flooded her nose. Blacksmith smoke, roasting meats, even the snow itself. Anything beat the stuffy tavern air. Jane remembered her discovery, and scanned the street, again noticing that familiar feeling of being watched. She threw on her hood, clamped the cloak tighter around her body, and marched through the snow toward a nearby alley. Without a plan, Jane had no idea how to remove the curse, or poison, or potion, or whatever was causing her body to swell up. Where could she find a cure? Who would know how to fix it? Jane mulled over the possibilities, and snapped her fingers in the cold air. \"A witch.\" Witches were renowned for their knowledge of curses, poisons, and potions alike. If anyone could help her, it would be a witch. But where could she find one? They weren't exactly accepted by society, so finding one would be difficult. Nobody in this town could be trusted, but Jane knew one man who had an affinity for the unusual: Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping between the alleys and shadows of the town, Jane successfully avoided suspicion and now stood before the door to Marcus' shop. Pushing it open, she peered inside. No sign of the murdered wolf from the night before could be seen, and Jane stepped out of the cold, morning air. \"Hello?\" She called in a low voice, and without delay the familiar businessman strode out from behind a pile of junk, some odd gizmo clutched in one hand and a magnifying class in the other. His eyes went wide and he dropped both items, turning to rush for the back door. Jane cursed and charged after him, but the shopkeeper knocked over a pile of books behind him, causing Jane to once again trip over her cloak. Modesty was clearly not worth the price of agility. Shedding her winter wear, the rogue dashed after him, her winter weight bouncing in plain sight. \"Get back here, Marcus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfish store owner turned about and whirled a small object at Jane, landing a direct hit against her forehead. Collapsing in a daze, Jane shook her head in time to see the shopkeeper slam the back door behind him. Damn it. He was her only connection. Jane rubbed the small lump above her nose and grabbed hold of whatever had knocked her down. \"Of course.\" It was yet another statue of Jane and the Sitharli, but this version reflected her current size, and she was posed clinging to his feet in groveling worship. \"Disgusting...\" The rogue tossed it aside and brushed off her skirt. Then it dawned on her. \"Wait, a minute. This guy collects all sorts of stuff. Maybe <i>he</i> has something here I can use.\" After all, Marcus was clearly involved in her capture somehow, so he must know something about what happened to her. Tapping a finger to her chin, Jane meandered through the piles of seemingly useless junk until she stopped at his office in the rear of the store. \"He's got to have <i>some</i> record of his business here.\" Finding the door locked, Jane grinned as she scooped up the nearby statue of herself and smashed it through the glass window, causing the word 'Office' to scatter at her feet. The rogue reached through and unlocked it from the inside before swinging the door open wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room sat a filing cabinet and a desk, both plain and unassuming, but atop the desk rested a large book bound in purple leather. A single eye was carved into the cover, and Jane flipped it open to the page containing the bookmark. There in ink was her name, followed by the words: 'bearer of the gift.' What gift? The statue? The <i>thing</i> inside her? She continued reading and flipped to the previous page. There she saw Nasha's name and the description of  a remote hut out in the wilderness wherein an old crone had been contacted by the Sitharli's minions. It couldn't have been more than an hour from town on foot, and Jane decided it was her best bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sneaking past the guards and leaving town, Jane hiked through the quiet, windless forest in the direction mentioned in the book. She decided it would be wise to bring it with her, and now carried it in her backpack. The plump rogue was most thankful for remembering to grab her cloak, as even the high noon sun was not enough to warm the wintry weather. Her breath hung in the air, but before long she saw the telltale sign of fireplace smoke rising over the treetops. Crunching through the snow, Jane caught sight of a large, ramshackle hut, the source of the smoke. Cautiously, she approached the window and peered inside. For all she knew it could be another trap set by that wretched Nasha. To her amazement, there was no one inside. Above the fire sat a large cauldron, and Jane knew this had to be the right place. She checked the door, found it unlocked, and slipped inside. The hut consisted of a single, round room with the fireplace at its center. The walls were lined with bookshelves and workbenches piled high with beakers of technicolor tonics. Her salvation could lay within any of them, but it would be foolish to drink anything without first consulting the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the smell of something absolutely tantalizing caught her nose. Jane followed it back to the cauldron and peered inside. It appeared to be some sort of meat stew with boiled vegetables and a rich, savory broth. Her mouth watered simply seeing and smelling it, and Jane noticed an empty, clean bowl and spoon resting on an adjacent table. It <i>had</i> been several hours since she had that one pancake... surely the witch could part with one bowl. Without second thought, Jane ladled the soup into the bowl, filling it to the brim. She plopped down into a nearby chair and blew across the soup's steamy surface. It smelled even better than before! Greedily bringing it to her lips, she slurped it down, feeling the warmth trickle down her throat and settle in her belly. It was more than delicious; it was heavenly! Who knew witches could cook something so tasty! One spoonful after another brought the spicy soup to her eager mouth. Before she knew it, the stew was gone and she had already licked the bowl clean. A small burp rumbled from her sated stomach, and Jane couldn't help but notice a spicy, bread-like... aftertaste. \"Oh, no... not good!\" She hadn't noticed, but the stew tasted exactly like the <i>thing</i> Nasha spewed into her throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Jane could only whimper as the changes took hold. The tingling started at her chest, spreading out to each arm. Although not clad in her skin-tight leathers, Jane felt the swelling beneath her tunic nonetheless. First her arms thickened slightly, now stretching the sleeves around her doughy triceps. Her wrists grew even softer, straining her forearm sheath to uncomfortable limits. Even her fingers now looked puffier as dimples began forming between her knuckles. A warmth rose in her chest with each breath, and Jane winced as the linen bindings now squeezed against her swelling bosom. Between the first ceremony and the soup she had easily grown from a B cup to a solid double C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?! Why can't I catch a break?!\" Jane clutched her chest, but grimaced as the warmth roiled into her tummy, spreading out over the soft flesh. The same sensation of swelling took hold, as her slight curved belly now pushed forth. Her tunic began to ride up, exposing more of the pale, round flesh. Where the extent of her tummy had previously sat as a pronounced muffin top, it now pushed out at least two more inches, stopping just before it could succumb to gravity and reach her lap. But the changes were not done just yet, and the last warmth reached her buttocks, filling out her already round ass, deepening the crease between her rump and thighs. Those also grew, and now touched near her crotch. Walking would be bothersome if they scraped together... Finally subsiding, Jane had clearly gained another fifteen pounds from just the one bowl of soup. Whatever this witch had planned, this stuff was far stronger than the goop Nasha used. Jane needed a plan and fast. Could she trust the witch?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane placed the bowl on the table and growled beneath her breath. That bitch of a witch would pay for this. Jane rose from the wooden chair with a little more difficulty than when she sat down, and rested a hand on her marginally bigger belly. Although she still bore a primarily pear-shaped physique, this batch of soup added more bulk to her middle than to her bottom. If she wasn't careful, she could easily turn apple-shaped and lose her center of balance. Then she'd never be able to fight Nasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeaky sneeze sounded outside, and Jane shuffled to the window, slowly growing accustomed to her growing bulk. Jane wiped her sleeve across the dusty pane and peered through the circle of clean glass. It was her! The supposed witch was home, and from what Jane could see, she didn't look to be a very tough opponent. The witch was young, far younger than the title might suggest. The woman couldn't have been a day over thirty, and she slunk toward the door in her form-fitting black robe. For one who serves the Sitharli, she was awfully slender. Odd. Once the witch was out of sight of the window, Jane tiptoed behind the door and waited. With a creak it slowly opened, and the young woman glided into her home, yawning softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane wasted no time in pouncing on the small, thin woman, utilizing her new girth to pin the witch to the floor. Having been tackled from behind, the woman shrieked in panic before the rogue could bash a nearby candelabra across the back of her head. With the single blow, she was down and out. Jane sighed and grunted to her feet. Time to work quickly. Jane reached into her pouch and removed her climbing rope, eyes darting between the unconscious witch and the chair beside the cauldron. Interrogation time! She gripped the rope tight and made her way toward the prone recluse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're awake. Good,\" Jane grinned as she sat across from the bound witch. The woman in black wriggled and struggled, but could not break free from Jane's deft knots. The witch's blue eyes met Jane's gaze, and she wrinkled her nose. Jane could only smirk and gestured to her plump body. \"As you can see, I was a little hungry and sampled some of your soup. It was delicious, but I think it might be a little fattening.\" The witch kept her mouth shut and just stared. Jane cleared her throat and stirred the cauldron with a wooden ladle. \"I have questions.\" Silence. \"This can go two ways: you spill it, or I help you fill out that dress some more. Understand?\" The rogue rang the ladle against the cauldron's side for good measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never betray the great and powerful Sitharli!\" The witch spat on Jane's boot, and the rogue scowled back. She nodded in acknowledgment and rose from her seat, moving to a nearby workbench. The witch went wide-eyed and started thrashing her feet against the chair legs to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least now I know you can talk, so I won't feel so bad about this next part,\" Jane collected a leather strap with a ring at its center, a long canvas tube, and a funnel. The tube looked like a miniature fire hose, and Jane quickly stuck the funnel into one end of it, and approached the witch's face with the leather strap. The captive kept her mouth tightly shut, and so Jane opened up with a heavy right hook to the side of her head, dazing the bound woman enough to loosen her jaw. In that instant Jane slipped the ring into the witch's mouth and fastened the leather behind her head, effectively keeping her mouth opened. She groaned in frustration, but before she could belt out a real scream, Jane stuck the other end of the tube into the metal ring, leaving the end atop the witch's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance, lady.\" Jane stirred the cauldron with one hand and held aloft the funnel with the other. A wicked grin spread across the rogue's soft cheeks, and the thin witch scowled, shaking her head in defiance. \"Wrong choice. Bottom's up!\" Jane ladled a few ounces of the thick, warm stew into the funnel, and watched as it slid down into the slim woman's mouth. Sputtering and coughing, she tried her hardest not to swallow, but it was swallow or choke, so the stew soon found its way down her esophagus. A muffled scream rose in her throat, but was soon cut off by the oncoming soup. One ladle down, and Jane lowered the funnel. \"Still feel like resisting? I have a <i>lot</i> more soup to go,\" Jane chuckled viciously, \"and you still look hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shake of the head and a scowl, and Jane shrugged before scooping more soup down the funnel, this time two ladles full. At this point, the changes were becoming visible. The witch's form-fitting black robes were getting a little snug all over, but particularly around her middle. The black fabric was incrementally smoothing out the creases as a small paunch began to form on her waistline. Her petite bosom was also pressing into the dress, forming a bridge of fabric between her breasts as they went up a cup size from their original A's. Overall she looked to have gained about five pounds. Strangely, there was hardly any change to the woman's butt or thighs. She must be a natural apple shape. Well, it was her decision to keep it coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, tasty! You're one hell of a cook, lady! But something tells me this wasn't your dinner, huh?\" Jane pulled the tube out of her mouth and grabbed the witch by the jaw, leaning in close. \"Talk or I swear I'll feed you until you can't walk!\" The witch went wide-eyed and shook her head. \"You think your master is scarier than me? We've just gotten started!\" Jane pulled off the funnel and stuck the far end of the tube directly into the cauldron. She took the witch's side and held it in front of her own mouth. \"This is your <i>final</i> warning.\" The witch simply looked away. Jane scoffed and put the tube into her mouth, sucking in to begin siphoning the soup. Once the negative pressure began, the soup started traveling down the length of the canvas tube. Jane pulled the tube out of her mouth and popped it into the witch's just as the soup reached the end, causing it to stream down the bound woman's throat. She swallowed hard, tears welling in her eyes as she stared blankly into space. With the faster siphoning, the changes came about quicker as well. The witch's body began ballooning out all over. Her bust pushed against her robes, swelling from B's to C's. Her belly stretched out another few inches, straining the fabric of her robes to the limit. The witch's arms barely fluffed up, still not visible within the confines of her sleeves. Her thighs nor butt changed in the least, and she began to look five months pregnant with the fattening soup! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low whimper escaped her lips between swallows, but Jane only crossed her arms. \"You can end this whenever you want. Just nod your head.\" The witch, however, did not obey. And still, the fattening formula flowed down her throat. At last her robes could no longer contain her growing girth and they burst down the middle from neck to navel, letting her bountiful bust and belly billow free. The tanned flesh of her trio of fleshy globes shone slick with sweat in the afternoon light, and each was heavily encased in fat. Her belly was both swollen and soft, like a basketball covered in pizza dough. Jane grimaced at the damage she had already done to the woman, and lifted the tube out of the cauldron. Once the remainder within drained into the witch's throat, she pulled the empty tube free. The flushed, fattened woman panted heavily as Jane removed the leather strap and ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes, however, were still not complete. The woman's breasts continued to swell forth, now resting atop the fluffy, soup-filled belly like two wineskins fit to burst. They easily filled a DD cup now and her exposed, pink areola were puffy like small pink saucers. Her belly's growth slowed now, changing the contents from liquid to fat. It didn't quite flatten out as much as soften and droop, the overhang of her tummy flesh now resting atop her slender thighs. Between her chest and tummy she must have packed on another thirty pounds. The disproportion of her fat was surreal, and Jane reached out to touch the product of her torture. Her fingers sunk into the soft belly, but the witch hissed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch me!\" Immediately, the rogue retracted her hand, looking over the woman tied to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk. I'm feeling merciful, but if you don't tell me what I need to know, I swear I will not stop until every last drop of that cauldron is in your stomach. And you still have more than half left.\" Jane sat back in her own chair and folded her arms across her soft chest, feeling her arms rest atop a pronounced tummy of her own. It wasn't nearly as bloated as the witch's, but it was still not the toned abs she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... you win.\" The witch hung her head, whimpering softly. \"What is it you want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane sat upright and shifted her weight in her seat. \"I want to go back to normal.\" Her eyes narrowed as she stared at the witch, and the woman across from her let out a maddened giggle. \"What's so funny?\" The rogue maintained her stern expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go back to normal! You can only grow bigger and bigger!\" She finally raised her head and glared wickedly at Jane. \"That is both our fates now. The soup is a concentrated form of the enchanted ooze my mistress infested you with!\" A wide grin flashed across her face, and the witch cackled again. \"You will only grow larger and larger until the master, the sacred Sitharli deems you worthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crazy freak!\" She back-handed the woman and drew the dagger from her forearm, holding it to the woman's throat. \"What good are you to me alive?\" This seemed to sink in, and the witch gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait! Okay!\" She sighed and Jane only jabbed the dagger harder  against her throat, drawing a drop of blood. \"I can't make you normal, but I can stop the growing! There! In my alchemy kit! Drink the pink vial!\" Jane looked over and saw the vial. Can she trust the witch?</span></div></div>",

Isaac isn't a very exciting man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tells him about her \"profession\" as a warrior, and how she hasn't been doing much lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Isaac says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be so bad...  Except, you know, no money...\" Maria says.  \"I'm beginning to consider abandoning this job...  For what, though, I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably don't have to do that...  At least, not if you don't want to.  I think I might have a 'lead' for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Maria asks, her interest piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I've been hearing stories, lately, about this cave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a cave.  It's full of monsters and traps, but also full of treasure.  You might check that out; if nothing else, you might salvage something that'll at least fetch enough coin to feed you 'til your next job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.  Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...  Somewhere around here.  People are a bit vague about that.  You might look around the base of the mountain...\"  Isaac gestures toward a mountain 500 yards away.  \"I hope that helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does, it does.  Thank you, Isaac; for the pears, and the information.\"  Maria rises from her sitting position, stretches, and heads toward the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait...  Before you go, you might as well take another pear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria accepts the pear and continues on her way.  Isaac stays behind, eating a pear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a nice girl...\" Isaac says to himself, between mouthfuls of pear.  \"I hope he doesn't give her much trouble...\"</span></div></div>",

After making a few foolish decisions of what track to follow to get her back to the main road, she soon found herself even deeper in the woods, in an area that was ruled by flora. By now her hunger was returning, the snack she had earlier only helping to quench it for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox never felt so helpless in her life. She felt like crying, even though she told herself to take deep breath and remain calm. But how could she if she was doomed to wonder the forest untill she succumbed to starvation and exposure? She quickly wiped away a tear that threatened to spill from  her eye and soile her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to give up all hope, to throw her pack down, crawl up against a tree and weep like a cub when she heard the soothing sound of running water and someone singing a happy tune. Maria was overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the sound, running through bushes and over uneven earth. The sweet sound grew louder and louder. She finally came to a stop when she reached a clearing. The river wasn't very large, more like very large stream, fed by a rumbling waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that Maria found the creature that was singing the sweet song; he was tall, at least six feet, and well-built with grey fur and a white underbelly. The water soaked his fur as he  stood under the waterfall bathing himself, completely nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear him was a backpack. A large axe leaned against it, gleaming in the sun. From the look of these  items, Maria could easily determine that he was a barbarian-wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf turned and his bright yellow eyes spotted Maria staring at him. He didn't shy away, in fact he tainted the fox by turning and swaying his rump, saying:  \"Got a nice view from there,  m'lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria frowned at the wolf's rudeness. He was a barbarian, that was for sure. But she wasn't about to be chased away by a brute's obscene manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steped forth boldly. \"Can you help me? I'm lost and I need to get back to the...\" She was going to say 'main road', but that would have left her back at square one. Instead she continued with, \"I mean to a cave. I need to find a cave in the mountains. You wouldn't know where I could find it perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and flashed Maria, stepping out from under the waterfall. He shooked his body like a dog,  water droplets flying everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to the cave of the Lipomancer, I see. Well, I do know where it is, but it's gonna cost ya.\" He tucked at his scrotum to emphasize what the 'price' was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria groaned in frustration; she didn't have time for this folly. \"Listen here, tramp,\" the fox said coldly, taking a new approach to her situation, \"I don't have time for this. I'm starving over here. Now, you either tell or go to hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" the wolf said, raising his paws in defense, but he was still grinning like some sort of stupid jester, \"I was just toying with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria snorted. \"You better be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, names Rouge,\" he said, pulling up his breeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria,\" the fox said, feeling that it was only polite to reveal her name as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge looked towards the sky suddenly. \"Getting dark,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then noticed that he was right. She must have been lost for hours in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell had come from this direction, but there didn't seem to be anything there; the clearing was empty, for the most part, save for a wide, flat stone in the center, reminiscent of a stage, encircled by a number of strange cup-like stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anythi-\" Maria began; she stopped speaking, though, when she looked a little bit to the left of the clearing and saw the largest oak tree she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...  What is this?\"  Maria asked (rhetorically, of course) as she stepped toward the leviathan arbor to give it a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree was enormous; fifty times taller than the average oak, and fifty times as wide.  Its numerous boughs were as trees themselves, and from their \"boughs,\" among an ocean of green, hung acorns the size of pumpkins.  How something this large could possibly exist...  Boggling, to the mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stood in amazement, forgetting her hunger in her awe, looking up and down this wonder of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous acorn fell to the ground moments later with a mighty thud, jarring Maria and returning her attention to the world...  And her hunger.  She stared at the acorn for a second or two, before picking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acorn was quite heavy; twice as heavy as a pumpkin would be.  \"I wonder how it tastes?\"  Maria lifted it to her mouth, and attempted to wrap her vulpine muzzle around the nut, but found the acorn's curvature and uncharacteristic solidness made it difficult to penetrate.  She lowered the nut back to the ground, and grumbled; she wouldn't be eating <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly three feet away from the undefeated acorn was another acorn, dropped by the tree long before Maria arrived.  She went to examine it, and found that it had a chunk missing from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something managed to bite it?\"  She figured it was a wild hog of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if the hog is still around?\"  Maria began to circle the oak's perimeter, having long forgotten the scent that brought her here.  However, it sprang back to her mind when she'd made it a quarter-way around the tree; she'd found its source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gargantuan bee hive, hidden within a massive hollow in the tree's side; the hungry vixen had smelled honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my!\" she said, astonished once more.  She peered inside the gaping mouth and into the cavernous hive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hive appeared to occupy nearly half of the oak's trunk.  Its walls were tiled neatly with large, hexagonal honeycombs, all dripping with golden honey.  The honey poured like lazy waterfalls down the hive's sides, from farther up than the vixen could see, and pooled at the bottom, nearly 10 feet into the ground below the tree, forming a reservoir of the sweet substance; an edge, of which, was right by the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf particular note, however, was something Maria did <i>not</i> see:  The residents.  The hive was conspicuously devoid of the expected honeybees.  None were to be found crawling along the walls, nor were there any to be found buzzing around outside.  What kind of bees would build a hive like this?  What kind of bees would just leave it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How odd...\"  The vixen wanted to get a closer look inside, but paused.  Maria was certain the bees were nowhere around, but she was wary of the hive anyway.  What if the bees came back?  They'd be pretty angry if they came home to find a stranger had invaded their home, and Maria did not want to meet angry bees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it'd be a shame to pass up the chance to get any of that honey; she <i>was</i> hungry, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria decided to dip a paw into the honey reservoir.  She pulled it out, and gave it a lick; this honey was exceptionally sweet, and wondrously smooth!  She continued to lick her sticky paw, until the honey was all gone.  She licked around her muzzle to get any that she'd left behind, and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen certainly wasn't leaving, now...  She'd found her lunch.  Or, rather, dinner; the sun had begun to set.</span></div></div>",

And how pigs ate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could just lean in there and slurp some of the honey up...  But...  Eating like a pig is <i>embarrassing</i>,\" Maria bemoaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she didn't want to eat like a pig, she also didn't want to get her paw sticky.  And nobody was around to see her, anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...  Alright...\"  It never took much to change Maria's mind, especially when she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria began to position herself over the lip of the hive's opening, trying to attain both balance and comfort.  She eventually found the right position:  The lip would be right under Maria's bustline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving found the right spot, she thrust her muzzle into the honey reservoir and began to suck up as much of the delicious honey as she could.  Her rear-end began to \"dance,\" much as it had earlier, swishing left and right, up and down, as her tail wagged back and forth.  Every minute or so, she'd raise her muzzle and gasp for air, giggle giddily while honey dripped from her muzzle into her cleavage, and return her lips to the reservoir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes of engorging herself on honey, Maria was still going, hungry as ever.  Her belly, which by all accounts should be stretched taut and near-to-bursting, had actually become a bit softer, as had the rest of her body.  Her ass, still dancing, now jiggled and bounced a bit as she swayed, becoming thicker as time went by.  Her hips, voluptuous and full in the first place, had become even fuller, and added a bit more momentum to her \"dance.\"  Indeed, this honey seemed to metabolize <i>very</i> quickly, turning almost-instantly into fat on the orange vixen's frame.  She hadn't noticed herself becoming heavier, though; she was only paying attention to her hunger and the sweet, sweet honey right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer focus was broken, however, when the honey level of the 50-foot-long reservoir had dropped 5 inches, leaving it out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwwww...\" Maria whined.  \"I'm still hungry, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and stretched a bit, then tried to reposition herself.  She leveraged herself on her thickened tummy, and leaned even further into the reservoir, beginning her binge anew, eating even faster, all the while ignoring how her armor was becoming tighter, or how she was beginning to fill up more of the hive's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly grew as fat gathered, smothering the lip of the hive's mouth with pillowy vixen-flesh; her asscheeks did, as well, now not even needing Maria's swaying motion to send them into a hearty wobble; her hips and thighs were not spared, either, as they too became thicker and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms had become flabby, jiggling as they grasped whatever surface they could for leverage, and a second chin had begun to develop under her muzzle.  Her body, overall, was becoming thicker; she had to have gained 50 pounds since she started eating the honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she raised her muzzle up from the reservoir.  Something was troubling her...</span></div></div>",

Her armor creaked and groaned as her body resumed swelling with fat, each part of her apparently in a race to beat the others in growing bigger faster. The groans grew louder and more constant, mixing with her moaning and groaning. Moaning from the wonderful feeling of the wonderful honey flowing down her throat, and groaning from the increasing pressure the armor was putting on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp snaps and tearing follow in succession as her armor gave up the fight. First her chest piece broke under the strain of her swelling breasts and stomach; now free, they bounced before settling into place, lower than before under their weight.

She was now almost certainly trapped, but couldn't care less as long as the honey continued to fill her mouth. Her mind was blissfully unaware of the pounds that continue to pile on her body, bloating her frame with more and more jiggly wobbly fat.</span></div></div>",

The wonderful warm feeling spreading through her body, as well as the veil the honey was casting over her mind, caused the vixen to start to become sleepy. She continued to hold on, eating and eating as much of the honey she could reach. Diving her muzzle deep into the pool, she slurped it up, nearly inhaling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Maria, someone was standing at the edge of the clearing.

This didn\u2019t stop her gluttony as the honey formed into a thick viscous tendril flowing up and into her waiting mouth. So fed now, the veil of sleep encroaches on her mind and body.

In another, some strange monster has her trapped, its tentacles rammed into her every orifice, pumping her up like a balloon. More dreams pass through, each more extreme than the last, and Maria is shocked that some smart part of her isn\u2019t totally disturbed by what she dreams, that part maybe actually even liking the dreams. Eventually consciousness returns to her slowly, though her body still feels sluggish and overly warm, though the bed feels nice and soft. Groaning, she reaches up to toss the covers off, but stops when she is left to wonder how she got into a bed. Her eyes snap open and see two white furry mounds, with a third much larger one beyond. Then she remembers the tree with the honey, and fragments of what had happened to her, realizing that any activity is going to be much harder. Pinching herself, she resigns herself to the fact that this isn\u2019t a dream like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is completely naked and hugely swollen with fat; huge fleshy breasts heave as she breathes, and her bloated stomach rests heavily atop her pinning her down. She is somewhat surprised to see that she has been cleaned up, no sign of the honey that had ended up smeared across her during her time in the honey hollow. First attempts at movement only cause ripples and wobbles to cascade through her corpulent frame. Trying again and again, she is eventually able to slowly roll over enough that gravity is able to take over and pull her stomach down, though that almost causes her to roll to the floor from the momentum. Barely managing to catch herself from sliding all of the way off the edge of the bed, she has to stop and catch her breath. Now on her side, she is able to gradually force her way up so that her rounded form is sitting on the edge of the bed. Now able to see around without the rest of her body in the way, she sees that she is in a lavishly decorated bedroom, far more ornate than any of the inns or even homes that she regularly stayed in on her journeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Where am I?\u2019 she thinks to herself, looking around at her accommodations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive bed she occupies dwarfs her, even with her new larger body. She dreads to think of who would need such a huge bed, though that same small part from before is intrigued. Heaving her bulk up, she nearly loses her balance as all of her girth succumbs to gravity and tries to pull her over. Recovering slowly, she starts walking over to a window, bit it proves just as hard as any other motion. With each step, she has to force her legs against the sagging apron of belly fat that hangs to her knees, as well as forcing each leg against the other, as her thighs were so fat that they were completely in contact the whole time no matter how far she spread her legs. Eventually, she is able to reach the window, gasping for breath, chest heaving, and fur soaked through with sweat. Bracing herself against the side of the window and the windowsill, she is able to look outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing looked familiar for sure, there is forest land yes, but nothing that said that it is the forest that she was in when she was entranced by the honey. Mountains loomed off in the distance, but again nothing looked absolutely familiar. She has no better luck when looking closer, finding that she is in a huge stone keep or castle set within the forest. No recognition stirs as she looks down at the stone walls, though the angle isn\u2019t on her side. Fear creeps into her mind though, as her predicament sinks in: now nearly too fat to move, she is stuck somewhere with no idea where she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust perfect,\u201d she says to herself, wondering how she would get out of this, or <i>if</i> she would get out of this.</span></div></div>",

She'd covered her pink, coin-sized nipples with her hands, clutching as much of the the white-furred spheres as she could to hide them from a non-existent audience.  She tried to calm herself down; rationally, she knew that nobody would see her.  She told herself this a couple of times, and began to loosen up.  She released her breasts, letting them fall, bouncing as they dropped to hang enticingly from her chest.  She took her paws (Hands?  Whatever.), placed them behind her head and arched her back, thrusting her chest forward and jostling \"the twins\" a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened her back, afterward, and placed her paws on her wide, round hips.  The vixen bent over slightly, and wriggled her shapely rear as she flicked her tail up and down.

She walked along the reservoir, taking care not to get <i>too</i> much honey between her delicate toes.

She toppled forward with a cry, plummeting into the honey pool, and landing in it with a wet <i><b>splodge</b></i>. Maria immediately felt the sticky honey soaking into her fur, both weighing her down as it clung to her and sucking her deeper into the well of succulent sweetness. Her head now submerged below the honey thanks to her plunge, she desperately clawed her way to the surface in an attempt to get air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney was not like water: It was thick and hard to swim in. Maria was lucky that the pool wasn't very deep, and she found her footing on the reservoir's floor and pushed off of it with as much strength as she could muster. She felt herself rising up through the gooey lake and soon she burst through the surface with a loud gasp for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was shocked at what just happened, but otherwise unharmed. The honey dripped from Maria's fur, its sap stinging her eyes, but it tasted so divine when she licked it off her lips. The nectar only reached up to Maria's neck now that she had made her way to the surface, making it easy for her to only lower her head, and suck up the sweet juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria drank the sap, oblivious to what it was doing to her body. Under the honey's surface, her body expanded. Her breasts grew larger, fuller, and plumper. Her gut both swelled up with honey and fat, growing larger and larger. Her butt cheeks grew bigger, becoming a more prominent feature on her body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maria was finally finished, she swam to the side. With much effort, the fox was able to climb out, honey pouring down her curvaceous body. Maria had consumed so much of the heavy sap now, all she could do was lay there on the side, rubbing her bloated stomach. Never had did Maria feel as full as she did now. Fatigue settled in, and Maria felt  her eyes close. She slowly drifted into the land of slumber.</span></div></div>",

It was a loud laugh, but instead of a sinister tune, it sounded more like it came from an elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the laughter had died down a bit a large figure dropped down out of the tree. He was wearing full plate armor with a bandoleer strapped across the chest plate, a sword strapped to his left hip, a shield on to his right arm, and a large backpack on his back. When he pulled off his helmet she realized he was a grey wolf with sky-blue eyes. \"Hello!\" He said, crouching down in order to get to her eye level. \"Um...\" Maria said, trying to process all that had just happened. \"Hi?\" The wolf let out another big laugh. He took a minute to calm himself before smiling and resuming talking. \"Sorry about that, today is just a wonderful day to laugh is it not?\" He said, opening his arms as though to gesture at everything. \"The sun is shining, the wind is blowing, the trees as rustling! But you don't see anything to be merry about do you? Why is that?\" He leaned a forward a bit to get closer to her. Maria rolled her eyes at the wolf's question. \"It's hard to be happy at <b>anything</b> when you don't have anything to eat.\" She placed a paw on her toned belly as it let out another growl. The wolf merely smiled at this response, seeming not to have a care in the world. \"But you now have fruit to eat!\" He said, gesturing to the peach he dropped. \"And, if you ask me, that small belly of yours looks as though it could barely handle some Lembas much less that peach!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then moved over next to her (he was surprisingly agile for wearing full plate armor), picked up the peach, and sat down. Maria shifted away uncomfortably. \"Who are you again?\" She asked, eyeing him suspiciously. \"I don't think I caught your name.\" \"Because you didn't.\" He said, changing his face to a serious one for a few seconds before bursting into laughter. After he had calmed down once again, he handed her the peach. \"My apologies! I have just come from a feast at my homestead-elves host wonderful parties mind you-and I am in the greatest of moods! But you ask my name? I have a few names; The Wandering Knight, The Knight of the Forest, The Knight With No Castle, but my friends and acquaintances know me by Grunyar!\" He smiled at her but frowned when her belly growled again. \"I see you truly are hungry, come! The feast will still be going when we arrive and there should be more than enough food left!\" He sprang up, put his helmet back on, and dashed off to Maria's right.<i>Doesn't look like I have much of a choice.</i> Maria thought, taking the peach and running after him.</span></div></div>",

I can't run that fast!\" Grunyar glanced back, then slowed down to a walking pace so she could catch up. When she finally caught up she bent over and placed a paw on his shoulder. \"Jesus!\" She said between pants. \"How do you move so fast in that armor?\" Grunyar smiled. \"I've worn it for most of my adult life, it's become almost like a second skin to me.\" He said, looking down at her through his visor. After she caught her breath, they both began walking towards the mixed smell of meat and cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes of silence, Maria spoke. \"Hey, can I ask you something? Why do you live with elves since you're-ya know-a Wolf?\" She looked up at him when she said this, the setting sun making the shadows under his visor dark enough to where she couldn't see his face. He turned his head towards her, his cheery demeanor suddenly gone. \"I was 6 when my father and mother were murdered along the main road, bandits ambushed our caravan and slaughtered everything.\" He said, turning his head back toward their destination. \"I only survived because Lemidas, my adoptive father and the head of this elven village, led a group of them to drive off the bandits. They took me in and raised me as one of their own and I like to believe that they see me as much an elf as a wolf.\" He sniffed slightly, then shook his head. \"But the past cannot be changed, there is only the future to look forward to!\" Maria looked down at the ground. \"I'm sorry, I didn't know.\" Grunyar patted her back. \"It's alright, how could you have known? But on a happier note I assume you wish to know how I stayed in the trees with this armor?\" Maria nodded. \"Well,\" Said Grunyar, adjusting his sword. \"It's like I said, this armor is a second skin to me!\" He let out a big laugh and pulled off his helmet. \"We are almost there, come! You must meet my family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them walked into the elven village, the sound of music floated through the air along with the smell of various delicious foods. The only light other than the moon was the large bonfire in the center of the village, its blue flame magically lit in order to spare the trees. A crowd of elves gathered around the two as the entered, all were speaking to Grunyar and eyeing Maria suspiciously, speaking to Grunyar in their own tongue and pointing to her. After he (apparently) re-assured them, the elves led them both to a large hall. Outside of this hall stood a tall elf who looked as though he had seen most of his life pass with much adventure. \"Grunyar!\" He shouted, embracing the wolf. \"It is so good to see you my son!\" \"Father, I only left this morning.\" Replied Grunyar, blushing a little bit and hugging Lemidas back. \"I know my son!\" Said the elf, laughing. \"But any minute without your lightheartedness feels like a millennia! But come, come! I see you have brought a guest to our feast!\" Maria, realizing that she was being referred to, bowed. \"What is this?\" Said the elf, letting out more laughs. \"We do not require this formality! We just require you to eat something!\" Maria stood up. \"Thank you.\" She said, stepping inside.</span></div></div>",

Grunyar was growing on her and she (a little more than she admitted) was growing fond of his personality. But she soon brushed that thought aside and instead focused on what was at hand: food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria thought about what table to start on first, then finally decided to go for the sweets. Her belly grumbled loudly as she approached. \"I know, I know.\" She said, quickly grabbing a big slice of cake. Her mouth exploded with flavor and she immediately grabbed more sweets, stuffing them into her mouth, her butt doing a slight dance that made her tail go from side to side. She loved this food, and she didn't want to stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes of engorging herself on sweets, Maria was still going, hungry as ever. Her belly, which by all accounts should be stretched taut and near-to-bursting, had actually become a bit softer, as had the rest of her body. Her ass, still dancing, now jiggled and bounced a bit as she swayed, becoming thicker as time went by. Her hips, voluptuous and full in the first place, had become even fuller, and added a bit more momentum to her \"dance.\" Indeed, these sweets seemed to metabolize very quickly, turning almost-instantly into fat on the orange vixen's frame. She hadn't noticed herself becoming heavier, though; she was only paying attention to her hunger and the sweet, sweet food right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, she stopped to take a breather, noticing that not only was her armor tight, her belly was pushing up against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and stretched a bit, then tried to reposition herself. She stood now with her belly facing sideways in order to reach the table better, then resumed her feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly grew as fat gathered, smothering the lip of the table mouth with pillowy vixen-flesh; her asscheeks did, as well, now not even needing Maria's swaying motion to send them into a hearty wobble; her hips and thighs were not spared, either, as they too became thicker and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms had become flabby, jiggling as they grasped whatever surface they could for leverage, and a second chin had begun to develop under her muzzle. Her body, overall, was becoming thicker; she had to have gained 50 pounds since she started eating the honey.</span></div></div>",

So sweet...\" Maria sighs.  \"So wonderful...\"  The swelling orange vixen is losing herself to euphoria; her thoughts are becoming less organized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaps out of it, though, when a single thought enters her mind:  That of a pressure in her abdomen.  \"Oooooh...  Getting a bit tight...\" she says hazily.  \"Wait...  What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had only just become aware of the fact that she'd been growing fatter.  \"Oh, my...\" she gasps, poking a bit of white-furred flesh spilling out from her bodice.  She giggles a bit; it's ticklish.  But she's still a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" she says.  \"I'm...  Getting fat?  How?\"  The vixen stares at her belly-flesh, watching it slowly, slowly rise like bread in an oven.  She gives it another poke, and another, each time trying to stifle her laughter.  Apparently, the flower-oil has made her both fatter <i>and</i> more sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it tickles!\" she squeals as she grabs the pillowy vixenflesh with both of her paws and massages it.  She breaks out into hysterical laughter; euphoria's setting in once more, but not completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria sighs wistfully.  \"I can't remember the last time I've had so much fun, or been so happy...\"  She sighs once more.  \"I've been a warrior for as long as I could thrust a sword...  And I've never been good at it.  I can never make enough money to make ends meet, and I never have anywhere to go...\"  A tear comes to the vixen's eye, and her green irises become misty.  \"I've always been hungry...  Always been alone...  But what else can I do?  Nothing.  Being a warrior's the best I can do...\"  Her euphoria's been sufficiently squelched.  \"I wish...  I wish I didn't have to...  I just want to be here with these flowers...\"  She inhales deeply through her nostrils, breathing in much of the flowers' aroma.  \"No responsibilities...  No cares...  Like a kit again...\"  She lays a paw on her belly, feeling it a bit, and giggles.  \"If only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind wanders to memories of herself, much younger; when she was a child.  Memories of being back home (what <i>used</i> to be home, before she left) in the village she was born.  A tiny, tiny kit, with not a care in the world.  She'd always had enough to eat, and a warm bed to sleep in...  No monsters to slay but the ones she'd imagined.  No swords to heft but the branch she'd picked up from beneath the willow.  And no armor to wear; she didn't need any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd climb the tree right outside of her family's cottage.  She'd chase butterflies through tall grass, over by the pond, pouncing on them if they dared to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she'd roll through the field of daisies, sending petals flying into the warm breeze on a summer's day, and coming up smelling so sweetly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria snaps back to reality, and a smile comes across her muzzle.  She was <i>surrounded</i> by a field of flowers.  And she was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time...  To be a kit again!\" she squeals.  She rolls onto her belly, laughing as the petals of the flowers brush her sensitive flesh, and gets up onto all fours.  The added weight, nearly 80 pounds since she arrived, is a bit difficult to maneuver with, but she manages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity, however, is making itself apparent; Maria's new weight tries to pull her down, and the pressure in her abdomen increases as the tightness of her armor becomes intolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" Maria snorts.  \"Kits don't need armor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flops onto the ground, letting her fat ripple and bounce, and begins to take off all of her equipment.  She kicks her boots off, wriggling her toes in the evening air, letting them breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls off her leggings; they're stubborn, to say the least, wrapped tight around the vixen's thick thighs and soft ass.  With a little pulling, they come off, revealing Maria's once-toned legs, orange-furred like the rest of her body, but with white fur lining her inner thighs.  She runs her paws up and down them; her calves, once slim, had become soft, and merged with her ankle; her knees had begun to sag; her thighs had become quite round, losing their muscular tone and gaining what felt to be an inch-thick layering of fat; her hips had become quite wide and round, jutting from her leg a good foot and a half...  And her ass had grown to nearly 4 times its original size, layered with vixen-fat and bouncing with even the most subtle of movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempts to pull off her bodice, which proves to be even more difficult than her leggings.  The vixen grunts, trying to tug the stubborn armor off of her blubbery midsection, which refuses to let her armor pass.  \"C'mon, tummy...\" she pleads.  With a particularly hard pull, the armor slides upwards, exposing more of Maria's soft belly, bouncing and jiggling with her continued struggle.  Her armor refuses to budge.  However, it pays dearly for its disobedience; the leather bodice tears right down the center, falling off of the bloated vixen's frame, exposing a hidden expanse of flesh.  \"Awwww...  I didn't want you to break...\"  Her belly, now free of its bindings, fell downwards with the force of gravity, bouncing as it settled into position, spilling into her lap as she sat; a sizable, round white-furred mass of vixen-lard framed by orange, with a deep, wide navel yawning dead in the center, squishing itself into a half-closed mouth.  Her breasts fell into place, as well, settling themselves on top of her belly with a hearty bounce, two glorious ivory globes, heavy with the flowers' handiwork, tipped with a pink, silver-dollar sized nipple on each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took a moment to feel herself up, exploring all of this new flesh; she'd come into the meadow a svelte 80 pounds...  By her estimate, she was now about 200, and still growing!  She wasn't all that concerned anymore, though; she just laughed from the stimulus.  A goofy grin broke out across her muzzle, joined by a twinkle in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we..?\"  She flopped onto her back and inhaled deeply.  \"Ah, yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment to rub her belly, squeezing it and massaging it.  Maria threw her arms to her sides, and began to roll from side-to-side, giggling like the little girl she wanted to be again and crushing the strange flowers underneath the thick rolls on her back, coating herself in oil and speeding up her expansion.  \"Hahahahahahahahaha!\"  She was having more fun than she'd had in a while.  She rolled faster, and harder, throwing more of her body into her roll, coming into a full rotation like a rotisserie chicken on a spit.  With all of her body, she practically steam-rolled the flowers, flattening them beneath her growing bulk and evenly soaking her body in the fattening oil, laughing louder and harder than she ever had.  \"I feel just like a kit again!\"  She reared up on all fours, her ass jutting into the air.  She wriggled her behind, jiggling it thoroughly, and pounced ahead of her, aiming at nothing in particular, and flopped down onto her pillowy belly.  She repeated this a few more times, attempting to perform a few somersaults; her bulk wouldn't allow it,but she was having the time of her life, just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one last \"half-somersault,\" she came to rest, lying on her back, panting and giggling.  She was now over 400 pounds!  \"Wow!\" said Maria, genuinely astounded and without a hint of shock.  \"Look how big I am!\"  She laughed as she ran her paws all over her belly.  \"<i>Soooooooo big!</i>\"  She laughed even harder, sending all of her front into a hearty wobble.  \"<i>Enormous...</i>\" she sighed contentedly...</span></div></div>",

It was night-time, no mistaking that.  \"Well, this is as good a time as any to go to sleep...\" she dully observed, punctuating her statement with another hearty yawn.  \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a warm breeze rolling across her exposed belly, she giggled; it was a fine night to sleep under the stars.  She gave her belly a light pat, and rolled onto her side, taking care not to catch her bushy tail beneath her legs or gut; it found a spot lying on top of her ass.  Hugging her belly as close to her as she could, she closed her eyes, sighed contentedly, and drifted off to sleep.</i></span></div></div>",

She was just as fat as she was now, and just as naked.  Despite her bulk, though, she had no apparent difficulty standing.  She felt herself up, a bit; just as soft and squishy as she remembered, but not quite as sensitive.  Maria hefted her large, sagging gut in her hands and found that it was almost weightless.</i>  \"How strange,\" <i>she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of food entered her vulpine nostrils; she waddled forth to find its source.  It was a wonderful scent, that of perfectly-roasted meat and sweet, sweet blueberry pie, as well as a few other scents, no less sumptuous.  She weaved around numerous trees, coming closer and closer to the wonderful smell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut found herself stuck between the trunks of two rather close oak trees, her belly wedged tight.</i>  \"Oh, dear...\"  <i>But, her mind wandered from her predicament when she looked up; she'd found the source of the delicious scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had happened upon a gathering of 20 muscular male foxes, huddled around a long wooden table.  On top of the table were the delicacies she'd smelled:  Heaping bowls of mashed potatoes, each with an equally-generous pot of rich, well-seasoned gravy; an assortment of wagon-wheel sized pies of varying flavors; a platter piled high with buttered cobs of corn; at least 10 stuffed turkeys; a plate of thick, well-done steaks, just the way Maria liked them; and a bowl of strawberries with a smaller bowl full of melted chocolate beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these were not the \"main attraction;\" no, that was in the center of the table:  An enormous roasted pig, golden-brown and dripping with a variety of thick sauces and glaze, lying belly-down in a pan with an apple in its mouth.  Maria's mouth would have been watering...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  Were not all of the foxes' eyes on her.  She was feeling quite self-conscious; she hadn't expected that anybody would see her like this, fat and nude.  She blushed through her fur as she tried to avert her gaze from the staring foxes; it wouldn't be nearly so bad if they weren't so handsome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the males, one covered in gray fur, rose from the table, approaching her.  He was, for the most part, naked himself, just like all of the other males, save for a loincloth.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I'm sorry...\" <i>the orange vixen stammered, wracked with embarrassment.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" <i>the muscular male answered,</i> \"You are the guest of honor, Maria!  Why should you be sorry at your own feast?\"  <i>All of the foxes cheered.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...  You know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  We've been expecting you!  Now, come.  ...  I am Kervos, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  It's nice to meet you, Kervos...  I'm...  A bit stuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, of course.\"  <i>Kervos raised his claw, and snapped, beckoning forth four of the other males:  One red, one white, one green, and one brown, all stood at attention.</i>  \"If you will, men...  Please 'escort' Miss Maria to her seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" <i>they exclaimed in unison, eagerly taking position around Maria.  The green and white foxes took their place on either side of the large vixen's expansive white-furred belly, lifting it from underneath, while the other two took their place behind Maria, each placing their paws squarely on her buttocks, and pushing.</i>  \"Oh, my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for the discomfort,\" <i>Kervos said.</i>  \"We're doing what we can to get you out.\"  <i>Kervos stepped forward, and embraced Maria's gut, pulling as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Maria was quite enjoying the attention; she hadn't been touched in quite some time, especially not by such fine specimens of virility and masculinity, all paying undivided attention and using the utmost care to move her.  With a *pop!*, she sprang from between the trees, jiggling wildly and being cradled by ten strong, vulpine arms.  She was still blushing, but not as embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey carried her over to the other end of the table, where a throne had been set up for her, wide enough to accommodate her fat ass.  They lowered her into place, and removed their arms from beneath her, placing them instead on the vixen's meaty belly, rubbing it gently.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th- thank you...\" <i>Maria stammered, overwhelmed by such treatment.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it...\" <i>Kervos said.</i>  \"Now, it's time for the feast to begin!\"  <i>He gestured toward the table.</i>  \"All...  For you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" <i>she said, excitedly; she hadn't noticed until now, but she was <u>starving.</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Would you like us to feed you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The vixen purred.</i>  \"That would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kervos snapped his fingers, and all of the males rose, each grasping one of the dishes, save for the pig in the center, and bringing them forward to the hungry vixen.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide, if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maria obeyed, opening her muzzle as wide as she possibly could, and was rewarded with a spoon-full of buttery mashed potatoes.</i>  \"Oh...\" <i>the vixen moaned in ecstasy; they were, perhaps, the best she'd ever eaten, creamy and fluffy in a way she'd never had the pleasure to taste.  It was followed by another heaping spoon-full, and another, with intermediate ladle-fulls of gravy, which Maria happily ate, until the bowl was gone.  The male put this bowl and spoon aside, and placed his own paws on Maria's doughy gut, which had grown slightly larger, and began to knead it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process continued, with different dishes; as they were depleted, the tod would either join the others in their reverent massage, perhaps using a special oil, or return to the table for another dish.  This went on for nearly two hours.  Slices of pie, pumpkin, cherry, blueberry, apple, and pecan disappeared down her throat after having gently been placed on her tongue, with minimal chewing.  So did turkey breasts and legs, which the tods took care to hold aloft for the vixen to gnaw on so that she wouldn't swallow a bone; the same care was taken with the corn cobs, as well.  Steaks disappeared, chewed thoroughly and savored, piece by piece bitten off a skewer.  All of these were followed by the strawberries, each dipped in the thick melted chocolate, slowly swirled about to make sure that as much chocolate as possible had found its way onto sweet fruit, and placed on her tongue, slithering down her throat after some mastication.  She moaned in pleasure, rubbing her belly with her own paws as everyone else was.  Every once in a while, Kervos would raise a chalice filled with a sweet red wine to the vixen's lips, tipping it up to let the beverage flow into her mouth.  Never before had Maria been treated so well, like a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the food was emptied from the table, finding its way into Maria's eager paunch...  Save for the roasted pig, which still sat in the center of the table.  She eyed it groggily, drunk from indulgence, and licked her chops.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still hungry, Maria?\" <i>Kervos asked, with a tone that betrayed the question to be rhetorical.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmmmm...  Yes, dear Kervos...  I am,\" <i>she replied, punctuating her sentence with a small burp.</i>  \"Oh...  Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, Maria.  Shall we lift you over to the swine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kervos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All of the foxes placed their hand under the vixen, over 5 times the size she was when she'd come to the banquet; over a ton of vixen-blubber and flesh sat in that throne.  They each lifted Maria, slowly rising above her seat, and carefully carried her to the roasted hog.  It was nearly three times as large as she was!  There was no way it could be lifted into her mouth...  So, she was being taken to the pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was placed upon the near-empty table, right beside the golden-brown swine.  The lard-ass vixen lay on her belly, with her muzzle poised right beside the pig's right thigh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in, Maria!\" <i>all of the tods cried in unison, continually cheering as the whale of a vixen tore into the succulent porker, almost inhaling fat and meat...  For over an hour, she ate, much like a pig, face buried in the hog, and ass swaying rhythmically, until all that was left was a pile of bones and an apple.  She belched, having defeated the hog, and blushed as a rush of gas escaped her rear-end, a loud, rather unladylike *FRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT* sending her belly and ass jiggling like a gelatin-mold.  When everyone began to laugh, she laughed, as well; she had a wonderful time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all cheered louder than ever as the 4-ton vixen crawled sluggishly into the pan to claim the apple, like a trophy, and place it in her mouth, giggling all-the-while.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Maria!\" <i>Kervos exclaimed, as he patted the vixen's swollen gut.  She grinned, grunting out words of gratitude around the fruit in her mouth.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, the festivities shall continue in the great hall!\"  <i>Kervos gestured toward a grand hut behind her, 4 stories tall and composed mainly of adobe, with an entrance wide enough to accommodate an enormous vixen such as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered once more, lifting Maria's bulk into their arms and toward the hut.  They each grinned wildly at her, as if they had a special surprise for her waiting beyond that door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Maria didn't know what it could possibly be, she was excited for what was in store...</i></span></div></div>",

The fruit-and-wine mixture she was practically inhaling was delicious, no doubt about it; but she wasn't eating because it was delicious.  No, she'd lost herself to gluttony, eating it simply because it was edible, and right in front of her.  The tods didn't mind, though; in fact, they were all grinning madly as the vixen ate.  She was swelling right before their very eyes, her flesh growing around their paws as they continued to massage the blubbery vixen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria continued to glut herself, oblivious to her surroundings so long as she could eat and be massaged.  She didn't notice the tubs of green paste that had been brought into the chamber.  She didn't notice that she had been lifted from the cushion and on to a crude scale; she certainly didn't notice that she was nearing 15,000 pounds, becoming a veritable pile of vixen.  And she certainly didn't notice the gleam in Kervos' eye, or his wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't have known what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Maria had finished her fourth trough, she'd been completely coated in oil.  Only when the tods had stopped massaging her did she notice anything was amiss.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys?\" <i>she asked, warily.</i>  \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, nothing, Maria...\" <i>Kervos replied.</i>  \"Well, I suppose there is <b>something</b> going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\"  <i>Kervos demeanor had changed entirely; he seemed far less kind, and rather shifty.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're preparing you, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The enormous vixen became nervous.</i>  \"I don't want to be here anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kervos didn't reply, but merely patted the underside of Maria's soft belly, chuckling softly...  Before he raised his muzzle to her rear-end, inserted it right between her asscheeks, and inhaled deeply.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnnnnnnnnnngh!\"  <i>The vixen squirmed futilely.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes...  You'll do nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kervos read the scale one last time; the vixen was now 17,000 pounds.  He gave her right buttock a light rub, and snapped, summoning forth five of the foxes, each bearing a tub of green paste and a large spoon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commence,\" <i>Kervos ordered, an order which was gladly obeyed.  Spoons were dipped into their respective tubs, and globs of verdant paste were brought back up.  They advanced toward the near-immobile vixen, who could not even turn her head to see them; she only knew they were drawing closer by the smell of the paste, a rather pungent, greasy aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of horror appeared on Maria's face; she'd realized what they were about to do when they lifted her tail...  She opened her mouth and squealed like a pig, wobbling her jowls and chins as spoons plunged into her anus; she was, quite literally, being stuffed like a turkey!  Spoon after spoon entered and left, returning to their tubs to retrieve more paste; they only stopped when there was no more room for the paste to fill.  Maria's large, round buttocks were pushing apart from each other, barely containing the paste as it threatened to spill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKervos, anticipating this, retrieved the apple Maria had dropped from her mouth earlier, inserting it into the opposite hole.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this!?\" <i>Maria cried.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerdyx, my dear...  You are to be a meal for Jerdyx,\" <i>Kervos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was about to ask what Jerdyx was, but as she opened her mouth, a tube was inserted inside, effectively silencing her; all she could do was grunt and squeal.  A flood of a viscous substance erupted from the tube, forcing its way down her throat and adding even more pounds to her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the flood stopped, Maria was even larger than before, now 30,000 pounds, according to the scale.  The tube was removed from her mouth, and replaced by a grapefruit.  The stuffed, oily vixen was taken from the scale and placed on a platter, now being carried into another chamber, where...</i></span></div></div>",

When the dragon's muzzle emerged ten minutes later; Maria was spent, panting heavily as Jerdyx licked his chops to get any residue off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, wonderful...\" <i>Jerdyx said, still staring intently at his sacrifice.</i>  \"And now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maria yelped as she was lowered to the ground in a matter of seconds, her entire body quivering from the force of the motion, and yelped again as she was flipped over onto her back.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what happens next?\" <i>Jerdyx said, smiling wickedly.  He slapped her belly, and watched all of the fat inside ripple, quivering like custard.  Jerdyx laughed.  </i>  \"Excellent!  Plenty of fat; a fine second course, indeed!\"  <i>The cruel dragon dove his claw into her navel, swirling it about and watching her squirm, and then licking it as it left.</i>  \"Be sure to squeal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jerdyx lowered his muzzle to the vixen's belly, opening his jaw wide and showing her all of his sharp teeth.

She decided that she had enough; there was nothing to eat, so, why stay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the pretty meadow behind and headed off in search of food. As she walked, a strange smell filled her nostrils; a sent of fire, burn wood and...FOOD! Maria dashed off towards the area she presumed the food was being cooked; she ran deeper and deeper into the forest, through thick under grows dominated by looming trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sent became stronger and the smoke of thee cooking-fire was visible in the air. When she was only a few feet away from the fire, she stopped and investigated her surroundings. She was indeed very far in the woods; thick flora grew around her, the trees' leaves so thick that it almost blocked out all the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria began to feel nervous. This was quite a eerie scene. But she reminded herself that she was a warrior, straightened herself up and headed boldly towards the fire, that was casting its yellow glow through the shrubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was brave, Maria couldn't help but be careful. She stuck her head through the nearest bush and observed the scene before her; there was a fire (obviously), a big pot with bubbling stew suspended over it, a pitched tent that was made from an assortment of wild animal skins, and a very large, muscular creature sitting by his belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his pointy, sharp looking horns, his flat muzzle, big snout - that contained a golden nose-ring -, and brown fur, Maria could only identify this furry as one thing - a minotaur. He was dressed in a piece of loincloth, but other clothing - such as armor laying next to him - suggested that he was a warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, this large beast was sharpening his deadly axe; a deadly weapon that looked that it had tasted its fair share of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny creatures' first impulse was to back away slowly, then, when they where far away enough, run like hell! But not this fox; Maria's stomach demanded food, and she was going to get just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe a merged from the bushes. The minotaur head immediately rose in alarm, hauled his axe in both hands, and adopted a battle-stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stared at Maria with a fierce stare, his yellow eyes penetrating right through her body. The fox, stopping in her tracks, regretted disturbing this mighty minotaur, but likely her stomach gave her another injection if courage when it growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria opened her muzzle to say something, but the bovine beated her to it: \"What do you want, fox?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice deep and intimidating. A sign that this creature didn't like to be messed with. Maria gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smelled food... and I thought that I -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off when the minotaur spoke again: \"That you could have some?\" He studied Maria with his yellow eyes, and she couldn't help but feel naked as she stood awkwardly there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Maria stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur raised an eyebrow, snorted, and sat back down. \"Then you may have some,\" he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria could not believe her luck. She did not hesitate, sat next to him and waited for the food to be finished boiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaza nodded and turned back towards the fire. He wasn't much of a talker, she realised. They sat again in silence. Maria stared back up at the beast; he, like she noted before, was huge, muscles rippling across his body.

As she sat there with her sword she heard the sounds of a trig snapping and spun toward the sound.  She took off toward the sound, springing up from the underbrush and bushes she had been using as a partial cover.  As she sprung up she saw a man traveling through the woods jump in surprise, dropping the axe at the sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling let down that the it was a human male instead of something edible Maria sighed and sheathed her sword, as the man regained his bearings.  Her stomach growled again, but then she felt something else as she watched the well muscled man brush himself off.  Suddenly she became flush and realized that she had avoided the town for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap,\" she said and spun around, feeling the urge to jump on the man suddenly flair all the way up.  \"That's the last thing I need right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that miss,\" the man said and came over to her.  \"You surprised me is all.  Don't normally get to many visitors back this way, especially ones that look like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be at a loss for words attempting to describing Maria.  She was used to confusing humans since her clan normally avoided them.  All he life she had heard of the atrocities humans had committed against her kind, and would have expected the man to use the axe on his shoulder to mow her down, if she hadn't have learned better through her various adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Maria said backing away from the man slowly, and fighting the urges that were rising in her still.  It was a bad time of the year to run into any kind of male period...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why you're back here miss?\" the man asked politely, keeping his distance since it didn't look like Maria wanted to be near him for some reason.  Maybe it's the axe, he thought to himself and lowered it to the ground while awaiting her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry and looking for work...I was trying to hunt, but couldn't find anything out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked her up and down after her tentative response.  He noticed the sword and armor and figured her to be the adventuring type.  He hummed a bit before saying, \"Well hunger I can fix, and I think i know of a job you may be able to do too.  Mind coming back to my cottage?  I'll fix something for ya and tell you about the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria thought about it, she didn't want to be around him much longer, the initial urges were being suppressed but just barely.  Her stomach growled again and she decided to restrain herself long enough to get a meal and hear the man out.  She nodded trying not to look directly at him, making her look shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" the man said starting to head off.  \"This way.  Name's Mike, by the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked for a ways through the woods, until they came to a small one room cottage in a small clearing.  Splintered wood seemed to be everywhere, suggesting that Mike was either a lumberjack or carpenter.  He grabbed a couple of hares that had been cleaned and hung out side before pushing the door open and ushering Maria in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's not much,\" Mike said as he threw the hares on the only table.  Aside from the table there was only a bed and a small cooking stove, but it looked homey, and smelled like fresh timber.  Maria sat on the bed and waited while Mike set to work on the hares and put the meat into a pot to start cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess i can tell you about the job,\" Mike said as he continued to cook.  \"There's a cave around these parts that have some great treasure.  A lot of fokes have gone looking for it, but not many come back, so it must be dangerous.  So, consider that a warning, but if you're still interested i can draw you a map.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like it'd be fun,\" Maria said perking up at the idea of treasure.  \"Sure draw it up for me and I'll head out after i eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded, but looked a little concerned.  Maria thought that it was sweet and started to smile causing the suppressed urges to flair out of control.  In seconds she was across the room and on the man, kissing him insatiably.  She threw him toward the bed and started to strip off her armor before jumping onto him and continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, wait a second,\" Mike tried to say whenever he got a breath, but Maria didn't slow down.  She started stripping the poor man, who didn't seem to be fighting back much more then those few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attacked him as if she was starving, in more ways then one, and it ended rather quickly.  Mike struggled up from his bed and pulled the finished stew off the pot.  Maria, felt contented as she ate.  As soon as she was finished eat she pulled Mike back to the bed for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Mike drew Maria a map and waved her off, looking a little dishearten to see her go.  Maria cursed to herself as she head off for the next big adventure, but did she want to go straight there, or pick up some supplies...</span></div></div>",

The pig would never know what hit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her stomach conspired against her, as at that very moment it let out the loudest rumble she'd ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" she thought to herself.  \"It's gonna run, now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was surprised when it <i>didn't</i> run; it didn't even <i>stop</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Maria said aloud.  She bristled, as she was sure that <i>that</i> was gonna send it running...  But it didn't.  Either it was oblivious to her, or it just didn't think she was a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they really <i>that</i> good?\" Maria asked.  As if to answer, the pig let out a short grunt, and began eating faster.  Its behind even began swaying back and forth, just as the vixen's had when she was digging through her bag, except with more jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria decided to take a closer look at the berries.  They were a bit strange looking, to be certain.  The berries grew in clusters, much like grapes, and were a light pink, with little blue stripes growing down the sides.  They smelled very sweet; almost saccharine, really.  The plant it grew on was equally strange...  From a distance, the leaves had looked to be a deep green color, but upon closer inspection, were actually...  Purple?..  The shape of the leaves was quite distinctive, too; it was hard to describe what they looked like, but their shape was oddly familiar...  Wait!  She recognized the shape of them!  They looked like the silhouette of a very curvaceous woman.  From the stem, she could make out a round head (with pointed ears on top?) tapering into a neck, which widened into a pair of fairly broad shoulders; from there, it curved inward, forming a pair of large breasts, and tapered down into a relatively fairly slender waist.  At this point, it curved outward into the widest part of the leaf:  Its \"hips,\" which measured 5 inches across from one side to the other.  Finally, it tapered to a blunt point.  On the underside of each leaf hung a thick vine, which also tapered into a point.  It looked like a bushy fox tail, she noted, as she looked at her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, this was a plant that didn't look like it belonged on the <i>planet</i>, let alone this forest...  And yet, here it was, right in front of Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"  The orange vixen looked to her side, just to make sure the pig was still there (it was).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what the berries taste like?\" she mused.  \"But I wouldn't want to spoil my appetite for pork...\"</span></div></div>",

She did not stop to think that grinding a strange berry against her teeth, especially when she didn't know if it was even poisonous or not, was almost as bad of an idea as sampling the fruit in the first place. Whatever effects the juices of the plant would have on her, deadly or not, would have been amplified by these actions, but dammit she was hungry and didn't have time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it was no surprise that the chemicals within the berries went to work swiftly. The Vixen gasped as she chewed on the tiny fruit, as not only did it taste sweet and amazing, but the simple act of consuming the one berry seemed to give her a massive rush of pleasure and arousal.She swallowed the berry and gasped in shock at the feeling of sexual bliss, suddenly looking around self-consciously as her cheeks flushed red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet all she saw was the massive pig, still gorging itself continuously on the plant, never seeming to get full or tired from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you dirty beast... No wonder you love these things...\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long though, she soon found that she too was craving even more of the little pink fruits and the feelings that came with them. She caught herself licking her lips with desire as she thought of eating some more, then soon felt shame for even thinking such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, even considering eating another berry when she now knew of its potently aphrodisiac-like effects on her body was incredibly perverse. And then what if she couldn't stop eating them? Would she end up like the hog before her, helplessly gorging on berries for the rest of it's life? Even the appearance of the plant, especially its leaves that seemed to resemble her so much, seemed sinister to the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, who cares if it was a shameful and sexually indulgent act. It was not like anybody was around to see her enjoy it. And she only had to have a couple or a handful more of the berries. She wasn't a dumb animal, so surely she could stop eating at any time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria had thought hard about the bizarre berries and their addictive properties, but ultimately she had decided that just a few more couldn't hurt. The Vixen had always been weak when it came to satisfying her more carnal desires, and when it was the right time of year, as it was now, it was almost impossible for her to resist something so pleasing as <i>this!</i> She licked her lips with a hunger that was for more than just food and plucked a pawful of the berries, plopping two in her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately her body was racked with intense pleasure as she gasped, leaning back against a nearby tree for support. She shivered and panted, moaning with passionate delight before the feeling faded, seemingly faster than before. She crammed the rest of the berries into her maw in a manner that seemed almost reflexive, and chewed them recklessly, her eyes rolling back as her mind was soon filled with sexual bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seemed like a minute or two, she had lost track of everything except for the intense feelings that had coursed through her body. When she woke up to the rest of the world, she had discovered that her arms and legs were wrapped about the tree, and her crotch felt particularly moist. She tried to regain her composure as quickly as she could and laughed nervously as she walked over to the pig, eying the berries and drooling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, she crammed about two dozen more of the devious fruits into her muzzle, scarfing them down quickly so that she could enjoy the euphoria which followed. This time her pleasure-fueled coma seemed to last five or ten minutes, and she discovered she was leaning against the gluttonous hog, in the process of relieving herself of her gear. She hadn't gotten far into disrobing, only having removed one of her gloves with the other halfway off her paw, but the implications of why she would be doing such a thing were startlingly disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.... hehe! I mean damn... that was odd, huh..?\" She chuckled before slapping the pig on the rump, eliciting a short grunt from it as well as causing the beast's massive ass to jiggle wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the obese hog, and even though it was a beast, swollen with blubber, and quite obviously a female, Maria found herself to be rather attracted to it. She was shocked and blamed it on a combination of the season and the effects of the berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze, nothing is going to stop you from stuffing yourself, you big... fat... bitch...\" Maria giggled as she groped at the pig's rolls of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig let out a soft, satisfied moan, one that almost sounded as if it had come from a sentient being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill went up Maria's spine as she began to examine the hog more closely. Her fear were reassured when she noticed for the first time that the pig seemed to have long, curly blond hair, possibly missed due to how closely the color matched her fur and how many of the locks were swallowed by the fat that ringed her neck. Maria began to feel nervous, but soon passed the disturbing presence of a full head of hair on the pig off as some form of defect or breeding trait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this poorly constructed excuse was soon shattered when the vixen fished through the mud for her glove, and instead found what appeared to be a pair of overalls, trampled and shredded and stained with mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These... these are... where could they have come from...?\" Maria stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig grunted and squealed, gasping for breath as she momentarily stopped her feeding frenzy, just long enough to utter one word, \"Mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen dropped the clothing and jumped to her feet, gaping in horror as she realized that the mindless pig in front of her wasn't a pig at all, but a pig girl. She wasn't one of the livestock that had wandered away from it's pen, but likely a farmer that had gotten lost in the woods, forced to eat the same berries Maria had just eaten to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same berries Maria had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite this horrifying revelation, Maria couldn't help but desire another taste. She should run, she should get the fuck away from this horrible plant, but she just needed to sample it just one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even seem to notice her belly had already become slightly doughier.</span></div></div>",

She knew now that these berries were bad... no, they were <i>horrible</i> because of what they could do and had done to this woman on her hands and knees in the muck. She also knew that if she kept eating them, she might become a slave to them as well, and yet she still could not stop herself from plopping that one last fruit into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this... I'm done!\" She said in a shaky voice before falling to the ground and screaming in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing no further resistance, the fox girl crawled next to the fat sow and began to shovel pawfuls of berries straight into her drooling mouth.She didn't care about the repercussions anymore, she just needed to satisfy her gluttony and her lust simultaneously, and the fruits of this plant were there just to satisfy both of those indulgences at once.Maria moaned and purred as the pleasure hit her, only increased by the massive amount of berries she was consuming now. She could feel her loins becoming hot and moist with each swallow, the juices of the wicked plant dripping past her lips as she gasped with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet what she didn't realize was that not only was her arousal growing with every berry, but so was her waistline.After only a half hour into her feeding her clothes had started to feel tight, especially around the areas of her stomach and rump. Yet oddly enough, this snug feeling didn't snap her out of her daze, instead only serving to arouse her further. She moaned ever more loudly as she ate until, finally, the berries had pushed her over into orgasm, pausing only momentarily to savor the release. Her eyes widened, the crotch of her pants becoming wet from her own juices, but her arousal didn't cease, only abating somewhat before continuing to climb with renewed purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though most of the vixen warrior was lost to the immense excitement she was now enthralled in, a small part of her at the very back of her mind remained sensible, only able to watch as her primal desires remained in control.This small bit of herself kept hoping that she would snap out of it, that somehow this dreadful feast would end. Yet the berries seemed to grow back even faster than they could be eaten, and the helpless fox was more than happy to continue stuffing her face with them. As Maria got on all fours and simply began to eat the berries off of the ground like her neighbor, even the tiny sensible bit of her that was left was pushed away, its voice of reason and hope silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly muscular fox girl had weighed roughly around 140 pounds just an hour ago. Now she was nearing the 300 pound mark and was definitely no longer muscular. Her clothes had finally begun to give in around this point, her hard leather skirt having ridden up her fattening ass to show off how her once shapely rear had stretched and torn her pants severely. Her belly and breasts forced the straps holding her leather vest closed to burst apart, revealing her breasts which overflowed her soft leather bra and her massive belly below that.</span></div></div>",

Juice and saliva dripped down and over a growing number of chins as the mess soaked and stained the vixen's fur a darker shade of red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria paused, her belly quaking and gurgling as another belch forced its way out of her gullet. She let out a low, deep moan as this distraction ended and she was allowed to resume her feeding. Now that her stomach was relieved of the pressure and discomfort of the gas, she ate with renewed vigor, hoping to once more devour enough to satisfy her belly and her lust. As her teeth chomped down on berry bush Maria groaned. She found herself chewing at an empty branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnh..\" The vixen whined to herself, sniffing and nibbling at the now barren plant, \"C'mon, where did they goooo...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria groaned weakly, shifting on her paws and knees as she pulled them loose from the mud. Now that the constant sounds of her lip-smacking and teeth-gnashing meal had subsided, she could hear her heavy and labored breaths, as well as the gurgling of her stomach. She might have been able to snap out of her berry frenzy if her mind hadn't once more become focused on the arousal that wracked her body instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need a few... urrff... a few more...\" She whimpered to herself, trying to reach back between her legs but finding it harder to achieve than before thanks to all the new girth. She couldn't be THAT fat now, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxgirl moaned as she tried to push herself to her knees, finding it to be an enormously difficult thing to do. She could feel her heavy belly weighing her down, sliding around in the mud as she tried to lift it off the ground. With tremendous difficulty, she finally managed to pull it up and move herself into a kneeling position, but the abrupt shift caused it to churn painfully in agitation as it spilled over her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit...\" She huffed, noticing the huskiness in her voice now. She grabbed at her stomach, the titanic gut still packed with berries and incredibly heavy as she hefted it, yet covered in enough fat so that her paws sank into its folds as she did. As she rubbed and fondled her aching paunch, the berries continued to digest within, only increasing the stimulating effect they had upon her and making her moan louder, \"Need more berries... huff huff... Need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed softly to herself as she found her pudgy paws wandering up to her breasts. She felt the furry orbs, now bare and massive, retaining their perkiness even as they sagged a bit atop her tummy. She gripped the melon-sized jugs in her hands, rubbing and squeezing them sensuously, shivering and purring as waves of pleasure rippled through her obese body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's it now... I just need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped thickly as she pinched a nipple between her fat fingers, nearly tumbling onto her back from the blast of ecstasy. The vixen grinned, licking her lips as she steeled herself before gripping her other teat with her free paw. The hefty girl's whole body shook, sending her rolls rippling as she moaned, but as much as she fondled and squeezed she still found no relief. The arousal between her legs was like a furnace now, sweat soaking Maria's fur as her libido fully dominated her wits.

It didn't matter, though; either way, it was food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her paw wander all around the pig's various \"meat areas,\" and found that its back and hams were just as soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach rumbled once more.  \"Easy, easy...

To tear living flesh from a beast, and devour the raw meat as their prey lie dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to subdue it, as best as she could...  But only barely kept herself from tearing it limb from limb.  It was still inside of her, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was a battlefield:  A war between rational thought and feral desire.  Her rationale was, of course, trying to reason with this feral spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why would you eat it live, when you could kill it first?  Mealtime will come sooner if we need not fight a struggling beast.</i><br>\r\n<b>Look at it!  It can't do anything!  It probably would just lay there as it's torn apart!

For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...  I just have to slit its throat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the sow's front slowly and quietly, with sword drawn; while the pig hadn't given any indication that it would even care that anything's happening, Maria decided it was better to be safe than sorry.  The sow was still stuffing its face; it didn't even look over at its impending slaughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd didn't realize, until it was too late, that the vixen's sword had run along its jugular.  It squealed, as one would expect a pig to do, but not quite as much as one would expect a pig to, only uttering a few half-hearted squeals; it was almost like it was feigning its own death.  Of course, it wasn't; this was made quite obvious by the crimson stream escaping from the cut the hungry vixen had made.  It barely moved, even in its death-throes, just shifting about from side to side an inch or two, until the blood ceased to flow.  The sow flopped onto its side with a mighty \"thud\" and a thunderous jiggling of its bountiful gut; aside from this, though, it no longer moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria approached her kill, cautiously, surveying it to make sure that it was <i>really</i> dead.  When she was sure it was, she smiled; she was one step closer to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer task, now, was to slaughter the beast; she could not lift this leviathan by herself, and she certainly couldn't fit it onto a spit.  No, she'd be content to slice off a bit of the pig, and roast it; yes, a lot of the pig would go to waste, but this wasn't her primary concern.  After a bit of thought, she'd decided to take her meal from the sow's belly.  Her sword, while not optimal for this job, would do.  She circled around the swine until she'd arrived at its rear, and readied her blade to enter what she'd assumed would be the firmest part of its belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she plunged her sword into its titanic gut, however, she'd found that she was incorrect; there was no resistance, whatsoever, as the blade literally slid through to the other side.  She removed the blade from the sow, and stared at it with a puzzled look on her face.  She peered into slit she'd made, and found that its insides were almost blubber in its entirety; there was hardly any blood, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for meat, then...\" the vixen sighed as she stared at the lard balloon.  When her stomach growled, though, she'd realized she didn't have much choice, here.  She reached cautiously into the belly-hole, and pulled out a paw-full of lard.  \"How's it taste..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised the yellow-white half-solid to her muzzle, and licked it.  What she'd expected to be somewhat pungent...  Wasn't half bad, actually.  It was sort of sweet, a bit salty, and the texture wasn't at all as nauseating as she'd thought it would.  She ate the rest of it, and licked her paw clean.  \"It's not so bad, I guess,\" Maria said.  \"I think I'd still prefer meat, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she'd said \"meat,\" she glanced upwards at the hog's untouched hams.  \"Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her blade, and gave the sow's left shank a jab.  There wasn't as much give as had been in the belly, and she actually drew blood with her minuscule puncture; the meat was <i>here</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" she said.  \"I <i>do</i> have meat, then.\"  It was something she'd have to cook, though, and by the size of the porker's shank...  It could take hours to roast it adequately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she want to wait?</span></div></div>",

The vixen had to eat <i>something,</i> fast...  And there already was \"something\" in front of her:  A thousand-or-so pounds of a sow's belly-lard.  She didn't even need to cook it; she could just scoop it out of the opening she'd made, and eat it directly from her hand.  She wasn't quite thrilled about making a meal of something that was typically <i>not</i> food (at least not food she'd ever had), she was hungry, and the lard was plentiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her paw, she reached into the sow's belly, and pulled out another glob.

And so on, and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did seem to do the trick, though; Maria didn't feel quite as hungry as she had ten minutes ago.

Instead she sat against a tree, arms wrapped about her knees as she pulled them against her plump belly, still filled with her horrible meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet whether she wanted to or not, soon she would have to pay for what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, earsplitting squeal pierced through the silent clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen yelped in shock, leaping to her feet, causing her stuffed stomach to wobble. Standing before her were a trio of pig men, all of them rather fat, though not nearly as large as the one she had eaten. These three were more fit looking as well, having what seemed like a muscular build under all that blubber. All three were garbed in the simple dirt-stained clothing of farmers, and all of them severely pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie...\" The lead one growled as he stood before the slaughtered pig woman, \"Oh your father is not going to like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria covered her mouth, gasping softly.There was a tree between her and the party of swine, but had they heard her yelp just now? She hoped desperately that they didn't, not wanting to think about what would happen to her if they found her, covered in blood and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided it would be best not to face the consequences of her actions and swiftly sneak away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the vixen, she wasn't used to sneaking with so much weight on her. As she passed by a nearby tree she smacked into it with her now considerably wider hip. The thin trunk cracked rather loudly and fell to the ground with a thunderous crash, stopping the vixen dead in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio of hog men looked up at her, and while standing still might have worked if the three of them were tyrannosaurus rexes, they were sadly not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" gulped Maria as she immediately took off in the opposite direction of the pig people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Squuuueeeee!</i> It's the murderer! Get her NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three gave chase, and despite her smaller size, Maria just wasn't as experienced as they were in navigating the woods with so much fat weighing her down. It seemed as though she bumped into every other tree, and unlike the pig men she wasn't large enough to charge straight through them and knock them out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon could hear the bated breaths of her pursuers, the vixen smelling their awful stench and feeling as their paws narrowly missed her as they tried to grab for her. She wheezed and gasped as her body began to fail her, her new-found weight starting to severely effect her ability to run. It wasn't long before one of the pigs tackled her to the ground, easily overpowering her and pinning her against the dirt with their mass and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got you now vixen... guess foxes aren't so swift when they've gorged themselves so gluttonously!\" The pig lying atop of Maria gloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior merely whined, hardly able to breath as the pig man slowly crushed her under his large, furry gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong girl?

We're taking her home, there's a big ol' feast waiting for Annie, but since she's gone somebody's gonna have to eat it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all laughed once more as the pig with the shovel brought out a length of rope he was carrying on his shoulder and used it to bind Maria's wrists and ankles while Chuck held her steady. Once she was properly restrained, Chuck picked her up and slung her unceremoniously over his shoulder, her fat rump facing forward while the vixen herself was stuck looking behind her captor, and the three fat pigs and their not-so-fat captive moved through the woods towards their home village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! Do you even care about what happened to that girl?! Where are you sick bastards taking me?! And what the hell is a lipomancer?!\" Maria shouted, kicking her bound legs futilely, sending her plump buttocks and thighs jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuck laughed heartily, firmly gripping one of Maria's ass cheeks to stop her squirming, giving it a squeeze for good measure, \"Calm yourself girl! You'll find out soon enough. It sure is nice though, having something other than another pig around to feed... yes, we're gonna have fun with this one, don't you agree boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two oinked and snorted in agreement. The one with the tusks was following closely behind Chuck, and Maria couldn't help but shiver when he licked his lips as he eyed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you bastards wait... I've gotten out of worse spots before!\" She growled, spitting at the tusky pig, and missing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh, she's feisty boss!\" He said as he patted Maria's cheek, \"Well we'll just see about that, won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, we're back at the village!\" The shovel wielding pig said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon came upon a road cutting through the woods, and down the road lay the village ahead. Of course Maria couldn't see the village, just what lay down the opposite end of the road, but as they traveled down the forest path she noticed a large sign spanning the road which they soon passed under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt simply read \"Plowtonsville\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfftt... who the fuck named your town?

Most of the residents seemed to be porcine, but there were a few other races amongst them as well. Maria couldn't help but notice that all of them were plump and well-fed with no exception. How could such a small town yield enough crops not only to feed but over-feed every single citizen? Maria begged the townsfolk to help her, but most only laughed, sneered, or snorted at her in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Maria's captors stopped at their destination, the pig man holding her having set her down before him and turned her to face the building ahead of them. Before the vixen stood a large wooden building, its size and big, wide doors reminding her of a barn. Two of the pigs (Hal and Chuck if Maria's memory was correct) opened the large doors as the tusky pig pushed her forward into the spacious building. Inside she saw the building was even larger than she had at first thought, the room inside stretching far ahead of her, a table almost just as long running the length of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many pig men and women sitting on each side of the long table, but what frightened her most was what lay on top of it. When the pigs had mentioned that an entire feast was waiting for her, she didn't expect anything nearly this massive: The entire table was overflowing with foods of all kind, so much so that Maria couldn't even make out its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assembled crowd of swine all oinked and jeered and snorted uproariously as Maria was shoved into the dining hall towards an empty chair at the head of the table. The pig with the tusks pulled a knife from his pocket, cutting Maria free of her restraints as the two other pigs escorting her grabbed her arms and sat her in the chair. The fox's anxiety wasn't eased at all by the fact that the seat was much too large for her already plump posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was sat before the feast, the mob in the room grew quieter, watching and examining the vixen intensely before the pig Maria knew as Chuck stood before the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We regretfully inform all gathered 'ere that the feast will not go as planned,' He shouted, the seated crowd murmuring and mumbling amongst themselves, 'Unfortunately our other sacrifice, Annie, was eaten today'' Some gasped and even more murmuring was heard, but so was some soft chuckling as some of the pigs guessed what Chuck was going to say next, 'But fear not me friends an' neighbors, for even more unfortunately for this 'ere vixen, she was the one that ate 'er!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered and laughed viciously as Maria sunk back into her chair, both guilt and fear filling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And so, even though we have to start the feasting anew, I think we can all agree that this 'ere pretty shall please the Lipomancer even more! With that out of the way, let the feast begin!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered in agreement, even a few hip-hip-hoorays were shouted as Maria felt all attention shifting back to her. The fox girl looked about nervously, expecting the crowd of diners to begin eating, but none of them did. She gulped<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n'Well' is anyone going to start'?' She asked meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mob of pigs immediately broke out into loud, spontaneous bouts of squealing laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh the poor lil' girl!' Shrieked a rather obese pig woman, wiping tears from her eyes, still chortling, 'She's serious!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You don't get it, do you?' The tusky pig said, grinning viciously as he grabbed the back of Maria's head, 'It's all for you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked about her, whimpering as the pig held her tight and the others laughed. This all seemed like such a horrible dream to her, but she knew it was all real. She figured she had only two options: She could either talk her way out of this, or fight them'<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They shifted every once in a while, grunting as they tried to get a little more comfortable.  One farted mightily, sending its bulk into a thunderous jiggle.  \"Pardon her...  Anyway.

It was that or be sacrificed, the little voice of courage told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen turned, burying her fist into his flabby gut. The boar squealed in pain and doubled over, and Maria made another run for it. Leaving the boar wheezing, she flung herself on a guard, putting two hands on the spear and twisting. The two grappled over the weapon, the powerful pig and the fattened vixen wobbling back and forth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwisting the spear up and out, Maria finally got it in her grasp, twisting around to take care of the other guard. When she felt the butt of the spear crash against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily coming back to life, Maria found herself tied up again. This was becoming a thing. She tried to move her head to clear it and get a better look at her surroundings, but it was stuck. A quick test proved her hands were as well. The courage she felt fled quickly as she realized she was rather firmly strapped to the chair at the head of the table this time. The large tusked boar waved his hands expansively and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually, our sacrifice is a little more willing. But that's alright. It's been a while, but we have the tools for the holy rite!\" Another boar called out, this one clad in a flowing red robe, clearly some kind of priest for whatever strange cult Maria was now a captive of. The two guards, much more roughly now, pull the vixen's muzzle open, sliding in a wide mouthed funnel and locking it in place. Maria started to struggle again, setting soft breasts and belly jiggling as she did, but it was universally ignored as the priest brought forth an impressively large sausage grinder, setting it over the funnel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping his hands three times, the priest lifted hammy hands and flabby arms into the air. \"With this, we begin the ceremony. We take this brave adventurer and force them down the path of gluttony, so that the Lipomancer will look favorably on us!\" The crowd nodded solemnly. Maria tried to scream, the words echoed but made garbled by the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten days shall we devote to the sin of gluttony. Ten days shall we fast to show our devotion to the Lipomancer, willing to put his needs above our own. Then a year of feasting!\" The pigs cheer and begin to grasp trays and platters and clamber up to the machine. The priest, fat, but sturdy, grasped the well worn wooden portion of the steel handle. With a slow mechanical grinding, the huge machine started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first townspig dumped a plate of something meaty and gravy drenched in. Maria couldn't see it. She could only hear the grinding of the machine. Gravy dripped out first, warm rich beefy flavor dripping on her face and chest, then into the funnel. Next, ground ropes of the tenderloin squeezed out from the machine, slopping down into the tunnel. Maria choked as the first mass of mush struck her open mouth, the vixen struggling to swallow it. It was soft enough that she could swallow it without trouble, and it struck her tongue, the salty tender taste brief before she struggled to swallow. Without the ability to close her mouth, it was work to get her throat working just right to swallow each mouthful without it choking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as one dished finished, the next two pigs were eager to try and fight over who dumped in theirs first, resorting in two thick plops into the machine. One of the beefy guards used a thick wooden spatula to slide the contents further into the grinder, until it hit the gears and began to mush about. Something creamy and cheesy hit the funnel, but it mixed with something thick and sweet, creating a rather unlooked for taste. Some sort of creamy pasta and a cake with chocolate sauce? More heavy drips splattered across her breasts in the form of the mixed sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's beginning to look like a real pig now!\" One of the bloated pigs called as the handle was steadily cranked, churning the mass of food into Maria's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exhausting, leaning with her head back, struggling to ease her throat enough to let everything slide down. When she started to cough from the dryiness of a particular pastry, she nearly choked as cream splashed out of the machine, dumped in by a guard to wash out the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything on the table went in. Slowly, Maria's stomach, already well abused by the devouring of the pig from before, expanded. She'd never eaten so much at one time, and the pigs weren't letting up even for the whimpers from her as her belly expanded. Creams and sauces, goo and glop slid down between her breasts as the entire table as forced into her belly. The blubbery expanse of her middle first showed no signs of gurgling, but as the day wore on, it began to round and swell. The soft rolls smoothed out as the stomach beneath belly fat was tortured with a seemingly endless supply of food. Maria's head was tilted back. She couldn't see the table. When would it be done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDishes mixed together. She could taste some, but others were churned into a milky fatty mass by the grinder, continually pushed into the funnel. Her stomach was starting to ache. Worse, the barn was trapping the heat of the day, making it musky from the smell of the sweating townsfolk and her own collecting sweat, moist underneath her fattened breasts and belly. She spread her plump thighs to let her belly hang a bit more into her lap, but that did little to help. Her stomach was being filled like a wine skin, pushed more than she could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head vigorously, she couldn't take much more! But the priest only laughed. Just as it was slowing down, one of the guards took over. With a snorting grunt, he worked the handle harder, forcing more into the funnel faster, creating a back log of the mush! Maria struggled to gulp it down before it started choking her, groaning with every new moment as her stomach strained. Did they mean to make her eat so much she would pop? It was a horrible thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel it. Her stomach straining inside of her, she thought she could hear the creaking of muscle and the straining of her belly flesh. Her snorting grew louder from her nose as a thick slab of mint cake was poured into her muzzle. This was it. With every gulp, she could feel herself being pushed further to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last gulp, her body shivered and convulsed, but beyond a few drips from the funnel, nothing else came. She frantically looked back and forth, trying to see around the funnel. Finally, with a wrench, the funnel came out, letting Maria relax her mouth. Her jaw was on fire, forcing her to very slowly close it to prevent pain. The priest was saying something. She could barely hear it through the thundering of blood in her ears.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, we shall meet again! This pig will be our finest sacrifice yet.\" The priest yanked off the head strap, and Maria's head leaned forward, a pain searing through her neck. She got a look at her front and the mess of food streaming down it, and her stomach. It was round and the flesh beneath the fur was red with strain. She could hear the stomach beneath struggle with the meal fit for twenty. Two more straps came down and Maria collapsed against the straw on the barn floor. The pigs guffawed and mocked as they passed the vixen cradling her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria moaned pitifully around the enormous meal, the boar priest slowly waddled over, panting from the day's work. \"That was just the trainer meal. Tomorrow, your stomach should be so large, you won't be able to resist.\" The two guards closed the barn doors and audibly chained it shut. Leaving Maria to lie there and digest. And wait for tomorrow's even larger feast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The barn stayed warm for much of the night, but Maria could hardly feel the cold when it came. She was sweating from the packed belly looming over it. It was vast, she was atonished anyone could eat so much. She couldn't do anything but carefully balance it in her paws, it spread out over her thickened thighs and past her knees, pushing out in a gravid red swell. Sleeping wasn't easy, between the loud noises of her stomach and the weak farts from her widened rear end.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMorning wasn't much better for Maria. Light poured through the slats of the barn and the hay loft, making her pry her gummed eyes open. She felt like she was being smothered by a heavy quilt. Slowly, the vixen pushed herself up to her feet, woozy and worn out from her forceful feeding the day before. It wasn't an easy task, she felt so heavy. She peered downward over the food smeared from.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's curvy body, which has always put her in prime position for Bar Wench or Whore professions and pushed her to be an adventurer in the first place, has expanded overnight from her feast. Her breasts have gotten even heavier, her paws denting into the big teardrops, heaving them up to get a look at the fattened swell of her belly, drooping down well over her thighs and sticking out a shelf for her big fat tits. She'd always been a bit hefty, but they were getting huge now. She looked around, dreading a mirror, anything to look at herself. Walking around the barn to get her bearings wasn't easy. Her gait was slowed down to a waddle, fat thighs rubbing against each other, and she could FEEL just how fat her ass had gotten. It bounced against her thighs with each step. She was getting huge. She HAD to get out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hayloft was out of the question. She wouldn't fit on the ladder. She lumbered into one of the stalls, hoping to buy some time. A chain? It was the only weapon she could manage. She picked it up and grasped it in small hope.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe sounds of work outside slid in through the slats. Pigs grunting, heaving objects up to the barn. The unchaining of the barn door, metal loops sliding through the braces of the door. She couldn't see much out of the stall but she could hear the heavy tread and snorts of several of the pigs as they made their way closer. Maria moved to make a weak jump out of the stall, only to fall on her ass as two great buckets of water splashed over her front. The two brawny porkers grabbed at her flabby arms, using their hands to loosen up the mess she had made of herself the previous day. The priest came up with a third bucket, washing much of the rest as well as some of the musky sweat out to the straw below. Sputtering, Maria struggled  as they led her back out to a new feasting table. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe priest stood in front of the townspigs, letting them jeer and laugh at the fattened vixen before he lifted his hands. He spread his arms to the massive spread in front of them. It was even bigger than yesterday, by quite a bit. She could hardly believed she stomached the previous meal. This would surely be her end. \"You can sit down and embrace your gluttony. It'll go easier on you if you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shook her head, feeling her face shake. Even her face was getting big now. The townspigs cheered. The boar nodded his head. \"I thought so. So we already brought out something for our sacrifical piggy.\" Two of the burlier males heaved a low trough in front of the barn, but with two large sturdy loops on it. The trough angled towards the middle, where a slight chin rest stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Maria could fathom what it was for, the two guards pushed her over on her front, the vixen sprawlign helplessly on her fat belly and breasts. She struggled in vain, for one last escape before they strapped her arms out to either side, putting her fat muzzle over the rest and into the middle of the trough. Maria struggled, only earning the waggling of her ass and a weak fart from it. \"Why me?! What do you get out of this?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe priest waved forward. A huge bowl was set on the table, and what looked like warmed animal grease was poured into it, along with one of the platters of food. A third pig worked at it with a large wooden spoon. \"Bounty. Usually we sacrifice one of our own, but we are already fairly...\" he pats his stomach, \"gluttonous. The Lipomancer will give us a great year of bounty for one like you, who has only just tasted what it's like to endulge.\" The first bucket was hefted over and dropped into the side of the trough, pouring the greasy slop into the angled center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slop came up to her muzzle, but with some effort, she was able to angle her fat face away and let the slop only touch her chin. Until the next bucket came in, making her cough and splutter. She was nearly drowned in greasy slop! <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"All you have to do is eat!\" The priest called. And Maria saw it. She could eat, or drown in food. It was a thick greasy paste of pastry. She opened her mouth, swallowing two large mouthfuls of the mush into her mouth, just enough to give her nose a chance to suck in a breath of greasy air. She coughed in her respite, interrupted by the next bucket of slop. She had to keep eating or drown.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMaria sucked in a mouthful of the pig slop, gulping it down. It was thick and warm and only barely flavorful enough to ignore the fact she was drinking fat. She struggled to suck down enough of the mush so she could get her nose up again. Until another bucket came in, filling up the trough nearly to her eyes. She started to struggle, trying to get her knees under her, trying to force against the bonds, but she was pulled tight in position. There was no moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to eat. Eat or drown. She started gulping the mush down as fast as she could, open her mouth wide and sucking in great mouthful of it until her nose was free. She panted through her nose wildly, trying to suck in breath. The next bucket crashed in, nearly drowning her again. Again, Maria wildly gulped at the slop until she could get her nose free and take a momentary break. And again she was put under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fourth near drowning frayed her nerves, she realized she would have to give up trying to stop at all. She would have to gulp. It was the only way to get the life giving air. So in the growing sun, she gulped. It took her nearly ten minutes, but she was able to find a pace of swallowing the slop where she wouldn't get smothered by it, and she worked at it. She baked in the sun, her rotund weight warming her quickly, making her sweat. And the horrible food was giving hell to her guts, making her widened ass burst with sporadic farts. Every time, the pigs cheered and laughed, hands slapping at the fattened ass, the bloated belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was less aching than before. Every part of her body didn't hurt. And there was much more time for her belly to expand and swell into the meal. She could feel it spreading over the grass in front of the barn, pushing out to either side of her. Pushing her breasts up to her neck. Then the familiar feeling came again. The fact she was pushing more food into her body then it wanted. Worse, she had to slowly push herself up onto her knees, bunching herself closer to the trough to give her belly more room. Each gulp pushed it fuller, but there wasn't much room for her to give herself. Her fat thighs pushed her stomach from underneath. All she was doing as pushing her ass higher into the air.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis time, at least, she could see her progress. Watching the table dwindle as the entire thing was served to her. Meat pastries softened in warm grease. Heavy meat soups and sauces mixed with thick fat. Sweets by the dozen, buttercream icing, ruined and mixed into a greasy slurry. She had to chomp down and gulp the mostly liquid meal to get air back into her nose. It was a day long process. But without rest. A full day of feasting.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nWhen the sun began to set, they pushed the fox off and onto her back. She could hardly breathe, aching for each gasp as her stomach pushed down against her. A massive sphere that loomed over her, sloshing, gurgling, creaking painfully as each townspig touched it to 'bless' it. Grease covered her entire face and breasts, and sweat cooled her aching belly and body. Every touch to her belly was heaven, soothing the unbelievably large meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Maria didn't think she could last another day of being so forcefully stuffed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maria didn't remember getting back into the barn. She didn't remember going to sleep either. Eating for a solid day until she was about to burst had made her a sweaty exhausted mess. Eating just to stay alive. The early morning light showed her a different view than last night. The wall across from her. Well, that and the tops of her prodigious breasts. Was she asleep in some sort of giant chair? A slowly squirm gave her the facts, to her horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she let her body shift and wobble, she realized she was on the floor of the barn. Her ass had simply grown so fat, it was impossible for her to sleep on her back. She could feel the warm bulk of her back piling on top of the massive cheeks. Maria started to panic, a visceral response to the feeling of being pinned to the ground by her widened bulk. Her fat winged arms flailed about until she grabbed the sides of her stall. Already, sweat was starting to pour down from her head and body from the movement, running little rivulets down her bulk. She grabbed the stall door in pudgy paws and slowly heaved. Gasping, she strained against gravity to get herself on her feet. Her breasts alone were like massive weights that kept moving back and forth, stained with yesterday's voluminous meal. With a herculean strain, she got one foot under her, then the other, stumbling out of the stall. She felt like an overstuffed ooze.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every step was an effort. She had to maneuver carefully out of the stall, using her paws to push her tits into the right place. Vixens always got the lion share there, but this was ridiculous. They were two huge stuffed globes on top of her belly, the air brushing across the sweat drenched surface. Standing up, they didn't block as much of her sight as before, but she swore she thought they were bigger than SHE used to be. Pushing out of the stall took unwedging her ass. Slowly, she took tentative steps towards the barn doors. It was more like shuffles. She had to move each massive thigh against the other, all the while trying to shift just one of her three foot wide rump cheeks against the other. By the time she got to the doors, she was exhausted, heaving with breath. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The doors opened. She was greeted again by the usual routine. Two cold buckets of water washed out the remnants of yesterday's meal on her titanic tits and the worst of the sweat. The boar priest's tusked grin widened as he watched the vixen struggle just to stay standing. She looked like someone had taken the fine curved beauty and stuffed them full of jelly. He waved his icon of the Lipomancer once, giving her the choice. The feast table in front of her... or whatever torture they could think of. Maria thought briefly of objecting, but her stomach protested. It was a deep roiling gurgle that started in her guts and built up into a belch. The entire town was gathering again to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The table was loaded like it always was. Piles of omelettes, racks of different sorts of every sort of pork, potatoes, gallons of creme, fluffy pastries. Her stomach protested again. She hadn't eaten real food in days. And she was tired. So tired. Step after plodding step, she waddled over towards the table. There was a massive bench seat, made not only to accommodate her massive ass, but designed to go bigger. It had some odds hinges in some places. The guards slid the benches back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Are you ready to give in?\" The boar mocked as Maria sat down on the sturdy wooden bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dull fire of hunger dug at Maria's stomach, and a light headed feeling swam over her brain as it demanded food. Leaning forward slowly, Maria reached out to grab a pastry in one chunky paw, watching as the entire city waited for her. Seven days of feasting. She'd only gone through two of them and she was already as big as a horse. Two horses! She popped the pastry into her mouth, the thick filling dripping down her chin as she chewed. It was heavenly. She fought back a little moan at the simple joy of food she didn't have to struggle to eat. They didn't skimp on anything. Sugar was supposed to be scarce, yet everything here had mountains of it. There was no dirth of butter, or lack of cream. It was work at first to get the food over her breasts. Whenever she leaned forward, the huge pillows pressed over the table. And she had to lift the food up and over them back to her greedy maw. But she started a rhythm. Fishing food up to her mouth with one paw while the other one was busy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was more leisurely, she found. No one forced her to eat. No one cramming food into her face. She could breathe easily. But a worry crept into Maria's mind. The damage had been done. Her stomach was cavernous from how much got forced into it. Even as she kept eating, she was still hungry. It gnawed at her, demanded that she continue to indulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Food never stopped coming. And it was never the same. Plates kept coming up to her fat paws as she kept stuffing food into her face. Slice of ham disappeared into her mouth, only to be replaced with a platter of new pastries. Cream dripped down her cheeks as she ate to try and fill her belly. Maybe if she was full under her own power, they'd let her go. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hours drifted by as she worked at her food. People came and went as they pleased, but she couldn't go. She had to keep eating. Her stomach felt like it had a lead weight in it, still it demanded more. Her paws had gotten slick with icing and grease. A new light sheen of sweat developed over her body, drops of it dripping from her breasts and belly to the ground. Somewhere, lunch came along, coming to pastries filled with cheese and sauce. Maria whined to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The food was just good. GRAND. Heavenly. Every new bite of something that gushed sauce down her cheeks was something she had never tried before. Tender meats in sauces, sugary delights. She could hardly pay attention to her breasts slowly rising up, her stomach steadily filling up. She took a tankard that was offered to her and tipped it up to her muzzle, guzzling down the thick dark brew. Immediately following it with a cheese filled potato, groaning in hedonist delight as the warm gooey cheese mixture went down. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No one had to cajole her. Slowly, her ass grew wider, the bench filling up more with the orange and white cheeks. Her body grew heavier, more sweat coming down as the day passed noon and it started to heat him. Her legs spread to either side as her belly grew, filling up with food. It was slow, her pace making it hard to get herself full. Her arms got heavier, her breasts had swollen up even further, making her lean forward more to reach the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was late afternoon when Maria came out of her trance. The bench she was sitting on was starting to creak and the guards were working at it, prying something from underneath her massive asscheeks. They had gotten so large she could see the tops of them over her shoulder. The bench made a CLUNK and Maria fell to the ground, though a short jiggly fall. She would never get up again, she knew that. She was even having trouble seeing the table now that her belly pushed her breasts up into her chubby face. She groaned as she reached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The boar appeared next to her, in her line of sight, eyebrows raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gulping down the last of her pride, Maria whined, \"Can I get some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The town cheered. Each of them picked up a plate to bring up to their sacrificial vixen. They did not force, instead, they just urged, trying to provide the bloated vixen with their dish before anyone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When night came, Maria was pleasantly asleep, her face smeared in sauces.</span></div></div>",

The sun on her face woke her up and reminded her of her position.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nShe couldn't lie down. She was stuck in a sort of sitting position, bouyed up by her own mass. Her ass two red and white hillocks behind her that pushed up higher than her head, forcing a set of backrolls to push down towards her head. Her front view wasn't much better. Always a fine example of the vixen species, her breasts were now two massive beanbags that blocked her view, weighing heavily to either side of her belly, pushing their weight on her flabby arms. Not that they could do well on their own. Her elbows were lost somewhere in the fact. An experimental wiggle of her fingers showed that they weren't much better than bloated sausages, the only thing poking out from her flabby fore arms. A testing wiggle of toes confirmed her feet were in the same condition, all but swallowed up in the single blob each of her legs has become. The remnants of last nights feast spread out over her massive stomach. Sensing she was awake, it immediately began to protest. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nMaria whined pitifully for a moment before worked up the energy to call in a heavy breathy voice. \"Is someone there? I'm... starving.\" It was something she didn't want to admit, but she craved it more than anything now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy wooden sound next to her and Maria looked, still able to see over her shoulder to see the boarpriest setting down a thick wooden stool and standing up on it so she could see him properly. \"It's so much easier when our 'guest' is willing. None of that working against us to slow things down.\" He waved his hands and more of the townspigs came over with a wooden contraption. Fear immediately filled Maria's labored heart and she broke out into a new sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo cross pieces were set over her face, mounted at the side of ladders. From there, a large wooden slope was secured, leading down to her face. She cringed, expecting something to be forced into her mouth, but instead, the first of breakfast dishes was escorted by a young hog up her sides and onto the ramp. It was certainly undiginified to have the eggs topple down right onto her fat face and cheeks. But when, given how hungry she was, she didn't care. As soon as it was in reach, she started chomping down, chewing great noisy bites. Food rolled down across the plank, leaving bits of cream and grease behind. Blissfully, the pace was slowly. She could breathe. More importantly, she could taste everything. A pastry dropped across her fat cheeks into her muzzle and she had a moment to savor the exquisite buttery flakes and the rich sweet frosting. Everything here used far too much butter and sugar.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA platter full of eggs and bacon and cheese slid across the plank, toppling into tongue range where she greedily snapped it up, the rich fluffy softness of eggs mixed with a salty greasy crunch of bacon and the sharpness of cheddar cheese. She never felt hurried, even as food came faster. When she coughed and looked up at her feeder and murmured, \"Can I have something to drink?\" The pig feeding her smiled wistfully and the food was stopped for jugs of rich cold cream. Gently poured into her mouth, washing away the thick grease and sweetness of her previous breakfast, little rivulets dropping down her cheeks and chins. Food was brought back out again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria lost complete track of time. She was aware that things were changing. She was getting warmer as more sun hit her now considerable surface area, causing sweat to begin to drip from her vast curves. Food was moving from eggs and pastries and creams to meats, cheeses, cakes and chocolates. Her poor stomach, which had been filled until she nearly burst, was given respite, but under the new slow pace, never registered any sort of fullness, even as the wide orange and white expanse swelled. When the sweat became too thick across her face and cheeks, threatening to start to pool, hands gently dabbed away the sweat and the worst of the mass that had accumulated over her face. The fact they had to stop to clean her up gave Maria a moment to let loose a thunderous BWOOOORP and then whine up at her captors, \"I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMore food came. Home baked and hearty. Thick with fat and juice. Hands pat down on her growing stomach as it lurched slowly upward and outward, soothing it. She was too focused on a delicious series of ale barrels to notice the fact her massive breasts have pressed against the grass to either side of her stomach. There was too much to enjoy in the selection of cakes everyone wanted to push into her mouth to notice her ass pressing up against the barn now, or the backrolls starting to press against the back of her head, threatening to bury her body in lard. Her muzzle had a new thicker roll underneath it, pushing it upward. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe fact that it was night and she was still eating registered vaguely to her. But everyone was laughing and cheering now, and she was enjoying the wine being offered to her, poured into her mouth. Her stomach was always in sight now, a gurgling mass of white that kept pushing higher below her. The tinge of alcohol on her mind kept her from being too worried about the fact her cheeks were so massive she could hardly see over them. Or the fact that she was so vast, her backrolls started to press onto her head, both asscheeks now covering a good portion of the barn. It grew hot again and the food changed back into delicious eggs, Maria eagerly snapping them up as fast as they were dumped onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food stopped. Or at least, people stopped pushing food into her face. For that brief instant, Maria whined and tried to squirm. She couldn't see, her eyes permanently squeezed shut by her cheeks. She moaned weakly, out of breath, each movement feeling exhausting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two rats pushed experimentally into the vixen in front of them. \"I heard fox girls had big tits, but damn.\" One commented, slapping the heavy mass as they worked the oil on. Usually they could just do it by hand, but this whale needed two mops. The two rats worked diligently, spreading the teleportation potion all over the vast mass of wheezing lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's getting agitated.\"<br>\r\n\"Probably because she hasn't eaten in five seconds,\" the second chuckled nastily. She was nearly nine feet tall sitting. And three times as wide. The hogs went about dutifully in the mean time, moving away benches and buckets and contraptions until the next year. Already, the high mountain of belly was gurgling in hunger. Both rats snickered again, gooping the oil onto one massive side of her ass, a squashed jiggling hill that was twice as high as her head, leaving her body in a little valley of curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third rat in robes made his way over to the boarpriest, holding a sack. Inside were purple beads. A years worth of crop growth. No tending, no farming, no work needed. He deposited the leather sack in the hammy hand and bowed. \"The Lipomancer is pleased with your contribution and eagerly awaits next year's sacrifice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-vwip-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was gone. In her spot, the earth was bowed down, crushed under her weight. \"I hope next years resists more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was hungry right now, and what was a warrior without bloodstained armour? Not a very fearsome one, she reckoned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraddling the sow's back, the fox leaned down with her arms around its neck, as if hugging it. Instead, she dug her claws into the yielding flesh and tore it away in great bloody chunks, digging deeper and deeper until she wrapped her hands around thick blood tubes and tore them free, silencing the sow's wet squeals. Now it was time to feast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling off the corpse and landing near its side, Maria grabbed a great slab of meat and pulled, using all the strength hidden on her lithe frame. Blood squirted out, coating her hands and thighs, and she stuffed the hunk of hide into her mouth, gnawing on it. The flavour was delicious, intense. The best damn pig she'd ever had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the hide and hugging the ground, Maria stuck her face right into the hole she'd made on the side of the pig and started chomping at the meat, heedless of the blood that coated her head and shoulders. She stuffed every bit of flesh she could into her maw, salivating and growling with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some time before she began to show signs of reaching her limit, her slim stomach swelling out roundly, still firm to the touch, but packed with food. Still she ate on, lost to the flavour and her savage nature. Far and away in her mind, her civilized side stopped trying to get her attention and just sat down to wait it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, when her belly was swollen as if nine months pregnant, but packed with no-longer living flesh, she withdrew herself from her position practically inside the pig and leaned up against its side, supremely satisfied. She rested a hand on her belly and closed her eyes, quite drowsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of a minute, she was asleep.</span></div></div>",

She yawned, and closed them for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened them again, she was under cover of trees, leaves swaying in a gentle breeze. Now she squeezed her eyes shut to banish her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext time she opened them, it was starry sky she saw above her again. But this time, she was aware of movement. This couldn't have been right, as she was prone on her back. Or supposed to be! What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to her sides and saw rotund little mice, no bigger than three feet in height each, and surely at least that around, each supporting one of her limbs, waddling along towards some unknown destination. \"What the Nine Hells?\" she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll forward movement abruptly ceased. \"Oh. She's awake!\" One of the mice squeaked fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria jerked her arms out of their grasps and shifted her weight, causing the other two mice to spill her onto the ground. She rolled in the air, landed on her hands and knees, and sprang up, roaring \"What the fuck do you think you're doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mice, utterly cowed, could only gape at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria felt something snap inside her; something red. \"You know what? Don't care. Hungry now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, she grabbed the first mouse by the neck and swung him into the second, knocking him down. One mouse came to his senses and tried to flee. Maria flung the mouse she held after him like a missile, knocking him down with a sick crunch. The fourth one she punted into a tree, hitting it with a crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second mouse was oozing blood from a head wound. Maria put her foot on his head and pushed down until it split open like a melon. The first mouse was dead, neck broken by strain. The third was struggling to crawl away under the dead weight of his friend, gasping desperately. The fourth remained motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, smirk bloody and stare cold and paralyzing, picked up the third mouse by his arm, dangling him before her. With her other hand, she grabbed him round the chest, digging her claws in, then shifted her right hand into the same position. Regardless of his squeaks of pain, she pulled her hands apart. The mouse was torn in half before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes glinting with madness, she raised half of the body to her mouth and opened wide...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She picked around the bones and scraps of fabric that once were clothing, dropping the bits she did not wish to eat. She brought the other half up to her mouth, and ate eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot near enough to satisfy her wicked appetite, the vixen proceeded to eat her way through the rest of the mice in morbid fashion, filling her stomach to a point where she no longer hungered. Her stomach bulged only a little this time, barely noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that all that was out of the way... \"Where did those little bastards haul me off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked around. She was on a trail, but there was no way it was a straight shot back to that sow. She would've noticed something like that. And she didn't desire getting hopelessly lost and starving to death. So that was definitely the less-preferable option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if the mice were taking her this way, they probably had dwellings further along. Maybe the other inhabitants could help her get back to where she needed to go. Or maybe they would just make good meals. Either way...</span></div></div>",

Obviously, the trap hadn't been meant to kill anyone, so what the hell...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking the other way, she realized she was at the end of a long hallway. Torches burned brightly at regular intervals, and stretched between the walls just under the ceiling was something she could hardly credit: banners, signs, with her name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Welcome Maria!' one read. 'Congratulations!' Read the next one. She continued down the hallway, gaping up at them. 'Good luck!' 'Eating Competition Dead Ahead!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating competition...?\" Maria pondered aloud. Subconsciously, she rubbed her stomach. \"Well... that can't be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, her next step sent her whooshing downwards on a slick slope, and she squealed involuntarily. It wasn't unpleasant; she just wished she had some warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was dumped out into what seemed to be an underground arena. Torches again circled the walls, high out of reach, and closed gates were spaced regularly throughout the space. The seats above were currently empty. In the middle sat a heavy table, loaded with food, but no chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria approached this carefully. As she reached it, a gate across the room suddenly lowered, and three small shapes were shoved forward, stumbling. As they, too, approached the table, she could see they too, were mice, as small and round as the last four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal? Is this food for us?\" She asked one particularly harmless-looking one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" the little mouse said meekly, nodding. \"If you think you can get it, that is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria blinked at this, unsure if she had heard that right. \"If I-? What? You're going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whipped around and saw the other two mice already on the table, picking at the food. Her temper flared; the beast awakened. \"Like Hell you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backhanded one mouse clear off the table, punted the one at her feet, picked up a heavy plate and brained the third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an angry sort of squeaking, the other two mice, surprisingly resilient, came charging at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria laughed and pounced the closest one, squishing it beneath her feet. Drawing her sword, she spun and brought it down, cleaving the other one in half. \"Hahaha! That's what I thought!\" she laughed triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped her sword on her armour and sheathed it again. Eyeing the food, she picked up a roast chicken leg, feeling peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could sink her teeth in, a slow, dry clapping came from the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, instantly alert, but could see only shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good!\" The voice, surely belonging to the owner of the hands, croaked. \"Eat heartily, vixen, and rest well. For tomorrow, my Food Fights begin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Maria!\" She yelled at the empty bleachers. \"My name's Maria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she tore in, de-boning the chicken leg rather neatly, and swallowing the moist, spicy meat after masticating it to a fine mush. Next, she stuffed down stuffing, swallowed vegetable soup, and packed in pie. Behind her, for the moment unheeded, a gate opened, light shining in the pathway behind it. She finally saw this after finishing off a flask of wine, her belly taut and warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no other choice, yet finding herself wishing for none, Maria ambled through the open gate, around a corner, and into a very plush room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor beneath her feet was deeply soft and lightly ticklish, the bed before her big enough for three, with mattress thick as her waist and blankets of deep blue adorning it, fluffy pillows set against the headboard. A bookshelf stood against one wall, nigh overflowing with literature, and a scroll rack sat next to that, a scroll in each hole. A wide wardrobe stood against the other wall, open to reveal both silky undergarments and tough leather armours. There were no windows, but torches and lanterns kept it bright, and a fireplace kept it warm. Accommodations, she thought, fit for a Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, stretching and yawning, stripped down, changed into some of the provided undergarments, and cast herself onto the bed. She snuggled under the covers and soon fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Leather dyed in every colour, cut in every style was available for her to choose, as well as casual, formal, and nighttime gowns, blouses, skirts, and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost reluctant to trade in her bloodstained armour, Maria couldn't resist the allure of a finely crafted black leather cuirass, painted with gold swirls, for her top, matching leather leggings, and the gauntlets, to complete the set. Hell, there was even a sheath, she saw, trading it for her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, well, she felt like a badass. A hot badass. She examined herself in the room's large mirror, quite ignorant of the fact that today, her stomach looked a little softer, less toned, merely average. She felt- and now looked- better than ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria!\" the voice croaked, returning. \"You must be hungry! Well, here, if you want to eat, you fight for it, my dear! And you have some hungry competition...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck those guys!\" Maria snarled, whipping around and marching quickly towards the door. \"I need to be fed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon emerged into the arena again. Across the room, from two different gates, her competition emerged. On the left was a rabbit lady, of all species, looking distinctly underfed and uneasy, armed with a dagger. On the right was a slightly more formidable-looking human male, armed with an axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no pretense, the rabbit darted for the food, looking desperate. Surprised, both Maria and the human darted forward, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human seemed reluctant to use his axe, instead hip-checking the rabbit aside as he reached her, making her drop the biscuit she was holding. \"Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had no such qualms. She unsheathed her sword and swung it in a great arc, making the human step back to avoid losing his head. \"Hungry? Try cold steel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we don't have to fight!\" The rabbit protested meekly, ears laying flat. \"There's enough for us all to get a little... Enough to survive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human appeared to consider this for a few moments, and Maria fingered her sword. \"Hmm, yes, you have a POINT!\" She ran the rabbit through with this last word, quickly withdrawing her blade and leaping the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps stunned by the bad pun, he did nothing as Maria spilled his guts onto the floor. He died with the same stupidly-shocked expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smirked, wiped her blade clean on his leggings, and sheathed her sword. \"Stupid men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further delays or forthcoming challenges, she celebrated with breakfast- or at least, the first meal of the day. It was indeed larger than she herself needed, but she ate it all happily, her belly swelling to hold it. Patting it proudly, she retired to her room to await her next meal. A victory nap was in order.</span></div></div>",

So she could bring the food back with her, right? Well, after her victory, she was sure she could do whatever she wanted with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling out into the Arena, she eyed the competition- just one other, this time, a strong- and pissed-looking puma woman. The puma sprinted not for the food, but towards her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria drew her sword and charged forward, face set in grim determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met with a clash of steel and sparks, neither giving way as they glared at each other. Then they jumped back, readying their swords again. Another swing, another clash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA parry! A feint! A clash! A swipe! A jump! A clash! A duck! A clash! Clash! Clash!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unff- ARRRGGHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, panting slightly, laughed. Bending down carefully, she picked up the arm, still clutching a sword, that lay at her feet. Her hackles were raised, her blood was flooded with adrenaline, and a mad light glinted in her eyes. As the puma watched, snarling, the fox raised the arm to her lips and tore a chunk out of it, chewing and swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm! Victory!\" she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puma's expression changed to surprise and horror, incredulous at this display. The vixen was mad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria pried the sword from the warm, dead fingers, grasped the wrist, and brought the arm down on the puma's skull. She raised it and did it again, and again, and again. Blood spurted from her stump, and her skull quickly caved in under the rain of blows, pink brain matter mixing with blood and bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria finally stopped, dipped the severed end of the arm on the blood, and took another bite. \"Fucking victory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the table, she gorged herself on as much as she could, stuffing her stomach to the limit, and gathered the rest on her arms, leaving the extra by the rest of the puma. She strutted off to her room, grinning darkly.</span></div></div>",

She knew she should be training, or something, to make sure she could keep winning... But honestly, she felt better than ever! Stronger, faster, more dexterous... Talk about a good night's sleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hells, maybe the bed is magic,\" she chuckled, sitting down on it. \"Magically damn comfortable, for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about this for a few moments,  she flopped backwards onto it. 'If this really is magic, I want as much of its effect as I can get! Whatever do between meals from now on, I'm doing it in bed!' She resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeather armour couldn't have been the most comfortable thing to sleep in, but Maria must've managed, for she was woken by a buzz sometime later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel the need to say anything clever to you, so off you go,\" the voice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shrugged and left. Fair enough. There was something slightly different about the arena, this time. Or rather, something different in it- an audience. There were perhaps a dozen beings in all, a drop in a bucket when it came to the number of seats, but they appeared to be there willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were half a dozen who were obviously servants in the castle, judging by their state of dress, two young noble ladies, if their posh clothes were any indication, and four floating orbs she recognized as scrying orbs. Was she being watched from afar now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer opponent, a stocky bear, seemed rather dazed herself by the prospect of being watched in action. It was several seconds before she realized Maria was running at her full-speed, and she didn't have time to react before a fist slammed into her face, shattering her nose in a spray of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to put on a bit of a show for the audience, Maria kneeled on the bear's back and twisted her arm behind her, making her roar in pain. Pulling up a little more, she heard a satisfying snap, and the bear whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stood up and kicked her opponent in the ribs. \"C'mon then, honey-humper. You've got one good arm. Come get me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strolled out to the center of the arena and leaned on the table, grazing casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear levered herself up, panting, gathered herself, and charged towards Maria, one arm dangling uselessly at her side. More than anything, it was the humiliation that drove her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria drew her sword, but did not attack, instead dodging the bear's clumsy swipes, once even smacking her ass with the flat of her blade. \"Good thing there are no hills, here! You'd trip over your own feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, she let the bear take a swipe at her, bent backwards to avoid it, and then propelled her upper half violently forward like a loaded trebuchet. With her forehead, she smashed the bear's jaw, rattling and loosening several teeth. Grinning, she watched the bear spit blood and teeth. Before she could try and attack again, Maria swiftly kicked out her knee, and the bear sprawled helplessly on the ground, panting, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her sword, the vixen rammed it home in the bear's heart. She expired with a wet gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the clapping this time was visible, coming from the slaves, and the two noble ladies nodded their approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grinned, bowed, and stomped on the bear's stomach. Her sword came shooting up, and she snatched it by the handle, flourished it, and sheathed it. Battle won, she dug into her feast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After devouring her supper, Maria retired to the welcome embrace of her bed, gladly changing into silky undergarments before flopping in. Unbeknownst to her, it was not the bed that worked magically through the night, but the food she had so readily shown her gullet, increasing her mass in more than one way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, again to the sound of a buzzer, she jumped out of bed feeling, in her own words, \"Fucking fantastic!\" There was a bit more bounce in her step for good reason. Her stomach was now slightly rounded, even empty, sporting a soft layer of fat over her muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, eager for a breakfast brawl, Maria paid no heed to her body other than to admire the strength she felt waiting to be used. She strapped on her armour and sword and rushed out the door, salivating already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular tiger she faced across the arena seemed to have some speech prepared. \"I will slay you, wicked vixen, and the light of my god will shine through-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut your religious claptrap and let's fight, fatty!\" She challenged, running full-on towards him with her sword hanging by her side and her tongue hanging out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger paused in his quick stride towards the table, looking down and poking himself uncertainly. \"I am not fat...\" he said, hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Maria herself, her words carried more weight than she thought. She hopped up onto the table, avoiding the food, and then flung herself off, cackling manically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger looked up just in time to watch Maria's fist enter his field of vision and just as quickly trim it in half as it smashed his eye with a crunch and a 'pop!'. He fell back, screaming, and tripped over his own tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave him no quarter, dropping onto his chest on her knees, none-too-gently, and working at his ribs. One-by-one she cracked his ribs, the sounds audible even over his quickly-wheezy and quieting screams. She must've punctured a lung at least once, for he began to foam blood at the mouth. Doubling her fists, she raised them far behind her head, like she was going to scratch her back, and then brought them down on the tiger's nose like a hammer. Blood flew everywhere as it shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger finally went silent, his breathing becoming even shallower as the blackness took the rest of his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another victim of self-esteem issues!\" Maria declared to the arena at large. \"Be proud of who you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Mad Maria!\" Someone in the audience cheered, whooping. This got the rest of the audience, a dozen beings, clapping as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound wasn't spectacular in the large amphitheater, but to \"Mad\" Maria, it was the sweetest music. She bowed, grinning widely, immensely pleased. Hopping up onto the table with a omelet clutched in her hands, she yelled \"Thank you! This is for you, fans!\" And she crammed it whole into her mouth, only a little messily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the taste of food now influencing her anew, the vixen scrambled down to the ground to stuff her face. What an adventure this was turning out to be!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even by her next breakfast, by which time Maria looked lightly pregnant, in terms of body shape, the vixen couldn't help but notice she was beginning to draw a wider audience. Where yesterday morning, she had seen a dozen audience members, today, as she prepared to throw down with a chubby elf, she counted  twice that, and a half-dozen scrying orbs, to boot. And who knew how many- or whom- was watching those transmissions on the other end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf, as they squared off, hadn't lost any of her speed, jabbing and weaving her dagger with hard-to-follow speed. Maria was on the defensive, keeping away from the sharp object. Despite the distance advantage her sword would give her, she didn't yet have it drawn, already growing to relish the brutally fulfilling feel of bashing some skulls with her bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elf misstepped, Maria grabbed her arm, and exerting her strength, bent it at the elbow completely the wrong way. The elf screamed and her fingers went dead, releasing the dagger. Maria delivered a downright fierce uppercut to the elf's jaw, dazing her, then released her and drove an elbow into her chest, knocking the wind out of her and causing her to fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the dagger while the elf wheezed and tried to get some semblance of her higher brain functions working, Maria strode over to her and drove it down through the top of her skull, ensuring she never would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning and waving at her cheering audience, she glutted herself proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy suppertime, the audience had another half-dozen members, and after Maria had dispatched of her opponent by denting their skull until they stopped moving and breathing, she ate and looked over just who was looking over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany members were more monstrous beings- a couple of werewolves, some Cyclopes, ogres, lamias. One section- being studiously avoided by everyone else- seemed populated by the reanimated- ghouls, mummies, wights. A plump bunny in black sat in the middle of them all; Maria knew a necromancer when she saw one. Were they enjoying it too, she wondered? Or were they just her entourage? Regardless, the werewolves and unnaturally attractive succubae and incubi were enjoying it. Odd that they coexisted peacefully with the human nobles who had gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they all loved her, and that was all that mattered. She blew them bloody kisses, bowed, and flexed.  She had since forgotten why she'd come here, or indeed that she was beneath a castle; she lived to perform in the Ample Amphitheater now, and she supposed she would die in it, hopefully in a blaze of gory glory. Maybe for one day before that, be a Champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunchtime the next day, at least as many as last night had come to see the almost-chubby champ-in-the-making lay the smack down on her opponent. Quite literally, a particularly strong backhand had spun their head around so fast their neck snapped. More than one mother would go home and tell her children that it really could happen, if they acted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheering for her was louder than ever, finally a respectable rumble in the arena, unmistakable. \"Tell your friends!\" Maria yelled triumphantly. \"Bring your families! And send me your enemies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazed upon her adoring fans, noting most of the nobles, if they did not share similar colours or insignias, shared similar figures- portly, plush, signs of wealth and affluence. That they would come to see her honored her. Nobles were notoriously picky; they could get the best of everything. So their increasing presence would seem to indicate she was increasingly the best! Inspiring, indeed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Drunk with victory, Maria stumbled back into her quarters with a sway and tumble as she crashed down onto her godly bed, the impact creating a slight jiggle amongst her softer areas. With her mouth hanging open, Maria was knocked out and began to dream of battle and blood lust, two of her favorite things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in a dark and foreboding tower at the top of the mysterious castle that Maria was currently residing in, a meeting between a hooded figure and a scrying orb was taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is the greatest combatant I have ever seen enter the Ample Ampitheater! With each opponent she vanquishes her thirst for blood grows! Will you not give me permission to have her compete in my name? I shall pay you handsomely, if you so choose to relinquish Maria to me...\u201d said the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded figure's eyes stayed on the ground, seemingly looking for the answer upon his floor. But then the hood moved up, and the figure spoke with a commanding tone that one would expect to hear from a royal king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria is mine and mine only. I should have guessed the purpose of this meeting before you even mentioned it to me. None of you 'lords' shall lay a hand upon her!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the lights (the few it had) in the tower suddenly went dim at the last shout from the hooded figure, the force of it even dimming the scrying orb slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment before the orb spoke again, as the lord peering from inside was trying desperately to not soil his undergarments. \u201cI can see that you do not wish to negotiate.....However, I wish to propose a deal with you, Lipomancer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of his supposed name, the Lipomancer lifted his head with interest. \u201cSpeak of this deal then, before I lose my steadily declining patience...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, here it is. I will send some of my own combatants to your castle to fight with Maria. If my combatants win, Maria will be mine to do with as I wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if Maria wins\u201d, replied the Lipomancer in a mocking tone, \u201cyou shall deliver to me five hundred sacks of pure gold coins, straight from your own personal safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree with your terms-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on there, I'm not finished yet.\u201d interrupted the Lipomancer. \u201cYou will also deliver to me twenty of your most beautiful harem maidens. And also be sure to pack larger clothing with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb tried again to speak. \u201cI agree with your terms. But these will only come to pass if Maria-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah blah, yadda yadda, I understand! Now leave my castle! Go! GO!\u201d The orb hurriedly sped out the window of the tower back to wherever its user lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer watched as the quickly shrinking orb sped off into the distance, body bouncing as he chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFool. Your deal,\u201d said the Lipomancer, \u201cis doomed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came, and with it a yawn of contentedness from a drowsy Maria. She rubbed her eyes as magical light shone into her room, illuminating her vast closet and expertly decorated scroll shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, today is gonna be a good freakin' day.\u201d said Maria as she hefted herself off her bed with more bounce than usual. (A good portion of that bounce being supplied from her expanded rear.) As she stood Maria pulled off one more satisfying stretch that made her slight pot belly push out, and let her arms swoosh down with a loud sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Maria. Today's breakfast battle will be a particularly special one.\u201d said the voice of Maria's mystery host. \u201cInstead of the usual one on one kind of fight, you will be pitched against multiple opponents all at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barbaric grin planted itself on Maria's rounded face, and she fist pumped the air in excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is one more thing Maria.\u201d As the host said this, a green beam of energy materialized from the floor in front of Maria. In the middle of said beam there was a floating ring. Maria instinctively grabbed it without waiting for instructions and studied the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the ring of Voregar the Ever-Eating. It has abilities that could be useful to you in the coming fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a metallic gray/white color and had a lustrous shine to it. She turned the ring over in her hand and saw that there was what appeared to be a creature of some kind with its mouth gaping wide open. In the center of the mouth was an emerald. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria slipped it on her ring finger, but it got stuck half-way. \u201cUmmm....its a little tight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring suddenly grew to go fully around her thick fingers. She held her hand out in front of her to admire how it looked on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts very....fitting. Why are you suddenly giving away magical stuff to me anyways? And besides, I don't need stinking magic to help me win!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry Maria. I have the utmost faith in your physical abilities. I just want to see the look on Dorin's face when he sees you....Uhm...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria raised a furred eyebrow at this statement. \u201cSee me do what exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. Absolutely nothing. I was getting caught up in a different matter. Now, get armored up! I can't begin the fight without you up in the theater first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria did as he told, and chose the same black leather armor for the fight, which, unusually, was fitting a bit snugger then usual. \u201cI must be getting some muscles!\u201d shouted Maria as she attempted to flex her arms, but she only succeeded in jiggling her fatty upper arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria now stood at the far end of the theater, bobbing her head to the rythmic chant of her expertly gained title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMad Maria! Mad Maria! Mad Maria!\u201d Almost all of the spectators were chanting her name. The few that weren't were some scrying orbs and a full lot of zombies that were falling apart even as they spectated the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grinding sound at the opposite end of the theater alerted Maria and the crowd of spectators to the arrival of her opponent, who appeared to be a hunch-backed figure in a purple cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this a joke?! Am I really fighting an old geezer here!\u201d said Maria, which was followed by a cacophony of laughs and chuckles from the chubby vulpine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA table arose from the middle of the theater stacked from end to end with...pastries! Pastries of all kinds were arranged on the table, with the centerpiece being a grand six layered caramel chocolate cake almost as tall as Maria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and drooled at the cake, just now noticing the groans coming from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhhh.......Wow that looks damn good...\u201d She struggled to take her eyes of the cake and focus on her enemy, but eventually managed to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at her enemy, ready to pounce at any given second, when the unthinkable happened.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all jumped off each other in a professional manner, obviously having done the maneuver before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGnome Force Five, go!\u201d yelled the portliest gnome, a male with a bright red beard. He pulled out two 'short' swords from his sides as he charged at Maria, the other four gnomes following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA malicious grin appeared on Maria's face. \u201cOh hell, this is gonna be fucking fun!\u201d She charged at the gnomes with as much vigor as a bull in a jewelry store, her sharp teeth gleaming and sword pointed in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo gnomes coming from the left attempted to distract Maria as the leader and other two gnomes charged forward. But Maria, a cunning vulpine, predicted what they were going to do. As they were all closing in on her, she dropped down quickly to see the gnomes all collide into one another. She took this moment to lop the head off one of the gnomes and kick the leader back a couple of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly got up again and blocked a strike from a female gnome with messy black hair. \u201cYou'll pay for that you bitch!\u201d yelled the little gnome, referring to her headless comrade. Maria just laughed and kicked the gnomes sword out of her hand, then punted her across the arena in a comedic fashion. The gnomes head found itself impaled onto one of the guard spikes in front of the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tired looking ogre looked at the lifeless body, tore it from the spike and swiftly devoured it with no emotion. Maria couldn't help but chuckle at that little spectacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly brought her attention back to the fight, now with only three gnomes remaining. She quickly dodged a jab from one gnomes shortened polearm, and cleaved in two with her bloody sword. She picked up the blade part of it, and gutted the gnome trying to sneak up behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at the gnome that had the polearm to see that he was running away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don't!\u201d Maria picked up the gutted gnome and tossed him at the fleeing gnome. The body made contact, and both gnomes made contact with the spiked wall, a sickening crunch resounding through the theater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria chuckled and looked to the last gnome, the red bearded leader. He was struggling to get up from the ground, for he had broken a leg from Maria's kick. He spat out blood, and leaned on one of his shortswords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you are a...monster! No one...has ever beaten us before....\u201d Maria was now slowly walking towards the wounded gnome. \u201cMy friends...all slaughtered....by you...\u201d Maria licked her lips, the sliver ring she wore now glowing unnaturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shall...defeat you, devil, no matter how-ungh!\u201d Maria had grasped the gnome by his neck, bringing him up to her hungry gaze, her eyes glowing an eery green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough talk. I'm hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Maria brought the gnomes head into her mouth, and began shoving the rest of his body into her awaiting stomach. The gnome struggled, his feet kicking out and muffled yells coming from inside Maria's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed down on his body with her paws, throat bulging out to accommodate the gnomes girth. His tiny legs were next to disappear down Maria's gullet, followed by his small feet. Once the gnome had all gone down, Maria re-hinged her jaw and let out a hearty belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, I never would have thought gnome tasted so good.\u201d said Maria as she placed a hand on her burgeoning belly, feeling the movement from her opponent inside. She then waddled over to the table covered in pastries and proceeded to indulge in her winnings, hunger still gripping her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed shut behind her, Maria let out one of largest and loudest belches she had ever heard from herself. She then fondled her overstuffed belly, which by now was quite huge. Amazingly, Maria had eaten almost all the pastries on the table along with half of the caramel chocolate cake, even with  a whole gnome inside her giant belly.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly waddled to her comfortable bed, taking care to sit down carefully on it, one hand holding her bloated belly and the other steadying her descent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh my god......I have never felt so full....uhhhh....\u201d  Maria grimaced as a groan came from her stomach,  followed by a couple of loud gurgles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.....sleepy.....\u201d whispered Maria as her eyes closed and she passed into her dreams, where blood rained and battle was constant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Lipomancer watched, a broad smile across his face. He had one the bet of course. He was never wrong with these types of things. He turned to look at Dorin, who had actually come in person this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA deals a deal. Give me the gold and the maidens, now.\u201d Dorin hesitantly handed over ten bags full of gold coins. \u201cThe maidens are being put into your holding cells at this very moment, Lipomancer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer laughed deeply, his head rising and falling. \u201cGood, good. I will see to it that they are properly cared for...\u201d said the Lipomancer. \u201cLeave me now, Dorin, and sulk in your failure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorin did as he was told, and shut the door as he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria...you are destined for greatness...I am sure of it.\u201d The lights in the tower darkened, and the Lipomancer went into a deep, dark sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, she slept even more soundly than the previous evenings, and when she awoke, she felt even more invigorated. So much <i>stronger</i> - nigh invincible, even! She sat straight up, striking her arms out towards the ceiling as she stretched, and readied herself for the day ahead, not even noticing the way her body jiggled and bounced more prominently with each sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did, however, notice the mirror - or more specifically, what was reflected upon its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't register at first; she actually thought it was a window. Perhaps she had awoken in a different room, entirely. Then she placed a chubby paw upon her sagging belly, bringing it up to swollen breasts that seemed to fill the cups of her bra, and then some. She realized with dawning shock that she was not the same vixen who had entered the Ample Amphitheater. Not even the same one from the day before, perhaps. Instead she was tubbier; obese; a PIG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, something else happened as she remembered how she'd gotten this way; the many challenges and trials that had earned her such fame and glory already. She wasn't fat, she was... <i>voluptuous</i>, sexy, incredibly appealing! She ran her paws over her generous curves; grabbed handfuls of her soft, overflowing belly; cupped her weighty rump. The thought that what she was feeling was disgusting <i>lard</i> began to slip from her mind, replaced with pride in her body; in her <i>achievements</i>. She didn't think about how she had seemingly put on almost thirty pounds these past... since last checking, instead marveling at how drop-dead <i>gorgeous</i> she must look. She was Mad Maria, after all! She could get any man or woman she desired! That is, if she didn't desire spilling their blood, and filling her maw, instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting aside her yearning for a good preen, now that these developments had come to light, she reminded herself that she had a duty to attend to. More than that, just thinking about getting out into that arena had her mouth watering. Gods, the scent of blood and battle was practically in her nostrils already...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, and wiping a stray strand of drool from her lips with the back of her hand, the chubby champ-in-the-making rose from the bed, and headed for the door. She had an audience waiting just for her; she could no more let them down than starve herself, especially now. She took a deep breath, pausing in the doorway, and then pressed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's eyes quickly scanned the seats of the amphitheater as they adjusted to the lighting changes, taking a hasty headcount before snapping down to size up her opposition. She had to blink a few times, and not just to adjust to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding across the arena was the single biggest creature she had laid eyes on since... Well, never mind. The curious haze when she cast her mind back made that unimportant. What was of the utmost importance now was the towering behemoth already helping itself (herself?) to the victor's feast. <i>Her</i> victor's feast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen feet tall, if she (it?) was an inch, the thing cramming an entire quiche into its gaping maw was covered in white fur, broken by black splotches. Its nose was flat and pink; its fingers shelled in some glossy, keratinous material. His(?) feet seemed protected by oddly-shaped, chitinous armour. Between bites, her teeth were seen to be broad and flat; good for grinding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most eye-catching, and perhaps breath-taking, thing about this behemoth was that he/it/she was wider, than tall! A circus tent would have fallen short of covering the blubber that bulged from every inch and foot of the spotted creature, an apron fit for Mealinie, God-Chef, to wear hanging down to obscure clues as to its gender, and its chest massively distorted, no help in identifying it, either. Its bulbous behind stuck out nearly as far as its stomach, serving as adequate counterweight to a swollen sack of lard that, alone, must have weighed twice as much as she did - at a VERY generous estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step forward, prepared to charge, Maria stopped short as her target, the beast's meaty legs, were suddenly obscured by something just over half its size - a figure recognizable as an average-sized, non-monstrous being! Another opponent! The... human female, red of hair, and robust of figure, seemed to have wrapped herself around the monster's leg, trying to pull it down. The beast didn't seem to notice - or <i>her</i>food was more important to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen snorted angrily, drew her sword (there was no way she could punch through those foot-thick layers of lard on its legs), and ran to intercept the fight. \"Stand back, you simpering sow! I'll show you how a <i>real</i> warrior handles such weaklings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that, you fleabitten fool!\" The woman tried to warn her, throwing out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria paid her no heed, and slashed at the creature's shin with her sword. A satisfying red line was carved through flesh and fat, and blood began to ooze from it, quickly coating the lower part of its shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite unable to perceive the moment between her attack, and this one, Maria found herself winded, on the floor, halfway across the arena. Her front side ached like she had fallen from a tree, but why? Teleporting magic wasn't supposed to do that, and anyway, who had cast the spell? Groaning, and rubbing her chest, she rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill tugging at the behemoth's leg, the human woman offered a sympathetic look. \"I tried to warn you. Hideously swollen with fat though it is, this thing is <i>fast</i>. Even <i>I</i> did not see it kick you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeething quietly through her teeth at this perceived jab at her own figure, Maria decided to open a discourse with the woman, before she opened her throat. \"Why warn me? Surely, it would be better to let it finish me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too proud to admit I need help tackling this monster,\" she replied, letting go of it for now. \"With our womanly wiles combined, we can surely figure out a way to fell the foul thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria glanced at the creature, unconcernedly grazing from the banquet table, today the length of the arena, and putting one hell of a dent in it. Every second she delayed, another dish was wrested from her grasp! \"Fine. If we both attack a leg at the same time, it cannot kick us both. If it does, it will fall, and we can seize the opportunity to strike a blow at its unprotected back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded, and drew her sword. \"On three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria took her position behind the creature, and readied her sword. \"One...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead readied her own for a slice. \"Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne big breath, in, and out. \"Three!\" They said as one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria plunged her sword into the back of the beast's knee like an oversized acupuncture needle, while the other woman slashed a deep, nasty cut into the back of its other leg, severing muscles with flesh and fat, though her sword was buried to the hilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth bellowed in pain, the first real acknowledgement of their presence, and its legs gave way. The women dodged out of the way as it came crashing down on its flabby rump, causing the earth to quake. It moaned loudly, voice deepened and distorted by the thick rings of fat around its neck. It raised a hand, and Maria braced herself to lash out, or dodge, but only extended it towards the food, far out of its reach, and surely obscured from its vision by its titanic tummy. Maria saw even this was easily bigger than her; she could have embraced its side with her entire body, and sink in so far, she'd lose sight of the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy of Pomina be on this poor creature!\" the redhead gasped softly, pushing her hand gingerly into its swollen side. Maria watched the rolls on her side wobble. \"Its mind is completely gone! Consumed by a desire - nay, a <i>lust!</i> - for food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, prodding around for a good spot in which to sink her sword, and silence the pathetic thing's mournful bellows, snarled \"Do you want us to kill this thing, or feed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human woman flushed, and she hesitated, before saying...</span></div></div>",

Neither of us - least of all you - need all, or perhaps <i>any</i> of the food on those tables,\" the redhead sniffed, somehow managing to look haughty while delivering this ridiculous (to Maria's ears) statement. \"What we have here is a unique opportunity. A convenient way to dispose of that bewitched food, and save our figures. You can still salvage yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria bit her lip so hard, blood began to bead beneath her fangs. Just as she was opening her mouth to inform the human just how much she was going to suffer before she let her die, a simple idea, blinding in its beauty, soothed her flaring temper like a salve on a rash. \"Yes. Yes, okay. You're right. I'm afraid that I, too, was... <i>maddened</i> by a lust for food, but your inspiring, thoughtful words have made me see the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! I knew you were a sensible, er, <i>woman</i>,\" the human chuckled, smiling proudly. \"I will stay here, and soothe the creature, while you go get it some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, Maria swore \"Fuck <i>you</i> if you think <i>I'm</i> doing all the godsdamned work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking the behemoth's broad belly as a mother might her child's, the redhead explained calmly \"I <i>will</i> assist, once it has seen we're only trying to help. Until then, I will try to keep it from lashing out at us again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, and grinding her teeth, Maria reminded herself of her plan, and wiped her sword clean before sheathing it, and shuffling towards the tables that spanned the length of the amphitheater. Choosing one at the farthest end, still loaded with food, she surveyed her choice of dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, she saw, was the dessert course. Three-tiered cakes as big as her head, frosting a finger thick. Bowls seemingly made of sugar glass, overflowing with various candies, all unwrapped. Doughnuts big enough to wear as bracelets, with glaze, sprinkles, jelly, custard, sugar, and frosting. Fist-sized cream puffs and bon-bons. Pies with diameters the length of her forearm, oozing fruit syrups. Cobblers that must have weighed five pounds apiece, bursting with tender fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe... Maybe she <i>didn't</i> need these...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria sadly swallowed her drool, backed up, and seized the two table legs the shortest distance apart. Putting her enhanced musculature to the test, she dug in her heels, and <i>pulled</i>. It was heavy as hell, nothing but dead weight, but the table began to scrape through the dirt floor of the amphitheater. She carefully backed up towards the beast, stopped just outside its range, and moved around to the other side of the table to push it. She was sure, in its blind fervor for food, the thing would callously knock her down, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner was the table within arm's reach of the tubby titan than did it grasp for nourishment, making a delighted sort of noise. A bowl, and its candy, were stuffed whole into its moist maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria resisted the urge to stab it in the hand, and made a wide berth around its front side as she went to pull a table up to the human, so she could help.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The human woman was currently crooning sweet nothings to the beast, massaging the side of its soft stomach. She appeared quite enamored of it, pressing herself ever further into the squishy surface. Even if the creature noticed or appreciated this, it obviously appreciated food more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria could hear the audience mumbling in dissent about the utter lack of action, and it shamed her to her core to be letting them down. She wanted to shout to them, to scream \"Wait! Do not leave! Do not think any less of me! Just have patience!\" but to do so would jeopardize, if not utterly torpedo, her plan. Instead, hoping they would see her, interpret her, and trust her, she looked up to them, offered up a broad grin and wink, and held a finger in front of her lips. She had a secret plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the voluptuous vixen dragged the second table, from the other end of the amphitheater, over to the human, the redhead said \"Perfect! And a good workout for you. Now, help me up, here, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria kept her mouth shut, knowing she could say nothing nice, and boosted the woman not onto the table, but up onto the behemoth's body. And people called <i>her</i> \"mad\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robust redhead found she couldn't stand, her legs sunk so far into the doughy creature, so she crawled towards its chest, commanding \"Bring the other tables over, and when you have them all, hand me the food from them. I will take it upon myself to feed this... Er, <i>foul</i> thing... Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's hands longed to cave in the bitch's skull for ordering her around like some boot-licking peon, but she only grumbled \"Whatever\", and set about doing just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the table the beast could have been said to be seated at, even if it now had no hope of reaching it, Maria pushed a few untouched dishes from its edges onto the tables next to it on her way down the line. There were three more tables on each side of the center table, all loaded with seemingly enough food to snap them in twain, though they somehow held sturdy. Either it was magic, she figured, or someone who really knew what they were doing had built them. And <i>that</i> raised all sorts of disturbing possibilities she had no desire to further explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard and hungry work; sometimes, nigh-impossible. Maria soon began to sweat, and her arms to ache, legs burning, and lungs heaving. It brought her back (very briefly, and in fragments) to her training days. Her stomach roared like the beast had when fell, but she could only reassure it vaguely that everything would soon be more than okay; it would be <i>rewarded</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the last table pushed into place, Maria got no respite from the human bitch, lounging very comfortably atop the cushioned chest of their fallen foe. \"About time! Now quickly, start handing things up here! Our baby's hungry; yes she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Maria's inner strength not to split the woman's skull for this remark as she hefted up a platter of hotdogs to her. Curiously, this platter looked tough, but edible, too. Like solid honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead shifted, and managed to get a hold of the platter, suggesting \"You ought to climb up onto the table. It'll be easier for me to reach. But don't stand in the middle; <i>you'd</i> only break it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, feeling again the cool calm that had come with her first notion of the plan, let the comment slide off of her, like water off a duck's beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide, my sweet little girl!\" The redhead cooed, presenting the platter of hotdogs to the beast. \"Dotty's gonna feed you! Yes she is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking blob rather eagerly opened its mouth, and rolled out its broad, flat tongue, more than ready to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked away from the spectacle, her rare spell of serenity only able to extend so far. When asked (or told), she presented \"Dotty\" with some new dish, not particularly caring what it was, so long as it would stop tempting her. Her stomach seemed eager to eat itself, now, unresponsive to her repeated pats, or attempts at mollifying it with words. \"Soon\" could not be soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an unknown, inscrutable, hellishly <i>boring</i> amount of time, the vixen could see no more dishes, edible or otherwise, in sight. The last one was the chocolate cake before her, and sure enough, Dotty was demanding that, too. Wishing bitterly she could do some magic to the cake, maybe to make it explode, or something, she settled for scrawling a very rude word in the frosting with her finger before handing it up. Contemplating her chocolate-smeared finger afterwards, she wiped it on the beast's side. It would have only sharpened her hunger pains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust a mangy bitch like you...\" Dotty tutted vaguely as she inspected the cake, trailing off with a small 'humph!'. Raising her voice, she lilted to the behemoth \"Oh, dearest! Dotty has one last very special treat for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big, pink tongue rolled out, and the redhead placed the cake on it with a mixture of regret and joy. Their relationship would have to end here, but she had brought a lot of happiness to this poor thing, and really quite enjoyed herself doing so! And let us not forget, she had saved her own figure, as well. How clever she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature drew its tongue back into its mouth, and perhaps even chewed the cake once or twice before swallowing it. It let out a deep, pleased sigh. Was it finally satiated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotty crawled onto its stomach, and to her evident surprise, found it rather more firm than she remembered. \"Oh my! Are you <i>full</i>, my sweet?\" As if scrubbing a floor, she began massaging the monstrous mammal's swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" she gasped, as if to herself. It was somehow so <i>tantalizing</i>, this action... This sensation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast seemed pleased, too, lowing, and grinning sloppily. What a day it must have been having!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly curious, Maria pushed her hand into the side of the behemoth's stomach. Squishy fat yielded to her touch, yes, but underneath, it became taut. This <i>thing</i> was stuffed with food, she realized; yet <i>she</i> was not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could begin to put her plan into action, the surface she was leaning against inexplicably grew <i>softer</i>. She lost her balance, and ended up with half her face smothered by the beast's blubber before she could push herself up. It was warm and fuzzy; no wonder the bitch was enjoying it up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's this?\" Dotty asked. She had noticed it, too, her hands sinking in another inch, and catching her off-guard. \"Did something shift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria watched, a sudden surge actually rippled the ample adipose of the abomination adjacent to her. Furry flesh spilled out over the nearest table by an inch. Was it trying to <i>move</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotty tried to push herself up, to balance on her knees, but she couldn't get enough force against the squishy surface. \"Um- Vixen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria backed away from the beast, watching it with a wary eye. She didn't like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother ripple, and a definite surge. Dotty toppled forward, head over heels, coming to rest on her back like an overturned turtle on the creature's stomach. She wriggled and writhed, but couldn't push herself up. \"Vixen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria turned her gaze to the front of the creature's great mass of stomach, and sure enough, with the next wave, it inched forward over the floor even more. Yet, the bulk of the beast didn't move an inch. It <i>was</i> getting fatter - right before their eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vixen!\" Dotty's voice was on the edge of panic, now. \"Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria turned to survey the redhead's situation. She was sinking slowly into the soft surface of the creature's stomach, further and further down. Fat was rising higher and higher around her, walling her in; trapping her. She was going to <i>drown</i> in it! Drown in fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vixen! Please! <i>please</i>! Help me!\" Dotty cried, struggling futilely. \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! If you help me now, I'll return the favor later! I give you my <i>word</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria considered this. It was always handy to have someone in your pocket. But all the same, watching the bitch get crushed by poetic justice and irony <i>would</i> be satisfyingly sweet...</span></div></div>",

Still, she had <i>bigger</i> plans for this bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing her legs, the voluptuous vixen sprang up onto the monstrous mass of adipose, and scrambled onto the top of its rapidly-softening stomach. Finding her footing was like being out at sea in a canoe, she struggled to stay upright, but it helped anchor her when she grabbed one of the redheaded human's hands with her own two, and pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sound not unlike a cork freed from a bottle, Dotty popped out of her imprisonment, and nearly toppled both of them. If they <i>had</i> gone down, Maria thought, that would have been their end. Instead, she shoved the woman off, none too gently, and then jumped from atop the beast onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotty regained her breath quickly, and backed far away from the creature, Maria tagging along rather more sedately. From this viewpoint, they could watch as the white-furred, black-spotted monster, ten feet tall, and already more than that wide, expanded further. Its titanic tummy grew rounder, pushing out further in front of it, and further upwards, consuming more of its field of vision. The behemoth's bulbous behind bloated, pushing it up even higher from the ground. Its tail, had it one, was nowhere to be seen, long since consumed by fat rolls. Its thighs somehow grew <i>more</i> thunderous, swelling like sausages. It was very odd to watch it also grow <i>towards</i> them as its hips widened, furry fat rolls soon pressing against the nearby tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most horrifying part (at least, to Maria) was when, after it had halted its growth, it again lowed pleasurably, and used its thick, heavy, relatively-stumpy arms to rub little what it could reach of its stomach. Was it even now hungry for <i>more</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, <i>Dotty</i>, you owe me one,\" the vixen sneered, turning towards the redhead. \"That's the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotty absently rubbed her chest as she looked down at Maria's outstretched hand, then up at her face. \"Oh... Yes. Of course. One favor. You want to shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria resisted the urge to roll her eyes, and only waited. \"Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal,\" Dotty confirmed, taking her hand with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smiled, too, as she gripped the woman's hand firmly. \"You act like you've never shaken hands before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not <i>usually</i>, no,\" she admitted. Her smile was growing strained. \"Erm, is it <i>supposed</i> to be this painful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's smile widened. \"It is when I'm trying to break the bones in your hand. It will be more so when I grind them together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDotty's face paled, freckles now even more contrasted. \"Wh-what? <i>What</i> did you-? Ow! You- You're hurting me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea!\" Maria agreed, smile reaching \"beaming\" status. \"They don't call me 'Mad' Maria for nothing, <i>toots</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this last word, she stuck her unoccupied hand into the redhead's gaping maw, and pulled down on her lower jaw. The woman tried to scream, but without her tongue to shape the sounds, it wasn't very effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe <i>crunch!</i> of Dotty's fingers breaking, and the <i>CRACK!</i> of her lower jaw dislocating, were simultaneous. Maria ground together the shattered finger bones until they splintered. Smile only now growing sinister, crazed, she seized Dotty's lower jaw, flapping loose beneath her face, with both her hands, brought her foot up to wedge between herself and the woman's chest, and shoved her away as she pulled backwards. With a wet tearing sound too gruesome to be here described, the bony structure, and much of its surrounding skin and musculature, tore loose from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming and gurgling, displaced tongue waggling obscenely in the air, blood spurting and flowing from her wounds, Dotty stumbled backwards, falling onto a table. Her hands clutched at the space where her jaw had once been; she was literally unable to grasp what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria made a show of inspecting the jaw, then held it up, for all the audience to see. \"I wonder,\" she said loudly, \"which one is the 'sweet tooth'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, cheers and whistles erupted from the stands. The familiar whoops and cries rang out, and someone started up the chant \"MAD MA-RI-A! MAD MA-RI-A! <i>MAD MA-RI-A!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria wrenched Dotty's left arm as she pulled her close, looking not at her, but out at her adoring audience. \"Stick around! We'll be taking a small <i>BREAK</i>-\" with this, the vixen snapped the redhead's radius \"-but I know, like Dotty, here, you've only got <i>eyes</i>-\" quick as the peck of a bird, Maria snatched one of the woman's out of her head \"-<i>FOR ME!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild(er), filling the amphitheater with a noise bigger than their size belied. Even the reanimated were getting into the spirit, chanting as best their mangled mouths could, and waving (sometimes detached) limbs in the air. Ogres and cyclopes had the boomingest voices, while those of the incubi and succubae made one want to cheer along with them. A few werewolves howled for her, clapping their large paws together thunderously, and stomping their feet. Slaves whistled and cheered, and rattled their chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria felt as though if she grinned any bigger, her head would split in half - not unlike Dotty's. She was a <i>big</i> hit! <i>This</i>, she remembered, was why she came out here, and fought for her meals. <i>This</i> was why she had never been happier. <i>This</i> was why she was here- here in this world. She was, and was always meant to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAD MA-RI-A! <i>MAD MA-RI-A!</i> MAD MA-RI-A!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right now, Mad Maria was mad <i>hungry</i>...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maria bent down, stomach squishing out over her leather greaves as she did, and drew the recently-deceased Dotty's sword from its scabbard. Holding it in her left hand, she drew her own, and strode back towards the hulking, immobilized creature in the center of the amphitheater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen feet tall, when it had been able to stand, the white-furred beast's black splotches had stretched as it had become wider than it was tall, something it had achieved before Maria had ever seen it. Even so, it had just recently put on several hundred pounds, judging by the fact it was noticeably fatter now, than before its feast. Even if it had been able to support its new weight on its tree-mendous thighs, and waddle away, with its titanic tummy touching the ground (though its bulbous behind surely acted as an effective counterweight), the fact Maria had tickled the back of its patella with her sword, and Dotty had severed some tendons had permanently crippled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it didn't appear too bothered; in fact, it had greeted its feasting, and even expansion, with the utmost delight. At the moment, it seemed to be snoozing, head nestled into the layers of fat beneath it. It had kicked her once, with startling speed, but it could hardly be a threat now... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria circled around, approaching it from behind. It could hardly turn its head at all, and its eyes were closed. But she padded softly, and the audience fell quiet, too. She switched her grip on the swords, holding them like oversized daggers, as she came around behind the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching slightly, she eyed the angles, plotted her trajectory, licked her lips, and <i>sprung</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen landed on the behemoth's blubbery bum, a shifting, squishy mass that sucked at her feet like mud. Before she could fall, she plunged her swords into the creature's back, and held on tight. They worked, in essence, like the ice daggers the hardy northern races used to climb glaciers, whatever their reasons. When she gave them a little twist, they held even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast wriggled and moaned at this, pained, but could not shake itself with enough force to dislodge her. It had started out such a nice day, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria withdrew the sword in her right hand, and then plunged it back into the creature at a higher level than before. Giving it a twist to secure it, she pulled herself up with it, while drawing out the sword in her left hand, and then plunged that back in, higher than the other one. She repeated this process until she was straddling the behemoth's shoulders, though the thick layers of fat around its neck made it nigh-impossible for her to get her legs around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure that she was not going to fall off (or at least that her landing would be cushioned if she did), Maria steadied herself, brought her swords into roughly the correct position, and stabbed them deep into the monster's fat-swaddled neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rewarded immediately with a wet bellow, which might have been high-pitched, if not for the extra ton, or so, the creature appeared to be carrying. Blood gushed from its mouth and wounds, and the vixen knew she had hit at least one vital artery. It thrashed feebly, but it was so weak, and so burdened, it only managed to jiggle itself slightly. Its breaths became shallow and labored, wheezed from its chest, and then ceased completely. It closed its eyes, and slouched there where it was, propped up by its own morbid obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria hardly felt this was impressive; a toddler with knives strapped to his eyes could have slain the stupid thing. What was going to set her apart was not even the fact she was cutting off its head right at this moment. No, they called her \"Mad Maria\" for a reason, and she rather suspected it was because she dared to think different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the behemoth's head sawed off at its shoulders, the bloody hole gaping at the ceiling, Maria reached in, and seized its trachea, reeling in its lungs, and tossing them aside. With that done, she poked her snout into the hole, and began to nibble at the meats inside. The taste was somehow familiar, but indisputably pleasing. She grinned, and ate away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to lean further and further forward as she ate deeper into the creature's corpse, though she really had only just a little bit of actual \"meat\", due to where she was nibbling. Seeing a bite just out of reach of her jaws, she stretched and strained, but still fell short. Lunging forward, she felt her teeth close around it... and her precarious balance give way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid, head-first, down into the behemoth's chest cavity, its ribcage trapping her in front, and its spine parallel with her own behind her. She had displaced its guts towards its pelvis, face mashed up against them. All around her was the beast's padding, making things quite warm. Fortunately, she could still breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little other choice, yet somehow pleased with this turn of events, Maria began to eat. The flavors of exotic organ meats filled her mouth, and traveled easily down to her stomach, roaring louder than before to be fed. She tried to comply, wriggling her arms free enough to be able to push herself up on them, and tilt her head forward to nibble at whatever was obstructing her way. It was <i>fantastic</i>, whatever it was, coating her mouth with a rich flavor she couldn't get enough of. But it, too, was strangely reminiscent of something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven upside-down, her stomach was able to begin to fill on the delicious innards of the creature, hunger gradually growing satiated, but appetite calling out for more. Eventually, eating away at the same spot revealed the light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. A speck of whatever lit the amphitheater shone through into her dark prison, initially causing some pain, as she'd been in the dark so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her eyes adjusted, however, she raised a hand, and clawed the hole wider, peeling back layers of fur and fat, blinking as the light flooded her vision. Sweet, fresh oxygen came to her in big gasps, making her a little light-headed, and initially unable to understand the noise coming from all sides. She squirmed out, inch by inch, and shakily stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAD MA-RI-A! MAD MA-RI-A! <i>MAD MA-RI-A!</i>\" Though some seats were now empty, many had stayed to await their hero's triumphant return. Some had feared, secretly, that it was the ignominious end of her; she'd simply suffocated after a klutzy accident. But now they told themselves (and others within earshot) they'd known all along she'd done it on purpose. That was their Mad Maria!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria accepted the praise without quarrel, pumping her fists in the air, and striking threatening poses. But what she really wanted was to get back to eating, and so after a minute of soaking up her (surely well-deserved) glory, she turned back to the behemoth's body.</span></div></div>",

But what she really wanted was to get back to eating, and so after a minute of soaking up her (surely well-deserved) glory, she turned back to the behemoth's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed she'd managed to eat her way out through an area with relatively little fat beneath the ribs. If she <i>had</i> been eating straight through the thickest part of the thing, she'd have still been in there. The thought alone had her licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocating her sword, she made an incision down the middle of the behemoth's chest. Then, pulling on its rib bones, one-by-one, she opened up the creature, exposing the cavity where organs had once been suspended. Its adipose-abundant abdomen still rested on its tree trunk-like thighs, arms resting limply on its swollen sides. It reminded her, absurdly, of a jack-o-lantern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria patted her soft stomach as it growled, and returned to the belly of the beast. Climbing into its chest cavity, now roomy enough for her to sit in, she got down on her hands and knees to gnaw at the thickest, fattiest part of the titan's tummy, intending to eat a tunnel right through. Delicious fat (for some reason, she was reminded of pork) squished between her teeth, moist, intense flavors flooding her very <i>being</i>, it seemed. She began to tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first challenge, after clearing a space big enough for her head to get through, was making it big enough for her shoulders, she discovered. Fortunately, hers were fairly narrow. She squeezed them through. Tunneling was a matter of tearing the fat off first one side, then the other, sometimes rolling over to gnaw on the ceiling. This amused her most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second challenge came when she tried to squeeze in past her bosom, itself constricted. She was, apparently, taking up more space than she thought. She backed up, and widened the tunnel all around, drooling enough to keep her thirst quite slaked. Pressing forward, her breasts came through easily, and then, save her rear and tail, she was completely inside the darkened tunnel, all light from behind her blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate a wide swatch out from her right. She turned, and gnawed an equally-wide swatch on her left. Facing down, she cleaned out the bottom of the tunnel. Rolling onto her back, feeling quite pleased, she carved out the top of the tunnel. Belching tremendously, the \"caverns\" around her seemed to shake, and she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen also found, as she went along, that she was apparently making the tunnel on the sides than on the top and bottom. She began to feel her belly drag along the ground, and when she lifted her butt, it bumped the ceiling. When this happened, she'd go back until her bosom was about where her bum had been, and widen the tunnel's top and bottom dimensions. This kept happening, but she wasn't too distressed; she was otherwise doing very well, for navigating in the dark, and not being a mole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll good things must come to an end, and Maria came to see the light. Disappointing, as it signaled an end to her fun, but her fans were waiting on the other side! Though the hole was about the size of her fist, she decided to see if she could force her way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead first, the vixen poked one ear out through the hole; then some orange fur. It began to tear like a ream of wet construction paper, requiring some effort, but yielding to her advance. Using her hands, she tore it open wide enough to get her shoulders out. Her breasts popped out next, bouncing from their inertia. Trying to use her arms to push herself out didn't work so well, so she tried steadying herself while standing up from the tunnel. This worked until her belly became wedged in the hole, simply too yielding to make itself room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging and waving, Maria wormed her way back inside. What a <i>shame</i> - she was going to have to eat more of this stuff! Growing a little weary of the spectacle, she decided to widen end of the tunnel more than \"just enough\" to squeeze through. She tried to eat in a circular pattern, following the edges of the tunnel like a pair of scissors cutting through a dotted line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs tends to happen, though, the circle became more like a spiral, just missing connecting. And she was rather disoriented, with no landmarks, and all the tunnel looked the same. She just wasn't sure when to stop. And really, when was she going to get a chance like this again? She'd better eat all she could of it while it was available. Even IF that meant a little more than was, perhaps, advisable. You only lived once, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So it was that Maria kept going around and around, following the tunnel backwards, and widening it all around. Soon, she forgot quite what the hell she had been aiming to do in the first place; this stuff was <i>heavenly</i>! It was a good thing that bitch Dotty wasn't around to spoil her fun. Boy, she'd showed her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled onto her back to nibble at the \"ceiling\" of the tunnel she'd eaten through the deceased behemoth's stomach like a <i>very</i> hungry, and more than a little twisted, caterpillar, almost acknowledging, for a moment, the orange-and-white dome that obscured the lower part of her field of vision. Her brain glanced right over it, however, pleasantly overdosing on flavor divine. Her <i>breasts</i> looked good, though, it allowed; all showing a naughty little bit of cleavage in her hardened leather top like that. Rowr!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, there was no more to eat. Maria blinked, and looked around; she was back in the chest cavity. She could climb out from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut \"Fucking a...\" she moaned pleasantly, stretching. Her rump wiggled in the air, her tail wagged, and her belly bumped the ground before her breasts did. \"I <i>am</i> a little tired, after that. I should just fucking sit here, and rest, a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of quite <i>sitting</i>, she just plumped down where she was; it was comfortable enough, she found. The floor was quite well-padded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis position grew tiring, after about thirty seconds, so the voluptuous vixen closed her eyes, and rolled onto her back, arms crooked at the elbow on either side of her chest, and hands bent at the wrist. Her knees were pulled up towards her chest, so her feet were off the ground. Always delighted by this, she squirmed and wiggled happily for a full minute, giggling to herself like a kit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin reach was plenty more of the sweetmeat she had most come to enjoy, so, idly, she began to tear off chunks, and chew them around, and swallow them down, savoring their flavour and consistency. She felt... <i>comfortably full</i>, yes, but one <i>was</i> allowed to indulge, on occasion. Certainly, on <i>special</i> occasions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no more was at hand, she scooted and wiggled until she found some, then continued lazily stuffing her face, and daydreaming of the ceremony whence they would crown her \"Grand Champion\". The Ample Amphitheater would be her domain! They would cheer her name across the land! Bards would sing her praises for ages to come!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, not content to rest on her laurels, she would be back in that arena every... Oh, week or two, proving Mad Maria still deserved her crown. Why, they might need a bigger stadium for all her fans!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, and putting dents in the \"walls\" that could well have made more-than-adequate entrances to two new tunnels, Maria (with some difficulty) rolled up onto her butt, remembering well now her \"magic bed\". A nice nap would do her wonders! <i>Especially</i> after this day's monster mash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her legs folded in the butterfly position, and her expression one of feeling perfect harmony, Maria could have passed some strange interpretation of Buddha just then. Her leather armor had loosened up at some point, as evidenced by the fact it had ridden up to cover just her breasts, and wasn't squashing her flat. Her orange- and white-furred belly was bloated enormously out in front of her, her lap cradling it as a wok cradles a basketball. She was far more engorged than ever before, the malleable fat compacting itself in her stomach, with so much company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the vixen dropped to her hands and knees, looking around for the proper tunnel. Yawning widely, belly dragging on the ground (and making her crawl a ponderous waddle), the vixen prepared to slip out for her grand exit.</span></div></div>",

It is the <i>shit</i>. Gonna be so totally godsdamn <i>bitchrod</i> when I wake up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey went well, if ponderously, for approximately two feet. Progress halted when, after clearing the entrance to the tunnel, Maria's bloated belly became wedged against the sides and bottom of the tunnel, and her butt, held up in the air by necessity at this point, could slide no further along the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fucking c'mon, man, what the fuck?\" She groaned, trying, but unable, to press forward. \"What, are these fucking tunnels <i>collapsing</i>, or some shit? Fuck, I bet that's it. What kind of shitty, fuck, I don't know, <i>foreman</i> built this shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed out, answering her own question with a scowl. \"A <i>stupid</i> shitty one; that's who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another groan, Maria realized she was actually almost <i>dreading</i> having to eat her way out. It still <i>tasted</i> really good, and she wasn't <i>exactly</i> tired of it... But she felt like it was, perhaps, time to move on to something new. And that couldn't happen until she had some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not about to sleep in this shitty collapsing carcass!\" she vowed, to no one in particular. \"Let's do this shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny real animosity towards this course of action vanished with the first mouthful of springy, juicy fat. It really was still so <i>good</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the final time, the vixen ate her way out of the situation, being rather generous in how much she bit off each time, just in case it decided to be a wise-ass, and shrink again. But even when the tunnel was big enough for her voluminous mass to fit through, she was having trouble just <i>moving</i> through. She grumpily attributed this to her growing tiredness inhibiting her cognitive and locomotive abilities. If she could just get to her \"fucking magic <i>bed</i>\", she was sure, she would be better than fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, her locomotive issues could be attributed to her engorged, ever-expanding belly. It was swelling to such proportions that she could only have one knee touching the ground at a time, the other forced up and out by the swell of her stomach. The ground was at least slick enough for it to slide across without much trouble, though she was getting tired of having her bum rammed against the ceiling all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end was drawing near, however. It was just over an arm's-length away, in fact. Too far for her to pull herself out just yet, but a foot more, and she'd have it!

But as she went to move, she noticed something odd.  Quite odd, in fact.  Though she had slept in the bed she believed to be magical, it appeared to her that she was having much more difficulty getting out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\", she asked.  \"Why do I not have the strength of an army, with all the food I consumed?\".  Maria was so busy trying to figure out her dilemma that she barely noticed an announcement for her to be ready and in the arena in 10 minutes.  Deciding she had better figure it out fast, she set to work in an attempt to understand her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, when I first arrived I ate food from numerous events and slept in this bed, I would not only gain weight, but the strength to keep moving as if I had only procured a few pounds.  Then with yesterday's event, I only consumed meat, fat, and other portions of that strange creature.  Huh, well it seems to me that...\", and then a lightbulb went off in the vixen's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only the food that makes you gain equal strength, but since I ate from the monster, I gained weight without the added bonus!\".  Having it only taken a few minutes for the fox to realize how it all worked out, she decided to get a look at herself and make any adjustments to her armor so that she would be able to comfortably and efficiently complete the day's challenge.  Walking over to the mirror in her chambers, Maria noticed that devouring pieces of that beast had added quite a few pounds to her frame.  Firstly, her stomach, although being smaller than when it was prior to her slumber, was still girthier than it had been before she gorged herself on the beast's bounties.  Her bust had also grown slightly, her arms had gotten slightly thicker and a tiny bit heavier, as did her already thick thighs and calves.  Lastly, her large posterior had gotten even bigger, wobbling more with each step and causing her to gather more momentum when she would break out in a run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't seem too severe, but I'll definitely have to avoid consuming anything other than food specifically put out on tables.\", spoke the fox.  Finally getting around to struggling into her armor, it took her the last few minutes she had before going out to face the next event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria arrived at the gate leading to the arena, and was waiting for the announcement that, any second now, would be calling her in to provide some more gore-filled, gut-filling entertainment to the spectators.  \"I just have to remember to avoid everything other than the food on the tables.\", Maria whispered to herself, in an attempt to make sure she would not forget such an important detail any time soon.  As she heard an amplified voice begin the event, the door began to slide apart, revealing the bright lights within the colosseum.  As her eyes readjusted from the dark lighting within the entrance tunnel, she stepped into the arena to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She even rubbed her round, white-furred belly and licked her lips, just for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</i>\" Bella squealed.  She began thrashing once more, this time to escape; of course, this effort was also fruitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria chuckled, and hopped down off of the blubbery swine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure I finish every last bit this time...\" she ran a claw against the porker's well-padded belly, raking the soft flesh and leaving marks.  Bella winced.  \"I don't think I'll bother killing my prey, this time...  Let's see what 'live meat' tastes like...\"  Maria's descent into \"the dark side\" was complete.  She even punctuated it with a cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about this time, Maria's eyes had fully adjusted to the dim light of the room.  She wasn't in a dungeon, or a cell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a kitchen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were numerous counters, each topped with dough-covered rolling pins, oily cutting boards with bits of onion and potato clinging to them, mixing bowls, suspiciously-clean butcher knives, or water basins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were five vault doors; one was open, though.  In that open vault were shelves upon shelves of foodstuffs: Mountains of potatoes, walls of flour sacks, stacks of raw steaks, innumerable casks of what was presumably alcohol of some sort.  The voracious vixen could only assume that the other \"vaults\" held roughly the same things.  They weren't vaults, but massive larders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were dozens upon dozens of ovens, lined up against a wall; enough to accommodate a thousand turkeys.  Of special note were a couple of overly-large ovens, each of which looked capable of housing three elephants, side by side...  Or one <i>enormous</i> pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was right by Maria?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria confirmed her suspicions when she glanced to the side of Bella and saw a massive roasting pan and a veritable vat of stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems somebody else was already planning on eating you...\" Maria mused.  She gave the pan a light kick.  \"And a feast, they would have had, indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella continued to squeal, louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, pig,\" Maria ordered.  When the pig did <i>not</i> silence itself, Maria grabbed a large unpeeled onion, about the size of Bella's head, and jammed it in the porker's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was in the middle of the biggest kitchen she'd ever seen, with the biggest meal she'd ever have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell.  I've got the tools right here...  Why not cook you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella closed her eyes tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Live, of course.\"  The vixen jabbed the sow right in the middle of her doughy gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But!

Maria's maw stretched open and clamped down onto the jiggling flesh, her sharp teeth drawing crimson blood. A panicked squeal came from Bella's plugged mouth as she tried her best to get up and run, but her weight was just too great. Maria tore the first chunk of meat away from the massive pig, blood dripping down her chin as she chewed up the delicious morsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, *Gulp*, are <i>very</i> tasty Bella. The fat, the blood, oh it's <i>all</i> so good!\" gasped Maria. She stared at the now crying Bella with vigor, her tongue sliding over her blood-stained teeth. \"Well, enough talk. I have a meal to finish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria sauntered back to Bella's bloody backside, and proceeded to tear another chunk off with her teeth, which was quickly followed by another, and another, and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella had started to slow her struggling, her breaths coming out ragged and short. Her body was obviously not taking the blood loss well, and her vision was getting blurry. Maria had stripped a good portion of Bella's once fatty ass away to put inside her now slightly bloated belly. Maria stood up, cracked her neck, and let loose a pungent burp right into Bella's face. She giggled as she saw the pig's face shrivel up in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How ya feeling, missy? You look a bit woozy. I must say though, you are the best pig I've ever tasted. Even your sister can't compare...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria said this, Bella squealed in anger, tears falling from her puffy eyes. Maria just huffed and rolled Bella over onto her back, the obese pig squealing in pain from her bloody backside touching the ground. Maria growled at Bella, \"Shut up! I would like that my meal be quiet, alright blubbergut?\" Maria slapped her bloody palm on top of Bella's massive belly, the shock wave jiggling the pigs body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Maria took a huge chomp out of Bella's gut, relishing the taste of the warm blubber. Much like with Bella's sister, Maria tried the tactic of sticking her maw into the entry she made and started lapping up the succulent fat. Bella's screams were becoming quieter and quieter. Light-headed and hemorrhaging, Bella knew in her mind that she wasn't going to last much longer....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          <div align=\"center\">* * * *</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria didn't notice when Bella's heart stopped. Her blood lust had blinded her to everything around her. There was only the hunger she had, and the meal in front of her. Nothing else registered in her mind. Maria stretched the hole in Bella's belly wider, and was now digging the fat out in hand-fulls. Her belly, now fully round and bloated, had expanded so much in the time that it had forced her leather armor open, revealing her gravid form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore time passed, and Maria had finally had her fill of the massive swine. She attempted to stand herself up, but her engorged belly had forced Maria back down to the stone floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm....so...full. Must....sleep.\" mumbled Maria, her eyes glazed with fatigue. She moved her hands over her belly, covered in fat and blood. The rhythmic motions soon relaxed the gurgles and groans coming from her furry stomach, and she grunted as she settled herself on the floor. With one hand on her belly and one cradling the back of her head, Maria passed into a deep, bloody sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next she grabs a hold of a nearby bottle of wine and pops the cork free with her teeth, spitting it across the room and beginning to glug the whole thing down, giving a loud burp afterwards before moving onto a fat honey-basted ham like those from the stall outside. It all tasted so good, even as her gut began to expand into her lap, she thought about nothing but that taste... it was understandable how all of the townspeople got so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the fox girl was ravenously stuffing down everything in front of her with her hands, covering her face with food and saliva as she barely paid attention to anything but that. The other fox just sat at the other end of the table, staring at her and smirking. She began to feel a bit larger, filling out her clothes as she once had and then continuing to fill! Her ass feels as though its becoming rounder and plumper, filling out the large cushioned seat even more... her gut stretching her bodice and her bosoms becoming plumper and fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she's finished ten or so plates worth of fatty meat, the vulpine looks to the other fox at the end of the table...</span></div></div>",

By this point, more of her butt is hanging off the chair than on, and her dress is nothing more than tatters... underwear struggling to hang in there. Several others at the bar grab chairs and begin to place them under her. Even with three chairs it doesnt' seem to do enough to hold her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looks across from her, the table has now been removed due to restricting the size of their hanging guts... the rat girl seems to be in a similar state to her.

Then, Roul stood back up to face her and said, \"Now then, Mademoiselle Maria; Shall we proceed to enter the ch\u00e2teau that I call home?\" Even though she wasn't exactly acquainted with Roul's native language, Maria could somewhat understand that he wants her to enter his home  with him. \"Well, I guess there's no turning back now.\" Maria thought to herself, as she took Roul's chubby hand and followed him inside, as the two fat regal foxes approached the doors to Roul's mansion. <br>\r\nHowever, once they approached the large double doors, Maria quickly noticed the doors opening up by themselves, as she saw two fat female raccoon maids opening both doors individually, almost as if they were there to greet their master.

(Welcome home, Master Roul!)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Maria had just heard, she could easily tell that the two fat raccoon maids were definitely speaking Roul's native tongue, since she was completely clueless as to what they just said, raising an eyebrow in confusion. Though in Roul's case, he was easily able to understand what they said, so he spoke back to the rotund raccoon maids and replied, \"Pourquoi vous remercier , Aim\u00e9e et Aveline .

How were my sister and the others faring while I was away?)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I know what these maids' names are.\" Maria thought to herself, despite clearly having no clue as to what Roul, Aim\u00e9e, and Aveline were talking about. However, it wasn't until one of the two fat raccoon maids took notice of you alongside their beloved master, causing her stand back up from her bowing position, then spoke to Roul and asked, \"Je ne veux pas soulever , Ma\u00eetre Roul , mais qui est-elle ? Est-elle I'un des habitants de la ville ? (I do not mean to pry, Master Roul, but who is she? Is she one of the town's residents?)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having no clue on what she was saying, Maria could only guess that one of the large raccoon maids was talking about her, judging from how the maid was looking her way. \"Oh , mes plus sinc\u00e8res excuses , mesdames. S'il vous pla\u00eet permettez-moi de vous pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la fois Mme Maria . Elle est mon invit\u00e9 et VA rester ici aussi longtemps qu'elle le souhaite .

Unfortunately, I am afraid she does not understand or speak our country's language, so you will have to speak in the commoners' tongue so she will be able to understand better.)\" Roul answered, explaining to the two fat maids who their master brought home with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Roul gave his explanation to them, both Aim\u00e9e and Aveline had this \"Oh, that explains it\" expression on their plump faces, where they then turned their heads to look at one another, nodding yes once, and turned to face Maria, bowing like they did with Roul. From there, they spoke toward Maria using the commoners language and  Aveline said, \"Our apologies, Lady Maria. We were unaware that you do not speak our country's native tongue. I am Aveline, and this is my cousin Aim\u00e9e.\" \"If there is anything you need, please let us know, and we'll be able to provide you some assistance, Lady Maria.\" Aim\u00e9e answered, speaking shortly after her equally large cousin was done talking. From there, both maids left Maria and Roul, as they both gathered Maria's things and carried them inside, where Roul lead the plumped-up Maria toward one of the large guest suites on the 3rd floor, right next-door to his master bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough on the way there......</span></div></div>",

What exactly did you say to those two anyway?\" Maria asked, trying her best to start up a conversation with the fat regal fox to pass the time. After all, the giant mansion that he calls home was shockingly huge! So it was basically going to take a while before they reach the guest room on the 3rd floor. Fortunately for Maria, Roul spoke back to her and replied, \"Do you mean Aim\u00e9e and Aveline, ma ch\u00e9rie? Well, I was asking them how my sister and the other members of Ch\u00e2teau Couture were simply faring while I was away on business, that's all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sort of news came as somewhat of a surprise to Maria. Besides, she didn't know that Roul had a sister. So in response, looked back at the plump chivalrous fox and said, \"Really? I wasn't aware that you actually had a sister.\" \"Yes, indeed I have a sister, mademoiselle Maria. Though to be more precise, C\u00e9line is merely my younger sister.\" Roul answered, as the two fat raccoon maids split away from their beloved master and his guest, heading toward a large but lavishly decorated elevator, while the two fat foxes approached the spacious flight of stairs that led to the mansion's upper floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um......I don't mean to offend you or your sister, Roul, but.......how old is your sister?\" Maria asked, obviously feeling a little flustered, just as she thought to herself and said, \"Wait a  sec, why am I even stuttering? Come on, Maria; What the hell is wrong with you? Why are you even liking this guy, anyway?\" Although her conscience was bickering at her for beginning to develop a feeling or two toward the tubby regal fox, Maria's ears were still listening to what Roul had to say, as the two fat foxes climbed up the stairs, while Roul continued speaking to Maria and answered, \"Well you're certainly a curious vixen, Maria. Though if you want to know so desperately, ma ch\u00e9rie; I am currently at the age of 23 years, while my sister C\u00e9line is merely 4 years younger than yours truly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing bit of math from what he told her, Maria found out how old Roul's sister and said, \"So, she's 19 years old.\"  Roul turned his head to look at  Maria and nodded at her in response, as the fat fox continued speaking and replied, \"Although she is actually 19 years of age, C\u00e9line happens to look only a year younger than her actual age. However, while I happen to be in charge of our family's business in the nearby town, it is my beloved sister's handiwork in creating all of those regal and elegant dresses you have seen back in my restaurant. That gown you are currently wearing? It is just merely one of the many dresses she has designed and created, ma ch\u00e9rie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were halfway up the large flight of stairs, Maria shifted gears a little on the conversation topic. After all, Maria started to become more curious about where Roul, his sister, and the mansion's residents originated from. Still, her curiosity the best of her somewhat, as she then spoke toward Roul and asked, \"So.....where did you and the other people in your \"Ch\u00e2teau\" came from, exactly? I mean, I haven't heard anybody speaking like what you said to those two maids until today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously being aware of the plumped-up Maria's growing curiosity, Roul decided to give an explanation to his vulpine guest and answered, \"Well then; If it is knowledge that you seek, then I will be willing to provide you with an answer or two, ma ch\u00e9rie Maria. You see, C\u00e9line and I, along with the others who came here to live here, have traveled quite a rather long distance from La Principaut\u00e9 de Rois. In the commoners' tongue, it stands for \"The Principality of Monarchs\" when one translates the language of my native country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to get you mad or anything like that, but why do I get a weird feeling that your country is filled with a lot more nobles and people like that?\" Maria asked, cocking an eyebrow out of questioning Roul about his native homeland. Fortunately, he knew what she was talking about, as the tubby fox spoke to her and replied, \"I can understand your suspicions, Maria. However, you happen to be correct on one matter; my country is mostly filled with the rich upper-class and middle-class, due to my homeland's excessive overabundance of wealth. In a way, you could say that The Principality of Monarchs is one of the wealthiest nations on the continent, probably one of the wealthiest in the world if it ever devolves into such an expensive but trivial matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom listening to what he had to say, Maria could understand that Roul and company were definitely not from around here,  but it was good to know that he was being honest as to where he and his sibling originated. Then, Maria, doing her best to avoid asking Roul how rich was he, spoke toward the tubby chivalrous fox and said, \"I'm guessing you had a hand in crafting the town I met you in earlier into a bustling city, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* It is true, mademoiselle; I guess you could say that it was mostly my doing in crafting the small town of Sulvale into the bustling and still-growing metropolis it is today and will eventually become. After all, my family happens to be one of the wealthiest Monarch Houses in my homeland. The others being House Chevalier, House L\u00e9vesque, House Marchand, and House Villeneuve.\" Roul answered, letting out a sigh of feeling frustrated by merely a slight margin. Not enough to be very angry, but just enough to feel annoyed that his family and their extremely overabundant wealth got involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough once the two pudgy foxes finally reached the 3rd floor, the conversation between the two still continued, as Maria noticed a bit of the subtle annoyance on Roul's slightly plump snout and said, \"It sounds like you seem upset about your family helping out in expanding Sulvale.\" \"*sigh* Although I am glad for my family to send some assistance in expanding Sulvale and it's economy, ma ch\u00e9rie. Believe me, I am. It's just that.....it's been like this for me and my sister our whole lives; Our parents and family members spoiling us like we're still kits. Even though C\u00e9line manages to tolerate the excessive amount of attention thrown in our direction, I just-\" Roul answered, just as Maria understood what he was trying to say, causing her to interrupt him and replied, \"It's okay, I understand. You just wanted to prove your family you could handle yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after making their way up the flight of stairs and down a long spacious hallway, Maria and Roul arrived at the assigned guest room, just  as they entered the lavishly large room, noticing that Aim\u00e9e and Aveline were sorting through Maria's stuff, unpacking, and storing the clothes, since the two rotund raccoon maids arrived before the two fat foxes did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Maria saw before her eyes was a room meant for a girl who was super rich. It had a massive King-size bed, lined with plush silk bedsheets and large pillows as soft as clouds. Other than the heavenly soft bed, the carpet was an orange hue and blissfully plush, as a full-body mirror was propped up on the wall, and a few other fancy and elegant furniture found inside the vast and lavishly decorated room, along with a very large and spacious closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after Aim\u00e9e and Aveline finished unpacking and storing Maria's personal items in the drawers of the cabinets.......</span></div></div>",

Seeing nothing else to do but sleep, she waddled over to the tall, ornate wardrobe to see if there was any sleepwear. To her satisfaction, she found a large nightgown made of sleek white velvet, and a matching nightcap she found a bit silly. She set the nightcap on a nearby end table, and when trying on the large gown, she was only mildly surprised to find it fit her large form properly. She waddled to the mirror to glance at herself, and saw a very heavyset vixen, as large as Roul was, with a very luxurious nightgown on. She gripped her sagging belly absentmindedly and was surprised at its softness! The meal had definitely digested by now, albeit faster than the normal dish. Lobo was to blame, she knew well, but another thought popped into her mind - living a life of pampered luxury with Roul. <i>B-but... I'm a warrior, an adventurer! I can't just settle down and be with Roul...</i> she pondered, her mind constantly going back to Roul's largeness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt weirded her out, but the more she thought about it, the more the idea of being the lady of Roul's life seemed more and more appealing. It was certainly easier than being an adventurer, scrapping for food and coin and always in harms way. Living here, as a noblegirl in this town, being fed grapes, living a life of luxury, and cuddling with Roul's plump... she stopped herself before she thought any more on it, scrunching her face in disdain. It was too late in the night to make a decision, she would think about it in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling over to the bed, she slowly heaved herself under the covers and slept peacefully, the soft covers cradling her bosom and belly very gently. <br>\r\nThe next morning, she awakened to the sound of birds and Aim\u00e9e and Aveline over in the next room, tending to Roul's needs. They'd be here any minute, what was her decision?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, she never expected Roul to ask such a question so sudden, and this was a lot to take in, since she only met the rotund vulpine merely a day ago. Becoming somewhat confused, Roul carefully sat down beside the plump Maria, looking at her with a sense of concern, and asked, \"....Maria?

Besides, marriage was a life-changing event that is a serious commitment to endure. Although he was slightly disappointed by this, Roul also understood that he simply rushed things, which he considered as something callous for someone of his stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, his lips curved into a caring smile, his voice both understanding and apologetic as he replied, \"My apologies, my dear.

The first she noticed was that her belly softer now, along with the rest of her body. Although she could not see it, but her chin was a little more chubby than previously, beginning it's subtle progression into a fat double chin on her neck. However, as she then stood up from the chair, Maria noticed that she had a little more heft in her physique. More specifically, in her breasts, belly, hips, waist, butt, and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, how much did I actually eat anyway?\" Maria though to herself, putting one plump paw-like hand on her plumper abdomen, feeling just how soft it had become from digesting all of that food during breakfast. However, she couldn't help but feel a curious about her new weight, but also a little excited as well, not sure why she had such excitement toward something awkward as feeling herself getting fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of where he went, Maria left the Dining Room to comfort Roul, despite how vast his manor was.

After all, she was inexperienced as to the overall layout of Roul's home, so she was unsure as to whether there was a hidden room he had built into the manor's construction, or simply in a different room right in plain sight this whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she looked around the main lobby near the grand staircase for any signs of Roul's passing, Maria then noticed a nearby door opening outwards, where the two rotund raccoon maidens, Aim\u00e9e and Aveline, exited out of the wide doorway, cleaning utensils in hand, tending to the well keep of their master's humble abode. \"Maybe they might know where Roul is....\" Maria thought, having a hopeful smirk on her slightly plump snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Maria approached the two corpulent maids, noticing that she now has a swaying in her waist and hips with each waddling step. Then, as she drew closer toward Aim\u00e9e and Aveline, Maria gathered their attention and asked, \"I apologize if I'm interrupting you two, but do you know where Roul is? I am having a rather difficult time finding him.\" Obviously eager to aid their master's guest and potential wife, Aim\u00e9e spoke up first and replied, \"Oh, it's rather simple, Mademoiselle Maria, Ma\u00eetre Roul is.....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"....currently in the Ballroom as we speak. I believe he wants to share a dance with you, mademoiselle.\" Aim\u00e9e explained, giving Maria a sense of relief, as she then replied, \"Oh thank goodness.....Wait a minute, this manor has a Ballroom?\" Obviously giggling at their master's guest at the way she reacted, , Aveline then spoke toward Maria and answered, \"Why yes, Mademoiselle Maria. Ma\u00eetre Roul has a vast Ballroom built within the manor, for leisurely and entertainment purposes, of course. It is mostly used for galas and ballroom dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was initially surprised that Roul's massive home had an actual ballroom built within the manor's itself, Maria couldn't help but somewhat blush in the process. After all, hearing that Roul wanted to share a dance with her.... It sounded like something out of a romantic fairytale like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, where the plump vulpine nobleman was her \"Prince Charming\" of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Aveline turned to face her equally rotund cousin, gently handing the cleaning utensils to Aim\u00e9e, where she then spoke in their native language and said, \"Un instant, cher cousin . Je dois montrer Madame Maria , o\u00f9 la salle de bal est situ\u00e9 . (One moment, dear cousin. I need to show Madame Maria where the Ballroom is located.)\" From there, Aim\u00e9e nodded in agreement, speaking in the same foreign tongue as her cousin and replied, \"Pas de probl\u00e8me, Aveline . Apr\u00e8s tout, elle est assez nouveau en ce qui concerne la navigation dans la maison de notre Ma\u00eetre .(No problem, Aveline. After all, she is fairly new when it comes to navigating through our Master's home.)\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Aveline let out a feminine giggle and answered, \"Tellement vrai , tellement vrai. (So true, so true.)\" From there, Aveline then focused her attention on her master's female guest and said, \"Follow me if you will, Mademoiselle Maria. I will show you where the Ballroom is.\" Seeing as how she still didn't fully know her way around the vast estate, Maria decided to follow Aveline to where the Ballroom was located, staying close behind the corpulent raccoon maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, along the way, Aveline then spoke toward Maria as they waddled their way down the large hallways and said, \"Master Roul has taken a liking to you, mademoiselle. You must be honored with such a privilege.\" \"Yes, well....I guess it is sort of a big deal, huh?\" Maria responded, obviously blushing a little, feeling like it's almost a weird but very thrilling fantasy, her inner childhood jumping with joy on knowing what it's like to be treated like a fairy tale princess. That is, if said fairy tale princess was required to be fattened up like Hansel and Gretel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course it's a \"big deal\", mademoiselle! After all, Ma\u00eetre Roul would not treat you with such generosity if he had no affection towards you, and Aim\u00e9e and I can see he clearly shows much affection when he laid his eyes upon you.\" Aveline replied, fully aware of the blooming romance occurring between Maria and Roul, becoming positively vocal about such a romantic relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Maria knew one thing for certain: She knew that Aveline was right, she was having such romantic feelings toward the blubbery vulpine noble. Maria couldn't deny that fact anymore than the reason why she originally came to Sulvale in the first place. Letting out a sigh of defeat, Maria then spoke toward Aveline and said, \"*Sigh* ......I know, you're right, Aveline; I do have feelings toward Roul, romantic feelings. It's just that.....I want our relationship to be, you know, fully developed, as if we were meant for each other, not a relationship where he only loves me because of my physical beauty and appearance, but then abandons me for another woman outright entirely. I deeply apologize if I offended your opinion of Roul, but....I just wanted to let somebody understand from my perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeenly listening on every word that Maria said to her, Aveline clearly understood what the tubby vixen was explaining, as the rotund raccoon maid then spoke up and answered, \"It's quite alright, mademoiselle. I clearly understand what you mean by a fully developed relationship. After all, you and Ma\u00eetre (Master) Roul want a romance that is meaningful. To prove that you are both made for each other. These are truly the passionate feelings of compassion and true love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not just that, Aveline. I'm....I'm also worried about meeting Roul's parents and family given. I mean, they're basically the closest equivalent to royalty in his homeland, and I'm deeply concerned about being treated like, well.....an outsider, a foreigner.\" Maria continued, feeling like she was confessing her sins to a priest in a cathedral, only Aveline wasn't neither an actual priest or an actual nun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Aveline stopped at a set of large, stained glass double doors, where the obese raccoon maid then turned around to face Maria and answered, \"Then fear not, Mademoiselle Maria. Roul's parents are quite the wise and understandable Nobles. After all, they've given me, my cousin, and a few of our siblings a place to call home, and treated us like members of their family. Surely, they would understand Ma\u00eetre Roul's passionate romantic feelings for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you had more family members besides your cousin Aim\u00e9e. May I ask what your siblings are like?\" Maria curiously asked, but Aveline then spoke up and answered, \"....Maybe for another time, perhaps. But right now, you have a romantic dance with Ma\u00eetre Roul to attend to. The Ballroom is on the other side of these doors, mademoiselle. Profitez de votre danse, ma dame !(Enjoy your dance, my lady!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with her guidance fulfilled, Aveline waddled back down the hallway, returning to Aim\u00e9e and leaving Maria by the doors leading into the Ballroom. Although she was thankful for Aveline's assistance with such a trivial matter, she had to actually be sure that Roul was actually inside the Ballroom. Approaching the stained glass double doors, Maria turned the knobs on both doors, opening them both in unison, revealing that Roul.....</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon entering the Ballroom, Maria couldn't help but stare in awe toward the sheer vast size of the manor's Ballroom. The floor was covered with tiles of smooth limestone the size of carriages, each tile laced in these regal and intricate designs upon the floor. In the center, Maria witnessed a large crystal chandelier hung high above the Ballroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her right, she laid eyes upon an elaborate stage-floor, covered with brass decor and built with hardwood spruce. In one of the corners, Maria noticed a collection of large circular tables with equally large chairs, each spread out across the tiled floor, as if the Ballroom was also a place for gathering an audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Maria began to hear Roul's voice echo throughout the Ballroom, where she ten turned to her left toward the source of the echo, using her vulpine ears to focus in on the source. And there he was, sitting at one of the tables near the corner of the room that was the furthest from her current location in the Ballroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was there that the rotund properly-dressed vixen then began to notice something peculiar: Roul appeared to be having a conversation with someone. Judging from her appearance, Maria could clearly tell that the unknown person was an anthropomorphic fox, a rather obese one for sure. The magenta and white frilly day gown indicated that it was a vixen, a rather young vixen judging from her current height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen was downright corpulent, with a large apron belly displayed underneath the dress's corset. Her waist, hips, and butt obviously filled up the chair's seat, threatening to get the rotund vulpine jammed underneath the chair arms, both from the gown itself and the copious amount of cellulite on her frame. Her breasts clearly filled out the gown's top, along with a pair of tubby fat-laden arms, ending with a set of thick chubby paw-like hands and fingers at the end of each blubbery arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she could not see under the vixen's dress, Maria could only speculate that the vixen's legs were probably bulkier than her arms, since her feet appeared to be full of cellulite, almost pushing the red heeled shoes and white silk stockings to their size limit. But as Maria cautiously waddled closer toward Roul and the slightly young obese vixen, she captured a better look of the vixen's face, which sported a thick double chin, a tubby vulpine snout, and a pair of plump facial cheeks, with long flowing blonde hair put into these very curly locks of hair, something more akin to the type of hairstyle a member of nobility would acquire, as well as having her lips coated in red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could....Could this be his sister C\u00e9line?\" Maria thought to herself, just as she was only 10 feet away before Roul turned his head and noticed her, with a caring smile on his snout. From there, despite his bulk, Roul was able to somewhat quickly sprung up onto his feet, as he approached his potential wife and said, \"Ah, ma ch\u00e9rie! You've finally arrived.\" Almost unexpectedly, Maria felt Roul plant a tender kiss on her left cheek, causing the rotund vixen to blush some, unable to help herself but enjoy the attention she was receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" He asked, obviously concerned if she was still a little too full from the massive breakfast from earlier. In response, as she placed a chubby paw-like hand on her fat belly, Maria then spoke toward the plump vulpine noble and answered, \"Better, I guess. I mean, my stomach doesn't feel like it could explode at a moment's notice anymore.\" \"Well, I'm glad that you are feeling much better, ma ch\u00e9rie.\" Roul replied, feeling reassured about Maria's well-being. However, the younger rotund vixen nearby then spoke up and asked, \"So, I take it that she is your romantic flame, cher fr\u00e8re (dear brother)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes, ma ch\u00e8re soeur (my dear sister). Please allow me to introduce you to Mademoiselle Maria. Maria, this healthy young lady before us is none other than my beloved sister, C\u00e9line.\" Roul explained, confirming Maria's speculations about the rotund younger vixen is without a doubt C\u00e9line, the youthful sister of the plump vulpine nobleman, whom he has mentioned at least once or twice. Out of respect, Maria then faced C\u00e9line, then performed a light bow as a sign of greeting someone new, and said, \"It's an honor to meet you, C\u00e9line. Roul told me a bit about you yesterday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the pleasure's all mine, Lady Maria. After all, I must applaud you for making my beloved brother...what is that old saying foreigners use: \"Head over heels\", I presume?\" C\u00e9line complimented, obviously impressed by Maria making Roul have romantic affections toward her. In response, Maria giggled a bit and replied, \"Well, that definitely seems about right, Ms. C\u00e9line.\" \"Please, just call me C\u00e9line. Simply calling me \"Ms. C\u00e9line\" makes me feel like I'm merely 5 years older.\" C\u00e9line remarked, giving off a friendly and courteous atmosphere toward Roul's potential wife, along with being regally honest with Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you two are able to get along one another quite nicely. However, before we proceed with our dancing lessons, Maria, I have to leave for a moment to perform a small errand. Would you kindly accompany my beloved sister until I return?\" Roul asked, looking toward Maria with reassurance that he'll return soon for their lessons. Of course, Maria looked back at the blubbery vulpine noble and answered, \"Why of course, Roul! Just....promise me you won't take too long, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOui, mon bien-aim\u00e9 renarde (Yes, my beloved vixen). I solemnly swear to return by your side soon.\" Roul promised, holding both of Maria's plump paw-like hands, then delivered a tender kiss on her cheek, making the tubby vixen blush out of flirtation from the honorable vulpine nobleman. From there, Roul then proceeded to exit the Ballroom, opening another set of stained-glass double doors nearby, as he waddled out of the spacious room. Leaving the two vixens inside the Ballroom, there was this short moment of silence until....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"....So, I take it that my dear brother has been treating you nicely?\" C\u00e9line asked, curiously as to how her older sibling was treating Maria. In response,  Maria blushed a little once more and answered, \"Actually, Roul has been treating me like a lady ever since I've arrived here in Sulvale. And I thought chivalry was dead.\" \"Well, of course he would treat you in such a gentlemanly manner. After all, chivalry is a deeply rooted tradition in our country, and it is better to be loved and respected than to be feared and despised.\" C\u00e9line explained, giving off a few words of wisdom herself in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, there is.... another matter I wish to discuss with you.....\" C\u00e9line said, her voice now more serious in tone as she spoke toward Maria. From there, the younger obese vixen gestured Maria to take a seat nearby, which Maria then pulled up a nearby chair and faced it opposite of C\u00e9line. In appearance, Maria's own padded bulk was miniscule in comparison to the chair seat's overall size, made perfectly for someone of C\u00e9line's bulk and above that weight threshold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, C\u00e9line looked at Maria and explained, \"Look, I am attempting to threaten you or anything of such vulgar behavior, but tell me: Do you truly care about my brother, Maria?\" To be honest, Maria had this feeling that she might be getting a heart-to-heart talk with C\u00e9line, though she couldn't blame her for such an action anyway. After all, C\u00e9line appears to be looking out for her older sibling. So after letting out a deep sigh, Maria then spoke up and replied, \".....To be honest, C\u00e9line, I.... I really do have affectionate feelings toward Roul. It's just that....I want our relationship to be more than just \"I married him because he's rich\" or anything like that, I want it to be something true, something genuine, as if we were meant to be together as lovers. Every time your brother holds my hands, kisses me on the cheek or lips, or when he calls me his \"ma ch\u00e9rie\", I can't help myself but blush out of affection toward him. I've trusted a small handful of people in my life because of my occupation, but your brother.....he's the only one who was able to open my heart, and that means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeenly listening in on every word that Maria said, C\u00e9line began to understand that her motives were not of ill-intent, but of romance, greatly relieved that Maria has feelings for Roul as well. However, this also made C\u00e9line look back at Maria and asked, \"Then, what was your occupation when you arrived here?\" \"I.... I was an Adventurer. You know, someone who would wander the realms looking for a job the requires someone with my expertise, whether I had to go slay a dragon threatening a village, rescue royalty, or just retrieve an ancient artifact from a bunch of old abandoned ruins. You know, the usual odd jobs someone like me would perform.\" Maria answered, giving Roul's younger sibling a clear explanation as to what she did before she met Roul only yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from what C\u00e9line was able to understand, Maria had a difficult life, always on the move from town to town, from city to city. \"I....I see. It must have been quite a difficult life, being an Adventurer and such.\" She said, taking into account that Maria was an Adventurer, a warrior, and a heroine in her own right. In response, Maria then spoke toward C\u00e9line and answered, \"Yeah, it was difficult at times, even more so on occasion. But, it was sort of the only life I knew so far....at least, I thought it was the only Ilife I did know of before I met your brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, from what she was able to analyze, C\u00e9line could understand that Maria deeply cared about Roul, but she could see some of the hesitation in the padded vixen's eyes, not sure if she was ready to truly be tied down by something like marriage. So, she then spoke once more and said, \"....You're still hesitant about fully committing to marriage, aren't you?\" In reaction, Maria became surprised as to how dead-on C\u00e9line was with such a question, as she then asked, \"But....h-how did you even know that I was hesitant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Giggle* Maria: I'm a Seamstress. In my ligne de travail (line of work), it requires a keen eye and accurate perception to sew yards of silk and cloth into beautiful and elegant gowns and other articles of clothing. My personal experiences as a Seamstress has allowed to see what one's inner desires are when I gaze into their eyes. And I've seen such desires in your eyes as well, mademoiselle. You love my brother, and yet, you feel as if you are not ready to have yourself tied down by circumstances such as marriage.\" C\u00e9line explained, giving Maria such an accurate and precise analysis of what the plumper vixen truly desired in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um.....I don't know what else to say. I'm just.....speechless.\" Maria remarked, definitely not expecting Roul's more youthful sibling to be so accurate about what she wanted at this time. From there, C\u00e9line simply let out a short giggle and replied, \"No need, just a simple \"Thank you\" is in proper order. After all, I simply wanted to understand you little more, that is all.\" Maria couldn't help but display a reassured but thankful smirk on her slightly chubby snout, appreciative of C\u00e9line accepting her as Roul's lover.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moments later, the two vixens then heard the sounds of footsteps approaching the Ballroom doors nearby, which then revealed to be none other than Roul, whom Maria could only guess that the plump vulpine nobleman had completed said errand, as he made his way through the double doors. \"Well, that didn't exactly take long.\" Maria thought to herself, noticing how brief his supposed \"errand\" actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have returned, mademoiselle! I hope I wasn't gone for too long, have I?\" Roul said, greeting both his younger sister and his potential wife, as he stood with Maria. From there, C\u00e9line spoke toward her older brother and replied, \"Not at all, cher fr\u00e8re (dear brother). In fact, Maria and I were merely having a conversation amicale (friendly conversation). Nothing too concerning or anything as such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of curiosity, Maria turned her head to face the tubby vulpine noble, wanting to get an answer or two as to what he was doing, and asked, \"So.....what exactly was this errand of yours you've mentioned before you walked out of the Ballroom?\" Understanding the slightly rotund vixen's uncertainty toward his errand, Roul then looked toward Maria in the eyes, sporting a caring smile upon his chubby vulpine snout in the process, and he answered, \".....You know, since you seem so curious about what I was preoccupied with earlier, ma ch\u00e9rie, why don't I give you an explanation while we dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction to his answer, Maria couldn't help but blush even more, causing her cheeks to turn a near crimson-red hue, feeling like it was something completely out of a fairytale, like Cinderella sharing a dance with her Prince Charming, only the vixen didn't have to worry about the clock striking at midnight whatsoever. It was almost like a dream, a somewhat awkward dream, of course, but a dream nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Well, since we are inside a Ballroom, I guess....I-I guess we could have our dance here, Roul.\" Maria answered, obviously blushing from the fact that she was going to share a dance with Roul himself, very person she began to have affections toward. In response, Roul was excited to hear Maria's approval, as he spoke to her and replied, \"Excellent, ma ch\u00e9rie! C\u00e9line, do you think we can have some music for our duet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Giggle* Pas un probl\u00e8me , mon cher fr\u00e8re (Not a problem, dear brother).\" C\u00e9line remarked, as she then stood up from the chair, then waddled toward a weird looking machine Maria had never seen before in her life. In appearance, the machine looked like a large box with two large curved brass instrumental horns sticking out of the box and aimed their trajectory upwards toward the ceiling a little. On the top in between the two horns, it had this circular metal plate in the center, with a short rod sticking out in the center of the plate, where there was also a rectangular metal block positioned beside the metal plate, which had a needle-like rod sticking out of the bottom of the metal block's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what exactly is that thing?\" Maria asked, just as C\u00e9line pulled out what appeared to be a large black, holding it with a plump paw-like hand, as she looked toward Maria and said, \"What? You've never seen a Phonograph before, Maria?\" \"A Phono-what?\" Maria replied, raising an eyebrow out of sheer confusion, not exactly sure what that contraption actually was supposed to do. Out of reassurance, Roul comforted Maria some, where he spoke to her and answered, \"Ah, so you have never seen such a machine before, ma ch\u00e9rie? Well, to perfectly explain it, a Phonograph is an elegant machine from our homeland. It basically plays music when no orchestra could be present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as C\u00e9line inserted the black disk onto the metal plate, she then moved the metal block onto the disk as it moved. And just like that, the machine came to life and played the type of classical music akin to an orchestra, as it played what could only be described as \"Ballroom Dancing Music\". But as the music began to echo throughout the Ballroom, Roul then extended his left paw-like hand toward Maria and asked, \"Shall we dance, mademoiselle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was blushing extensively from how romantic the atmosphere was becoming, Maria couldn't help but give in to such whimsical fantasies, as she placed her plump right hand in his left hand, where he then pulled her towards him, putting his other arm around her lower back, as the duo both felt their bellies touching one another. From there, they began to perform a slow but elegant dance, with Maria doing her best to follow Roul's lead in such a duet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while they were continuing the dancing, Maria then spoke toward Roul, just as she performed a pirouette and asked, \"So, what exactly was this errand that  you were preoccupied with?\" In response to Maria's burning question, Roul then spoke toward the rounder vixen and answered.....</span></div></div>",

To elaborate, our family, the Coutures, have cordially invited us to a royal gala with the capital city of La Principaut\u00e9 de Rois (The Principality of Monarchs), known simply as \"Azure Ville\", which means \"Azure City\" in our country's native dialect.\" Roul explained thoroughly, giving Maria more insight into The Principality of Monarch's geographical infrastructure, as well as the name of the nation's capital city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this only served to have more questions, as Maria became more precise in the pacing of the ballroom dance with Roul with each passing minute, becoming more in sync with Roul's movements as they pirouette across the Ballroom's tiled floor. Although she now understood what Roul's motives were at the moment, Maria became a bit more curious as she asked, \"So....why is it called Azure City then? I mean, there has to be a reason behind such a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Chuckle* Quite the curious vixen, are you not? Well, to answer your curiosity, ma ch\u00e9rie: Yes, there is an actual reason behind the city's name. You see, Azure City was founded by our forefathers when they discovered vast and numerous deposits of Azurite, a rare and unique crystal with magical properties contained within the mineral itself. The Principality of Monarchs is known for it's vast amounts of Azurite within it's borders, and Azure City has the largest deposit of Azurite ore in the country.\" Roul answered, going into detail involving the city's founding, along with informing Maria of the mystical mineral known as Azurite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now normally, my brother and I would usually attend these galas either by ourselves or with a friend or two as entourage. However, since you and my brother are starting a romantic relationship, Maria, you will be accepted to such an event if you stay close to Roul.\" C\u00e9line explained, giving the blubbery vixen more information on how the galas worked within Roul's homeland. Internally, Maria couldn't help but feel both excited and nervous at the same time, due to the fact that she wasn't just allowed the chance to visit Roul and C\u00e9line's native kingdom, but the hesitation was from the realization that Maria had to meet their parents, the Lord and Lady of Ch\u00e2teau Couture themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a sense, this was a very big deal for Maria, since she now had to meet Roul's mother and father, possibly much sooner than expected with this gala of theirs as any indication. Steeling her nerves some, Maria then spoke toward the tubby vulpine noble and said, \"Alright, so when will this gala occur, exactly?\" \"Just 6 days from now, mademoiselle Maria. Now as for how far is our homeland and what sort of transport we will be using to arrive in the Principality of Monarchs..... We will have to traverse the Hollow Sea by airship in order to reach the Principality itself and enter Azure City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow slightly unnerved by how short the time was until the gala, Maria was also completely unsure as to what Roul was talking about when he mentioned the word \"Airship\". After all, she has never heard of something like this before until now, where she spoke toward Roul and asked, \"An.....Airship?\" \"My apologies, ma ch\u00e9rie! I forgot to inform you about such an advanced technological marvel. To elaborate, an airship is.... well, a ship that can soar through the air like a flock of birds. It uses a set of gigantic balloons for lift and uses propellers powered by a pair of large engines fueled with Azurite crystals as a power source. These airships are the size equivalent to the large ships known as \"Man-O-Wars\". We use them as an alternative means of transportation across vast distances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Roul had explained to her, Maria could see that the Principality of Monarchs was more technologically advanced than she had anticipated. \"So, um....when will be leaving?\" She asked, trying her best to keep calm at a time like this. This was somewhat unusual behavior for her, she wouldn't normally be so timid when it came to visiting nobility. Maybe it was because she was going to inevitably meet C\u00e9line and Roul's parents, and was afraid of giving off a bad first impression? She wasn't sure at the moment, where Roul proceeded to answer Maria's question and replied, \"We will be leaving for the Principality of Monarchs tomorrow morning. The airship that will escort us, Les ailes du Maiden (The Maiden's Wings), shall arrive before noon to pick us up. In preparation, I requested Aim\u00e9e and Aveline to pack up the clothes you will be wearing during our trip to Azure City and the Couture Gala itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing such news, Maria couldn't help but instinctively gulp out of stress, obviously from the fact that meeting Roul's parents was definitely imminent. Upon seeing the signs of stress in the somewhat corpulent vixen's eyes, Roul stopped dancing to both comfort and reassure Maria, where he put his paw-like hands around her chubby paw-like hands and digits, doing his absolute best to relieve the stress inside her, where he spoke to her in a calm and caring tone of voice and said, \"Maria..... I understand that you seem rather....timid toward attending the gala. Is it because you are hesitant to meet our mother and father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how compassionate he was toward her plight, Maria couldn't help but blush a crimson red hue, where she then nodded her chubby snout and head yes once or twice in response, which Roul then planted a gentle loving kiss on the vixen's lips then replied, \"Ma ch\u00e9rie, there is nothing wrong with showing hesitation. But I assure you: our mother and father are two of the most humble and understanding people I know. Surely, they will comprehend the romantic affections you and I have for one another.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Maria then wrapped her plump arms around Roul in a loving embrace, then kissed him as well, causing the chubby vulpine noble to blush as well, as Maria spoke to him and said, \".....Thank you. That.....that means a lot, Roul.\" \"It is my honor to lend you aid, mademoiselle.\" Roul answered, feeling grateful to lift Maria's distressed mood. But as the two lovers continued the embrace......</span></div></div>",

Gods, I must've slept much longer than I thought.\" Maria thought to herself, surprised that it was much later than anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on cue, Maria's stomach's began to emit a loud gurgling noise, demanding to be satisfied with edible delicacies, causing the blubbery vixen to blush out of some embarrassment, just as Roul let out a light chuckle and said, \"Well, it seems your stomach has quite the demanding appetite, ma ch\u00e9rie. What do you say we satisfy it's demands?\" From hearing his flirtatious remark, Maria couldn't help but display a gentle smirk upon her slightly chubby snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Maria held her right paw-like hand in Roul's left paw-like hand, as they waddled out of the Ballroom and down the wide hallway back to the Dining Room, with C\u00e9line following closely behind her brother and his potential wife. Once the trio made it to the Dining Room, the table was littered with roasting meats of various flavors, ranging from a simple hog with an apple stuffed into it's maw, to more exotic delicacies like smoking Mountain Deer meat. Mentally, Maria felt like her jaw metaphorically dropped to the floor out of starving awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting anytime, Roul guided Maria toward one of the chairs, pulling out said in a chivalrous manner for the somewhat rotund vulpine. Of course, Maria obliged and sat her tubby furry rear down in the spacious chair, just as Aveline pulled out a somewhat larger chair for C\u00e9line to sit in. Then, Roul sat himself in a chair next to Maria, keeping her company during supper. Once they settled into their seats, the feasting had begun, as Maria quickly grabbed what was once a left hind leg of a Mountain Deer, her tongue's taste buds taking in the succulent flavors from the roasted deer leg, consuming a good chunk of thigh meat on the deer leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Maria, she had not tasted Mountain Deer meat before until now, and from what she has heard of it's taste and flavor, they were right on the money with such accusations. Looking over toward the two vulpine siblings, Maria could see how chivalrous their eating was. She wagered it had to do with being raised by nobility and such. Of course, Maria then returned her attention toward the unfinished deer leg, rotating the roasted leg and chomping her teeth down on the deer leg's reddish meat, consuming the meat until there was nothing but bones.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After about nearly a full hour later, Maria had finally consumed the entire platter of roasted Mountain Deer, leaving nothing but the entire skeleton itself, including the skull, ribcage, pelvis, and both the forelegs and hind legs, which were licked clean of any remaining nearly residue, as the Deer skeleton and it's bones laid out on the massive silver platter. Though as for Maria, her thoughts of being full earlier during breakfast was a complete understatement compared to her current physical state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, her belly was completely and undeniably stuffed to the brim. After all, consuming little over 200 pounds of Roasted Deer flesh will undoubtedly take a great toll on one's digestive tract, as Maria felt her painfully distended abdomen underneath the stressed petticoats of her blue dress, her stomach working overtime to digest every last scrap of food that she shoved down her vulpine gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but moan a little in pain, causing Roul to become concerned for her well-being, putting a paw-like hand on her left shoulder to let her know of his concern, as he spoke toward her and asked, \"Ma ch\u00e9rie, are you going to be alright? Your stomach looks very much in pain.\" \"Ugh.....*Grunt* This.....is definitely going to take some adjusting, but.....I think I'll be fine, Roul. It's just.....I need to get some rest, nothing more *Yawn*.\" Maria replied, succumbing to the effects of a \"Food Coma\", her eyelids feeling heavy, and her consciousness slowly but surely drifting away for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding that Maria's stomach capacity wasn't on par with neither his sister's or his own, Roul looked at the forcefully drowsy vixen before him and answered, \"I understand, mademoiselle. May your dreams be as blissful as a field of Ivory Roses.\" And just as she let off one final blush of the day, Maria then closed her eyes and drifted to sleep from her possibly second food coma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Roul gave both Aim\u00e9e and Aveline a physical gesture to carry Maria to her room for the night, which the two obese raccoon maids complied with their master's wishes. And surprisingly, despite the copious amount of blubber on the physiques, Aim\u00e9e and Aveline were both physically strong enough to gently lift the sleeping Maria and carried her out of the Dining Room with such trivial ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Giggle* It seems that your beloved Maria has quite a lot adjusting to do when it comes to our lifestyle, cher fr\u00e8re (dear brother).\" C\u00e9line remarked, aware of Maria's difficulty with staying awake after such a meal, along with being fairly impressed on how the plus-sized vixen was able to stomach 200 pounds of Mountain Deer Meat in one sitting, which was such a rare feat for a newcomer like Maria. \"Maybe, ch\u00e8re s\u0153ur (dear sister). However, I have faith in her potential with such a feat quite recently. After all, Maria happens to be quite the natural when it comes to Ballroom Dancing, despite bearing little to no knowledge of such a performance.\" Roul replied, discussing with his somewhat younger sibling about his potential wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, I hope she does not have motion sickness during the airship journey back to our homeland.\" C\u00e9line said, taking into account that Maria has never seen, heard, or rode on an airship before. In response, Roul reassured his sister and answered, \"Well, Maria DOES happen to have a profession as an Adventurer when I first laid eyes upon her. I can only speculate as to the kinds of adventures she has endured throughout her life, so I believe she can endure the journey on an airship. It's simply like traveling by ship, only we are soaring through the air instead of sailing through the ocean waves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words still fresh, both C\u00e9line and Roul stood from their seats, and proceeded to waddle to their rooms for a good night's rest. Meanwhile, Aim\u00e9e and Aveline made their way into Maria's bedroom, with the sleeping vixen in tow. From there, they gently sat her into a nearby chair, where the maiden duo carefully stripped the unconscious Maria down to nothing but her bra and panties, being extremely cautious when removing the blue gown, especially when it came to maneuvering around the vixen's painfully distended belly. Of course, Aim\u00e9e and Aveline had little to no difficulty with such an intimate manner, as Aim\u00e9e then grabbed the large silk night gown from before, and put the gown on the vixen's somewhat corpulent frame, maneuvering Maria's chubby arms and paw-like hands through both of the night gown's sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after getting the unconscious vixen dressed for the night, Aim\u00e9e and Aveline then carried Maria, gently laying her down on the bed. From there, the two rotund raccoon maids proceeded to lift the bedsheets over Maria's body, covering most of her blubbery form except for her plump face and snout, and her long flowing hair. Finished with the work, Aim\u00e9e and Aveline quietly waddled out of the bedroom, as they turned off the lights and carefully closed the door, leaving Maria to her dreams.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the morning light shining through the window leading into her bedroom, Maria groggily awoke from her food-induced slumber from last night, moving her plump left arm to block the sunlight from her chubby head and snout, allowing her eyes to adjust in the change of brightness. \"*Yawn* Man, I ate a lot of food last night.\" Maria said to herself, noticing her now larger  but softer belly, as it was beginning it's development into a full-blown apron belly, pooching toward the space in between her thicker legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't just her belly that got fatter, Maria noticed that her breasts were now a bit more hefty than previously, ascending a few bra cup sizes, as they pressed a little more against her silky nightgown. Also, her waist, hips, and butt felt somewhat more rounder than they were yesterday. Of course, as the now tubbier vixen stood up from the bed, Maria felt how much heavier she weighed a little, her buttcheeks having a bit more of a hefty jiggle with each waddling step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, how much did I eat last night?\" She asked herself, groping her belly some with her plump paw-like hands, feeling how much more sensitive her body was now, causing her to blush a little upon how doughy she had become. \"I see you're now quite awake, mademoiselle.\" A voice rang out nearby, causing Maria to turn around to see who she was speaking with, revealing to be none other than Aim\u00e9e, who stood in front of the doorway, as the corpulent raccoon maid waddled inside Maria's bedroom to check up on her master's lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too, Maria. I take it that you're here to help me get dressed then?\" Maria asked, just as Aim\u00e9e waddled toward the closet, pulling a rather large but regal crimson daygown, complete with puffed out skirt and orange ruffles along the back and sides of the dress's skirt, while it  had these slight puffy but ruffled short sleeves on the upper part of the dress, complete with a opening to show some of her cleavage. Overall, the dress had a lavish but flirtatious feel in it's design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, as she carefully set the dress down on the bed, Aim\u00e9e spoke to Maria once more and replied, \"Oui (Yes), Mademoiselle. After all, your updated size requires a new dress to be worn upon your beautiful form.\" The comment made Maria blush a little more, just as the rotund raccoon maiden then grabbed a larger set of purple silk bra and panties, since she could easily notice that the current undergarments Maria was wearing were becoming quite skin tight squeezing slightly on the vixens now larger breasts and buttcheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after stripping Maria of the tight bra and panties, Aim\u00e9e then proceeded to help Maria put on the larger lingerie, feeling relieved to have some breathing room. \"Well, at least I don't feel so constricted in that bra anymore.\" Maria complied, letting out a deep exhaled breath out of physical relief. \"Indeed, mademoiselle Maria. Now then, let's see if we can get you properly dressed, shall we?\" Aim\u00e9e replied, as she carried the crimson dress over to where Maria stood, inserting the fatter vixen into the dress legs first. From there, Aim\u00e9e pulled the dress upwards, putting each arm into the puffy short sleeves of the gown. Finally, the obese raccoon maid then closed the back of the dress, sealing Maria inside the regal daygown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Aim\u00e9e pulled a pair of red ruby heeled shoes, which are easily large enough to fit onto Maria's plump furry feet comfortably, as she inserted one foot at a time into both of the expensive and fancy footwear. With that done, Maria approached the nearby vanity and applied red lipstick onto her slightly plumper lips, just as Aim\u00e9e unexpectedly applied pink eyeshadow upon Maria's upper eyelids. Of course, this only added a bit more feminine beauty to the vixen's appearance, just as she turned around to look at her reflection in a full-body mirror, noticing how attractive she was, despite how fat she had recently become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along now, mademoiselle. Ma\u00eetre (Master) Roul is waiting for us by the Grand Staircase.\" Aim\u00e9e said, carrying several of Maria's already packed suitcases in tow, as the corpulent raccoon maid waddled out the door, down the wide hallway, and toward the Grand Staircase adjacent to the Main Lobby. Maria followed not too far behind herself, feeling her blubbery frame now having a more jiggling sway with each step. By the time they made it to the Grand Staircase......</span></div></div>",

However, it also appeared that Aveline was preoccupied with carrying several bags of luggage into an exquisite carriage parked at the front main entrance of Roul's 3-Story Manor, making sure that her Master and Mistress were adequately stocked on clothing and other necessities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf, course, both Roul and C\u00e9line eventually became aware of the rounded vulpine's presence, as they turned around to gaze upon Maria while she descended the Grand Staircase. \"Ah, there she is! La vixen de sommeil (The sleeping vixen) is finally wide awake!\" C\u00e9line said, greeting Maria with a mildly teasing tone. From there, as Maria inevitably reached the Main Lobby floor, Roul eagerly approached her, gently held her plump left paw-like hand, and then kissed her hand as he said, \"Good morning, Mon beau renard (my beautiful fox). Did you sleep well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Maria couldn't help but blush from such a romantic yet flirtatious greeting by the plump fox she was gradually falling in love with. However, she soon regained her normal composure and replied, \"Why yes, I did, Roul. Thank you for asking.\" From there, Maria then took notice of the large and elegant 6 horse-drawn carriage waiting outside, where she then spoke toward Roul and asked, \"...I take it that the carriage is going to take us to this \"Airship\" you spoke of yesterday?\" \"Pourquoi oui, mon cher (Why yes indeed, my dear)! I see that you're still assez perspicace (quite perceptive) as always, ma ch\u00e9rie.\" Roul answered, easily aware of Maria's keen sense of perception, obviously honed from years of experience as an Adventurer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after greeting one another, Roul affectionately guided Maria out of his Manor estate and towards the luxurious carriage awaiting them,with C\u00e9line following closely behind, despite her rotund bulk and girth. Upon approaching the carriage, both Aim\u00e9e and Aveline simultaneously opened both doors on the carriage's left side, thus allowing the 3 corpulent foxes to enter with ease. Being the kind and caring gentleman that he was, Roul allowed Maria to enter the carriage first, as she carefully ascended into the carriage interior. To her surprise, the carriage was much more spacious than she had originally anticipated, just as she was then accompanied by C\u00e9line, who sat opposite of her within the carriage. Finally, Roul eventually entered the carriage himself, where he then sat beside Maria within the carriage, as Aim\u00e9e and Aveline then closed the doors and locked them, then proceeded to the front of the carriage, and take up the reins to control the 6 horses, ordering them to move forward, thus pulling the carriage in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after 2 to 3 hours of traveling by carriage, they eventually arrived at their destination: The flying Airship known as \"The Maiden's Wings\", which was currently docked at a recently built Airship Port. \"Well, there she is, mademoiselle Maria: Les ailes de la jeune fille (The Maiden's Wings).\" Roul said, gazing out of the left window, prompting Maria to look out the same window as well, which caused her to have a reaction of shock and awe upon her plump vulpine snout, seeing the massive floating ship with her own two eyes. After all, even though she has seen massive Man-O-War ships before, Maria had truly never experienced witnessing such an unimaginable feat before: A flying ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the Airship Port, Aim\u00e9e and Aveline then unlocked the carriage doors to allow Maria, Roul, and C\u00e9line to proceed toward the Maiden's Wings. Roul was the first to exit the carriage, where he then assisted in allowing Maria to exit afterwards, since he was raised to use chivalry wherever he goes, while C\u00e9line was assisted by Aim\u00e9e and Aveline. From there, once she was now on solid ground, Maria gazed upward towards The Maiden's Wings, completely astonished from how such a massive ship was capable of flight. \"Impressive, is she not, ma ch\u00e9rie?\" Roul said, causing Maria to be snapped out of her astonished stupor, where she then gazed at the bloated vulpine nobleman and replied, \"...I'm sorry, Roul. Its just that I... Wow, I...I still can't believe that ship is floating in the air like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chuckle* Fret not, mademoiselle. This Airship is but a taste of what you will see at La Principaut\u00e9 des Monarques (The Principality of Monarchs).\" Roul explained, where he then held Maria's plump right paw-like hand and gently guided her toward The Maiden's Wings, where they would enter the ship and embark on their to Roul and C\u00e9line's homeland, The Principality of Monarchs. However, before they could even advance any further, the group encountered a rotund male wolf steward, who kept record of anyone who proceeded into The Maiden's Wings via ledger booklet. However, judging from some of his snug attire, Maria could easily tell that the lupine steward was also from The Principality of Monarchs as well, just as she then heard him speak in his native tongue as he said, \"Et qui pourriez-vous \u00eatre, Monsieur (And who might you be, sir)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in response to his fellow countryman, Roul spoke toward him in his native tongue and answered, \"Je m'appelle Roul Couture et je suis membre de House Couture. S\u00fbrement, vous avez d\u00fb nous attendre, bon monsieur? (My name is Roul Couture, and I am a member of House Couture. Surely, you must have been expecting us, good sir)?\" Shortly after that, the fat wolf steward scrolled through his ledger for confirmation that Roul and the others were on the list. Fortunately for the group, they were, as the obese lupine then gestured for them to enter The Maiden's Wings, waddling into the interior of the ship heading towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...  Another fox?\" Maria asked, rhetorically.  She took one more whiff, and caught the unmistakable scent of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>male</i> fox,\" the vixen said aloud.  She wasn't sure what to make of this.  It was always nice to find a fellow fox.  However, she was a bit uneasy about encountering a <i>male</i> fox, especially during this season, where they tended to be a bit...  \"Excitable.\"  She'd be, more-or-less, alone with this male, and she wasn't sure if she'd be able to thwart any unwelcome advances...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, in this situation, Maria decided it'd be a better idea to find him before he found her.  Obviously, if she was close enough to smell him, <i>he</i> was close enough to smell <i>her.</i>  Getting the drop on him would stop any sort of ambush he could plan, and Maria could avoid some not-quite-welcome sexual penetration (at least take her out to dinner first; <i>then</i> she'd talk).  She could smell where he was; it was only a matter of walking over there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe departed from the trail and embarked into the wooded area on her left, tip-toeing through the brush quietly.  Only fifteen feet in --<i>much</i> closer than expected-- she found the individual in question, crouching in a bush with his back to her.  He was a svelte, similarly-colored fox, albeit a tad a brighter, wearing a light brown tunic with gray linen pants with a hole in the back for his bushy, white-tipped tail.  The only weapon he had on him seemed to be a dagger that he'd strapped to his back loosely.  He was staring ahead intently, completely engrossed by...  Actually, it didn't really look like he was watching anything in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria rolled her eyes; this was child's play.  She simply plucked the dagger from the fox's back, rendering completely unarmed.  The male fox yelped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" he cried as he sprung to his feet and turned around to meet his would-be assailant.  He wasn't expecting another fox.  \"Who...  Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better question:  Who are <i>you</i>?\" Maria retorted, holding the male's dagger in her right hand to show him that she had control, here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  Mean no harm, Miss...  I-I'm James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  So, what the hell are you hiding in the bushes with a dagger for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd heard someone approach...  I thought it was an intruder...\" he eyed his dagger in the vixen's hand.  \"I was simply defending my home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"  Maria relaxed a bit, but not fully.  He didn't seem to be very threatening, even if he was half a foot taller than she was.  He was reasonably handsome, fairly mild...  But she certainly wasn't giving him his dagger back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Miss...  I mean no harm.  Especially not to a lovely vixen such as yourself...\"  James's tail swished a bit as he uttered the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was <i>I</i> the intruder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so...  The 'intruder' had much heavier footsteps.  I couldn't smell it, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\"  Maria sensed an opportunity, here.  \"I suppose I could take care of your problem...  For a fee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?  That would be wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's stomach growled quite audibly at that moment.  \"...  Sorry.\"  Maria blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no worries.  You sound hungry, Miss...  Would you like to follow me home?  I can get you something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's ears perked a bit at the mention of food.  \"That would be lovely, James.  I'm Maria, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Maria...  Let's get you fed, then we can discuss payment.  Come this way, lovely lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right, James...\"  The fox was becoming just a bit enamored with Maria, and she wasn't quite sure she was comfortable with that...  Still, a job's a job, and food is food.  And there could be <i>worse</i> individuals to pursue her; all in all, James seemed to be a sweet guy...  Well, from what little she knew about him, anyway.  Either way, she wasn't worried about him; Maria was convinced that, if James became \"rape-y,\" she could easily dispatch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames led Maria through the woods, weaving in between trees and bushes, until they came to a hillside...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, here we are, Maria...\" James said as he led Maria around the hill until they came to an opening framing a locked door.  \"Home, sweet home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames produced a key from his pocket and inserted it into the lock, opening the door.  \"Welcome to my humble abode.  After you, Miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange vixen obliged, steeping through the door and into James's den.  Her foot-paws were greeted by smooth hardwood flooring, which was always nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely flooring, James,\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  I've built this place myself...  I haven't been here long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly didn't expect it; usually, a person living as a hermit, in a cave, no less, wouldn't bother with such things.  However, James didn't seem to be your average cave-hermit; he'd put a lot of effort into turning his dwelling into a proper home.  The second \"civilized\" touch Maria noted was the walls; James had not been content to leave them as dirt, so he'd fashioned a proper plaster wall, forming a perfect right angle with the floor, as well as the ceiling, which was also plaster, eight feet from the ground.  The walls were covered in a tasteful red-and-white striped wallpaper, which gave a \"stately\" look to the place.  They walked a bit farther inside, and James shut the door behind them.  Maria remained wary, but not overtly paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey first came upon the \"living\" area of the den, a twelve-foot-by-nine-foot chamber lined with empty shelves, save for a few books scattered around them.  A fireplace stood in the center of the long, right-most wall from the two, complete with a hearth and a tiny pot hanging from a spit inside.  It wasn't lit, of course.  Beyond the hearth was an ovular red carpet, surrounded by two armchairs to either side of a loveseat facing the hearth.  They were comprised mainly of wood, with light-blue cushions covering the seats and backs.  An end-table flanked the loveseat on both of its sides.  It looked fairly cozy, to be sure; but Maria wasn't sure why James would even <i>need</i> so much seating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rising staircase was embedded in the wall opposite Maria and James, leading, obviously, to an upper floor.  James wasn't taking \"the tour\" in that direction, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn open doorway in the left wall led into a ten-foot-by-ten-foot dining area, housing a dark-wood table surround by eight dark-wood chairs.  There wasn't much to this room, but it did look like a nice place to eat.  Another open doorway on the facing the living area door led into a kitchen and pantry.  There wasn't much to this room besides a counter, a wood-burning stove...  And several shelves lined with dry ingredients and cookware to the right of the room.  James opened a small door on the left wall to reveal a \"refrigeration\" room, where enchanted crystals kept food at sufficiently-cold temperatures.  He stepped inside to retrieve a medium-sized ham, which he placed in a pan and slid into the oven, which apparently contained <i>more</i> enchanted crystals that <i>heated</i> the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes cooking so much easier,\" said James contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get all of these crystals, James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I moved in here, I took the liberty of purchasing them at the market in Welsengard.  It was an 'Enchanted Curios' stall that piqued my interest...  I also have some 'Lighting' crystals that I've yet to install.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...  Done!\"  James opened the oven and pulled out the ham, which was hot and steaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  It's...  Finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Lunch is served, Maria.\"  He took the pan and laid it on the table in the dining area.  \"Take a seat anywhere you like.\"  Maria removed the sword from her back and lowered her shapely ass onto a chair facing the kitchen, watching as James escaped into the kitchen and emerged with two plates, two forks and a knife.  He set a fork and plate before Maria, one fork and plate before himself at an adjacent chair to the vixen on the right side of the table and inserted the knife right into the ham.  He sawed off a thick, slightly-fatty slice and placed it on Maria's plate, and then sliced off a substantially thinner piece for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria wasted no time in tearing into her meal, the first substantial one she'd had in a couple days.  She wasn't very ladylike, simply using the fork to lift the entire piece of meat to her face and ate it as if were a kebab, simply biting it and tearing off pieces.  It was delicious; the fat had a sort of \"nutty\" flavor to it, and of course the meat was good, too.  James smiled pleasantly as he watched her eat, only picking at his own piece of ham himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you enjoy my 'cooking,' Maria,\" he said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-hmm!\" Maria uttered enthusiastically through a mouthful of pork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, Maria finished her slice.  She looked down at her empty plate; she was quite surprised that she'd eaten so quickly...  And that she was still hungry.  Before Maria could open her mouth to ask for another slice, James stood up to saw off another, even <i>thicker</i> slice, and placed it right onto Maria's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Uh, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore into this piece with as much enthusiasm as the last, and finished it just as quickly.  James continued to dish her more slices of ham each time she finished the last, until the ham was gone.  Luckily by that time, Maria's hunger was sated, leaving her to massage her slightly-distended belly which was peaking out from underneath her leather chest-plate, a modest white-furred dome with a shallow navel just below the center.  Maria licked her lips and moaned contentedly, thoroughly satisfied by a meal for the first time in months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you full, Maria?\" James asked as he cleared the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my, yes!\" Maria responded enthusiastically.  She'd completely dropped all pretenses of being a \"cold, hard warrior,\" and was now playing the role of \"food-drunk house-guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames chuckled.  \"Excellent, Maria.  Now that lunch is over, shall we...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm sure it'd be a good idea to let things digest before we work out any agreement,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?..  Oh, yes.  That sounds wonderful,\" Maria said hazily.  She raised herself from her seat with her right paw, cradling her belly with the left, and stood, waiting for James's cue to take a seat in front of the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; you go on over and get comfortable.  I'll be with you in a moment, after I finish clearing the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria strolled over to the loveseat in the living room, leaving her sword behind in the dining room.  She took the rightmost cushion, letting herself sink in as she admired the softness of cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooh...\" Maria moaned as she rubbed her gut with both paws.  \"So comfy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames appeared from the dining room moments later and made his way over to the fireplace.  He deposited a few logs inside and lit them with a bit of flint.  After stoking the flaming logs with a poker, he took the armchair to the right of Maria.  \"Ah, much better...\"  James shimmied a bit in his chair, and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such a comfortable loveseat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, it is.  You're more than welcome to put your feet up on the other cushion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria decided to take him up on his offer and swung her legs up onto the loveseat.  She wriggled her dainty vulpine toes as she settled herself into the loveseat, lying on her back and sighing contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a lovely home, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Maria.  So...  Tell me about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hail from the town of Remgard; I was born and raised there...  When I turned eighteen, I decided to leave and become a warrior so that I could see more of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded.  \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There really hasn't been much for me to do, lately, though...\" Maria admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jobs have been few and far between...\"  Maria shook her head.  \"Bah, I shouldn't be troubling you with my problems, James.  I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright.  So, where have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In all honesty...  Nowhere.  It's been three years since I left my village, and all I've seen are forests, more forests, a couple of towns...  And exactly one fortress.  It wasn't even a very impressive fortress, either...  No spikes, or a lava moat, or cannons...  Just a one-story gray-brick building.  There wasn't even anything inside...\"  Maria laughed.  \"Nothing!  No chests, no tables, no chairs, no shelves...  I wasn't sure if the previous warlord had moved out or if everything was just stolen...  Anyway.  I haven't explored nearly as much as I thought I would.  I don't know why, exactly.  I became a warrior to do just that, but I've never been given a reason to actually go anywhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...  You know, Maria, I used to be an adventurer, too, a couple years back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes; I was a mage, though.\"  James snapped his fingers, calling into existence a lone flame.  He held it for a few seconds, after which it extinguished itself just as suddenly as it had appeared.  \"It didn't take long for me to realize I wasn't cut out for that life, though...  I never liked traveling, much, and I never found pleasant company with any other adventurers I'd meet.  So, after about a year of exploring, I just sort of...  Quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...  If you've got magic...  Why do you need <i>me</i> to help you with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have much magic...  I can toss fireballs and freeze things, but I never got much farther than that,\" James said, shaking his head.  \"Why do you ask?  Have you changed your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...  Just curious, James,\" Maria said as softly as she could; she was afraid she'd offended him.  \"I didn't think a mage would need to hire a warrior for something as trivial as dispatching an 'unwanted guest,' even if that 'guest' turned out to be an ogre, or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough, Maria...  But I don't think my meager spells <i>could</i> take care of something like an ogre.  So, I will still require you.  And even if I was capable of taking care of this myself, it's still nice to have company...\"  James smiled warmly at Maria, and Maria nodded back.  \"So, shall we discuss payment, as long as we're on the subject?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shook her head.  \"...  Eh, you don't have to pay me...\" she said before stifling a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Maria?  That would be quite generous of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.  You've been very kind, so far, and I'd say that after I slay whatever troubles you, dinner and a place to stay the night will be ample compensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Maria.  I'd be happy to host you for tonight.\"  James smiled.  \"You could even stay longer, if you'd like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...  I couldn't impose upon you any longer than a night.  In the morning, I'll be on my way, looking for something to do...  I appreciate the offer, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded, and a strange look came over his face.  \"You know, Maria...  I might know of something you could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a cave somewhere north of here, across the river.  It's probably full of monsters...  And treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know much about it, though...  I'd gladly show you the way to it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wonderful.  Thank you, James.\"  Well, it looks like she'd finally lined something up:  A bit of good old-fashioned dungeon-crawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose...  That I could tag along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...  Want to 'tag along,' James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's a problem, I won't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's no problem.  I just didn't think you'd want to go somewhere like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, no.  But I suppose I'm feeling a bit of a residual 'itch' from my adventuring days.  I can brush up on a few spells, and hopefully prove myself useful to a pretty vixen such as yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded.  It was always a good idea to have a mage around.  And if nothing else, James would probably be pleasant company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you can come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Maria.  I've been a bit lonely, as of late, and it would be wonderful to accompany a lovely vixen...\"  James was laying it on a bit thick with the flattery; it wasn't very strong flattery, as you can see, but still tangible enough to leave Maria the slightest bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that she thought he'd \"take advantage\" of her, if given the chance.  It was just that he seemed just a bit too \"nice\" to someone he barely knew.  She certainly wouldn't be telling <i>him</i> what a \"handsome fox\" and \"charming man\" he was after knowing him for all of two hours...  But, alas, some of her discomfort came from the fact that she wasn't sure she had much reason, herself, to withhold such flattery, nor did she understand <i>exactly</i> why she should be uncomfortable with the attentions of a sweet fox that genuinely seemed to like her and that, truth be told, she found herself attracted to.  It was admirable of him to have offered her this hospitality, especially after she'd basically held him at dagger-point earlier.  Even after such an incident, he trusted her enough to let her into his home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't even mind if he wanted to \"do\" anything with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria subconsciously shuddered as she stopped that train of thought dead in its tracks.  Yes, he was a nice guy; yes, she trusted him somewhat...  But it was far too soon to pursue a relationship.  She wouldn't be adverse to such a relationship, but she decided that she shouldn't be considering such things in the heat of a sort of \"mini-crush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess I should start looking for your 'intruder,' James,\" Maria said, dismissing herself from the mental debate she was having with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feel that you're ready, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both rose from their seats.  Maria strolled over to the front door as James strolled into the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget your sword, Maria,\" James said as he reappeared with Maria's weapon in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh; thank you, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames unlocked the door and held it open for her.  She walked through it and turned to wave goodbye to James before she wandered off back into the woods to hunt James's beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames opened his mouth to speak...</span></div></div>",

Do you not want me along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine if you come along, James,\" the orange vixen said.  \"I'd love for you to come with me.  Just show me the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.  Follow me...\"  James walks straight ahead, past Maria and into the forest.  Maria follows close behind, silent.  They weave between trees and climb over fallen logs for nearly an hour, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" James says.  The red-orange fox raises his muzzle into the air and sniffs a couple of times.  \"I...  Smell something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria follows suit, raising her own muzzle into the air, sniffing once while James looks on...  And cringing as she catches a pungent aroma.  James can't help but smile at the orange vixen's over-reaction.  \"Eeeeeeeeeeugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea...  I've never smelled anything like it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few thuds sound amongst the trees as an unseen creature lumbers about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've found it, Maria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, the beast lumbers into view, revealing itself to be an <i>enormous</i> gray ogre.  Standing over nine feet tall and at least 15 feet around its waist, it dwarfed Maria and James's heights of 4'5 and 4'11, respectively, and easily outweighed them at a magnitude of over ten times the vulpine duo's combined weight.  It held a heavy, spiked club in its right hand, and a bulging burlap sack in its left, leaving no hand free to adjust its sagging fur loincloth.  It looked from side to side, not seeing the two foxes before it; it seemed to smell them, though, as its nostrils flared wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where...\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen an ogre before...\" Maria remarked.  \"Are they usually this...  Big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're certainly this tall, Maria...  But I've never heard of one being this huge.  True, they've never been renowned for under-eating, but...  They don't get <i>this</i> fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogre slammed its club into the ground, the impact shaking the ground around it.  It roared before fixing its eyes on Maria and James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>FOXES!</b>\" it bellowed.  \"<b>I MAKE YOU INTO BOOTS!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt charged forward, club raised above its head.  The lumbering oaf simply tripped itself, though, falling flat on its face as the vulpine duo stepped to the side.  Now prone, Maria decided to take this opportunity to strike it in the back of the neck.  She rose her sword high into the air and brought it down with all the force she could muster, severing the ogre's head from its body and ending the fight before it had even begun.  A stream of verdant lifeblood flowed from the stump of its neck, covering the ground around the fallen ogre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...  Was anti-climactic,\" Maria said dryly as she sheathed her sword..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing, Maria!  So skilled, so swift!\"  James said exuberantly as he beamed at Maria, and Maria returned an awkward smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  Thank you.\"  Maria rubbed the back of her own neck, blushing a bit at James's praise.  \"I...  I wasn't <i>that</i> amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you were!  You ended that beast before it could even swing once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...  Say, we should probably take that bag back to your house, James,\" the orange vixen said, pointing at the burlap sack in the ogre's lifeless hand.  \"It might contain something valuable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Maria.  You can have whatever is in that bag; you've earned it, magnificent warrior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria simply nodded as she looked away; James was trying far too hard to be nice.  It was getting hard for her to remain completely casual around him...  She sighed.</span></div></div>",

You're a very lovely vixen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange vixen turned her head to the side so that she could look at him.  \"Yes, James; you've told me that...\" Maria said, perhaps a bit more brusquely then she'd have liked it to sound.  \"You've told me how lovely I am a few times, already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...  I'm sorry, Maria...\" he said.  James hung his head, feeling the sting of an apparent incoming rejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry, James...  I do appreciate your many, many compliments...

You can still stay the night, if you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still love to stay the night at your place, James.  (Also, don't interrupt me...)  And, yes, you <i>are</i> making me a bit uncomfortable...  But not in the way you'd think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't the least bit attracted to you...

Hmmm...\"  Maria paused for a moment, looking for the words to say.  \"You're too subtle, <i>and</i> you're too <i>un</i>subtle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been obvious to me that you've been <i>trying</i> to be subtle...  You've made no 'advances,' said nothing remotely sexual...  And yet it's obvious that you <i>want</i> to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Maria-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now...  You're far too polite to ever do something like that, I know.  So, instead, you heap praise and whatever kindness you can spare upon me, hoping that that will be a big enough 'hint.'\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough, I suppose...  You're...  Quite good at this, Maria.  You...  See right through me...\"  James looked a bit uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shrugged.  \"Call it a woman's intuition, I guess.  Anyway...  You don't want to be too forward, you don't want to impose yourself upon me...  Which is refreshing, up to a point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to 'make the first move.'  You want <i>me</i> to do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And normally, I wouldn't.  But you know what, James?\"  Maria stepped around the ogre's corpse, coming right up next to James.  \"For you, I'll make an exception.\"  Maria stroked the side of James's face gently with her left paw before giving him a quick peck on the cheek, making him blush.  \"It's not a very <i>big</i> first move, but hopefully it gets the point across.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, Maria...\" James whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria winked at him and stepped away.  \"Now, the next few moves are <i>yours</i>, James.\"  The orange vixen wiggled her hips and swished her brown-tipped tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Maria.\"  James slung the ogre's burlap sack over his left shoulder and came up beside Maria.  He wrapped his right arm around Maria's shoulders and started to take the first step home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy...\" Maria said coyly.  \"But I was thinking a bit...  Lower.\"  With her right hand, she grabbed James's arm and guided it down her body, placing it right above her supple right buttock.  \"<i>That's</i> what I was thinking...\"  She threw her left arm over his waist and laid her head on James's shoulder, sighing contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  Wow...\" he said, eliciting a giggle from \"his\" vixen.  He never thought his reserved nature and general mildness would ever get him this far so quickly.  And truth be told, neither did Maria.  They'd only met today, being perfect strangers not four hours ago.  Relationships weren't <i>supposed</i> to form like this...  And yet, one just did.  There was just something about James...  Something she couldn't put her finger on...  Just something that felt so \"right.\"  Was this what you'd call \"true love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'd better not go <i>that</i> far, yet...\" Maria thought to herself, smiling.  \"What I'm doing now is 'risky,' but going that far is just <i>dangerous</i>...  Let's just see where the next few days take us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new couple set off for James's house, side by side...</span></div></div>",

The sun threatened to set on them, but they knew that they still had an hour of daylight left.  Not that it mattered much; James's home didn't have any windows, and they didn't really plan on spending much longer outside than they needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're home, Maria,\" James said, nuzzling the vixen's left cheek.  \"Let's head inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's,\" Maria responded, returning James's nuzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames produced the same brass key from earlier, approached the door and opened it.

After gingerly placing the sack on the floor nearby, James took his place beside Maria.  They both leaned into each other, sighing and watching the fire in the fireplace that James had neglected to extinguish before they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tranquility was broken, though, by Maria's gurgling stomach.  She blushed as James ran his paw up and down her belly, still only mildly-distended from her generous lunch earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hungry, love?\" James teased.  \"I guess I should start making dinner.

Maria asked rhetorically as her eyes took in the random assortment of things.  \"Where had that ogre <i>been</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...  My best guess is that it managed to surprise a passing carriage and looted it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, I guess.  Although one would think a carriage would have forethought to hire guards...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, I think we can enjoy this for what it is, valuable or not...\"  James rummaged through the pile and took out a horrendously-rumpled Tyrolean hat with a broken red feather.  He patted it for a moment, relieving the blue felt of its multitude of dents and pockmarks, and placed it atop his head, right between his ears.  \"I seem to have found a new hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria giggled at the remark and fished through the pile to find a hat of her own, coming up with a dented silver tiara.  Placing both hands on opposite sides, she attempted to bend it back into shape, but failed.  She shrugged, and placed it on her head anyway.  \"So have I,\" she said.  James chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take a moment to spread this out, shall we?\" James said.  With both of his hands he pushed various objects around the red rug, only stopping when he was satisfied that he'd revealed everything that the bag had hid.  Maria and James took a moment to see exactly what was in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left, farthest away, was a pair of black pants, clearly for a male, folded up surprisingly neatly; they looked a bit too large for James, though.  To the right of that laid a another Tyrolean hat, this one made of green felt with white feather.  James replaced the blue one on his head with this new green one.  \"I've found another hat,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Maria said, giggling.  \"Such a lovely hat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the right was a mid-sized, gray leather pouch, bulging with unknown contents.  \"Now, what could be in there?\" James asked, reaching for it.  He picked it up and placed it between him and Maria, opening it to reveal that it was full of gold nuggets.  \"Oh!\" they gasped in unison, each pulling out nuggets and examining them, confirming that they were, indeed, real.  There had to be at least seven pounds of gold in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple quickly snatched up another pouch from the spread, a similarly-sized brown leather pouch, opening it to reveal somewhat less valuable contents:  A variety of seed-bags, all unmarked but full of seeds.  \"I guess I could start a garden,\" James mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shrugged and continued scanning the pile as they were; they'd open any more pouches as they'd come to them.  They saw a set of blue satin lingerie, accompanying a similar nightgown which Maria picked up and pressed against her body.  \"Just a moment, James; I'm going to slip into something a bit more...  Comfortable.\"  James watched excitedly as Maria slipped out of her leather bodice, blue tunic and leather leggings, revealing Maria's own white-cotton lingerie, a well-filled bra but no panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like what you see, hon?\" she said in a sultry manner, running her hands up and down her bare fur, especially spending time along her inner thighs.  James nodded silently, eyes wide and mouth agape.  Maria giggled.  \"I thought you would.  Unfortunately, it all has to go away now...\"  Maria took the blue satin nightgown and pulled it over her head, letting it fall into place past her shoulders.  It was quite a bit roomier than she'd thought it would be, hanging loosely around her ample bosom and shoulders.  She was a bit disappointed to find that it didn't have a hole for her tail, though.  She'd have to make one later.  For now, though, she just lifted the gown to let her tail out spring out, and dropped it back down to let it hang on her bushy tail.  \"I've never owned a proper nightie...\" she said as her tail wagged.  \"Still, though...  I think I prefer to sleep nude.\"  She flashed James a devilish grin; James blushed and took off his hat and placed it on his lap, hoping to conceal his burgeoning erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria sat back down on the loveseat, a bit closer to James than she was before.  They continued looking through everything, but it seemed that they'd already seen everything that was remotely interesting.  There were a few more Tyrolean hats (whoever the ogre had ambushed had some sort of fetish for them, it seemed), a few rolls of fabric, mostly woolen with only one roll of silk, another nightgown, a couple of tunics, a red leather pouch full of silverware (\"Nice; I think we can make use of this.\"), a blue leather pouch full of spools of thread and sewing needles, a tiny bag full of silver coins (\"43...  44...  45...  46 silver coins.\"), a pair of clean, red flannel comforters (\"Ooooooooh...  Soft.\"), a pink tablecloth, and a large, black leather pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last pouch...\" said James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good; I'm getting hungry.\"  Maria's stomach growled noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, love.\"  James opened the bag and found a variety of magical paraphernalia.  \"Wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to pull out a number of differently-colored potions, none of them labeled, what appeared to be a wand, a few pouches filled with \"ingredients\" such as nightshade powder and poison oak leaves, a couple of spellbooks (\"These should be quite useful.\"), and a crystal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only object that had not been examined yet was a small white bag in the center of the rug.  \"Alright, love; this is the last thing here,\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it,\" Maria said.  She stood up and strutted over to the bag, and bent down to pick it up, intentionally shooting James a peek at her bare, supple ass.  She grinned as she looked back at the fox, and raised her tail for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my...\" he gasped.  Maria giggled.  Satisfied with her display, she picked up the bag and returned to the loveseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hon; open it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay...\"  James did as he was told, reaching into the bag and pulling out a little velvet box.  \"Wait; there's another...\"  With his other hand, he retrieved the second box, holding one in each hand.  With his thumbs, he opened each...  And within each sat a sparkling diamond ring, one studded with rubies and other with sapphires.  \"I believe these are yours, love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was speechless, dazzled by the two rings in front of her.  They seemed to shine with a light all their own.  They certainly didn't look like any other rings she'd ever seen...  No, these were far more beautiful.  After a moment of stunned silence, James took Maria's left paw and slid the ruby-studded ring onto her ring finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, James...  It fits perfectly!\" she cried, as if he'd bought her these rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now...  There's another one,\" he said as he took Maria's right paw and slid the first ring's brother onto her other ring finger.  Maria held her hands before her, eyes darting from left to right, taking in the splendor of the two rings.  She took her hands and brought them to her chest, sighing contentedly; she couldn't believe these were hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're...  They're <i>beautiful,</i> James...\" she gasped.  James opened his arms and embraced Maria.  She kissed him tenderly on his lips, and James blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat silently for eight minutes, enjoying each-others touch...  Until Maria's growling stomach broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, love.  Now's as good a time as any for dinner,\" James said, stroking her cheek.  \"I'll go get it started.  You wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the room, taking the red leather pouch and the pink tablecloth with him, leaving Maria on the loveseat.  She kicked up her feet and laid down, waiting patiently for dinner.  She gazed lovingly down at her new rings, admiring all of the gems embedded in the gold...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minutes passed as the fire flickered in the fireplace and the vixen's stomach growled.  Maria was as hungry as ever, to be sure, but she could ignore that; she was content.  A hot meal would be forthcoming, and the day had delivered to her many things:  A new adventure, a new boyfriend, a (possibly permanent) place to sleep, a bounty of treasure, and...  These rings.  These beautiful, beautiful rings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox gave a quavering sigh as she held her hands aloft, angling each of the baubles at the firelight so that they could sparkle, shimmer and shine.  Maria was quite enamored with her new \"toys.\"  She'd never owned anything <i>nearly</i> as glamorous (and presumably valuable) as the jewelry embracing her fingers and never believed that she ever could.  How on earth could an ogre come across something like these?  Could it even possibly know their worth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026  And who was dumb enough to travel through the woods without a bodyguard?  \u201cShoulda hired me...\u201d the vixen murmured.  It occurred to her, for one fleeting moment, that these rings weren't really hers, but rather the stolen property of the poor, simple soul whom the ogre preyed upon, and felt the slightest bit guilty.  Only a passing thought, though; it was quickly reasoned and rationalized away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dI doubt the owner of all of these things is even still alive...  Losing something outside of the borders of civilization means it belongs to the person who finds it...  And I found it...  And if they want it back, than they can just come take it.\u201d</i>  All these thoughts flowed through her head as she lazily flipped her wrists at the dying fire.  The rings sparkled, as they had all night, and Maria knew they were hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmong the sparkling of the ruby ring, a brief flash shone out, like a signal light calling to a distant ship.  It startled Maria, not enough for her to rise from the loveseat, but enough to remove her from her dreamy haze.  Both her eyes, wide open, fixed themselves upon the red stone, waiting for another unnatural flash.  Moments passed without a sign of life, and the vixen began to wonder if she had simply imagined the flash, or if it was a simple trick of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess...  It was nothing,\u201d she simply stated.  She halfheartedly held the suspect ring to the fire, trying to catch some light on the bauble.  It had been slowly dying over the evening's progression; it would be mere coals in less than an hour.  The fox sighed as she realized she'd have to get up to kindle the fading flame.  It wasn't as if she would have any trouble doing so, but...  She was so <i>cozy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shifted her body to rise from her spot, the ruby flashed again, more vividly than it had the last time.  Maria jumped a bit, realizing she <i>hadn't</i> imagined the earlier flash; there <i>was</i> something \u201coff\u201d about the ring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes would have remained fixed on the gemstone, but they were drawn to the fireplace.  The dying flame she was about to rekindle had sprung back to life, crackling away without any sort of fuel.  What was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames..?\u201d Maria called out, worry in her voice.  \u201cJames?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, he appeared in the dining room doorway, spoon in hand.  \u201cYes, love?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames, do you...  Is there anything...  Magical, about your fireplace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAside from the positively-enchanting glow it casts on the room, no.  It's just an ordinary fireplace.\u201d  James cocked his head at the vixen.  <i>What sort of question was that?</i>  Was she playing some sort of game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe fire was dying...  And it sprung back to life...\u201d  Maria could tell that the fox wasn't quite taking her seriously; she'd be infuriated if she weren't so uneasy.  \u201cIt did!  Just look in the fireplace; the fire's been burning for hours!  It shouldn't still be this bright!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, that's true...\u201d James admitted.  \u201cIt <i>shouldn't</i> still be this bright, but...  Why would that bother you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was getting just the slightest bit frustrated.  \u201cI'm...  The fire was...  Dying...\u201d  The vixen paused, frowning at the wall behind James as the confused fox stood watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaria, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'm alright...  I'm not crazy!  It's...\u201d  The vixen stopped mid-sentence as the gears began turning in her head.  \u201cThe rings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe...  Rings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes!  The ruby was flashing!  It flashed once, and then a few minutes later, it flashed again when I was about to rekindle the fire!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlashing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt flashed!  James, I...\u201d  Maria gave herself a moment to calm down.  \u201cThe ring flashed as I held it toward the fire, right as I was getting up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see...\u201d  James crossed his arms, unsure of what to make of all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...  You don't believe me, do you?  James, please...\u201d  Her voice quavered, betraying frustration and hurt.  \u201cWhy don't you believe me..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed.  \u201cI...  I believe you, Maria.  Please, calm down...  You don't need to be upset.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't believe me.  James...  It was the ring.\u201d  She held the ruby ring to the firelight, trying to make it flash again.  She wasn't even worried about the ring anymore.  She just wanted to prove to James that she wasn't making this up.  More than anything in the world, more than anything ever, she just wanted the fox to believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red stone sparkled pleasantly, as it had all night, but stayed otherwise inert.  Tears formed in the vixen's eyes.  \u201cI must look like a fool...\u201d she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Maria!</i>\u201d  James dropped the spoon and rushed to the vixen's side to comfort her.  \u201cMaria, it's okay, sweetheart...  Everything is alright...\u201d  He threw his arms around Maria and nuzzled her cheek.  \u201cMaria, please don't cry...  There's nothing to be upset about...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're...  You're right, James.  You're absolutely right.  I'm...  I'm sorry.\u201d  She sniffled as she laid her face on James's shoulder.  \u201cI'm so sorry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's nothing to be sorry about, Maria.  Nothing at all.  <i>I'm</i> sorry that I made you cry...\u201d  James took the vixen's paw in his own, smiling.  Maria returned his smile, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, feeling better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah.  I...  I don't know what happened.  I was...  I was worried.\u201d  The vixen held her rings aloft as if to emphasize the source of her worry.  \u201cI swear, the ruby...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sapphire ring, which had been quiet all this time, flashed twice.  The two foxes froze as their eyes focused on the blue stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames!  The sapphire..!\u201d Maria said.  \u201cDid you see that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...  I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared in silence at the sapphire before James spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're...  They're probably enchanted, I guess.  I'll have to look at them tomorrow.\u201d  Maria simply nodded in return.  \u201cIn the meantime, you should probably take them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...  I...\u201d  Maria gave the rings one last appraisal.  She didn't <i>want</i> to take them off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026  But she wasn't a hobbit.  She knew it was the best thing she could do, and complied shortly, placing the rings back into their boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen's stomach growled, bringing her attention to a hunger that had been silently building over the \u201cordeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...  Is dinner ready yet?\u201d she said quietly as she smiled weakly at James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it's almost ready.  Just a few more moments.\u201d  He rose from the loveseat, pulling Maria up with him and gently leading her toward the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll you need to do is sit down.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>James pulled out a seat for Maria, which the vixen wasted no time in filling.  It had been a full day, and she was eager for a proper, home-cooked dinner.  She waited patiently as James began to set the table, some of the loot from today's haul finding its way into the dining room.  He set to work draping the pink tablecloth over the dark oaken table, tugging it at its ends to relieve it of any wrinkles, and fetched two sets of the pilfered silverware.  He placed one fork, knife and spoon in front of the waiting vixen, and beside her place at the table he set more cutlery; presumably for himself.  He disappeared into the kitchen for a moment, and reappeared with a couple of empty plates which he set between the silverware.  Disappearing a second time, he returned with a candlestick and accompanying candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it would be nice to dine by candlelight, hm?\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that sounds nice...\" Maria answered flatly.  While she certainly wouldn't mind eating dinner by candlelight, she was frankly more concerned with eating dinner at all to care about the lighting situation.  She smiled sheepishly at James as her stomach rumbled.  He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dear, it's coming...\"  He plopped the pewter candlestick at the edge of the table, slid the candle into place, and with a flick of the wrist and a snap of his fingers beside the wick, a small flame had been called forth to cast its light.  The fox left without a word as the vixen looked on intently, hoping he would come back with what she so desperately desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hopes were answered moments later as James returned with one of the largest roasted chickens she'd ever seen, golden-brown and steaming, held aloft on a silver platter with a carving knife through its breast like Excalibur in the stone.  The fox placed it mere inches from Maria's plate, watching with amusement as the vixen became transfixed on the bird before her.  He left her with the meal's main course and returned to the kitchen, retrieving a bowl of mashed potatoes and a loaf of bread, and brought it back to the dimly-lit dining room to find the vixen already pulling away a drumstick from the chicken.  James shot her a playful \"disapproving\" glare and the vixen shrank back into her seat as he tutted.  \"Now, now, Maria...  Where are your manners?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I left them by the fireplace with my armor and sword...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's alright, dear; you needn't wait any longer.\"  James placed the rest of the meal beside the chicken and set to work freeing the chicken leg the vixen had already started on from its meaty prison.  With a bit of knifework and a tug, it came loose, and the reynard gingerly placed it on the vixen's plate.  A little more knifework yielded a thigh; without needing to be asked, it too, was placed on Maria's plate.  A heaping spoonful of mashed potatoes soon joined the meat, with a couple of slices from the loaf of bread rounding out the ensemble.  The vixen salivated, staring at her plate like she'd not eaten in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, dig in.  I wouldn't want to keep you waiting any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, not needing to be told twice, immediately picked up the drumstick and bit into it.  It was incredibly fatty; perhaps the fattiest chicken she'd ever eaten...  And yet, absolutely delicious.  The copious fat complemented the meat, melding together to make each bite rich and moist.  The vixen even noted a certain sweetness about the flesh; odd, but not unwelcome.  In only a minute flat, she was left gripping a greasy bone.  She set upon the chicken's thigh, next; also incredibly fatty, also very delicious.  She deigned to use her fork and knife for this bit of meat, taking one in each paw and quickly sawing the thigh apart, shoveling each bit of chicken into her eager maw as it was liberated.  Soon, she was left with yet another bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, this is wonderful chi- James?\"  Maria looked up to find herself alone in the dining room; the reynard was neither serving nor seated next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Maria?\"  James called from the kitchen.  He appeared a moment later gripping a pair of goblets and a bottle of wine.  \"Sorry; I'd just realized I'd forgotten our beverages.\"  He set one pewter goblet beside the vixen and immediately began filling it, the wine bottle having been uncorked in the kitchen.  He sauntered over to his own seat and did the same for his place, finally sitting down in front of his own plate, which he'd filled before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" he sighed, lifting his goblet to his lips and taking a sip.  The vixen figured she should follow suit, and did so.  The wine was very mild; not necessarily the best she'd had, but it did its job just fine, washing down the meat and warming her chest a bit as it slid down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, James,\" she said quietly as she placed her goblet back down on the table.  \"The chicken was good, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames picked up his own chicken thigh and bit into it.  \"Hmm.  A bit fatty,\" he stated, as he made the same discovery the vixen had only minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bit...  Where did that chicken come from, by the way?  I've never seen one so large.\"  The vixen hoped she might start up a bit of dinner conversation; although she'd rather be eating than talking, it seemed just plain wrong to allow silence between the two foxes who'd become romantically involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Silverhorne, apparently.  I picked it up at the market when I bought my crystals.  The merchant practically gave it away, too; I only paid a couple silver for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  He seemed like a jolly fellow; looked like one, too.  Silverhorne must be doing well to produce chickens and merchants like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some more, Maria?  Your plate is empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked down; apparently, it <i>was</i> empty.  She'd devoured her serving without having noticed.  \"Sure, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reynard carved a generous slab of meat from the chicken and placed it on her plate, which Maria immediately set upon as James returned to his seat.  He looked on in interest as the vixen began sawing off bits of flesh and popping them into her mouth...  Before she lost patience and just picked up the entire slab of chicken in both paws, bringing it to her face and ravenously tearing away a hunk with her teeth.  She chewed, swallowed, and went back for another hunks...  She immediately halted, though, as she realized she was being watched.  Her face flushed as she gingerly placed the meat back on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-  Uh...  I was-\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine!  It's fine, it's fine.  You're hungry, and it's just the two of us, after all.  Please, continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked back down at her plate in shame as she picked up her silverware again to resume eating.  <i>What on earth had gotten into her?  She'd NEVER do something like that!..  Not in front of a date, anyway...</i>  She slowly began cutting up her piece of chicken as she stammered out some awkward dinner conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...  Um, James.  How did you get-  Oh, James, I'm sorry.  That was so rude, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfectly fine, Maria.  I'm not upset, and I want you to eat your fill however you please,\" James interrupted.  \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  The vixen brought her slab of chicken back to her muzzle as she eyed James cautiously.  \"If...  If you're sure...\"  She resumed eating like a wild animal, meat disappearing down her throat at an alarming pace, only sparing the bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames simply smiled, getting up to carve Maria another generous portion before returning to his seat to watch the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette5.png\" alt=\"*Vignette5*\" title=\"Vignette5\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for dinner, James...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite welcome, Maria...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes found the pair still sitting at the table with a pile of bones, an empty bowl and a loaf of bread which had vanished between then and now, with only the wine having survived the vixen's glut.  James loving stroked the vixen's taut, distended belly, her nightgown lifted to expose it as the vixen leaned back in her chair, utterly satisfied.  She was positively stuffed, fuller than she'd been in <i>years</i>.  She placed her own paw on the white-furred dome, a bit shocked to feel the damage she'd done...  But all she could do was coo as the reynard beside her tenderly kneaded and rubbed her gut, relieving her of any discomfort and pressure she may have otherwise felt.  As she drowsily lounged, James got up to clear the table, taking all of the debris and utensils into the kitchen as Maria began rubbing her own gut.  The reynard returned to gently lift the vixen from her seat, guiding her out of the dining room after snuffing the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, James...\" Maria said lazily.  \"I...  I think I got grease on my nightgown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, easy come, easy go, aye?\" James answered.  \"I'll see what I can do about it tomorrow.  Besides:  Didn't you say you preferred to sleep in the nude?\"  The reynard's eyes widened as easily the most forward thing he'd said to Maria within the single day he'd known her escaped his lips.  \"I, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria only giggled as James fumbled to walk himself back from an even-slightly-sexual remark.  \"James.  <i>Shhhh,</i>\" she said, with a wry smile.  The two foxes continued through the living room and toward the stairwell, making their way upstairs...</span></div></div>",

I'm so full,\" Maria slurred to the fox gripping her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dear,\" James said.  \"Just a few more steps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair arrived at the landing only moments later, true to the reynard's words.  A sparse, relatively-narrow hallway greeted the two; only a few doorways and a small, empty bookshelf against the end wall calling it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...  This is the upstairs,\" James stated plainly.  \"On the left, there, is my bedroom...  The door beyond it is my study...  And on the right is the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bathroom..?  You've got a bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen a bathroom outside of a noble's manor, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm no nobleman, but...  I had the means to build one, and truth be told, it's absolutely worth it not to have to wash in the freezing creek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be quite the hassle to bring warm water up from the kitchen, though,\" Maria said flatly.  She darted forward to peek into the room in question, pushing the door open to reveal the chamber within.  At first glance, it didn't seem like anything <i>too</i> fancy.  It was a room with the same plastered walls as the rest of the house, only with a gray-tiled floor.  At the back of the room was moderately-sized stone basin built into the floor, with a spout above it and a drain on the bottom with a primitive stopper wedged firmly into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <i>would</i> be,\" James said, beaming with an ever-so-slight pride, \"...  But I don't really need to worry about that.\"  He took the vixen's paw as he gently led her into the room with him.  He pointed to a small red crystal lodged in the metal spout.  \"Like the oven downstairs, I've got a small crystal here to heat the water as it comes out.  And I've got this spout feeding from an aquifer below us.  The drain leads out into the river-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  But you're telling me you've got hot, running water on command?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James...  That's amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that is pretty impressive for a hermit...\" the reynard said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"</span></div></div>",

And I could probably use a good soak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't see why not...\" said James.  The reynard waved his paw over the small red crystal embedded in the metal spout before turning the handle above it.  The wall behind it rumbled, and seconds later the water came pouring out, ever-so-slowly filling the basin below.  \"You might want to dip your paw before you jump in...  Make sure it's not too hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen did as she was told, plopping herself down to sit at the edge of the basin and swinging her legs in.  \"Ooof...\" she muttered as the slight impact jostled her over-full stomach.  As soon as her toes hit the water, though, all discomfort was forgotten.  A pleasant tingle ran up her spine as the wonderful warmth worked its magic.  Deeming the bathwater to be just fine, she peeled off her grease-stained nightgown and tossed it by the door, where it would soon be joined by her cotton bra.  Free from her clothing, she slid into the basin to immerse as much of her body as she could in the rising water.  It would only come up past her groin at this point, lapping at the underside of her gut as she sat...  But that was just enough to elicit a small moan from the vixen as her eyes rolled back for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh, James...  This is <i>wonderful...</i>\" she sighed.  \"...  Aren't you going to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, well...  Are you sure?\" the reynard said bashfully.  \"I mean...  I wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James...  You've already seen me naked; I think we're beyond that.  Come join me.\"  The vixen patted the floor by the basin's edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist, Maria.\"  The fox began disrobing, first pulling off his tunic, and then his leggings, revealing his bare fur underneath; it would seem he had the same disdain for underwear as the vixen, leaving his genitals to hang free.  Before hopping in with Maria, he took care to fold his clothes and put them beside the vixen's, as well as grabbing a few supplies:  A ladle, a cloth, and a bar of soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Maria before him, he sat at the edge of the basin to test the waters.  It was just a bit too warm for his tastes, but he didn't feel any need to change it as long as the vixen was enjoying it.  Moments later, he slid himself into the water, submerging himself past his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, isn't that nice?\" the vixen said as she pulled the fox over to her.  She draped one arm over his shoulder, while the other set to work massaging her swollen gut.  \"You...  Me...  Naked as the day we were born...  Sitting together in a bath.\"  The vixen sighed, contented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" James stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, James...  Lighten up.  I <i>want</i> you here.  Why so uncomfortable?\"  The vixen playfully splashed her new-found mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I don't know.  It feels like I'm in a dream; like this isn't real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welllllll...  How do I <i>make</i> it real?\"  The vixen grinned as her paw darted beneath the water's surface.  \"You know, James...  All night, you've taken care of me...  I don't think I've properly returned the favor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, uh...  You killed that ogre...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was <i>business</i>, James...

Every passing second melted away his nervous disposition. His stray hand reached for her chest and grabbed her supple breast. A wry smile crossed Maria's lips as her actions spurred the intended effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I've something to work with.\" Maria cooed. She wrapped skilled fingers around his shaft and demonstrated her warrior arm's firm grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames only gasped in reply. The water rippled and quivered at the pump of her arm. It started slow, gentle. She tugged the foreskin back and forth over the bulb. Until his member swelled thick enough to pull the skin taught on its own. His hands clumsily fumbled over her body in an attempt to test the limits of his reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpine realized he could not have his cake and eat it too, at this angle at least. James slumped back, his aching arms gripped at the lips of the basin and his lower body presented itself in full to the warrior vixen. Maria's arm worked faster now -- no longer content to hold back. James grunted between clenched teeth, louder and louder with every pump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTension rippled the flesh in his thighs; his calves tightened solid. A mounting pleasure filled his loins,  Maria felt the throb and aches of his member in her capable paws. Almost there, she thought.  A staggering combination of pleasure and  pain seared the entirety of his lower body.A choked growl forced its way from James' maw and his body seized. Pleasure exploded within his loins, his limbs went limp. Milky flotsam pooled between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods, that's why they call it the 'little death.'\" James said, his speech slurred in his orgasm. \"I'm in heaven, if only for a moment longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria rubbed her sore forearm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You act like you've never been touched there.\" Maria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by anyone else at least.\" James felt his face flush. \"I've always scratched my own itch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria chortled and stood from the water. The lukewarm air proved colder than she anticipated, and sent shivers up and down her spine. She wrapped her arms around her bare breasts. James pulled the stopper to the drain and relished his climax for a little moment longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'll find you something to wrap up in.\" James grunted to himself as he stood from the stone basin. He stumbled a bit towards a neat folded pile of flat woven cloth.  He took one from the top of the pile and tossed it to Maria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded in appreciation and began to towel off her soaked fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you never hooked up with anyone in your travels?\" Maria broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one.\" James nodded. \"In my earlier adventuring days I focused too much on practicing my magecraft and these days, well, I'll just say you're the first attractive person that's wandered my way in a long time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ogres don't cut it for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lack of hygiene and homicidal tendencies are a bit of a turn off, I must admit.\" James said. \"It's so odd, I barely know you and yet I do not fear opening up to you at all. Either living out here so long has addled my mind, or...it's something else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpine walked over to Maria. By now, she wrapped the cloth around her naked body. James' stood before her, not even bothered to cover up. He reached for her cheek, and paused. Even now he felt odd pushing these feelings on her. She did not outwardly mind, so why should he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames' hesitated a second longer, then caved to impulse. He ran his fingers through the thick fur on her cheek and touched his muzzle to hers. Maria hummed in content and nuzzled him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I'm just as addled. Living the life of a transient is the opposite extreme of a hermit and comes with just as much baggage.\" Maria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I suppose we're both the same kind of crazy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, crazy together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxes locked lips and held each other close. James loosed her towel, then pressed against her body. Her body felt softer than the warrior's build he expected. Though it might just be a trick of her fur. His mind glossed over the thought in lieu of more pressing matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom would not come to him after all.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/books3.png\" alt=\"*Books3*\" title=\"Books3\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria awakes alone in James' bed after a long night together. She discovers him in his study examining one of the books they looted from the ogre. She peeks over his shoulder, and what does she see?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Neophyte Lipomancy:</u> The book serves as an introduction into the practice of lipomancy: an special offshoot from the forbidden school of biomancy. An excerpt:</i> <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><div class=\"bquote\">\"...The first law of biomancy dictates that all living beings consist of complex arrangements of Elementia. Therefore, one must have a healthy knowledge of Elementia Manipulation (colloquially referred to as 'magic') in order to grasp even the most basic spell in biomancy. The same applies to lipomancy. The key difference between these schools of thought, however, lies in the manipulation of the energy. Lipomancy is the art of successfully transferring Elementia from one being to another. Elementia in its raw form can destroy its host if transferred without any forethought...the astute mage will notice that Elementia transfers naturally all the time, and the excess is stored as fat...body-fat absorbs raw Elementia just as easily...allowing a lipomancer to ascend his thinner peers in sheer magical power through size alone...  </div> </font></span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Gifts of Hedonia:</u> A scholar's research on the goddess of indulgence and excess: patron to all lipomancers. An excerpt:</i><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><div class=\"bquote\"><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">...the great dragoness, like her mortal kin, is attracted to treasure. Priceless gems, hordes of gold, and the like are necessary in the summoning of her. To begin the summoning ritual one must feast in the name of Hedonia before her altar. The feast must consist of enough meals to feed four people twice over, and one must devour the feast on their own. Once one has earned her attention through indulgence, the treasure must be presented. If she is appeased, then one will receive a gift from her divine horde. These artifacts have come in many forms, with various documented effects. One case involved a brooch that caused an individual's gradual transformation into a dragon, another involved a crown that summoned endless feasts and a bottomless appetite to match...\"</font></div></span></span></div></div>",

Maria and James turned around, and beholded a tall figure on the bottom of the hillside. From his rippeling muscles, boiled leather vest and pants, and large warhammer Maria could easely determine that this being was indeed one thing- a barbarian wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tail swished and swashed behind him as he marched up the hillside, warhammer shimmering in the sunlight. He had evil smurk on his face and a blood-thurst in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames yelp and hid behind Maria, shivering in fear. 'This must be the intruder,' Maria thought, studying the wolf in all his seven foot glory,'no wonder he was hiding; the wolf is truely a formiddable foe.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoldly, Maria plucked out James' dagger and pionted to the wolf. The barbarian stoped, looked at the weapon, and hooted in laughter. Realising how silly she looked, Maria - much to the male fox's offens - threw the dagger aside and pulled out her own long sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, put away that tooth pick,\" the wolf said. But Maria wasn't in any way frightened by the barbarian. She pionted the sword devieantly towards the barbarian, saying sternly,\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, a brave one, I see. If you must know, my name is Kovan,\" the wolf known as Kovan said, hailling his large warhammer from his back. \"What do you want from us?\" Maria said, getting herself ready if the wolf attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much, just to drive you and your boyfriend, mate, brother, or who ever he is, from this land,\" Kovan said, grinning. \"And what gives you the right to do that?\" James asked, creeping out from behind Maria. The wolf smirk. \"The ruler of these lands,\" Kovan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was confused. \"Ruler? But these lands are free forests,\" Maria said, lowering her sword a little. \"You don't get it, do you?\" Kovan growled,\"this area belongs to us wolves now. Either you leave or face the wrath of my hammer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria went back into her gaurd stance, pionting the sword in Kovan's direction. \"Then bring your wrath of your hammer then,\" Maria said boldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very unwise chioce, fox,\" the wolf said.</span></div></div>",

But luckily, like stereotyping would have it, the barbarian wolf was slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria easily avoided his crushing blow, which send grass and dirt flying everywhere. From the corner of her she saw James running down the hill like the wind, like the coward he was; but Maria didn't expect him to help her in this fight. She was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dodged yet again as he came up with a anger-fueled side swipe. \"Stand still!\" he barked, frustrated. But Maria was trying to get around the brute, to reach his back and drive her sword into it. If only she had a spear; the stabbing would have been much more easier then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was finally able to catch him unaware and delever a swip with her long short at his upper leg. It went deep, but the wolf only grunted with pain. It would take much more than that to bring him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria danced with the barbariqn down the hill, avoiding his crushing blows with ease. He began to breath heavily; Kovan was getting tired, a good sign for Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis swipes were even more slower than before, as was his movement, and the fox finally reached his unprotected back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove her sword forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf this time howled in pain and lost his footing, falling to his knees, his hamner falling out of his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was her chance to finish him, to drive her sword through hid back and straight into his heart, but his neck was unprotected, though, and Maria thought to herself: \"Why kill him like that when I could make the victory more fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her blow in a splite-second to his neck and brought down her sword. But little did Maria know that this, if he was lucky enough, was what Kovan wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the blow was only inches away, the wolf's right paw, which was covered in a steel glove, lashed out and caught Maria's sword with a loud KLANG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox stood dumbfounded. The sword did go through the glove and cut the paw underneath, but it was not very deep. Kovan ripped the sword away and, while the fox was still flabbergasted, he dealt a blow with his other paw to the side of Maria's head. She never felt it, but she felt its after effects very well: the world spinning, slowly beinf swallowed up by darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she completely lost her consciousness, she saw Kovan's bloody paw reachinf out to her, a almost menacing grin on his face.</span></div></div>",

When she opened her eyes, she saw that the world was nothing more but a blurry haze of strange colors and indescribable shapes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked a few times, bringing the world into view, and discovered that she was laying in a bed, staring up at a dark sealing covered in cobwebs of all sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was she? Why didn't the brute known as Kovan kill her when he had the chance? All she could remember was his menacing smile, his hand reaching out towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria heard the door of the room swing open, and through it came strutting a robust wolfess, carrying a crate full of what looked like medical supplies. From the way she was dressed, Maria could easily tell that she was a warrior: she wore padded leather, a plate of armor strapped to it here and there, and a razor-sharp dagger hung at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, your awake,\" she said when she saw the fox staring at her. She had a stern but, strangely, motherly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" Maria managed to ask weakly, her voice harsh from disuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't speak,\" the wolf said, pulling out a vile from the crate. It was filled with thick white liquid. \"Drink this,\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria hesitated but drank it, tasting herbs with a hint of alcohol. The pain in the fox's head evaporated into a dull throb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are you?\" Maria tried again, her head much more clearer now, putting more force into the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,\" she began, \"am Jeanette; one of the soldiers and healers of Lord Murray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Murray?\" Maria asked, not familiar with the name. She had heard of many small lords that govern their small folk around the forest, but this one was completely new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's how he likes to style himself these days. He's actually our clan's chef,\" Jeanette explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's eyes examined the room, noting how abandoned it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" she asked, throwing the covers away and standing up from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, this?\" she custard with her paw, \"This was supposed to be a castle, but we couldn't restore it back to its former glory. We were at least able to turn it in to a stronghold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would your clan need a strong-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was cut off in mid-sentence when a gang - for the were too disorganized to be called a group - of wolves came barging in, spears in their paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here for the fox,\" what looked like the leader of the gang said, \"Lord Murray wants to have a word with her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was marched down a hallway, her paws bounded by thick rope, guards flanking her in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into a large room that most likely served as a throne room, and on a simple chair sat a fierce-looking wolf, watching Maria with mild interest. He, like the rest, wore thick leathers, but had much more armor covering him, and an eyepatch covered his left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him stood Kovan, grinning, his body and upper leg wrapped with bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Lord Murray demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no sense of rebelling, so Maria had no choice but to give her identity away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Murray studied her for a moment. \"And why do you reject submission from your Lord's men?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was talking about the fight she had with Kovan, Maria knew. Even from behind Lord Murray she could see the brute smiling even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These lands have no lord that govern it; there free forests,\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until now,\" Lord Murray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKovan cleared his throat. \"My Lord,\" he said, \"We must still discuss a proper punishment for her behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Murray shot him an impatient look. \"What? For giving you a boo boo?\" he said, his voice thick with mockery, \"You've survived worse than this, you bafoon. She did not know, and a punishment isn't necessarily then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette gave a snort in amusement, and a few chuckles went up in the court. Kovan took a few steps back, stunned. His pride had suffered a gut-punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you,\" Lord Murray said, turning his attention back to Maria, casting her a menacing smile that looked very similar to Kovan's, \"We can't have you running around warning everyone about what's going on. We still need to take this forest unaware. So, we will hold you here till further notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria felt her heart sank, but she did not protest, allowing herself to be taken away by the guards.</span></div></div>",

Never in all her life did she expect to be locked up in a tower like some helpless, fragile, innocent, pretty maiden, waiting for her night in signing armor to rescue her. A smelly, slimy dungeon was sounding better right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was surprisingly well furnished, even though it was still basic: there was a steel bed with a actual feather mattress on it, a desk for writing with its own chair, a wardrobe, though, it was completely empty, and even its own privy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it still had a neglected look to it: dust covered the surfaces, a few spiderwebs stood in the corners with their eight-legged creators standing idly in the center, waiting patently for their next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was pushed almost gently inside by one of her escorts, and, as expected, the heavy wooden door swung shut and was locked from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox attempted to inhale deeply to exhale as a sigh, but she nearly choked on the stuffy air. There was one small window just above the bed that could be opened, which, surprisingly, had no iron bars to speak of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bizarre for Maria; why would they leave window so unprotected? Did they want her or any other prisoner to escape? All her questions were answered when she opened it for they first time and peered outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sheer drop of hundreds of feet, leading to a small courtyard bellow. The stones, for some reason, were far too smooth for a climb, and even if she had the help of some sort of climbing gear, she would never risk such a deadly feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria hated to admit it but she had a fear of heights. Even now her heart was speeding up in her chest and her palms were beginning to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, the fox sat down on her bed, waiting, like the spiders, for something to happen. And she waited and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours turned to days. Food was brought to Maria a few times per day by male and female wolves alike. She tried her best to grab their attention, begging them to tell her of any news or to send a message to their chief, but her efforts were all for naught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only greeted her with expressionless faces, not even uttering a grunt or gesturing with a nod. She had half the mind at a certain point to grab one of her \"servants\" and force them to do what she asked, but Maria knew such an action would be disastrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't those bony, small, weak, dimwitted servants you saw at any ordinary castles; they strong, tall, clever wolves that had seen some hard times on the fields of battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chances were greater that they would overpower her in a split-second if she even dared to make a threatening move towards them. Even if she did accomplish such a deed, there was still the chance that they might cry out, alerting the guards outside, who had weapons and could end her in a moment, for they did not need her. She was just another mouth to feed in the stronghold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! It was better to be safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria kept count of the days by scratching lines on the grey stones by using her claws, and on the sixth day of her imprisonment she received a visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who was it?</span></div></div>",

For a few moments a strange madness took a hold of her, a madness of a prisoner kept isolated far too long in his cell, craving for the outside world, for freedom, but the fox conquered it before she did anything stupid; it would take a lot more than that to make her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not some random wolf bringing Maria her morning bread (though, she wished it was, for she felt rather famished), but it was one of the guards that stood post outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, fox, you got a visitor,\" he told Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow who could that possibly be? She only knew two beings in this castle at some level, and the good spirits forbid that it should be Kovan. Maria swore that she would claw his eyes out if he dared come all this way to bully or mock her. She didn't care if she had no weapon to speak of, or if there was guards to subdue her, or if the attempt of assault would only lead to her death in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, when the wolf stepped aside, allowing the visitor to enter, Maria saw that she was lucky today: it wasn't the brute but Jeanette. The fox was delighted by the sight of the sturdy wolf, feeling that her life got so much better, but she was surprised at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeanette?\" Maria began, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, I just came here for a talk, that's all,\" she answered, smiling, but she wasn't looking the fox; instead, her gaze was focused on the guard, who was closing the door behind him and locking it for safety reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria frowned: someone keeping her company in her lonely hours would be nice, but it was a little out of character for a wolfess like her to visit for idle chatting. Something told her that she was here for more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suspicion proved correct ones they were alone, for Jeanette's expression shifted, becoming serious with a hint of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" the wolf began, taking a seat next to Maria on the bed, \"You're probably wondering why I'm here, and you probably figured out a long time ago that I'm not here for idle talk. Hell, I'm not even supposed to be up here! Murray's got a lot more bossy lately, and he's threatening to hang every second wolf he sees for treason, so I'm risking my own tail for this. I had to bribe the guards a handsome amount of cash to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you guys are on tough times,\" Maria concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Jeanette confirmed, \"And things are reaching boiling point ever since the chief sided with a powerful sorcerer to help him with his campaign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorcerer?\" Maria asked, growing both concerned and interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople who had skills in real magic was both feared and a little shunned from society. So, it was odd that a bunch of barbarian wolves, which was a rather superstitious lot, would ask help from something they would avoid like a epidemic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jeanette said, \"He calls himself the Lipomancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd name,\" Maria said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is the least of our problems,\" Jeanette said, \"Ever since he arrived three days ago there have been conflict going on inside the clan. Now, I know that our kind can be...well, barbaric at times, but I promise you we're not without honor. This whole using magic thing to take over the forest isn't what we do! If we go to war, we want to do it fair and square! No tricks, no sorcery. It's not fair using magic in a battle. Even for an enemy that's harsh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded in agreement, for magic was a unfair tool to use in war. The fox had seen its destructive power in the fields of combat: it could kill platoons in seconds, poison armies, rendering them useless, and make Generals mysteriously die, turning the tides of the event completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a feeling that there was some sort of conspiracy going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once again her suspicion proved correct when Jeanette said the following: \"Okay, let me get to the chase,\" she said, before dropping her voice to a whisper, \"I'm planning a mutiny, and I want you to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bomb Jeanette dropped was pretty big, leaving Maria absolutely speechless. Like being locked up in a tower, she never expected in all her life to get in tangled in some political game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question was: would she except!</span></div></div>",

Even though the fox despised getting herself caught up in some political game (hell, she was a sword-for-hire), she knew she had to do this to get out of this tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" Maria said, breaking free from being dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette smiled. \"Good,\" she said, \"We'll come to free you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and walked towards the door, but before she left, Maria could not help but ask: \"Hey, Jeanette, why did you ask me for help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain that in due time,\" answered Jeanette, \"But right now I need to leave before someone catches me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, she rapped on the door a few times, saying: \"Oi, Torus, I'm ready to come out now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few moments of silence before the lock was being tampered with, and then the door opened. With one final wink to Maria, Jeanette closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason the fox found that waiting these few hours for night to fall was more agonizing than all her days here combined. When dusk finally arrived, Maria was laying on her bed, staring at the roof, waiting patiently for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then something did happen: Maria heard one of the guards shouting, \"Halt! Who goes there?\", the ringing of steel sliding out of a scabbard, cries of alarm, the clash of weaponry, screams of pain, bodies hitting the floor, and then everything went quiet for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was that jingling of keys again, the door opened, and Jeanette entered, dressed in armor with two swords hanging on her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Maria cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grinned. \"Impatient, aren't you?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isolation and boredom can make you a little Impatient,\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette began to fidget on one of her swords and pulled it free. \"Your gonna need this,\" she said, handing Maria the weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Maria said, taking the short sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lifeless bodies of the guards were laying on the staircase outside. Ones face was smashed in, and another had serious cuts and deep stab wounds. Being the warrior that she was, the sight wasn't new to Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did all of this?\" Maria asked, nudging one of the dead bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it to that one,\" said Jeanette, pointing to the body with cuts, \"Frisky little bugger that one was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, and who helped you?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him,\" she answered simply, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked towards the source she was pointing to and saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

But it was well-polished, for there was no rust and it gleamed in the moonlight that streamed through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis was holding his enormous hammer in both hands, the slab of iron smeared with blood, which without a doubt belonged to the poor guard that had his face smashed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked bored at first, killing and rescuing not being a new thing to him, but when his eyes met Maria's his muzzle curled up in disgust, grunting, turning his gaze quickly away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone ready?\" Jeanette asked, though it was rhetorical, not waiting for anyone to answer it before she said, \"Let's go then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved down the spiral staircase, Kovan at the back, Maria in the middle, and Jeanette at the front, leading this small party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made there way down, the fox asked: \"So, what do you need me for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like this was the most appropriate time to ask, for the rebellion was starting and Maria had not the faintest clue what part she played in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're planning to take two birds down with one stone,\" said Jeanette when they arrived at a long hallway at the bottom of the staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned right and continued: \"The Lipomancer himself arrived two days ago, to have a little chat with our chief, most likely came to discuss when to attack and take over the area. His arrival kinda put the whole rebellion in jeopardy. We need to weaken the wizard, and you are the one going to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!?\" Maria cried, shocked, grabbing Jeanette's shoulder and pulling their advances to a halt, much the Kovan's displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf growled, muttering something inaudible, most likely something offensive, but Maria didn't care about him. The idea of confronting a wizard, a being of immense power, terrified her, even more than heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell the hell am I going to do that!\" Maria cried. \"I can't go up against a wizard; that's madness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all,\" Jeanette said, frowning, frustration evident in her voice, \"Keep your voice down; someone will hear you. Secondly: I'm not sending face-to-face against the Lipomancer; that is madness, but I want you to sneak into his room and steal his staff while I assemble the rebellion. You do know what happens if a wizard loses his staff, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded. According to the basic lore, a wizard's staff is his greatest weapon. The most powerful spells was conjured from there. Take it away and he would be left with his much weaker spells, leveling the playing field. Maria now understood what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the fox said, growing determined, \"Tell me where he is staying at and I'll sneak in and get the staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeanette quickly explained to her, and after that they proceeded, coming across a T-section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take right, and you'll get to were you should go,\" informed Jeanette, \"We'll go left and assemble the army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded and they part ways.</span></div></div>",

Maria heard strange moaning sounds next to her, and when she looked she saw Kovan and Jeanette was stirring next to her, waking up from their unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all of them were finally awaking, rubbing their heads, a familiar voice suddenly spoke: \"Well, they say if you cut off the head of a snake the body would fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Maria identified the speaker as none other than Lord Murray, who was staring at them with a angry scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at the group, his finger moving from person to person he was addressing. \"Kovan, my most powerful warrior, though you always were a little dim and a slippery bastard, and Jeanette, my most skilled healer who has more sense than she truly should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved his finger, pointing at Maria now. \"And you! I don't have much to say to you, fox, except that I should have killed you when I had the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traitors, all of you!\" he yelled, \"I should hang you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but h-how did you know!\" Jeanette blurted out, her confidence and bravery she had earlier dropping, being replaced by fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't,\" came a voice, \"But I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the raised platform emerged a human, dressed in a long, red robe, a staff in his right hand. Even in his clothing that was designed to show little as possible of his figure, Maria knew from his bony hands and forearms that he was a thin man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had short, red hair and a pointy beard and mustache, giving his face sharp features. He was somewhere in his late twenties, but his chocolate brown eyes told that he had a great amount of wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be the Lipomancer,\" Maria concluded, thinking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was suspicious about you the day I arrived here,\" he said, talking to Jeanette. \"Lord Murray here said that I was just being paranoid, but I had a hunch that you were planning something, something that would ruin this whole entire take over of the region. So, I decided to spy on you, following your every movement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that was how I discovered your plot,\" said Lord Murray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said the wizard, \"We were just waiting for the right moment to strike, which was tonight. Though, I must admit that Murray's judgment here is a little harsh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" exclaimed the chief, looking at him with surprise and a hint of outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said the wizard, \"You heard me. You said so yourself that they are good warriors and helpers, and it would be such a waste to kill them. Instead, why don't you just punish them, discipline them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sounds like a great idea,\" said Lord Murray, a sinister grin growing on his face, \"I will break their bones, skin them and make a pair of good gloves, I will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was cut off when the Lipomancer spoke. \"Slow down there, my lord!\" he said, holding up his hand, \"If you want to punish someone you don't need to make it so brutal. You need to be...creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said the chief, calming down, sitting back on his wooden throne, \"What do you have in mind?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" he said, \"I propose a game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Kovan finally broke his silence. \"I'm not playing any games, you walking stick,\" he growled, \"Why don't we challenge each other to single combat, and allow the good spirits to allow who's innocent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria could tell that the Lipomancer was not pleased by the wolf's insult and suggestion, for he snapped his finger. Kovan's snarling muzzle suddenly closed shut, and he frantically touched, perhaps trying to pry it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbass,\" thought Maria, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard continued, unhindered this time: \"Each of you would use your special characteristic to win it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at the three, naming them. \"Strength.\" He pointed to Kovan, who was still trying to open his muzzle, his effort fruitless. \"Wit.\" He pointed at Jeanette. \"And stealth.\" He finished, pointing at Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even the fox?\" asked Lord Murray, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you said \"them\" I thought that you meant all three of them, so, yeah, even the fox,\" said the Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shrugged. \"So be it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" exclaimed the wizard, stepping back, \"Are all ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rhetorical, Maria knew, and nothing she could say or do would stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the games begin,\" he announced, snapping his fingers, and there was a blinding flash of light.</span></div></div>",

She blinked a few times, bringing the world into few...and she saw that it was upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to move but felt a pressure preventing her from doing so. Maria quickly examined herself and saw that she was tied up by thick rope to a tree, her head pointing towards the ground and feet towards the branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head felt as heavy as led due to all the blood rushing to it, causing her head to spin and throb even more painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Maria knew that she could do nothing to her situation, for she had already felt herself, trying to find her hidden dagger, but it was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo take her mind off of her predicament, Maria focused her attention to figure out where she was exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments, due to her uncomfortable position, but she figured it out: she was close to a large river, which flowed out of a huge lake, mountains and lush forest surrounding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not know this place, for she had never traveled further than the mountains which marked the borders of the free forests, meaning that she was quite a long way from were she ones was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting behind the mountains, casting a long shadow over the valley, setting it in the time if dusk even though it was only late in the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria spotted a warhammer and pieces of clothing laying close to a rock, and she knew it was Kovan's, but where could that brute be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was answered when the wolf himself suddenly emerged from the waters of the river. Maria averted her eyes. He was stark naked, water running off his thick arms, pecs, well-toned abs and plumb sheath and dangling scrotum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the shore, Kovan went on all fours and began to shake his body like a dog, sending water droplets flying everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, it would seem that my little prize is awake,\" he said when he noticed Maria, a wide, mocking grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria ignored him, still looking the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he said, faking concern, \"Are you angry that I knocked you out? Head hurting like hell? Sucks to be you! You shouldn't have fought me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maria still didn't say anything, Kovan grunted, pulling his pack, which laid next to his clothing, closer to him, digging inside until he pulled out a roll of white bandages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though, I have to admit that you put up a good fight,\" he said, wrapping the white cloth around the areas where Maria slashed him, silently indicating what he meant. \"It's a rarity when my adversaries survive more than ten seconds against me. You topped twenty seconds! I counted them myself. You make a worthy opponent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had to admit that she swelled a little with pride, but she still remained stoned-faced, finally breaking her silence, still refusing to look at him: \"What do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" the wolf said, wrapping the bandage around his hand, the very hand that caught her sword. \"Just wanna take you to my master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" the fox said, \"Why didn't you just kill me there? You could have spared yourself a lot of trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" said the wolf, \"But if I did that I would not get my prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What prize?\" Maria asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prize my master would give me, of course,\" said Kovan, finishing his last wound and reaching for his clothing. \"He's never had a fox in his service before, and I think he'll enjoy it a lot playing with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out soon enough,\" he said, pulling up his pants, \"But for now it's best that I make camp. It's still quite a distance before we reach our destination, and night falls quick in this valley. So, you better get yourself comfortable against that tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave I sigh.

They weren't moving, and had no discernible reason for being behind a raspberry thicket.  It wasn't old, either; in fact, it looked like it had been installed fairly recently, the components still shiny and free of rust.  Even if it wasn't, it was still being maintained, judging by a generous coating of slick oil.  \"Why are you here?\" she asked.  It didn't answer, of course, being an inanimate object, and Maria, of course, didn't expect an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe circled the mysterious mechanism, hoping to see if she could find its purpose.  A more thorough examination did not yield any insight into its function, but did reveal that at least some of it was underground.  \"Where did it come from..?\"  She sat down next to the gizmo, staring at it intently.  While Maria wasn't a mechanist or engineer, she did have an innate curiosity and appreciation for their craft.  All of the spinning gears and flying chains and bouncing springs fascinated her, capturing her imagination in ways that sorcery could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to understand magic as a non-magician was an exercise in futility:  One could easily see that it was at work, but without years of study or a natural affinity, one could not see <i>how</i> or <i>why</i> it did.  Machines were nothing like that:  One could see that it worked, and with enough patience, <i>would</i> see how if the inner workings were laid bare.  Pulling a lever could set a multitude of objects in motion, as if by magic...  And yet, it was clear that it wasn't magic at all.  And better yet, even <i>Maria</i> could pull that lever, if she wanted to; she'd find no such ease in summoning a ball of flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria reached out and flicked one of the gears, watching as it rotated.  The pistons lazily extended, and the chain set another gear rolling, if only for a quarter of a centimeter.  The orange vixen smiled.  She placed her hand on the second gear and slid across it, getting a bit oily in the process.  It was worth it, though, watching the machine work just a bit faster than it had.  She continued to play with the machine, pulling on the pistons and spinning the gears until she heard a click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  What did I do?\"  She scooted back a bit, thinking she'd broken it.  Instead, however, it sprang to life...  Almost instantly, in fact.  The gears began to whir and hum and the pistons shot up and fell down rapidly;  the machine was a blur of motion.  \"What did I <i>do</i>?\"  She looked on, watching the gizmo in action, still having no idea what the hell it did.  She lowered herself to her knees and elbows, leaning in and getting closer to it, ass in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rustling sounded in the thicket, but Maria didn't hear it; she was paying too much attention to the machine.  A moment later, a sizable party of strange, tiny humanoids emerged, each about as tall as Maria's hind-paws were long, but just a bit taller.  They resembled opossums in body structure and coat, with fur-colors ranging from varying shades of gray, to black, with a few patches of brown thrown in.  Their faces resembled that of a weasel's, apart from their eyes, a piercing red in color with yellow pupils, and two relatively long fangs on either side of their upper jaw.  They didn't have much in the way of clothes, simply wearing brown loincloths with crude breastplates made from tiny bronze discs held together by bits of twine.  They wielded weapons that were somewhat more impressive, though: Their little possum-claws were wrapped around the handles of something resembling tiny harpoon guns, all loaded with toothpick-sized spears.  A smokey-gray one snarled as its eyes darted about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehjum skreek dul ku rahba!\" it hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, Myrkis!  What did I tell you about that 'Black Speech' crap?  The Erpen speak English!  We don't even understand the gibberish you're spouting, and I get the feeling that <i>you</i> don't, either!\" a black one snapped in a somewhat squeaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Rellum...\" Myrkis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright...  Now, what the hell did you think you were saying?\" Rellum asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I said, 'Where is the creature that is tampering with our devices?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two things:  First, that's more words than you even said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Each of the spoken bits can mean more than one word, you know.\"  Rellum shot Myrkis a dull glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  Second, it's right there.\"  Rellum motioned straight ahead, pointing at Maria's swaying backside and full, round hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.  'Ours' sounds pretty good, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does, Rellum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you agree, Myrkis.\"  Rellum nodded.  \"Alright, then.  We march ahead, fire on the beast, and then take our prey home.  Charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party of fourteen erpen advanced on the orange vixen's ample ass, aiming their weapons upward at the center.  Pulling the triggers, they let loose a volley of tiny harpoons...  Most of which harmlessly bouncing off of Maria's leather armor.  A stray harpoon did manage to strike the base of her tail, but did not penetrate whatsoever.  \"I hate bugs...\" the vixen said idly as she waved her hand around her bushy tail, still unaware of the creatures behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, Kalx, your weapons are terrible!\" Rellum growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Rellum,\" a fog-gray one replied.  \"You knew they were supposed to be experimental!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah!  I'll just use my teeth...  You all!  Bind its legs...  Kalx!  Join me.\"  Kalx nodded and followed Rellum up Maria's leggings, scrambling to reach the top as the other twelve threw twine around the vixen's shins, both efforts still unnoticed.  Rellum's endeavor culminated in his arrival atop the vixen's right buttock, managing to stand even with the vixen's swaying.  Kalx fell off on the way up, but a second attempt proved successful, joining Rellum at his perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what?\" Kalx asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we figure out how to get past its armor...  And then we attack!\" Rellum said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalx pointed at the waist of Maria's leggings.  \"How's about we pull that back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinkin', Kalx.\"  The two erpens grabbed the vixen's loose-fitting waistband...</span></div></div>",

Millimeter by millimeter, the vixen's leggings yielded the orange fur underneath.  As the white fur of Maria's inner-thighs and inner-buttocks was revealed, though, they'd run out of room to pull.  However, Rellum and Kalx had exposed more than enough of Maria's flesh; all that was left was to pick a target.  They poked around, a bit, trying to find the softest spot, before deciding on the thickest part of each ass-cheek, right in their centers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRellum took the right 'cheek, dropping to his knees.  He pointed over at the left 'cheek.  Kalx took his cue, positioning himself just as Rellum had on the right.  Rellum held up a claw, raising four of his fingers for a silent countdown.  One lowered, and left three.  Another curled right back into a fist, leaving two.  Yet another fell, leaving one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the \"ground team\" were just finishing their job.  They'd wrapped Maria's shins together with twine, nice and tight.  They were surprised that their quarry had remained as still and \"cooperative\" as it had.  They stepped back and admired their handiwork for a moment, after which they readied another loop of twine for Maria's arms.  Back up top, Rellum's countdown concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last finger lowered, Kalx and Rellum dove into their respective ass-cheeks, piercing the flesh with their sharp teeth.  \"Ow!  Ow!\" Maria cried.  The shock of the attack sent her reeling; she rose up as she grabbed for her stinging buttocks, inadvertently dropping her pants the rest of the way to her ankles and revealing even more of her glorious ass, and fell to her side, where the ground team set to work binding her now-outstretched arms.  Rellum and Kalx retreated from Maria's supple ass, jumping to the ground and watching the others do the rest of the work.  They couldn't help but notice that the vixen's 'cheeks were swelling, a bit, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?  What's goin' on with its ass?\" Rellum asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalx slid his right claw up and down his right fang thoughtfully.  \"If I had to guess, I'd say that it's because we didn't wash our teeth off well enough after eating some of the 'Shrooms...  And you know what they do to other creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense, I guess.\"  Rellum watched the vixen squirm in her bindings as the ground team finished up.  He approached the thrashing Maria's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it speaks!\" Rellum replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better let me go, or I'll throw you half-way across the forest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that's no way to talk to your new owners...  You belong to us, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria belongs to <i>nobody</i>!\"  Maria gnashed her teeth at the gloating Rellum, hoping that that, along with her words, would make her seem bad-ass.  But alas, it did not.  It's hard to look anything but ridiculous when you're tied up with your pants around your ankles.  Rellum chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but she does!  Yes, the...  Er...  Creature...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Vixen</i>.  Female fox...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  Yes, the <i>vixen</i> does!\"  Rellum turned to the rest of the erpens.  \"Now, we pick her up and take her home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't!\"  Maria thrashed in her bindings, but only managed to exhaust herself.  Twine was stronger than she thought, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done?  Good.\"  The erpens positioned themselves on either side of the vixen, thrusting their arms underneath her and lifting her up.  <i>They</i> were stronger than she thought, too.  The erpens marched out of the thicket, snagging some of Maria's clothing on hanging thorns.  After a trip through the thicket and two right turns, the procession approached the wide mouth of a cave.  The light grew dim as they proceeded inside, the only illumination coming from tiny torches on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know what the gears did!\" Maria cried.  \"I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter now, uh...  Uh...  <i>Vixen</i>.  You're ours!\" Rellum replied.  They passed a few erpens as they continued onward, most of which hammering on the walls with pickaxes.  They stopped to gawk at Rellum's latest \"haul,\" but got back to work immediately afterwards.  As they approached the end of the pathway, they were met with a deep shaft with a pulley in the center, as well as a hunched-over black erpen standing next to three relatively-large baskets of purple mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hello, Rellum...\" the erpen said in a hoarse, raspy voice.  \"I see you've made quite the find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, Jykle.  We're gonna take it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Her</i>,\" Maria cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  <i>Her</i> down to the city; we'll figure out what to do with her, there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, excellent!  ...  Say, as long as you're going down, could you take the Liposhrooms with you?  I brought everyone up here lunch, and they just say, 'No, Jykle, we don't want those.'  And I tell 'em, 'Dammit, you'll eat if you're hungry.'  And they say, 'But those are for livestock!'  And I say, 'Well, hell, you're right!'  Anyway, I've got three baskets of Cave-Pig feed...  And I really don't wanna lug 'em back down.  It'd be a waste to leave 'em up here, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Jykle...\" Rellum said.  \"I don't know if we can fit the vixen on the platform <i>and</i> three baskets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout you feed 'em to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then she'd get really heavy.  You know what those things do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but...  Fine.  How about one basket?  Save me <i>some</i> work, please.\"</span></div></div>",

Put the vixen on the platform!  We're goin' down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\" the others cried in unison, marching onto the wooden platform ahead of them.  One pulled on a cord at the side, and the platform began to slowly descend down the shaft, the sound of sliding chains echoing all the while.  For a minute or so, all that Maria could see was stone surrounding her in the darkness, with chains lifting and dropping all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that broke the monotony of her environment were the elevator's \"stops.\"  The first one showed Maria a big, round chamber, with the platform lying in the center.  It branched out into several tunnels, where erpen laborers toiled.  Some were mining, while others carried the the coal and iron ore that they'd found back to the hub.  Still others lingered in the hub, their claws grasping chains that ran from floor to ceiling; the worked the elevator, and waited for Rellum's say-so to continue onward.  The bound orange vixen noted that the area was well-lit; a stark contrast to the dim lighting in the above layer.  Glowing white crystals lined the walls, each roughly two inches from the others beside it.  Rellum nodded, signalling the elevator erpen.  The erpen miners waved at Rellum and his party on the platform as they all descended even lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stop featured more of the same: A mining area, with miners, chains, and crystals.  All that the erpen seemed to find, however, were lumps of tin.  They continued to descend, each of the next three stops revealing more mines:  Copper, silver, and zinc.  The air grew warmer with each passing layer, and more humid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sixth stop revealed a rather unusual sight:  What appeared to be a ranch.  In the enormous chamber, erpen tended to strange, creatures, all of varying pastel colors.  They resembled tiny swine, with their flat, disc-shaped snouts, plump bodies and cloven hooves.  However, they certainly didn't behave like swine.  They seemed to be rooting around the stony floor, but tended to stay rather still.  Once in a while, they'd begin to lick the ground, swelling right before Maria's eyes.  When they finish, an erpen would push them to another spot, where they'd stand, staring blankly ahead.  At the back of the cavern, Maria spotted an even more unusual sight:  In the cavern wall, the erpen had lodged an <i>enormous</i> specimen of the \"Cave-Swine,\" one that was well over 20 times larger than all the rest of them.   All Maria could see of it was its well-fatted buttocks; the other end was on the other side.  As the orange vixen looked onward, a Cave-Swine emerged from between the two 'cheeks and plopped onto the cave floor, where it rolled over onto its hooves and joined the herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Maria started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the Queen, over there...  Not that it concerns you, vixen,\" Rellum said.  \"Why did we stop?  Keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"chain\" erpens obeyed, and the platform plunged back into the darkness, coming down to the seventh stop.  There were plenty of Cave-Swine standing about, albeit huddled together, but this wasn't a ranch.  No, this was a slaughterhouse (or slaughter-cave, whatever).  One by one, the swine were herded behind a wall, where each one would be sliced apart by an erpen with a knife into neat little chunks and piles of fat after getting their head lopped off.  They didn't bleed, surprisingly, nor did they squeal.  On the other side of the chamber were more of the swine, each getting loaded onto an odd machine one at a time, \"sitting.\"  A tube would descend from the device, which an erpen would jam into the swine's mouth.  The same erpen would flick a switch, and the swine would inflate to a ridiculous size, becoming nearly spherical.  It would be rolled over to another machine afterwards, which would puncture the swine's gut and begin to suck out the fat inside.  The swine would squeal continuously as this happened, only stopping when it was completely empty and the machine withdrew.  A dead, \"deflated\" swine would be left over, a pile of wrinkled hide, which would be taken away and placed in a pile to the side.  Maria gulped; she hoped that any of <i>this</i> wasn't what the erpen had in mind for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing the descent, all became dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Rellum shouted.</span></div></div>",

Oh, is that..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach turned as she realized what she was smelling:  The unmistakable stink of a decomposing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no...\"  The vixen kept a paw on her sensitive nose as she took a few cautious steps forward.  Did she even want to keep going?  That's what an adventurer would do, after all.  They'd forge onward, even if it meant seeing and smelling some deeply unpleasant...  But, as Maria would often admit to herself, she wasn't a very good adventurer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut turning back wouldn't do the fox much good.  She'd already spent a day on this road, and she'd spend another simply going back the way she came with no towns or homesteads she could avail herself of for hospitality.  If she was going to find somewhere to rest or eat, it'd be up ahead, and she'd just have to pretend that she was a good adventurer, and forge on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange vixen resumed walking, grim thoughts filling her mind.  <i>Who, or what, met their end nearby?  What grisly end did they meet?..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And what did they leave behind?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few gears began to turn in Maria's head, and a shameful thought arose.  <i>Whatever they left behind, they mustn't need it anymore...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she really thinking that?  That she'd simply loot a corpse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen sighed.  Yes, yes she would.  She had no money, and...  Well, this is simply what adventurers do.  Whether or not there was a...  \"Previous owner\" nearby, they take things that they find in the wilderness for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox gingerly uncurled her paw from her muzzle, and took a cautious whiff, grimacing as the stench filled her nostrils once more.  She could smell it coming from beyond a stand of trees, but couldn't see anything...  But she was fairly close.  She quickly returned her paw to her snout as she took a few careful steps off of the path and into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen or so yards later found her nearing the other side.

The vixen circled around to get a better look at the opossum's head.  A long, white face, dark coloring circling two tightly-closed eyes, a pink nose at the end of a long snout, and sharp teeth visible inside of a closed jaw.  A pair of pink, round ears crested her skull above her eyes, and she saw a small patch of the gray fur she'd assumed covered the rest of the 'possum's body between them.  The 'possum's robe was closed, and she couldn't really tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weapon Maria had spied earlier was now, quite clearly, a knife, lying beneath a black-furred arm ending in a pink-fingered claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the fox, though, that was all she could really see; the opossum didn't seem to have anything on her besides her robe and the knife.  But, as Maria knew, that didn't mean there wasn't anything she could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox began to gingerly pat down the 'possum, hoping to find a small bag or some other concealed storage, but found none.  To her own disdain, she remembered:  Opossum women had pouches...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria grimaced at the thought of actually probing a reeking corpse in search of that pouch and what it <i>might</i> hold, but...  She was already here, she was already thinking about it...  And she did see a small stream nearby she could wash her paws in afterward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen sighed as she knelt down and parted the 'possum's robe to get at her belly.  It was gray, just as she suspected, and more than a little padded.  It wasn't...  Bloated, as she'd expect, which she found more than a little strange.  In fact, as she reluctantly felt-up the body, she didn't notice any visible rot.  Thinking about things made Maria sick, though, so she returned to the task at hand, lifting the belly to find the pouch underneath, above the 'possum's loin.  As she slipped her fingers in, she was startled by a voice from nearby.</span></div></div>",

The opossum's eyes had opened, glaring golden eyes upon her, and her mouth had parted in a snarl to reveal the sharp teeth within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\" the vixen stammered in shock.  Tears welled in her eyes and she quickly withdrew her probing paw as she broke down at the thought of being confronted by a zombie.  The apparent-zombie's claw darted forth from above the knife and shoved the vixen away, wasting no time in getting the upper hand as she quickly leapt atop the stunned fox, who had by now broken down in hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a <i>private area</i>.  You do <i>not</i> get to touch me there...

Are you alright?  Calm down...\"  The 'possum shook her a little, but that only made her cry harder.

W-what are you?..\" Maria stammered between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you stupid..?

You've never seen an opossum-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't laugh at me!\" the vixen shouted, finding a bit of composure...  Only to lose it again once the \"zombie\" sprung forward, getting in her face.  She broke down back into sobbing as the opossum spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never seen an opossum <i>play dead</i>?\"  The opossum kept laughing, as this was apparently very funny to her.  Of course, it wasn't for Maria, still wracked in mortal terror...  Which gradually made the whole situation less entertaining for the opossum.  \"...  Okay, I guess you've never seen an opossum play dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opossum took a moment to lift the vixen up and rest her against a tree as she kept sobbing, sighing before she resumed speaking.  \"Calm down.  Calm down.  I'm alive.  Take a deep breath...\"  The vixen did as she was told, surprisingly, and the opossum threw an arm around her back, feeling the hard metal blade sheathed there.  \"Is...  Is that a sword?  You're a warrior?  <i>You're a warrior, and you break down sobbing when..</i>?  You know what, never mind.  Just calm down.\"  The opossum began patting the vixen's shoulder, and the two of them stayed like that for a while as the vixen came down from her hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-  I...\" Maria began, before being hushed by the opossum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Shhhhh</i>.

And why you thought it was a good idea to stick your fingers in what you seem to have thought was a corpse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I thought you'd have something valuable...  Down there,\" the vixen began.  \"My name is Maria...  I'm a warrior, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"  The opossum rose from her position next to Maria and waddled over to the bloody knife that she'd left a few feet away.  The vixen watched her nervously as she plucked it off the ground and began turning it over in her hand.  \"You're a warrior, and <i>not</i> a thief..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...  I was desperate, that's all.  And who are <i>you</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Lilac...  I'm...  <i>Nominally</i>, a cleric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"  The vixen inhaled, and gagged, as her attention was brought back to the stench that lured her here.  \"If you're not dead, why do you smell like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell like..?\"  Lilac paused and made an appraising sniff.  \"Oh.  Oh, boy...  That's...  That's embarrassing.\"  The opossum darted behind a tree and began fumbling about beneath her robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be.  What is it?  What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilac presented a large, stained pair of cotton panties to the disgusted vixen.  \"Uh...  These.  Opossums have an...  Unfortunate tendency to release some, uh, fluid from our...  Asses...  When we play dead.  I'm certainly not wearing <i>these</i> anymore,\" the 'possum said, punctuating her explanation by flinging the garment into the woods behind her.  Both her and Maria watched in discomfort as it caught on a tree branch a few feet away.  \"...  Well.  I'm going to go find a creek to wash off in.\"  Lilac stepped out from behind the tree and wandered off past the still-sitting Maria.  \"I guess you can come with me, if you'd like.\"</span></div></div>",

Nor was it a particularly deep stream, its pebbled bottom visible in the dimming sunlight.  Thus, it was perfectly well-suited for a pudgy opossum to wash the \"ass fluid\" from her legs and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilac wasted no time tossing her robe onto the shoreline and wading in, unceremoniously plopping down in the middle.  The vixen set herself down on the shore, gingerly dipping her hindpaws into the gentle stream...  Taking special care to remain upstream from Lilac.  The water was colder than she'd expected, no doubt about it, but after some time on the road, a bit of a soak couldn't hurt for her aching paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes pass as Maria awkwardly peddles her feet in the water and Lilac prods at her lower half to give the stream as good a chance as it could to carry away the remnants of the foul-smelling fluid.  Occasionally, they glanced at each-other, but no conversation was shared...  Until Maria happened to notice the opossum spreading her thighs, exposing her nethers.  The fox grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, never seen a vagina before?\" the opossum teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-  I have!  I've seen lots-  No, I mean...  Don't you feel...  Uncomfortable, displaying yourself like that in front of a stranger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  Why?\"  Lilac glanced down at her pussy beneath the water.  \"Is it deformed or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's...  It's just <i>immodest.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opossum mockingly brought a paw to her cheek, feigning bashfulness.  \"Oh, <i>no</i>...\"  That same paw came down on the water with a slap a moment later, followed by a derisive chuckle.  \"I don't really care that much for modesty, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um.  Okay.\"  Maria looked away in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilac sighed.  \"It's alright...  I'm almost done washing 'her' out...  There we go.  All tucked away.  Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to make you uncomfortable,\" the opossum said, with genuine sheepishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed in silence as Lilac finished her wash and Maria stared down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opossum, having attended to business, sidled up to the stream bank to get a bit closer to Maria.  Lounging on the sandy shore, she struck up a proper conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Lilac began.  \"What brings you out here?  Adventuring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\"  Not much point in telling her her life story, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About the same, I guess.  I'd probably call it 'wandering,' though.\"  The opossum began playing with a nearby reed, bending it between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  Same here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There really isn't a lot to do around here, lately.\"  The vixen twiddled her thumbs.  \"I was heading to the next town over...  Wherever that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds about right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was interrupted by a loud growl.  Normally, this would have alarmed the vixen--  Alarmed anybody, really-- and she'd leap to her feet, ready to attack...  Had that growl not come from her own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opossum chuckled.  \"Wow, it sounds like somebody hasn't eaten in <i>weeks</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a couple days, anyway...\"  Maria blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, shhh, it's okay.  No sense being embarrassed about it.\"  Lilac rose to her feet and padded over to her robe.  \"Only one thing for it, of course.  Let's get you fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, now.  Follow me.\"  The opossum slipped her beige robe over her head and plodded away, gesturing at Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox sighed and did as she was told.

Horribly emaciated fingers reached out of the darkness towards a softly glowing orb of glass, pulling it closer so it may study it more intimately. As the sickly luminescence drew closer to the creature's face, it was reflected in its unblinking eyes like two little skulls. He grinned hungrily as he peered into the depths of the crystal sphere, seeing the visitors as they arrived through the door.

As Johanna poked her head around the corner in front of them, she was astounded by what seemed like a still empty tunnel.The long passageway was well lit with periodic torches. As far as she could see, nothing was there. Stepping out around the curb, she turned back to face her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what caused that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was at that point that she felt what she assumed was a drop of water fall on top of her muzzle. Touching it with her paw, it turned out to be a slightly sticky, thick liquid. Looking up, she found her partner staring, jaw agape, with a lone finger pointing to a spot right above her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's right above me, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely had time to notice Richard nod before it struck. She braced herself for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard could only watch as Johanna was enveloped in what could only be described as a giant, yellow, blob. It fell from the ceiling, giving off a low roar, and swallowed  the wolfess whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flinched. Richard was not the brave type. Sure he was smart, and had the knack for stealth and pickpocketing, but direct confrontation was not his strong point. But after a moment of nothing he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it was just sitting there. Blocking the hallway, it had Johanna in the middle, and it looked like she was unconscious. Richard knew there was no way he was getting past this thing alone. He had to get Johanna out of there and fast. Luckily it looked as if the impact had created an air bubble around her head, allowing for her to breath, if only for a short amount of time, while he tried to rescue her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up, he took out his dagger. The creature, if you could call it that, did not move or strike. It just sat there, like it was waiting for something. With a loud cry, he struck at it. At first the weapon went nicely through the beast, but it soon stuck fast. Try as he might, Richard was unable to pull it free. Suddenly, the thing gurgled, and began to suck his dagger into its midst. Yelping, the rouge quickly withdrew his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too close. A little slower and I'd be stuck in  there too! Normal weapons don't work, but there's got to be a way to free her. THINK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he noticed a small object at the far end of the slime. It was a rune, engraved with and odd symbol he had never seen before. It was glowing a faint orange, which was difficult to pick out from the body of the slime itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Ha! That MUST be wha'ts holding the creature together! I can't get to it, but maybe Johanna can! But how can I wake her though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the idea hit him. It was risky, but it was the only plan that he had. Maybe a smoke bomb could jar the creature just enough to wake the wolfess without injuring his partner. Taking a bomb from his satchel, he lit it and threw it into the side of the leviathan. All that was left was to wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard noticed, as the fuse burnt, that the creature was moving more of itself to the space between the bomb and Johanna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it doing? Does it realize the danger it poses to her? It's trying to keep her alive???\"<br>\r\n============================================================================ ================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a muffled pop, the bomb went off, sending a wave through the semi-liquid creature. As it passed the wolfess, her eyes slowly began to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was pounding. \"Ugh, I feel as if a 50 pound brick fell on my head. What happened.\" She tried to move her arms and legs. Nothing happened. It was almost as something was enveloping her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her. The Creature!!! Her eyes snapped open as she struggled to move. Then, she heard a muffled voice coming from somewhere around her. Looking out, she could see Richard waving his arms with an obvious look of relief on his face. Then, he started pointing to something on her right. Straining to turn her head, she managed to see what she assumed was some sort of rune caught in the middle of the beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously it's important, but how can I get to it? My arms are stuck, my legs can't move, all I can do is turn my head. I have to use my head to get to the rune.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to the fudge trap, she remembered lapping up the fudge as it poured into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! If I can't go to it, I'll try to bring it to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously she stuck her muzzle into the goop. Sticking her tongue out, she tasted it. And it was delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It almost tastes like Honey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Slowly but surely, the wolf girl began to suck at the goo, with every mouthful bringing the glowing orb closer to her. Unfortunately for her, since she had to eat quite a lot of it to get to it. Doggedly, she slurped, coming up every so often for air. Eventually, after about 10 minutes, she was able to get the orb in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I destroy this thing, I can destroy this blob, but hopefully not with me in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting down hard, Johanna managed to crack, and then break the glowing rock. The Slime around her gave out a loud roar, and let go of its hold on her body. Quickly, the slime disintegrated, melting into the ground around her. Happy for the fresh air, Johanna laid down panting against the tunnel wall, covered in the sticky remains of her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna! Are you okay?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard quickly ran across the tunnel, kneeling next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Rich, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the god's! That must have been awful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was quite an experience, and I'd hope not to go through it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet! It's weird though. I'm not sure that...thing...tried to harm you. When I tried to wake you up with my smoke bomb, it seemed like it tried to protect you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" said Johanna, lifting an eyebrow. \"If that were true would it have caught me to begin with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm just happy that I got through this unharmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Richard smiling, \"I think we had one casualty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning from ear to ear, Richard reached down and, much to the suprise of Johanna, managed to pat her now exposed belly. She had consumed so much slime that it had burst clean through her leather armor. Johanna groaned. Using both arms, she reached down and hefted up her now quite rotund stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my lord! I'm like a tiger balloon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she picked up her belly, her hands pressed into the soft surface. It was if she had a big ball of tiger dough attached to her middle. With a grunt, she tried to stand up. It needed little more effort than it should have. She stumbled, trying to maintain her balance. Richard leaned down and poked her new gut with a finger, leaving a depression that slowly filled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna smacked his hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we've got to keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going? How can you keep going in you condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll manage. Come on, let's get going. The tunnel widens out up ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard could only shake his head, marveling at the wolfess's determination. Slowly, he turned, jogging to catch up.</span></div></div>",

When it finished filling, the walls came down and the fluid flooded the tunnel floor before draining away through what was found to be an illusionary patch of floor leading to a sloping tunnel. As the liquid drained away, Richard tasted some and reported it to be milk. Upon waving his hand through the patch of the floor the milk drained into, the illusion vanished and a mouth-watering scent wafted up the tunnel. Well, at least for Richard it was. Joanna was too full to find the scent of any food anything other than nauseating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to take any chances with the tunnel in the floor, they continued to the large doors at the end of the main tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping through them, they found themselves in a room fifty metres square and at least ten high, apparently empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the doors slammed shut behind them the whole room was bathed in a blinding yellow light. About thirty seconds later, their vision cleared up and although they couldn't see anything different, the could certainly <i>feel</i> something different. Joanna no longer felt stuffed full. In fact, she was feeling a little bit hungry. Richard, however, was doubled over clutching his stomach as if in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" enquired Joanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine apart from the fact I'm <i>absolutely starving!</i>\" moaned Richard somewhat pitifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile neither of them could have known this, their stomach capacities had been increased eight-fold without otherwise affecting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the room had been listening, a red pattern of a maze appeared on the floor and over several seconds a five-metre wall grew up on the pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna tried to climb the wall, but the surface was simply too soft to get a grip and she slid back down to the floor, collecting handfuls of red goop along the way. She tasted some and promptly spat it out again. Whatever it was, it was both very sweet and very sour and had an unidentifiable fruity flavour to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about humans, but this stuff isn't to my tastes. Still edible, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if it doesn't taste the best. It's food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard ran to the wall directly opposite the door and started scraping off handfuls of goop and bolting them down. Before long, he'd made a hole big enough to climb through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I can see two ways to get through here. We could either navigate the maze, which would take longer and might result in us running into traps. On the other hand, given your obvious hunger, and the fact this stuff doesn't seem to be filling you up very quickly, you could just eat a series of holes through the walls until we get to the other side of the maze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She always thought that they were just silly puzzles, meaningless to most, and even more meaningless to a warrior like her. She always thought they required more sheer dumb luck than actual thought and planning to solve, and as they went deeper and deeper into this vast labyrinth she felt it was even more true now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time they came to a branching path or a crossroads she couldn\u2019t help but to be filled with anxiety. What if they were choosing the wrong way? How would she remember where she was going? What if they were just running about in circles? Hours were starting to pass by, and she was beginning to reconsider just having her and Richard eat their way through when she turned yet another corner and noticed something ahead of them. As the two drew closer, it became more apparent that it was a pedestal, and as they got close enough to see that the walls curved about it, forming a small, circular courtyard of sorts, they both saw quite clearly what lay on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone pedestal rose up to their midsections (Or Richard\u2019s midsection at least, Johanna was quite a bit taller), and upon it sat a pristine, white porcelain plate. Yet, atop of that was what really drew their attention: A beautifully arranged and decadently prepared stuffed turkey, larger than even Johanna had seen in her barbarian homeland. Both of their stomachs growled eagerly as they caught sight of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Johanna said hesitantly, the pudgy wolfess licking her lips as she drooled slightly, \u201cIs obviously a trap\u2026 we\u2026 we should just turn around and head the other way. Come on Richard\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to look at her companion, ears perking as she saw that nobody was standing beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026yelp?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to the pedestal as she heard the sound of ravenous eating and saw her rogue friend gnawing away at the turkey, not even bothering to use his hands to assist in his consumption. She stood there momentarily, mouth agape, before growling viciously, still drooling with her own hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRichard! You get your stupid hide back here before you get us both\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she noticed that the circular jelly walls of the \u201croom\u201d the turkey and Richard were in began to extend, seemingly growing into a wall between the two adventurers. Johanna ran towards her companion, but was too late as she bounced off of the newly formed barrier and landed on her plush ass. She growled even more viciously as she pulled her axe from its harness and slammed it into the wall, intending to cut her way through. Unfortunately the wall seemed much thicker and the blow she delivered to it barely even managed to make a dent. Even worse, the jelly comprising the wall almost instantly regenerated. Richard was now sealed off from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit!\u201d She roared, swinging again and again at the blockade with her mighty axe, but to no avail. Eventually she just gave up, panting and grunting, and simply sat on the floor. Maybe if she had been as thin as she was earlier she\u2019d have the energy to cut through\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna sighed as she looked at the floor, letting her axe free from her grip, letting it clatter against the floor. She hated mazes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could just eat her way through, but that\u2019s what this damn maze wanted. Eating any of this maze, for any reason as far as the wolfess was concerned, was a last ditch option. It was something she didn\u2019t want to try right now, and if she was fast enough, she wouldn\u2019t have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up, picked her axe back up to sling it over her back, and ran back down the path they came from. This time though, she turned down a different path, using her sense of direction to try and maneuver through the maze and back around to the other side of the turkey room and to Richard. She was fairly certain the she was heading in the right direction, but with such devious things as labyrinths, she could never be completely sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned this way and that, running quickly, quite aware that it was far more taxing than it used to be. She tried to ignore her newfound burdens though, keeping her mind on her companion and his expedient rescue. Her train of thought was soon interrupted however when she came to a crossroads in the maze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she had to keep moving forward to reach Richard, but her keen lupine nose couldn\u2019t help but pick up the amazing scent that was currently wafting down the left path. She stopped in the middle of the crossroads and looked in the scents direction, seeing a similar pedestal to the one from before. She knew this one didn\u2019t hold a turkey though, and her nose was proved right when she saw a rather large bowl carefully perched upon the pillar, filled to the brim with hot soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, she couldn\u2019t identify just what it was, and although it smelled like meat, she couldn\u2019t be too sure. Whatever it was though, it smelled heavenly and made her drool once again, almost irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Almost.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her mind returned to Richard, something that gave her even more motivation to ignore this obvious trap. Just as she was about to continue straight through the intersection though, she caught sight of something scattered about the soup room that made her rethink her choice. They appeared to be small bones, fresh with gnawed meat still clinging to them, possibly belonging to a chicken\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr a turkey.</span></div></div>",

When she stood back up, she was greeted by a figure off in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard!? Is that you?\" She called. She approached the figure and realized it was a hooded man. \"Who are you?\" She questioned, preparing for a attack. The hooded man just laughed in responce. Before Johanna could respond, she felt something grab her from behind. Struggling to break free from its iron grip, the thing then took a chunk of the wall next to them and forced it down her throat. Pain shot through her already stuffed belly as it was stretched even more. Johanna tried to resist as much as possible, but only exhausted herself. The hooded figure's hands started to glow and Johanna felt not as full. Looking down, her eyes laid upon her mammoth stomach. It sagged way past her knees and stuck outward 5 more feet then it did yesterday. The process of force feeding carried on for 10 more minutes, and when the thing dropped her, she was HUGE. Her stomach stuck out 3 meters, her limbs were as thick as a tree, and four chins rested on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew, Johanna was in some castle-like place. She tried looking around but couldn't move her head much. See that she was alone, she started bawling her eyes out. Her days of adventuring were over; Her family would reject a blob like her. Suddenly, a door opened behind her. \"Hey!\" She screamed. Then something crawled ontop of her gut. It was the hooded man. A smile crept across his face (but Johanna couldn't see it) \"Why are you doing this?!?\" She said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She figured that as long as she kept her guard up and ignored the smell entirely, that it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Her willpower was like a solid rock, and the wondrous aroma a persistent ocean: As long as she didn\u2019t dawdle it wouldn\u2019t be able to wear her down in such a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about halfway there when her self-control became more comparable to a salt-lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pace quickened, the dangerously inviting scent filling her nose now, using it to effortlessly ensnare its lupine owner.  By the time she reached the podium that the bowl of soup was situated upon, drool dripped from her mouth and her tail was wagging uncontrollably behind her already cushier rump. She was lucky to still have the foresight to slow her pace as she neared the room, otherwise she would have simply crashed into the pedestal and its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there, licking her lips as she looked down at the soup, the bones scattered about her boots all but forgotten. It looked almost as inviting as it smelled, the surface smooth and glassy, a dark red it seemed, reminding Johanna almost of an alluring pair of lips. Even though soft wisps of steam wafted up from the bowl, hinting at the comforting warmth of its contents, she could still see her canine features reflected atop it. Somehow she looked even more beautiful than the last time she had seen her reflection, hell, she couldn\u2019t even recall the last time she had seen herself. Maybe she hadn\u2019t seen it before at all? It sounded ridiculous, but that was the only explanation her mind could reach, not even once realizing that it could have been some wicked glamor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over the bowl, placing both of her paws on each side of the pedestal and gripping it firmly. As she drew her snout even nearer, the incredible scent grew even more fantastic. Her senses were already filled with ecstasy, just imagine how it would <i>taste!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her snout, her reflection drawing closer to the soup\u2019s surface as if to meet her in a kiss, and knew that she had little choice\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The taste had to have been the highlight of her entire life! Everything just had to have lead to this unparalleled excellence that she now found pouring down her eager throat. If she had to describe the taste, she would fail. The only way to come even close was to say that it was the best of every soup that had ever met her taste buds: She could pick out savory beef, sweet corn, and the creamy richness of tomato, amongst countless others! She was so lost by the exquisite joy splashing across her tongue that she failed to hear the gelatin walls of the maze closing off all entrances to the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the warmth! By the gods, it was so welcome! She suddenly realized how cold the maze was, and how much she needed this hot, heavy feeling in her belly. It was beyond comfortable\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just couldn\u2019t stop herself from consuming the stuff, she couldn\u2019t even <i>think</i> of stopping. And it seemed that the soup didn\u2019t want itself to stop either. The bowl, already large to begin with, seemed as though it wasn\u2019t emptying in the slightest, even though Johanna seemed to have drank gallons of the stuff already. Yet this oddity was only a passing thought in Johanna\u2019s brain, just barely noticed between the indulgent pleasures that the delicious substance was giving her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more unnoticed was just how full she was getting. Well, not full exactly, as her belly seemingly continued to stretch and stretch below her, but <i>fuller</i>. Her stomach bulged like an overripe fruit, wobbling grotesquely as it filled with more of the wicked stew and stuck out below her leather top, causing it to ride up closer and closer to her breasts. Speaking of her leathers, if she was more aware of herself right now they would have felt far tighter than even moments before. She might have even noticed the still thin yet increasing layer of flab now spreading about her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyways. <i>Nothing</i> mattered but keeping the flow of soup going down her gullet and into her endless, gluttonous belly. It was a marvel that she didn\u2019t drown in the stuff with how voraciously she was eating, but that was the only sign of some kind of intelligence from the barbarian wolfess, for her mind was in another place entirely now. Her thoughts were lost in a heavenly sea of delight, a road of endless happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet there was something far down that path, hidden in the deepest parts of her brain, nagging at her.

She would have never, in her wildest dreams, have imagined that paradise wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a place you were sent to for achieving a warrior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, nor was it a state of mind obtainable through patience and enlightenment, but instead it was tangible, reachable, and so very delicious. Sure, even in her current state the wolfess had realized that there were other things to life than guzzling the bottomless concoction before her, but that was a long time ago, and everything else seemed so far away\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Even if she could push aside her complacent happiness , even if she had remembered who Richard was, and even if she desired to rescue him it would be useless. While the wolfess may have lost track of how long she had been indulging her gluttony, but the reality of it was she had been gulping warm, fattening soup for nearly three days straight now, and such things can be exceedingly unforgiving on one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body. By this point she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get to her feet, let alone walk, due to how enormously obese she had become from the enchanted stew. Yet still she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice, not while there was broth still left within the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Quite unfortunately for her however said bowl had a ways to go before it was completely empty, but Johanna didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to mind one bit. She also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to notice that, now that her arms had become completely and uselessly enveloped by fat, the soup had been assisting the barbarian in its consumption. Despite the fact that the basin was far from her mouth now, balanced perfectly between her massive breasts, the soup still flowed to her mouth, the mixture cascading up her multitude of chins like a preternatural waterfall. If Johanna had been in the right mind she might have recognized this devious enchantment for what it was, but then again she might have been far more concerned with her lack of mobility, or for that matter, decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Her leather armor had been torn to pieces the day she was hooked and what undergarments she had were ripped apart not long after by her slowly growing bulk. Her breasts now sagged atop her belly, each one bloated immensely and crowned by a plumpened nipple. Likewise, there was no longer anything to cover her rear, leaving the crack that separated each rounded, fattened buttock clearly and shamelessly visible. If Johanna had been focused enough to care, however, she might have been at least somewhat grateful for the fact that at the very least all of her wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely visible. Her crotch may not have been covered by clothing any longer, yet it still lay hidden from view beneath her massively soup-engorged belly along with the pillar the bowl had originally rested on, now crushed beneath her flabby paunch. Despite all of these dramatic changes to her body, Johanna remained blissfully ignorant, though that wasn't to last long\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Even in her uninhibited, intoxicated state, Johanna couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but notice as the last remaining drops of the intoxicating soup rolled up her chins and past her plump lips, and for the first time in three days, thought of something other than filling her gut. Unsurprisingly, after having been awake days on end and having a belly filled to capacity with warm, heavy soup, that first thought was of sleep. The massive, immobile lupine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyelids slowly fell closed as she drifted off almost immediately into a deep doze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Johanna slept on, her slumber deep enough to last for a long while, and her snoring loud enough to make the gelatin walls around her quiver and quake. Drool and slobber dripped past her lips unrestrained besides when she occasionally and instinctively licked them clean. Between snores she could be seen smiling, or heard moaning, lost in a dream and unable to notice the immense changes she had undergone nor the visitor that now approached her\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Such merciful ignorance would not last forever though, and as he walked around the slumbering, helpless wolfess, the robed figure examining her mountainous body, the owner of the dungeon knew as much. The Lipomancer ran his fingers through her fur, unable to stop a grin from spreading across his shrouded face, imagining the moment she would awaken and relishing it. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d enjoy watching her panic as she tried in vain to lift her flabby arms and reach the ground with her legs, only stopping when she finally gave into her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                He had big plans for his new captive, but even as he tenderly rubbed her flabby rolls he let her sleep, allowing her to enjoy a last moment of peace before she began her new life in the lair of the Lipomancer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johanna shook her head groggily, sniffling a bit, eyes blinded by a bright white light. She shivered a little as she awoke, realizing that wherever she was it was much too cold, but also recognizing it as a chill she had not felt in quite some time: The cold bite of deep winter winds. Her eyes widened as she suddenly understood what this meant; that not only was she outside of that abysmal maze and the dungeon itself, but also in a place she hadn't been in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself in her home village to the far north, and she felt comfy and at peace as her fellow wolves surrounded her. To her utter shock, but not unpleasantly so, they welcomed and praised her! They gave her gifts and showered her with affection and glory, as though she were a long lost hero returning from distant lands. She didn't realize how odd this situation felt, but instead she herself felt odd' as though she were different, bigger than how she normally felt. Was she taller, perhaps? Did it symbolize her larger-than-life status amongst the townsfolk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                It didn't matter now, as all the wolves were cheering at her, and her heart soared with elation, pure happiness filling her very being! She smiled proudly as they chanted her name, patted and rubbed her firmly with paws begging for a chance to feel the triumphant barbarian wolfess for themselves, and, most pleasing of all, brought forth platter upon platter of warm and wondrously scented food. She drooled, not even having to lift a finger as delicious gifts of tribute were brought to her lips and fed to her tenderly with care and reverence. Cakes! Pies! Cream! And meat, so much delicious, savory meat was fed to her as the wolfess hungrily devoured it all with little thought, moaning softly as she indulged herself in her glorious reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                'Reward for what though'?' She caught herself thinking, but pushed such thoughts away. There were vague memories of traps and perils and the promise of riches, and this served as a suitable enough explanation to her. Clearly she had brought back wealth and renown to her once humble home and been praised for it, hailed as a champion! And even... forgiven?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Now she found herself actively fighting to ignore her thoughts as she consumed her gifts more voraciously, not caring at all as she spilled crumbs, juices, and chunks down her chin as the villagers feeding her struggled to keep up. Soon she did not even care what was brought before her mouth as she mindlessly ate like a starved beast, trying to distract herself, trying to forget her painful thoughts and just eat and be happy. She was doing well too, that is at least, until she was brought something that she could not ignore, that brought her back out of her fugue in an instant:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piping hot bowl of dark red soup that was laid before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...?' The lupine barbarianess gasped uneasily as she caught sight of the familiar steaming stew, her mind filling with disturbing memories as a terrible realization began to dawn upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No'' She whimpered, starting to comprehend how helpless she felt, how foolish she'd been as she looked at the wolf people who surrounded her, 'N-No' please' take it away!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                But the men and women of her village did not obey, instead grinning wildly as they all gazed at her and chanted in unison, 'Eat! Eat! Eat! EAT!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Johanna whined in protest, trying to object to their demands, but finding that all that came out of her lips were panicked, almost strained gasps and pants. She tried to avoid looking too closely at the steaming hot soup as it rested in front of her, afraid of what she knew she would see, but once she caught a glimpse out of the corner of her eye, she was transfixed. What she saw inside of the bowl made her howl in horror and dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                Staring back into the wolf's face was the reflection of what she at first believed to be a different woman. Her furry cheeks were rounded and even sagging slightly with fat, her lips plump and lustrously wet with drool, and the remains of meals hastily and sloppily consumed dripped messily down her many chins. No, it wasn't another wolf whose face was reflected in that dark, liquid mirror at all, no matter how much Johanna wished for it to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                The wolfess cried out in shock, trying to push the bowl away herself, but finding that her arms would not even move. As she looked down, still grunting and gasping for breath, she noticed that not only was she completely naked, but that the bowl of stew was resting between greatly bloated breasts and atop a disturbingly immense stomach that spilled onto the ground in front of her and obstructed her sight. As she looked over what parts of her body she could, she soon realized that she couldn't move her arms at all simply because they were too heavy and swollen with fat. Even as she tried to take this all in, her breathing growing even more stressed and heavy from her increasing terror, the villagers continued to chant, sounding more eager now, growing impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'EAT! EAT! <i>EAT!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                She tried to look away from them all, tried to shake her head in denial as her heart pounded ever faster, but was distraught when she realized that she was far too obese to do even that, the many rolls of blubber that was now her 'neck' restricting all but the slightest of movements. As such, she could see all too well what was happening as the soup resting on her heaving, gelatinous belly began to squirm and then rise. The wolf's eyes widened in terror and recognition as the soup began to form into a thin tentacle that moved towards her lips, and she shut them firmly as it prodded at them, seeking entry as the crowd's chanting grew feverish and fanatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                But then Johanna noticed something even more terrible as she heard their shouts, realizing that not only were their cheers changing in tone, but wording as well: 'Eat <i>us!</i> Eat <i>us!</i> Eat <i>US!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n                As they shouted this bizarre mantra, Johanna's near constant fright was momentarily replaced by stunned confusion. She started to wonder just what was going on, for the first time trying to apply logic to this increasingly strange situation, when she noticed that all the villagers' pelts were turning a deep dark red. The wolf woman tried to push her feet against the ground, trying to flee but failing to even stand, gasping as her former kin began to melt into puddles of hot, frothing stew and swiftly oozed their way towards her immobilized form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Johanna tried her best to keep her lips sealed shut, but as the new tendrils of soup from the former crowd joined the liquid from the bowl she found she could do little to stop what was now a torrent of soup pushing its way effortlessly down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Overcome with terror, Johanna's breathing quickened and strained even more against both her vast girth and swelling panic, her heart racing dangerously as she tried to think of a way out of this horrifying mess. With the immense amount of thick, creamy stew that was flowing inside her, it wasn't long before her gut began to grow painfully taut, despite its ridiculous size. She had to think of something soon, but what could she do when she was helpless to even lift a paw to save herself?</span></div></div>",

But as the pain in her already tremendously swollen gut grew, she knew that she needed to do SOMETHING fast or else she might pop like a big, fat wolfy balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The mass of hot, delicious soup was unending, mercilessly continuing to gush and flow past her lips even as her fat gut grew firm and heavy. Even as she was forced to devour the first wave of townsfolk, more and more gathered around her only to melt into broth as well, joining their companions in filling the barbarian's belly. The bloating wolf woman squeezed her eyes shut tight as she tried to focus through the growing discomfort, her mind flooding with almost as many frantic thoughts as there were villagers flooding into her maw. Johanna whined as she attempted to move her paws in any way she could, but found that all she was able to use them for was gripping her now painfully distended stomach. Her efforts to close her mouth were fruitless as well, though she didn't expect it to do much good against the unrelenting tide of soup anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Thus the wolf woman did the only possible thing she could think of at this point: Simply try to stop swallowing the stuff. Johanna took a deep breath and gagged as hard as she could against the insistent flow of stew, and though at first she was less than successful, she continued to try. The Barbarian was putting as much strength as she could into coughing up the fattening fluid before it brought her to an untimely end. Yet as she continued to struggle she started to panic even more, her vision beginning to cloud from the effort and strain of an action that seemed so simple. Even as she managed to stop the flow of soup, the hot, rich liquid sputtering and spilling from her lips, her vision began to fade until it dimmed completely to black. Suddenly she could feel her breathing quickening, her eyes snapping open as she found herself in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A heavy groan escaped Johanna's plump lips as she slowly came to. Her vision was still fuzzy at first, but judging by the warmer temperature she could already tell she was no longer in her homeland. She was beginning to think, to immense relief, that all of that was just a horrible nightmare she was now free of. Unfortunately for her she was starting to realize that the reality preceding such a dream wasn't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As her eyesight adjusted various decorations and furnishings came into view; plush couches, silken drapes, shelves stocked with row upon row of books, and the dim candelabras that cast a flickering light across the room all seemed to suggest that she now found herself in some kind of parlor. The decor might have been a bit different, but as she noticed a sculpture of heavyset panda girl sitting on one of the tables across from her it only confirmed what she knew: She was still probably stuck in that bizarre and fattening dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite the sophisticated nature of her surroundings, there was something else unsettling about the place besides the obvious. Perhaps it was the poor lighting, or the subtle signs of age shown by a cobweb here or there, but whatever it was made the wolf girl feel uneasy. Remembering that she still hadn't found Richard yet, she decided that it might be best if she get a move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, the wolf woman... realized... wasn't going to be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" She grunted past soft but heaving pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Johanna looked down past her fat-swaddled neck, she saw only her tremendous belly before her, a vast sea of exposed white fur. Her mouth hung open as her panting increased and she looked about the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... how could I forget...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whimpered as she grabbed her belly in her pudgy paws, grimacing in dismay as they sunk into it. She wasn't as nearly as fat as she had become in her dream, but she was still pretty damn big, and still immobile. She had, perhaps foolishly, hoped that her stupid mistake and thus the resulting gain were all part of the dream as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, nooo...\" She whined, \"How could I have been so dumb! Huff... I should have known, I shouldn't have trusted such strange food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's the best kind...\" a feminine voice whispered into the wolfess's ear from behind, \"Much more interesting, wouldn't you say...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna gasped sharply, instinctively trying to look at the owner of the voice and finding it to be as useless as it was in the dream. Unable to turn her neck or body much all she could do was ask, \"Who are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, who am I? Droll, boring, I already know who <i>I</i> am... Now who <i>YOU</i> are is infinitely more fascinating,\" the voice muttered before Johanna felt a cold, gloved hand grope one of her mammoth and exposed buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremendously obese barbarian let out a surprised and thick yelp, a warm blush filling her face as she was grabbed, \"You let go of me fiend! Huff... grrr... I swear I will chop that hand off!\" She growled, losing the fierceness in her voice almost instantly as the woman's hand remained firmly grasping her rump, squeezing it and lifting the cheek. The wolfess's ears drooped as she realized she had no way of enforcing her threat at such a large size, her spirits falling even further as she felt how much this person's grip sunk into her pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax please, you're distracting me,\" The voice responded flatly as she let go of Johanna, causing the fat buttock to bounce, \"Mmm, yes, as I thought, quite heavy. Excellent accumulation. Soup is as effective as I had hoped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's ears perked straight back up, \"...Soup? You are the one who made the soup? Hrf... Are you the owner of this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. No, no, just a chef. Best chef,\" The voice said with pride, the first hint of emotion Johanna had noticed from her, \"I think of recipes, mixing the culinary and the arcane,\" She stated before Johanna felt two hands placed firmly upon the rolls of her back and a soft warmth in between, \"Oof! Odor potent. Subject must have been in state of ingestion for days before Master had her moved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\" The wolfess said as her expression soured, \"Did you just say that I stink...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, most definitely,\" The voiced replied without hesitation, and Johanna could feel her warm nose sniffing at her again, \"Mmmhm, it is to be expected. Accumulation of adipose tissue in such extensive quantities will increase sweat production. Doubtful you would have chance to wash or even have the thought cross your mind, the effects of the soup would of course be too enthralling. Along with that, and other factors of you body's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I get it!\" Johanna grunted, rolling her eyes, \"Do you always use so many words when you insult people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, not insult, simple facts,\" The voice said, \"Stench is considered to be offensive to most, but I don't mind. Used to it. You get accustomed when working with the Master's subjects so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill ran through Johanna's massive body as she looked around the room, the only thing she could do really besides talk to... well, whoever this person was, \"The one who owns this place... And by the gods, there are others who suffer this way? Urf... Does your master have a lot of... 'subjects'...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my yes... yes, very many...\" The woman said, her hands leaving their spots on Johanna's back, \"So many have come here and so many never leave. They all serve him when they stay, they have to. But the ones he doesn't want...\" Her voice seemed to grow subtly giddy as she moved to Johanna's side, yet still out of her sight, \"I get the majority of those for experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna didn't like the sound of that at all, \"Am I one of your 'experiments'...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman chuckled, a brisk and restrained sound, \"No. Sad, but no. If you were you would not be here of course. The Master wants to see you personally. I believe he might have bigger plans for you. Sorry for the pun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess frowned, but had more things to worry about than bad jokes, like why this lady was now sliding her hand in between one of the thick rolls of her belly \"Whatever, then if I am not your experiment then why all this poking and prodding...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady squeezed the fleshy roll a few times at various points before answering the wolf woman, \"If you were experiment I would conduct much further testing, shame I cannot though, you have beautiful distribution for lupine, robust physicality too. But no, not experiment per se, but must see how effective my soup was. First time tampering with edible polymorphic liquid, have to see if it retained metabolic and gastronomic effects. Obvious it still affects willpower and mind well from first sight of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well maybe you shouldn't have made that junk so tasty...\" Johanna grumbled, the woman next to her now poking the wolfess's tremendous gut with something solid and stick-like, mumbling thoughtfully as Johanna's bulk jiggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the situation Johanna found herself in was still pretty frightening, she felt more annoyed and confused than anything now, probably thanks to getting over the initial shock of her gain and the insistent examinations of this odd woman. There still wasn't much for her to do in her current state but sit around and be poked and grabbed, yet now that her mind had cleared a little she figured there might be some way to use this stranger's talkative and inquisitive nature to her advantage...</span></div></div>",

As her fatty belly rolls jiggled once more, Johanna figured that the best course of action was to ask the inquisitive woman some questions of her own, \"So... This person you call Master... who is he, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice let forth a thoughtful hum as she once more grabbed at Johanna's belly, now apparently testing its pliability with her own gloved hands instead of relying upon her stick, \"The Master? Hm, yes him. I wonder if I can say? I don't see why not I suppose, I mean you will be seeing him for yourself soon anyways, won't you? Well maybe not him exactly. That much maybe I shouldn't say, no that wouldn't be prudennt. No not at all, not at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods, would just shut up and talk to me!\" Johanna growled, leaning back and sinking into her rolls of flab as she shifted her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contradiction? Disappointing, incredibly so.\" The woman sighed as she ceased her prodding and walked further around Johanna's side, \"I expected more intelligence, even from one so physical and brutish.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna scowled at the remark, but she restrained herself from showing more vocal objections. She could argue with this woman all she wanted, but it'd just what precious time she had, \"Alright... Give me a straight answer... please. I want to know who you are working for, and who owns this dungeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... First of all, not dungeon. Dungeon is different area of Master's citadel. You are in his castle.\" The woman said before finally strolling into view. Johanna wasn't surprised to see that the heretofore unseen woman was a horse girl, as Bitemarsh was full of a variety of anthropomorphic animal species. Likewise she wasn't surprised by her attire because, while strange being that the white uniform with gold buttons and trim looked like a mix between a chef's outfit and an alchemist or scientist's garb, it suited what Johanna had already gathered about the woman's interests. What was somewhat odd was the girl's fur color, a light blue that was complimented somewhat by the darker sapphire locks that fell mainly to one side of her face, the deep color giving her otherwise messy hair a strange elegance. Also bizarre was the woman's size as for whatever reason Johanna had assumed anybody working in this place who had a hand in creating such fattening food and traps would have at least been a little chubby. Instead the young horse girl was actually quite thin. Beyond the woman's hips being somewhat wider than usual, there were no signs of her having any excess fat. Johanna gulped a bit when she realized the girl had noticed her looking her over, but the woman only continued with her analysis of the helpless wolfess, \"Yes. Clear now subject was completely unconscious until first clear communication, soup is remarkably effective at rendering subject comatose for great lengths of time. Perhaps too effective?\" She paused to whisper to herself, \"Regardless of Master's wishes, may require follow-up examinations to ascertain subject's current sleeping patterns as well as to determine levels of lethargy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess could only grit her teeth as she heard the horse's reply, stifling a growl deep in her throat, \"Please... I NEED to know what is going on here... I need to know who your master is and I NEED to find my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse girl stopped in her tracks as Johanna spoke, and for a moment Johanna's hopes soared, <i>\"Finally! Now she'll give me some damn answers!\"</i> She thought before the girl leaped onto her huge, fat-swollen gut, causing the wolfess to yelp and her many layers of fat to ripple and quake, \"H-Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse woman grunted as she landed on the morbidly obese barbarian's shaking gut, trying desperately to keep herself from rolling off as the jarring movement subsided. She then looked up at the wolf girl's face, a determined gleam in her eye as she grabbed pawfuls of Johanna's bare belly and scaled it like a climber might scale a cliff face, \"Hold on! Hold still!\" The equine huffed as she climbed over Johanna's gut, \"And keep talking, if you would! Don't stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What...?! You're crazy!\" Johanna groaned as her belly continued to be jostled by the horse's movements, the wolf still incredibly uncomfortable with her body's newly fattened proportions, \"Stop this! Get off of me you maniac, right now! YIPE!\" The wolfess barked suddenly as the horse girl finally reached her chest, grabbing hold of one of her bloated breasts for purchase. Johanna could barely choke back a moan as the girl's hand gripped her fat mammary momentarily before she continued to climb, apparently not even noticing the awkward grope.\"Godsdamn, paws off creep!\" Johanna hissed, blushing deeply and glancing away from the horse girl as she finally reached her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? I said keep talking!\" The horse sighed before removing her gloves and then grabbing Johanna's cheeks in each of her paws, causing her to bark once more in astonishment, \"I must see you in action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you-Mmph!\" Johanna growled before her voice was muffled by the sudden intrusion of the girls fingers in her mouth, the horse grabbing her pudgy lips and cheek in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! So perfect... such exquisite features.\" The woman mumbled to herself as she tugged at Johanna's lips, the barbarian glaring at the horse the whole time, \"Perfect lupine physiology, a prime specimen if I'd ever seen one, perhaps finest! Definitely better than most canine samples I've seen. What are you doing wolf? I said keep talking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna growled, a bit of drool dribbling past the corner of her lips as the horse continued to tug them. Her words were obviously muffled, but still discernible, \"If you don't take those godsdammned paws out of my mouth I'll bite them in half!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse girl blinked, poking around the inside of Johanna's cheek just a bit more before pulling her hands from the wolf girl's mouth, \"Apologies. But procedures necessary of course. Needed to examine facial structure and expression in relation to your recent... acquisitions. Only time for a few more tests until the Master sees you anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh... Can I at least ask what KIND of tests?\" Johanna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idea! Even better idea!\" The horse girl said, seeming to smirk at her own thoughts, \"I will let subject decide which she would like. Need results but not sure which to gather. Need to understand the effects the soup and resulting weight accumulation have had upon subjects vocalizations or... well, libido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna looked more than a little puzzled at these choices, especially the latter, \"Err... what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not waste time with more questions, choose!\"</span></div></div>",

Johanna couldn't help but notice it smelled much better than any other monster she'd fought. It smelled of fresh deer roasting on a spit, warm bread straight from the oven, fish practically swimming again in butter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small smirk, Johanna sidestepped as the creature lunged for her, swinging her axe into and through the golem's thigh. With a roar and a squelchy crash, the creature tumbled over in two pieces, fruit filling leaking from the severed stumps. Johanna didn't know whether this was its lifeblood, or if she'd cut though a pie or two, but didn't spare herself the time to think about it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a triumphant laugh, she brought her axe down again, severing one of the golem's arms. The creature tried to rise, only to fall over helplessly with a roar of anger. Johanna calmly walked around to its other arm, almost casually cutting off its other leg as she walked by. More fruit fillings spilled out, creating a sticky puddle not unlike blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna paused, axe raised over her head, and smirked. \"Stick this in your oven and bake it, fruitcake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent the axe on its way down, and severed the golem's remaining arm. Not quite content to stop there, Johanna brought down her axe again and again, smashing the golem into its requisite pieces and clumps of food. Then even these she crushed, whether under her footpaws or with the head of her axe. Fruits, meats, and vegetables squelched between her footpaws, getting them dirty and sticky, but this wasn't anything new to the bare-footed barbarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the once-fearsome construct had been reduced to something resembling wet oatmeal, Johanna hefted her axe onto her shoulder again and said \"Right, then. Let's go, Richard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard, having had regained his composure by this time, smiled and said \"Guess you could call it creamed' corn'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna chuckled and nodded. \"That's a good one, I'll give you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or smashed potatoes,\" Richard said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna laughed a little less this time. \"Yes, very good. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Richard wasn't quite finished yet. \"You certainly shut his piehole. Stomped his grapes.Sliced and diced him. Ah, but that's the way the cookie crumbles, no? You have to break a few eggs to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to shut YOUR cakehole if you don't move it...\" Johanna growled, glaring at Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!

Not only was the handle itself a trap, but the squelching sounds had resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna spun around to see the golem rising again. Though it didn't seem to be able to reform completely, it was still sliding towards them at a remarkable pace, considering its pasty (or was that pastry?) complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now would be a good time to open that door, Richard,\" Johanna said, readying her axe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Richard didn't move or reply, Johanna spared a moment to look over and see his frozen form. She swore and tried to push him aside, to no avail. He was fixed firmly to the handle, her only escape from the room. She looked round again to see the golem almost on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna jumped away again, swinging her axe. It sliced through the golem, splattering some of him onto the floor, but otherwise having no ill effects. The creature roared with annoyance, but kept moving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Johanna found the golem was completely ignoring her now, heading right for the helpless Richard. She didn't know what it could possibly do to him in such a semi-solid state, but she wasn't about to let it try anything funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she readied her axe again and approached the mushy monster, an unseen tentacle tripped her up. She fell forward, her axe clattering away across the floor. Before she could spring up, more of the monster's tentacles crept across her, surprisingly strong, pinning her to the floor. It had been a trap all along! Richard was the bait, and she had fallen for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna struggled against her bonds, snarling angrily \"Oh THIS is some bull-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thick tentacle had crept up on the edges of her peripheral vision and now forced itself into her gaping maw. She tried to close her mouth against the flow, but to no avail. It was simply too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna soon forgot completely about escaping as the flavor hit her. It was everything good she'd ever tasted made better, all at the same time, yet each flavor distinct. She had never thought they could blend together so smoothly... What had she been doing all her life? Not eating, certainly... and that was just wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem's magic forced a change upon Johanna's body. Converting its mass directly into calories, it sped up her metabolism to inhuman speeds. Her stomach emptied of the golem's mush and the fudge from before, spreading them thickly throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard watched, horrified, yet strangely fascinated, as Johanna's lithe frame swelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms added layers of thickness, swelling like sausages, and coming to resemble them, as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs thickened and rounded, growing steadily closer together until they touched, squishing against one another slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was not spared, rising out of her shirt like the soft dough it resembled, creating love-handles to rest on her widening, curvaceous hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rump, though they could not see it, \"bubbled\" outwards, two globular spheres pressing against her pants, stretching them until they creaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's bust grew, too, increasing from a not unimpressive size to a state of weightiness sure to be the envy of many women and grab the attention of many men, while still remaining reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the golem had stuffed the last of itself into the bloated barbarian, leaving her with only a wonderful taste in her mouth. Johanna soon came back to her senses, and she sat up groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, tried to. Her stomach rolled and squished against her thighs and bust, preventing her from sitting up straight. This action made her already dangerously strained shirt creak in protest. Her arm jiggled just a little as she raised a hand to rub her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what was-\" Johanna groaned, stopping as she saw what had happened. She blinked once, twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she screamed. \"Oh my GODS-\"</span></div></div>",

He was beginning to see a pattern here: It was almost as if every trap in this bizarre dungeon was designed specifically to increase intruder\u2019s waistlines. The rogue had encountered many traps in his career of plundering and burgling, but nothing as odd as that! And now the pulverized golem that had forced itself down his companion\u2019s throat, still making itself a threat even after its defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was brought out of his contemplation by a delighted yelp from Johanna, and he ran through the doors to check on his companion. What he saw on the other side astonished him. The room was absolutely enormous! Cavernous even! Yet most of the room seemed to be reserved for four very long banquet tables, each one simply overflowing with various kinds of foods. Richard couldn\u2019t help but notice that almost everything seemed to be fattening: Most of it was just meats, bread, and sweets with little to no vegetables or fruits to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the tables and the elaborate, sparkling gold chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the stone floored and walled room seemed to be rather barren, with no windows or decorations to be seen. The only other feature was the exit with sat at the intersection of two grand, sweeping staircases at the other end of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue once more tried to focus, looking about the banquet hall for Johanna, yet she was nowhere to be seen. He started to call out her name, moving further into the room until a loud, deep bout of laughter stopped him dead in his tracks. He looked up at the balcony that lay between the staircases and caught sight of a rather tall, slender figure donning a black robe with gold trim, its face hidden within the shadows of its cowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you interlopers have found your way to one of my dining halls!\u201d Called out a smug, masculine voice, \u201cOne of many, and not the grandest perhaps, but it should suit your needs just fine\u2026 Consider yourselves no longer intruders, but my guests, if you\u2019d please. Go ahead, help yourselves!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looked up at the menacing figure and snarled, \u201cYou must be the owner of this strange place then? You talk of needs, but it seems to be that there\u2019s more than enough food for an army, let alone two adventurers, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled, shaking his head, \u201cOh yes, it may seem to be an overwhelming amount of food, but that\u2019s the wonderful thing about this feast\u2026 it\u2019s just so delicious. I believe your companion understands\u2026\u201d The cloaked figure pointed a gloved hand at one of the tables and Richard followed it to see Johanna, madly stuffing her muzzle with meat pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then\u2026\u201d The figure continued, now pointing towards Richard, the human feeling a slight but nagging sensation of hunger sprout up within him as he did so, \u201cI must attend to some other things, but I do hope that you be a polite guest rogue\u2026 I\u2019d be offended if you didn\u2019t try at least some of the food\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled before walking through the exit, and as he did so, the large wooden doors behind Richard slammed shut by themselves. The rogue walked toward Johanna slowly, unable to help himself from eying all of the scrumptious looking food\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Richard placed his hand on her shoulder and quickly pulled it away.  She was <i>hot!</i>   Her metabolism had to be operating at unheard-on speeds, burning away the food almost as soon as it entered her belly.  <i>Most</i> of it, anyway.  She was still getting bigger, slowly -- too slowly for him to quite see it, but when he turned away for a minute, examing the room for possible escape routes, and then turned back, he could see a definite change.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna,\" he pleaded.  \"We have to go, now, while you still can!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swatted him away and buried her face in a vast tureen of pasta, slurping it down in huge, ravenous gulps.  She simply couldn't stop herself, Richard realized.  The food was obviously enchanted.   Ironically, perhaps their encounter with the food golem had been a blessing in disguise; if she hadn't had her metabolism supercharged, she surely would have exploded by now, at the rate she was shoveling it in.   But how long would that last?  And just how big would she be before it ended?  He had a sudden image of himself struggling to roll her from room to room, crushing monsters beneath her.   Rogues weren't supposed to do the heavy lifting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna,\" he said for the third time.  Maybe he could play on her pride in her warrior's physique, or what was left of it. \"Stop eating!  You're getting fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ridic'lous,\" Johanna belched, spraying bits of sausage and meatballs across the half-eaten platter of meat.  \"'m in the best shape of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Biggest shape of your life</i>, maybe, Richard thought crossly.   But he had to admit, if he hadn't seen it himself he would never have believed a woman could gain so much weight in a single sitting.  Gripped in the twin madness of magical compulsion and insatiable hunger, there was no way Johanna would listen to a thing he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe devoured every last bit of meat, licking the silver platter until it shone, then tossing it behind her, forgotten, and pulled a basket of steaming buns dripping with sugar and cinnamon towards herself.   Perhaps -- he wasn't quite sure, but just maybe -- yes, her growth seemed to be slowing.   The powerful burn had run its course.  But the enchantment still held her in its grip, and her frenzied glutting continued unabated.   Already, even under the soft pot belly her stomach was noticeably distended.   How much time did he have?  Ten minutes?  Five?   Even as he dithered, she guzzled a pitcher of honey.  A slab of roast beef.   A loaf of bread longer than he was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught a glimpse of his face in the mirrorlike surface of the platter which lay at his feet.   The suave rogue was gone.  He looked frantic, helpless, like a man completely out of ideas--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The platter!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If she won't believe me,</i> Richard realized, <i>I'll just have to show her.</i>  He grabbed the platter, leapt up onto the table in one smooth bound, and slammed it down in front of Johanna just as she was reaching for the last slice of a triple-chocolate pineapple fudge cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Best shape of your life', huh?   Take a look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Johanna looked.  It wasn't pretty.  Her cheeks bulged with cake, crumbs spilled from her mouth, and-- and--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she thought it was some kind of funhouse mirror.  Her face wasn't that round -- her breasts weren't<i> that </i>big -- and down there, half-hidden by the table -- it was impossible!  Her stomach was flat, it has always been flat -- what were though round curves doing there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible,\" she said.  \"No, it's an illusion, it's got to be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the spell began to take hold, but that brief interruption was all Richard needed.  He launched himself at her, knocking her chair over and stunning her against the stone floor, and began to haul her away bodily.   She was <i>heavy!</i>   Even when they'd entered the dungeon, she'd been a muscular woman, and now, with all that fat -- it was a miracle he didn't have a heart attack as he hauled her up the stairs.   Finally, he managed to drag the bloated warrior through the exit just as she was coming to.  His last view of the room -- before he slammed the door shut on those seductive aromas -- was the table Johanna had been seated at.   Amid the piles of untouched food, there was a large area of devastation, bones, and empty dishes.  It looked like it had been hit by a meteor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah,</i> he thought snidely.   <i>A big, fat, furry meteor.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna blinked.  She sat up with difficulty.   \"What happened?  Last thing I remember I was fighting a food golem... and then I ... I was so hungry... and I had this bizarre dream...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was no dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  The warrior looked down at herself.  \"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose you saved any room for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL KILL 'IM!\" Johanna roared.  \"I'LL KILL THE MISERABLE SON OF A BITCH!   Do you know how many sit-ups it took to get those abs and now this-- this -- look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking.  Bit like a furry pillow, isn't it?   And say, where's my thanks for saving your bacon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" the warrior snarled, getting to her feet with some difficulty.  \"We're gonna find whoever's setting these traps, and then I'll <i>personally</i>--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit on him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Grr.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna took one a step, and then gasped.

She began to blush as well, much harder and for different reasons than Richard. She never blushed before. She didn\u2019t like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d Richard asked, turning to look over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna jumped, cupping her nearly exposed, blubbery rumpcheeks in her paws, \u201c<i>WAIT! STOP, DON\u2019T TURN AROUND!</i>\u201d She shrieked in sheer panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Richard obeyed respectfully, she realized what she was feeling just now. While her ass wasn\u2019t completely exposed, a leather thong standing between it and total indecency, in its current state it was still incredibly shameful. She squeezed her pudgy cheeks carefully, whimpering as she felt how much they yielded and squished. She really was\u2026 <i>pillowy</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, \u201cRichard\u2026 It\u2026 okay if you walk in front from now on\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard only nodded, \u201cMmhm\u2026\u201d He replied before suddenly bursting into peals of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you!?\u201d Johanna raged, bearing her fangs at the rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d He gasped, still giggling as he doubled over to catch his breath, \u201cBut\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 don\u2019t you find it funny that all of this seems to be happening to you? And then <i>this</i>\u2026 I mean, come on, talk about a bad day, <i>right</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna glared at him scathingly, clearly not amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard grimaced sharply, \u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d He said, snickering a bit still, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard took the lead, freely smiling now as the barbarian couldn\u2019t see his face. Johanna followed behind, though not too closely, held back by a combination of her newly acquired weight slowing her pace and the shame she still felt after such a humiliating incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked for quite a while it seemed, no noticeable features to define the hallway they now found themselves in besides the many number of torches lining the walls and the way in which the hall seemed to be getting wider and wider the further they travelled. Finally it stopped widening up ahead where a large door spanned the width of the tunnel, a much smaller door located in the wall on their left just before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard stopped several feet before the doors, turning back to look at Johanna who also stopped a fair distance away.<br>\r\n\u201cI bet the big one\u2019s probably locked, if dungeon crawling has taught me anything. I bet I could probably pick it, but after all we\u2019ve been through already, it\u2019ll probably be pretty risky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna frowned at him wearily, \u201cI don\u2019t see you outgrowing your clothes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, after all that <i>you've</i> been through, better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d She said, smirking as she drew closer to the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo which shall it be then?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Richard was busy looking through a leather wrap full of lockpicking implements, selecting a rather large set to get the job done. As he stood before the door however, he couldn\u2019t help but to examine the engravings carved right into its iron surface and be disturbed by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire door seemed to be covered with the intricate designs, all but one of them showing massively obese creatures. They were man and beast alike, most seemingly female, all chained together, and all bowing to the lone, thin figure standing in the center. It was the same menacing robed man the two of them had seen taunting them in the dining hall not too long ago. At the very top of the dreary scene was a long plate spanning the entire face of the door from left to right, engraved with imposing letters reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\"> \u201cThe Master\u2019s Way\u201d</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard tore himself from his observations with a visible shiver, now only looking at the door to find the lock, located right beneath the robed figure\u2019s feet. He immediately began to fumble with the tumblers, seeking to find the mechanism\u2019s weaknesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna groaned, \u201cDo you usually take this long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust have to find\u2026 the right spot\u2026\u201d Richard muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s work-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>GOT IT!</i>\u201d Richard shouted, the mechanism unlocking rather loudly as Johanna yelped in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe podgy wolfess leapt to her feet, padding over to Richard as he let go of the picks and looked up at the large door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them heard a rather loud mechanical noise, a lot like gears spinning and chains pulling, before\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of the racket from the machinery should have been coming from the door in front of them, or maybe the walls to the side, not the floor directly benea-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could come to realize just what this meant, a large trap door spanning the width of the hallway fell open! The barbarian could only howl as she plummeted into the pit and to the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was once more a bit luckier, as in a purely instinctual reaction, he grabbed tightly to his lockpicking tools that were still jammed into the door\u2019s lock. It was a miracle they didn\u2019t break (Considering that it seemed like he went through at least half a dozen lockpicks a day), but he wasn\u2019t exactly thinking of that as he held onto them for dear life. He tried to look back to see what had become of his partner, but he was too afraid of falling to his own doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohanna? Are you alright?!\u201d He called out to her, clenching his teeth as he tried to maintain his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine! It was kind of a long fall!\u201d She called back, \u201cBut I think it might have been\u2026 cushioned a little\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried mumbling the last line, but Richard heard her all the same, \u201cI\u2019m not in the best of positions right now myself, but you said cushioned? Was it by your fa-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! It was\u2026 um, by all these\u2026 bones down here! Yeah, pit\u2019s full of \u2018em it looks like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit dark at the bottom of the hole, but not too dark to be unable to see that it was quite empty, oddly enough. Usually with these things there <i>were</i> a bunch of dead guys at the bottom, but she was sure Richard wasn\u2019t buying it anyways. She temporarily forgot about her own shame though when she looked up and saw her partner dangling above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Richard, you know you can drop down, right?\u201d She yelled up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d He shouted, his feet dangling in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ledge right below you, you great idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue carefully turned to look over his shoulder, indeed seeing a narrow ledge just below his feet. He shook his head at his own foolishness, grunting as he let go of the lockpicking tools and fell to his feet. The shelf he now found himself on seemed to go around the perimeter of the pit, though was only about two feet wide. Protruding from the middle of each side, however, were stone gargoyles that jutted out over the hole, perfect for Richard to crawl onto to get a good view of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna wasn\u2019t pleased to see him peeking his head over the gargoyle however, grinning at her, \u201cSo where exactly are these skeletons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said skeletons, I said bones,\u201d She grunted, looking about the room for an exit and pressing against the walls.<br>\r\n\u201cRight and where are those exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna opened her mouth to protest, but before she could more loud, mechanical noises could be heard, this time all around her. She looked about frantically, mouth agape in terror, half-expecting the walls to slide in and smash her into paste or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead though, golden streams of goo erupted from the mouths of all four gargoyles and began to cascade down into the pit. Johanna gasped as the sticky liquid touched her boots, pulling one of them into the air as strands of the stuff clung to it. Her noise almost instantly picked up on the overwhelmingly sweet aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026 honey?!\u201d She frowned, a puzzled expression forming on her snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really that surprising?\u201d Richard replied, looking at the gargoyle he was now perched on, \u201cIt\u2019s quite a lot like that whole fudge trap, isn\u2019t it? The \u2018Drink or you die\u2019 bit I mean\u2026 You know I was hoping stuff like this would be a lot more creative, besides the fact that they seem to be meant to fatten rather than kill. I <i>guess</i> that part\u2019s different from what you usually see\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna let out a frustrated sigh as she continued to press at the walls, looking for a switch of some kind and ignoring her fellow adventurer for the most part, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s like the fudge trap, except there\u2019s <i>no way out!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was beginning to panic, as even though the room she had become trapped in wasn\u2019t that small, the honey gushing into it from four different sources had already made a fair bit of progress in filling it. The gooey stuff was now past the height of her knees, and rising rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRichard, think of something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Richard almost fell from his perch before retreating back to the ledge. He pulled out his backpack and rummaged through it, looking for\u2026</span></div></div>",

Until then, you'll just have to drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna groaned and bent down.  The honey was lapping at the underside of her gut now, and the <i>last </i>thing she wanted to do was stuff more food into there. But, she reflected, getting fat beats dying anyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guzzled greedily, swallowing quart after quart of sticky golden honey in a series of gigantic, desperate swallows.   She doubled and redoubled her efforts, but the honey kept rising.  It was up to her chin now.  Now she had to stand on tip-toe.  And now it was over her head.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard seized the rope triumphantly.  \"Got it, Jo!\"  He tossed the coil over the edge, keeping a firm grip on the other end -- and was shocked when he felt it go slack almost at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the edge.  The honey was rapidly rising to meet the gargoyles.   The end of the rope trailed into the yellow surface.  Jo was nowhere to be seen.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jo!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing to be done.  She was gone.   All he could do was save himself.   He tossed a coil of rope up, looping it over a wall torch on the second attempt, and pulled himself out of the pit, honey sucking at his heels.  He sunk onto the flagstones, watching as the golden lake brimmed over the edge of the pit and stopped, as if some hidden pressure mechanism had been triggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Jo,\" Richard sighed.  \"I'll tell everyone you died heroically.  And, hell.  I'll tell you you stayed thin to the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a great globbering splut from the pit, and something surfaced.  At first, Richard thought it was a monster.  Then, he realized the truth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay in a dead man's float, even more bloated than she had been a few minutes ago, her eyes glazed in every sense of the world -- but alive.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna, you made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe belched, a few yellowish bubbles drifting upward.  \"Never... eating honey... again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the gods you're all right!  I thought -- that is, I thought I was trapped here.  Now, er... if you could just lie there for another couple of minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to stand <i>somewhere</i> while I finish up with this lock,\" Richard said, carefully climbing onto the sticky, round hill of Johanna's belly.   \"Sorry!  Don't move, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna hiccupped.  Richard lost his footing as the mass beneath him twitched, and he slid down one slippery flank into the honey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glub!  Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oops</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond time being the charm, Richard eventually managed to get through the lock, and on the other side of the door, the adventurers discovered--</span></div></div>",

Speaking of which\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Give me a hand here!\u201d Johanna sputtered as she futilely tried to pull herself from the pit, but even with her originally impressive muscles, they weren\u2019t strong enough to free her from the gooey pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne sec Jo,\u201d Richard sighed as he turned around and grabbed hold of his rather sticky companion\u2019s paw. Oddly enough, thanks to the sticky honey that covered both of them, he was able to retain his footing and grip on the wolf-woman, and pull her from the honey\u2026 Even if she was dragged across the floor with a large trail of honey left in her wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, this is disgusting,\u201d Johanna grumbled as she lifted up her leather top slightly to get some of the honey out from underneath it. \u201cI got honey in places I didn\u2019t even know I had!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Richard grumbled as he ran a hand through his hair and shook his hand to get a good amount of honey out of it. \u201cI\u2019m not that big of a fan of honey\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard would\u2019ve continued but he noticed that Johanna was now licking her right arm, getting the honey out of her fur. \u201cI thought you said that you weren\u2019t going to eat honey again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not gonna walk around with honey on me,\u201d Johanna replied after she gulped down a mouthful of honey. \u201c\u2018Sides, it\u2019d be a waste\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes full of clothes changing and licking later, the two heroes stood in the large room, with Richard dressed in a spare set of clothes and Johanna still wearing her ever tightening clothes and leather armor. With Richard in front of her and her form not entirely covered in honey anymore (there were a few places that she couldn\u2019t reach, places she\u2019d rather not clean with Richard in the room), she got a look at her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer leather top was barely able to contain the massive furry orbs that she called her breasts, with the two mammaries peaking out from underneath it and resting atop of her now bulbous gut \u2013 Her six pack had disappeared a little bit ago, but she missed not seeing that dome. She could feel that her thighs were so think that she could feel them squish against each other as she stood there behind Richard, she didn\u2019t even want to imagine what the damage was for her behind, but she could feel from the breeze she felt that her butt had ripped her pants even further and even her tail seemed to be a bit thicker too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nowhere else to go but forward,\u201d Richard said, breaking the barbarian wolfess\u2019s assessment of her figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right\u2026 So, what\u2019s with that door?

As the only light source here seemed to be from the formerly open door, he fumbled about his pack before pulling free a torch, thankfully untouched by the honey he had been submerged in. He quickly lit the thing using years of accumulated torch-lighting experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh! That\u2019s better,\u201d He said, scratching his chin habitually as he looked about the area. Unfortunately he still couldn't make out too much, even with the aid of his torch. The room was simply too big it seemed, and even as he walked forwards there wasn't much else to see besides the floor an ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat sort of trickery is this now?\u201d The rogue wondered out loud, \u201cSome sort of hex to make the room impossible to navigate perhaps\u2026 Or maybe mind games, is that it!\u201d He shouted as he waved the torch about in every direction and spinning wildly in an attempt to find anything that could be used as a landmark and slamming his head right into a stone wall as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGodsdammit! What wassat?!\u201d He grunted through gritted teeth as he rubbed his bruised forehead, his from lessening once he spotted a torch held upon the newly discovered wall. Instinctively, and perhaps recklessly, he brought his own lit torch to it, igniting the sconce with shared flame and making it just a bit easier to see in the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd that\u2019s better too, I guess\u2026\u201d He muttered to himself before his eyes looked to his left further down the wall just in time to see the next torch light spontaneously by itself, followed by the one after it. As Richard turned to look, it seemed every torch on both sides of the room were bursting to life through some kind of magical chain reaction, fully illuminating it from wall to wall, \u201cI take that back: <i>Much, much better!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rogue\u2019s delight soon turned to awe as he looked down the length of the room, finding that it was actually an enormous hallway, one not only quite wide, but so long that he couldn't even make out then end, even as the torches continued to ignite in the far distance. It was, by and far, the largest corridor the rogue had ever seen, lined on both sides by many, many torches and doors. \u201cBy Sol-Ra\u2019s light! Isn't this incredible Johanna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe human rogue turned to look back behind him, \u201cJohanna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA cold chill ran up Richard\u2019s spine. It shouldn't have taken nearly this long for the chubby wolfess to answer the door guardian\u2019s questions, even if she was one to favor brawn over wit most of time, \u201cYou\u2019ll be through the door any minute now, right Jo\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut the only response Richard received was the soft echo of his own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nRichard\u2019s question didn't fall upon deaf ears however, and while the one who had heard him knew the answer, it was nowhere near whom the rogue was expecting. This was because Johanna was now far away from her companion and growing even farther still as slid down a chute leading deeper and deeper into the bowels of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother had heard however, just as he now saw the tubby wolf woman as she slid howling down the watery stone shaft. He waved a gnarled and trembling hand over his scrying glass as a closer view of the terrified adventurer appeared beneath its curved surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarvellous\u2026\u201d The Lipomancer\u2019s rattling breath wheezed, \u201cShe\u2019s going further and further down the wrong way\u2026 You\u2019re on the fast track now my dear\u2026\u201d He hissed, his claw-like nails caressing the crystal globe, \u201cAnd there\u2019s no hope for you at the end of it\u2026 You will give in to your gluttonous nature just as those before you... And then, you will be mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe robed figure bent over the globe suddenly, one hand splayed over the surface of the table as the other rose before his cowl. Loud, retching coughs filled the dark room as he shook and gasped, but it passed just as quickly as it began, \u201cBut while the outcome is certain, the journey is still to be written\u2026 What will it be then wolf? The Wretched Larder perhaps? \u2026maybe the dragon\u2019s den? No\u2026 She is past those already\u2026\u201d He whispered, tapping the scrying glass, \u201cShe\u2019s going all the way to the bottom, but where\u2026?\u201d</span></div></div>",

We are drowning in here, and you're interrupting me!\", she then noticed the door opening, she tried to sit up, but had some trouble due to a bellyful of thick, heavy fudge.After a quick giggle from Richard, and a snarl from Johanna, he helped her up and they started to walk down the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Johanna looked down at her body. To her horror, the tight leather shirt that covered her whole chest had risen, and now a bloated belly was clearly showing. She looked at her hands, they were all pudgy, and her thighs were fat too. It looked like she had gained almost fifty pounds, and somehow all of this had happened in less than half an hour. She was very surprised, and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud groaning noise echoed from somewhere in the cave, it took a few moments for the two adventurers to realize that it was Johanna\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like someone has a hungry tummy, yes?\u201d Richard grinned, rubbing her stomach.

Just for a moment mind you.\" Johanna added, trying to maintain her facade of anger as she fought off a food coma. She leaned against a nearby wall and slumped to the ground, her large, fudge filled belly wobbling out in front of her. Richard sat down next to her and whipped out his pack. Inside he had a few sets of dry rations, enough to last for about a week of solid adventuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping one of the pouches for himself, he tossed another to Johanna, landing it square on top of her swollen belly which sloshed noisily as the fudge shifted around inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh.....\" the wolfess moaned. \"Careful there. I'm packed so tight I think I'll explode.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed a furry paw on one side, wincing at the pressure. Now that the adrenaline from the danger had worn off, she had rapidly become aware of just how full she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when are you due?\" chuckled Richard, earning a growl from Johanna in response, which quickly changed to a whimper as it made her gut jiggle heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help.\" offered the rogue. \"You probably swallowed a lot of air when you were lapping up the fudge. I know a thing or two that might help alleviate the pressure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess wanted to protest, but the odd desire to have her belly rubbed killed the words in her throat. She tensed a little as Richard pushed a hand in on either side of her stomach, bracing for the uncomfortable rise in pressure that would follow. None came. Instead, Johanna let out large belch and the pressure level dropped dramatically, her belly receding a few inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. I knew there had to be a gas pocket in there somewhere.\" Richard said smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm not completely useless now doesn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna smirked. \"Yeah, yeah, just keep rubbing and we'll see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogues are known for deft fingers, and Richard was no exception. He slowly caressed every inch of Johanna's swollen middle, touching key points that seemed to cause any pain the wolf girl experienced to evaporate straight into the air. Johanna merely laid back against the wall, her eyes closed, enjoying every minute of the massage. Richard smiled, enjoying his work just as much as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you look really cute when you're all bloated and helpless.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Johanna would have beaten up anyone that called her cute, let alone \"bloated and helpless\", but she didn't care right now. She was so full and tired, and right now seemed like a great time to just drift off to sleep....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johanna?

Gotta figure anything is possible.\" the Wolfess replied, hacking at the plants in her way angrily. A sort of whistling sound was heard through the leaves and bushes as soon as she destroyed some vines that blocked the trail. A golden brown, viscous liquid was pouring out of them. It was sticky, like honey, but smelled nothing like Honey. \"What is this stuff?\" Johanna asked as Richard picked up a piece of the vine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely sure. Syrup of some sort?\" Richard suggested, sniffing the stump of the vine that oozed the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever they are, if they get in my way, I cut them down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that's the best course of action, milady,\" Richard replied, throwing the Vine down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove him right, the trees began to shake as seven vines lowered themselves from the branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Richard?\" Johanna called, looking over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard readied his weapons as a Vine shot forth. Instead of targeting Richard, however, the Vines seemed to be \"focused\" on Johanna. Perhaps in anger for cutting down part of the trees. Four of the vines wrapped around Johanna's arms and legs, and with considerable force, pulled her limbs away from one another, rendering her in a spread-eagle position. She wiggled her fingers in a vain attempt to do something as the other three positioned themselves near her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're going to rip me apart!!\" Johanna panicked, as her theory was disproven when two vines began trying to pry her mouth open. She resisted as much as she possibly could, to no avail as they forced open her jaw and slid into her mouth. The third vine wrapped around her muzzle to prevent escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of \"ripping her apart\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vines began pouring that odd Syrup from their tips, filling Johanna's cheeks relatively quickly. She had no choice but to swallow to prevent an overflow, or worse. Trapped in an ordeal similar to the Fudge Trap. This time there was no puzzle to stop the problem. Strangely, another vine lowered itself from the leaves above and moved towards Johanna's bulging belly. As the syrup filled her, she looked down to notice her stomach was wobbling as she both packed on pounds and was inflated with the Syrupy Goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone vine began stroking her gut, almost affectionately, almost like it wanted to be her friend. This one's tip began glowing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard stood by and watched on with an odd mixture of harmless curiosity and mortal terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could either cut down the vines, which may enrage them, and cause them to target <i>him,</i> or he could allow them to do as they pleased with Johanna, potentially pacifying them and allowing the two to continue moving, unless of course Johanna couldn't move by the time this was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna, however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Johanna felt the strangest she ever did in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was pumped full of sweet Syrup, she looked down at the lone Vine stroking her gut. Something came over her, and she began wanting, no, *needing* more! She shuddered as she felt an alleviation of pressure in her midsection. This meant she was a long ways away from being full again! Regardless, she watched on as she continued inflating with this syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression changed from horror, to an odd sense of pleasure. She sighed best she could, smiled, and relaxed, sucking in the sweet, viscous liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looked up at Johanna. The Vines turned her around for Richard to see. He noticed that, somehow she was enjoying herself! Richard lowered his weapons in confusion as another vine comically nudged him in the shoulder. He looked at it as it reeled back in surprise. Richard dropped his weapons regardless and watched. He didn't want the Vines sicked on HIM, nor did he desire to get on Johanna's bad side, emotionally and physically invested as she was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly began to sag downwards, the only thing slowing it was the occasional pause to digest, which caused her arms and legs to thicken slightly. Her bosom grew at a crawl, hardly matching her gigantic gut. Johanna moaned as she felt her belly and breasts push her leather armor up, eventually snapping the straps that held it together. Her top fell off of her and landed with a quiet thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"rrrrRRRIIIIIIIP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer leather trousers followed suit, splitting down the sides and floating gently to the soft earth below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should do something right about now...\" Richard murmured. It was odd how, even as he watched, something inside him wanted this to go on, rather than stopping it. He could just sneak away and come back unseen to cut the vines down, but... with the number of vines in here alone, how many were in this forest?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna shook her head slowly, hearing Richard's comment. Something in the Syrup, possible something about the sugars, were making her addicted to this punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly jiggled wildly as it made contact with the ground. She moaned loudly and shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing her acceptance, the vines on her left wrist released her arm and she moved it to her belly to gently groom her fur, sinking into the soft flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you not full yet?\" Richard chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna shrugged casually and went back to drinking from the vines. One thing did enter her mind though: As amazing as this felt, how would she move around if she didn't stop soon? How would she move around *now*?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes bulged in realization, but also realized it was far too late for her. It was too late, ergo, she had two options. Ask the Vines to release her, having done enough, or get some payback: Suck the Vines completely dry, and kill them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A would leave her with a longing for more of the Syrup, and her mobility would not allow her to move on anyways.<br>\r\nOption B would allow her to savor the Syrup Vines' gift, get revenge, get even larger/softer, but she'll still be unable to move...</span></div></div>",

Her belly bounces lightly, shaking violently as it spreads out on the ground beneath her. Her legs and arms thickening with her. Whatever was left of her toned muscle was now long gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Barbarian now greedily slurped at the vines, and she began to become heavier than what the vines on her wrists and ankles could hold! She fell onto her bottom without a sound, her entire body sloshing with the syrup inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought she was victorious, the other vines attacked, shoving themselves into her mouth. She didn't account for those...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speed of growth was now at maximum. She looked over, pleadingly at Richard. \"Go! Get out of here, don't worry about me!\" she seemed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whimpered as she began to become \"taller\", her bottom and thighs now lifting her upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard frowned and picked up his weapons. \"Release her!\" he commanded, \"You've already done enough!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna continued to sate her appetite/addiction, rubbing her soft belly in victory, regardless of the fact that she was not, in fact, victorious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vines seemed to acknowledge Richard's Command, but they refused to stop. \"Why are they doing this...?\" Richard muttered, preparing his throwing knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna was reaching the pinnacle of her pleasure at this point, moaning loudly as vines caressed her and filled her to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should have already exploded by now, or had wanted to fight back a long time ago... why wasn't she? Why were all the traps here involved with food? Why only target Johanna? Who was behind all of this, and what was his motivation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more importantly, why was he so... turned on by all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and looked up at Johanna and the vines. \"Release her, please... for now. I want answers to the questions I seek!\" he pleaded. The Vines pulled away, temporarily retreating except for two. Johanna groaned in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jo, are you okay?\" Richard asked, deeply worried. He rushed to her side and pressed a hand into her gargantuan stomach. She actually <i>giggled</i> as he rubbed her gut. Talk about a fierce personality change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, never better...\" Johanna replied, trying to hug Richard, but finding she lacked the reach to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're pretty much down for the count... what should we do now?\" Richard replied, crawling up onto her belly to get a better look at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any Ideas? I myself am... actually quite... tired,\" Johanna said with a deep yawn. She smiled at Richard and looked \"down\" at her massive body. \"I could use the conversation, though.\" she added somberly, trying to move but failing. All she had mobility with was her neck, head, jaws, eyes, you get it. She could wiggle her toes and fingers, and slightly move her arms up and down, but that was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard mindlessly stroked her soft, furry tummy before snapping out of whatever funk he was in. \"Oh? Well, I think it would be best if I ventured out. I need to find help, or whoever is doing all of this!\" he snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it would be for the best, but you *are* leaving me all alone out here with the vines. They seem friendly enough before I chopped them up, and... apparently they don't want me dead right now either. I'm sure tons of adventurers are trying to make their ways through the caves. We should wait and see if any backup arrives.\" Johanna explained. Richard pondered this for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Angry, Pushy, Bitchy... no offense,\" Richard said, noting that Johanna was an Anthropomorphic Wolf...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Johanna replied, putting her facade of irritation and hostility back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's changed, what are you talking about?\" Johanna said, scoffing in mock disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're faking. You laughed, you were smiling, moaning. Something about *this*,\" Richard explained, patting Jo's belly, \"Brought something out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna looked down in frustration, sighing, before her friendly, cute side came back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, alright?\" she apologized, \"I'm sorry for everything. I was just... driven. Angry, determined. I need the Adrenaline to keep going! But, now that *this* has happened, I can barely move, let alone fight something or someone... I'm giving up.\" she clarified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard sat and contemplated what was said, and how he was feeling at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've succeeded so many times, but this... this is a failure!\" Johanna cried, her senses leaving the addiction as she became fully aware of just what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard couldn't bear to hear Johanna wallow in this self pity. Unsure of whether it was annoyance, or if he was hurting for her, he did something surprising, something even he didn't quite think through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard slammed his lips into Johanna's and placed a hand in her long, blonde hair. Maintaining this intimate contact for a minute, he slowly pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ri-Richard?!\" Johanna stuttered, eyes bulging as she eyed this Human Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard sighed and said...</span></div></div>",

I'm going to be sore, this much I know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard chuckled and nodded in agreement. \"Alright, but when our little nap is over, I need to find some help!\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna was still blushing, thinking about what Richard had said.

As he regained full-awareness, he looked up to see that it was Johanna, still sound asleep. He smiled at this sight. She was so beautiful when she was sleeping. Richard buried his head into her neck and sneaked in a little kiss, curling up and relaxing. He dozed off a few times, thanks to the wonderful warmth radiated by Johanna's new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, something in the forest caught Richard's eye. It wasn't a vine, or a feral animal. It seemed to walk upright, and was headed towards them! He drew his weapons swiftly and pointed one out into the forest as a warning. \"That's close enough!\" he barked. Johanna was rudely awoken by this shouting, but calmed down once she laid eyes on Richard. Of course, she went into defensive mode when she saw the pointed weapon, and snarled in an attempt to look menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the woods... was an Anthropomorphic Fox, with snowy white fur. She was draped in a brown, dirty robe that covered her lithe frame rather nicely. She pulled down her hood and smiled. \"Well, you two look so cute together!\" she said with a little squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Why are you here?\" Johanna inquired with a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Serena...\" she said, maintaining her friendly smile. Richard noted that on her robe, the top-left corner of the torso, there was some kind of strange insignia. Nothing he could really describe, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard... and this is Johanna,\" Richard finally said. \"What is that on your Robe?\" he inquired with a mixture of curiosity and anxiousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena looked down and searched her robe until she found the insignia. Her eyes widened as she realized what *exactly* she was wearing, in front of these two. She wracked her mind for an answer that, while still completely truthful, wouldn't panic the Rogue and his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, spit it out!\" Johanna ordered, narrowing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena took a deep breath and said... \"I'm one of the Lipomancer's ex-Students...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lipomancer?\" Richard muttered to himself, sounding out the syllables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also known as the master of this Cave, and the surrounding area...\" Serena clarified, with a nervous shrug and casual, yet still guilty grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard put the pieces together.

One look at her dead-serious glare, and that was enough to deter Richard... for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not risk a confrontation, shall we?\" Serena suggested, throwing her hands up in surrender. \"Whatever questions you have, feel free to ask!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna bit her lip. \"Richard, I'll ask the questions, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard kept his eyes on her. \"Alright, but the first funny move she makes against us and she dies!\" he warns. He takes a seat on Johanna's ginormous gut and relaxes as best he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna smiles, feeling Richard sitting against her belly. She blushes lightly before returning to reality. \"Firstly,\" Johanna said, holding up one finger for emphasis...<br>\r\n\"Who exactly is the Lipomancer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena nods, acknowledging the question. \"The Lipomancer is the Arch-Mage of this region. The amount of things he commands are not endless, but quite numerous. A Temple, a few castles, this cave... it's said that he's hiding treasure beyond your wildest dreams somewhere, but he wouldn't tell me where, or what it was.\" she elucidates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna gives a partial nod before holding up her second finger. \"Secondly: Why are you his Student?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena gives this question some thought. \"I'm aware of the purpose and effects of these traps. I myself was a victim of them,\" she explains with a nervous chuckle. \"I was just a beggar with an undiscovered skill in the magical arts. I stumbled upon this very cave one day, and went inside to escape the thunderstorm that day. Eventually, I came to the Fudge Trap. As you knew, I was a beggar. I wasn't the brightest, then. I couldn't solve it, and so I had to swallow as much of the fudge as I could to keep from drowning completely in it. Let's just say... I was five times <i>your</i> size when it finally shut off. I remember crying and crying for hours, trying to move. The Lipomancer found me and forced me to swear loyalty to him. I wasn't in a position to say no. He threatened to kill me!\" Serena explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't ask for a life-story, Miss,\" Richard retorted rather rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena frowned at him and continued, \"He later discovered my hidden abilities and made a deal with me. He'd agree to slowly shrink me back, a little bit every day, if I'd become his apprentice, to carry on his work. I agreed, and... within a few months, here I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna raised a third finger. \"Thirdly, why are the traps here meant to increase weight at such a rapid pace, and why target me and me only? What about Richard?\" she inquired, partly to tease Richard, who elbowed her belly affectionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena looked around cautiously before continuing. \"The Lipomancer doesn't have any interest in killing those unlucky enough to fall into his elaborate ruses. And, it's pretty damn hard to restrain a powerful, strong person with ropes. That and you can't force them to sell themselves as his eternal slaves when tied up and left at that. The Lipomancer decided to use... unique... magic to increase the WEIGHT of adventurers, to the point of immobility. That, and it's pretty hilarious to see you guys slowly gain, as you try to march on to the treasure, only to inevitably end up immobile, and slaves to the Lipomancer,\" Serena said with a haughty laugh at the end, \"That, and he told me that is was a real turn-on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's eyes widened at the idea of this. \"Hell no, I'm not being used as this old coot's pleasure object!?!\" she shouted in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jo, calm down. If anyone's going to take you away, they have to go through me first.\" Richard said, gently rubbing her belly, comforting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyways... that brings me to my fourth and final question for now...\" Johanna said, holding up her fourth finger. \"Why are you telling us all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena bit her lip angrily, bad memories flooding back. \"I escaped. I thought I had it all, working for this guy. When I saw what he was doing with other people, the work that he made them do, and that he wasn't ever bluffing about killing people... I had to run away. I know these caves, the temples, the castles, like the back of my hand. Even better, I can control body weight just like the Lipomancer. I can try to reverse the effects of the vines on Johanna, so she can move again. But we have to hurry and get out of here. The Lipomancer sees everything. He's been trying to apprehend me for weeks, and I've already helped several others escape. I need you to trust me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard and Johanna exchanged looks for a brief moment before returning their gaze to Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reverse this, best you can. But I still want that treasure!\" Johanna said, steely determination in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((<b>AUTHOR'S NOTE: Magicaster888 here! I'm not intentionally trying to get the story off it's original WG/Inflation track, but I do not believe that Weight Gain must occur in every. single. chapter. For me, it's about world-building, character development and introduction. We have the power of choice at our fingertips in this and many other stories. We should use it for it's greatest potential. I introduced an Ex-Student of the Lipomancer to help out and advance the plot. To help counter some traps, and get hit with traps herself! I want these characters to find that treasure and come home true heroes for defeating the Lipomancer, but that doesn't mean that the story is derailed. There will be plenty of weight gain, both voluntary and involuntary, and it'll be a long journey. If you want to support this storyline, feel free to contribute!</b></span></div></div>",

We'd need a bloody army!\" Serena advises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna and Richard cannot be swayed. \"We'll make do. You can help us if anything bad happens. Reversing trap effects, right?\" Johanna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena just facepalmed. \"Alright, we'll try to run for the treasure. Hold still, Richard, can you get off of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard hops off and Serena approaches. \"This may have a slight tickle to it. Not sure if It's painful or not...\" Serena says, placing both hands in Johanna's massive stomach and rubbing delicately with glowing hands. \"This should work...\" she mumbles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Johanna feels an odd, tingling sensation as her body begins to lose the weight! She smiles like an idiot when she finally feels strong enough to stand. She continued to drop the weight until she slowed to a halt. Her thighs and arms were still pretty thick, and her belly was the size of a very large exercise ball. All in all, she was still extremely obese, but it was light enough for travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... nude, right now. I don't think it's the best idea to completely reverse this, for the sake of body temperature, and decency's sake.\" Serena chuckles, patting Johanna's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna herself snarled in anger. \"You agreed to reverse it as best you could, I know you're holding back!\" she barked. Richard jumped in between them to forestall an escalation to the physical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jo, please, she's got a point. Besides... I think you're really beautiful like this,\" said Richard, who blushed at that last comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna took a deep breath and settled down, smiling at Richard. \"Thank you, you really think so?\" she asked, returning the blush while scratching her belly with one hand and putting the other on her hip seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I think we should go before you two get sidetracked again... I called off the vines, but if the Lipomancer overrides that...\" Serena warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard simply gave Johanna a pat on the side of her belly and nodded. \"Yes, we should get going. Which way?\" he inquired, and Serena turned her heads to the left and the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena snapped her fingers and finally began to speak. \"On the right, we have the path that you guys took to get here. We can go through that flower-field, but the Pollen is pretty damn intoxicating. You two will be 'rolling in satin sheets' for days if you catch my drift. That and the pollen also has an effect on the waistline if ingested. Stay close to me and we'll be fine. Our line of sight will be MUCH better, besides,\" she elucidated for the two adventurers.<br>\r\n\"On our LEFT, we'll continue into the forest, but I believe there is a cabin there. A few of the Lipomancer's 'employees' will be of service, providing food... untainted of course, because we eat the same stuff they have to... and bed. We can get some good, safe, uninterrupted rest there and ask for directions later.</span></div></div>",

Faster, more accurate travel to their right, at risk of falling under the spell of the local flora.<br>\r\nTo their left, more delayed travel speed to a cabin. If what Serena said was true, they'd have a safe place to rest up. However it was still risky. The Lipomancer could have warned the \"employees\" stationed at the cabin. Shrugging, Johanna decided to risk it and head to the cabin. \"It seems like a good idea. We can trust Serena, right?\" Johanna said, dragging out that final word with a glare at Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can trust me, but if you try to hurt me with a bad excuse, I'll balloon you out like you wouldn't believe,\" Serena cautioned with a lighthearted snicker, \"Nothing severe, though. When I use my magic it is only in good fun, rather than a trap for enslavement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's ears perked up at this. Two parts Anger, two parts Shock. She shook her head and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the alleged cabin was a long one. Johanna had to stop to take a breather about thrice before Serena took pity and cast another spell. Instead of dropping weight however, Johanna only found her endurance, and her strength, renewed and bolstered! \"How did you...\" she inquired, cocking her head in a canine fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't learn JUST the lipomancer's spells. You pick a few skills up here and there!\" Serena replied with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two are done chatting, I think I see the cabin!\" Richard exclaims excitedly as he runs towards the wooden lodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two caught up, Richard knocked on the door and Serena stepped in front. Answering the door was an antropomorphic lioness. Richard's eyes widened when he took one look at her gigantic gut, which was probably her largest feature, sagging down to her knees. She was still mobile... somehow, even with her large body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I didn't know we were to have visitors! Please, come inside, you must be starving!\" the lioness said, unaware of her visitors' current predicament...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, we're just here to stay the night. We'll be gone in the morning,\" Richard responded with a kind nod of the head. The lioness frowned sadly in realization. \"Oh, that's right. You've been eluding the Master's traps all day.\" she muttered in contempt for the Lipomancer. \"My name is Stacy, pleasure to make your acquaintance!\" she then added, extending her hands for Richard and Johanna, who both shook them out of respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food here... it doesn't... you know...?\" Johanna inquired, to Stacy's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! The food we eat, you eat. If we ate *that* sort of food we wouldn't be able to maintain the lodge!\" she replied, putting a pudgy hand to her thick chest where her heart would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Richard asked, looking to Johanna and Serena, \"Eat or Sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like a meal, if you don't mind!\" Serena pleaded, walking over to a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we *reaallly* risk it?\" Johanna questioned, putting a hand on her wide hip.</span></div></div>",

Two to One, overruled!\" she announced victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena rolled her eyes and followed the two downstairs to the basement. It was an almost excessively roomy space, with high ceilings and oversized beds. As Richard went to sit in one of them, Serena cleared her throat loudly to gain his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Stacy's bed,\" she said. \"Most of these beds are assigned to staff. You can tell by the belongings on the nightstands,\" she added as she gestured to a book resting on the nightstand. Sure enough, Stacy's name was written on the spine in some kind of oddly colored ink. A diary, possibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there any free beds?\" Richard inquired. At that moment, Stacy delicately waddled down the stairs, gripping the railings for dear life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only have two. Not many people come by here, and those two were reserved for our next... \"coworkers\"...\" she answered with a chuckle, in an attempt to lighten the mood and situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dibs on that first one!\" Serena immediately called aloud, dashing over to it to mark it as hers for the night. Johanna slapped a hand to her forehead and sighed as she stared at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That leaves just that one... Johanna, I insist you take it. I can sleep on the floor.\" Richard said, taking her hand in his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we... umm...\" Johanna whispered with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share the bed? No. It wouldn't fit both of us. You're about as big as the other people here. The bed was made for you. I can sleep on the floor, milady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena just casually listened to the exchange, examining her nails casually when she hit upon an idea. A brilliant one that could serve as a solution to this issue, and a way to get back at Johanna for her nasty attitude towards her. Not sure how Johanna would react if she *told* her the plan, but she knew it'd be much worse if she surprised the Wolfess. </span></div></div>",

Make *me* the bed?\" she said with a low chuckle and a grin. Her laughter became more and more awkward as she processed that Serena wasn't even moving in the slightest to tell her she was wrong. \"Oh no...\" Johanna said, narrowing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard shrugged. \"If it'll accomplish the goal, I'm all for it,\" the human Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna took a step back. \"No, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard pulled her back gently, \"Relax, Jo... I'm sure you might actually like it.\" he said in an attempt to sound comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna eyed him strangely for a moment before she exhaled. \"I can't believe I'm doing this,\" she said. Serena's ears perked up in excitement as she approached, waving her hands to gather arcane energies. \"I'm doing this for Richard. Not you!\" Johanna added, pointing a finger in Serena's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena nodded in respect. \"I understand. Could you please move to the back, where there's more room?\" she asked, gliding a hand in the direction aforementioned. There was actually another room beyond a door. Storage, but right now, for some unknown reason it was pretty much empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? An empty storage room?\" Richard asked, turning around to face Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness scratched her neck nervously, \"We're awaiting shipments from another part of the Lipomancer's territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna blinked before standing in the center of the room, awaiting Serena's spell. \"Before you ask, which I know you probably would have, I am sure that I want to do this!\" she declared. Stacy just turned and waddled to her bed and sat down. Richard held her hand, and Serena closed the door with her foot as she finished charging her spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then. This won't even hurt a single bit!\" Serena chirped, sliding her hands across the air and releasing her arcane energy in Johanna's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most. Unorthodox Way. To make a bed... I have ever had to bear witness to.\" Richard snickered, earning another blush of embarrassment from Johanna. Since the incident out in the forest, she had really lightened up around him. Johanna knew this. She actually kinda liked the feeling. It wasn't something she'd charge into battle thinking about, but... she simply felt at peace with Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna began feeling a strange sensation in her gut. She looked down to see that it was once again growing. This time, she didn't worry, she didn't kick or scream, and it wasn't an addictive like the Vines. She giggled quietly to herself and rested a hand on the \"shelf\"/top of her belly. She turned her head to examine her rear, which was also expanding outwards. This was a full-body experience, clearly. Bringing her vision back to her growing belly, she couldn't resist any longer. She cracked a toothy smile. \"Whatever you're doing...\" Johanna murmured to Serena, \"You do it well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard held Jo's other hand, but once he saw that she was comfortable, he let go and brought his hand to her back, which he gently began rubbing. \"How long will this take?\" Richard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena only grinned and closed her eyes. \"However long you want it to take. You two enjoy each other's company!\" she said, stopping the channeling of energy. Johanna was still growing at a steady pace regardless as Serena took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna turned to Richard. They were of pretty similar heights. Jo only had about an inch or so on him, so their eyes were able to meet without much effort. Richard put the side of his fist, at the thumb, to his mouth to stifle a snicker. \"To think that only yesterday my life was normal.\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo giggled in response, \"I know, right? Yesterday I was a thin, muscular, all-powerful Bitch with a giant axe and a cold attitude. Now look at me: A big fat softy in both meanings of 'softy'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard grinned as Jo's belly pressed against his. He tried to lean forwards to kiss Johanna, but found that his path was too obstructed. He settled for a light smooch on the top of Jo's gut. \"Yes, but you're my softy.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna sat down on the ground. It was probably just her, but the ground felt rather comfortable! Johanna spread her legs and let her belly rest on the ground. As her body grew in all directions, Richard stepped back and took it all in. Eventually Johanna reached the size she was when Serena first found the two, yet she was still going! \"Um, Jo, honey?\" Richard said, scratching his head and ruffling his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna seemed oblivious to the issue, though she still responded. \"Something the matter?\" she questioned as she brought both hands to rest atop each other, on her ginormous belly. Richard shook his head. It was probably nothing. Just Serena being Serena...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, conversation was exchanged. Primarily about Johanna and Richard's pasts, family, friends, and hobbies. Eventually however, Johanna stopped her growth, double her prior weight! It was miraculous that her arms could move at all, but Johanna managed to do so, patting her gut to invite Richard over. He snickered again and climbed up, giving her a kiss on her muzzle, before wrapping his arms around her neck and bringing her in for a \"hug\". She nuzzled his cheek and sighed contentedly, beginning to doze off. With the rest of her strength she pulled her arms up and over Richard, blanketing him in her embrace. Richard took a deep breath and caught scent of Jo's long, blonde hair. It smelled oddly sweet, of herbs, most likely. Finally, Richard closed his eyes and gave himself to the slumber...</span></div></div>",

He appeared fast asleep, still snuggled against Jo's body. Johanna lowered her head down to his cheek and gave it a small kiss. Richard seemed almost angelic in his sleep... an attribute appropriately deceptive for a Rogue of his Caliber. Truth be told he was really awake, but was feigning slumber in fear that if Johanna knew he was up, then this moment together would end. He didn't feel like getting up, quite honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna chuckled softly. \"I know you're awake,\" she whispered in Richard's ear. He grunted and rolled onto his side to look into Jo's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning...\" he replied, lifting a hand up and placing it against Jo's cheek. \"I suppose you want me to go get Serena now?\" he inquired with a disappointed groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna shook her head slowly. \"Not right this minute,\" she responded. \"I doubt she's even awake,\" she adds, turning her head in the direction of a clock on the wall. The room was quite dark, so it was hard to tell what time it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard aided her in finding out the time. \"By the gods, it's only 6:00 AM...\" he chuckled, sitting up partially, using his elbow for support. Really he was reclining against Johanna's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna just stay here a minute, or should we wake Serena up?\" Johanna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard wanted to swiftly say no, but he realized that the earlier they leave, the better chance they have at finding the treasure before sundown.

A cover for her raging thoughts regarding that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she settled down and replied. \"I'd love that, more than anything!\" she finally said, holding back another snicker. \"That is if we get out of here,\" Johanna added with a roll of the eyes.

Jo began to moan quietly as she closed her eyes. Richard was massaging her shoulders, working his way to the top of her belly as he remained locked in the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sound of a door opening was heard. \"Am I interrupting something?\" said a familiar voice as the Lipomancer's ex-Student entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard rolled his eyes and partially broke the kiss, keeping his head close to Johanna's. \"What is it now, Serena?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing.

I don't want to ruin this for you guys!\" the white fox-woman replied as she stepped back outside and wheeled in a tray with food on it. \"Feel free to eat when you are ready, and meet us upstairs.\" And with that, she left the two alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna smirked and pressed her lips back against Richard's. She thought to herself... \"I can eat later... right now, he's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lovers would continue their little date for about another two hours, most of it spent eating and talking, until Richard eventually hopped off of Johanna.

She knew that, without any way to fight back, and without anyone else to help her, she was pretty much doomed. She would struggle for some time until she felt something that horrified her. She felt her belly brush against the ground. She froze in mortal terror as she realized just how much Syrup was in her now. She wouldn't be able to move, ergo, unable to escape if she somehow got out of *these* vines' grasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tear, she resigned to her fate, all struggling ceased as the vines continued their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, she gained next to nothing in her face. The one bit of solace she was permitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vines sensed her pain, and one blew a strange powder in her face. Within five minutes, something strange was occurring inside her mind. A mixture of thoughts both positive and negative were at war with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's no escape, Johanna. You know it perfectly well. If you are to perish within the next few hours, would you spend them wallowing in shame?</i> she asked herself. A smirk managed to escape her as she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If this is my dying day, I want to enjoy this. Savor every last moment...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna, in spite of her common sense, began chugging the Syrupy liquid, moaning as her stomach spread out across the ground below her. Her arms, legs, and bosom inflated as well. Something in the Syrup was causing it to immediately become fat! Not like it mattered, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna growled in pleasure as all mobility was lost in her body, now a massive blob suspended by multiple vines that were not cut down by Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showed no signs of stopping at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna lost all concept of time, consumed by her greed for more... The Vines acknowledged her acceptance and lowered her down, releasing her arms and legs and letting her rub her belly with glee. She didn't care if this never stopped! She came here for treasure, glory, fame... but if she wasn't to get it the conventional way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may as well become the biggest Wolfess in existence! Johanna consciously fought back the impending Comatose that threatened to take away her feelings of Ecstasy, and was doing well at that, as a matter of fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Greed would cost her, though, as she grabbed the vines that had previously wrapped around her limbs, and allowed them to join the others in filling her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned loudly as her sensitive belly pressed against a tree. Her last reasonable thought: \"How am I turned on by this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she cared not, choosing instead to slurp down more of this Syrup. As the vines caressed her belly, Johanna couldn't hold back any longer. She attempted to shout as all she saw was a great blur, along with \"stars\". She shuddered in relief and pleasure, and, having her energy taken away by this sudden burst of stimulation, she finally faded out of Consciousness, still inflating rapidly with the Syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna and Richard were never seen Again. It is presumed that Johanna is still alive, and that the Lipomancer himself had taken great pride in his achievement. With a little magic, of course, Johanna had been dragged off to the heart of his Lair, where she may be living to this day, as the Lipomancer's most successful experiment, partner, and lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd: Critical Mission Failure.<br>\r\nMotives of the Lipomancer: Undiscovered.<br>\r\nRichard: Deceased<br>\r\nJohanna: Captured, Immobilized, and Indoctrinated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(A/N: Please don't kill me for the CMF... xD)</b></span></div></div>",

I say we go this way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard took one look back at the forest before following Johanna to the field. The aroma of the flowers were almost... intoxicating. They smelled wonderful, and Richard instantly felt at ease. Johanna, for once, was also starting to lighten up, smiling and looking about like a curious child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them were caring anymore about their navigation through the field, and somehow ended up getting lost, wandering aimlessly together in the flowers, just talking to each other as friends, for about an Hour before Richard finally stopped, and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Johanna asked, sitting down in front of him. Her belly wobbled in her lap as she tilted her head inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing... should we eat some rations?\" Richard stuttered. Thoughts in his mind that he knew were not deliberately his own began flooding in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna grinned and reached inside their pack, searching for their food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard could notice that pollen flew aimlessly through the air as Johanna ate. What he didn't notice was that the pollen was tainting some of the food. As Johanna ate, her entire body began expanding slowly with fat. Somehow, the pollen was causing the food to be digested immediately, converting into pure fat within minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard himself could not eat. He was too focused on his own thoughts. A sort of \"meditative\" state. His mind was utterly relaxed. No mental noise or conflict except for a select few topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Johanna as she grew, somehow not caring about what was happening. He was fully aware, but didn't really process the potential danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, when she isn't under stress, she's actually pretty nice...\"</i> he thought to himself, tilting his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Actually... she's pretty cute... dare I think it: she's actually pretty sexy...\"</i> he mused, before shaking his head. Did he just think that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even know he, a human, was attracted to Anthros! Let alone obese ones... Johanna was now joyfully munching on her rations as her expansion failed to cease. Her arms and legs had thickened quite nicely, about the size of her head in width. Her legs were leg tree-trunks, but not the particularly wide variety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut was the size of a large exercise ball by now, and she showed no signs of stopping. Her breasts each were basketball sized, sitting atop her globular belly. The only things not drastically affected were her cheeks and tail. Sure, her cheeks puffed out a bit, but not so much as to form chins or anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So... wonderful... round, soft, perfect...\"</i> he said, his mind giving in to his relaxed, giddy state. He did enjoy rubbing her belly, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard? Is something wrong?\" Johanna asked as she finally stopped eating. Richard was staring intently at her belly and bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted her now. Something in his mind was screaming for him to just, tackle her and make her his. His better nature, however, shouted in response. Crazy as this was, if he \"loved\" Johanna, he should at least get to know her, or let her know how he feels.</span></div></div>",

I've just been thinking, and all I can think about is you. You just look so *lovely* right now and I can't explain why. Your personality is fiery, determined. You love a Challenge but don't view failure as an option. You're so witty, angry, in a good way, sexy...\" Richard rambled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Johanna's surprise, she began to feel a strange attachment to Richard. She began blushing at his compliments in spite of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Reality, all of this was probably due to the Intoxicating Aroma of the flowers below them. Something Magical was obviously at work, but neither seemed to particularly notice or care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might like you too...\" Johanna giggled, brushing a lock of her blonde hair out of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard smiled in relief. Man, he was aware that this exchange was awkward, but that took some of the pressure off of him. Richard crawled over to Johanna and laid back against her, using her belly as a pillow. Johanna smirked and rubbed his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in a state of Euphoria at this rate, and were probably going to end up stuck in this field for quite some time if they didn't leave now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Richard or Johanna...</span></div></div>",

But I guess while we're here we should spend our time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna blushed and hugged Richard tightly, leaving him gasping for air. Wow, she may have lost her muscle a long time ago, but she was still pretty powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Pollen-Induced giddiness was only becoming stronger, and the two found themselves unable to stop giggling at times as they ran around the field like children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving their weapons, and most of their armor behind, the two completely abandoned the mission, opting instead for fun and games. Johanna had fallen over, rolling to her right side. Her entire body wobbled wildly as she just laughed at herself. Richard followed suit, rolling onto his left side and throwing his arms around Jo's waist. As the two stared into the other's eyes, they both stopped giggling almost instantly as Johanna moved closer and closer to Richard's face. She closed her eyes and gave Richard a passionate kiss on his lips, which he returned with both shock and great enthusiasm, running his hands along her back, belly, and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you thought I was cute when I was all bloated and helpless?\" Johanna asked mid-kiss. She remembered their past conversations, at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah?\" Richard replied, not knowing where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you feel if I got... even more bloated and helpless than I am now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard blinked and stared. \"You would do that just to please me?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, I think I might have a soft-spot for this pudge.\" Johanna confessed, looking down in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's definitely not keeping me away...\" Richard replied with a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what eating the flowers would do?\" Johanna mused aloud, eyeing one of the bright yellow petals before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it?\" Richard suggested, picking the flower out of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's eyes were fixed on the flower, mentally debating whether or not to do it. She sniffed the flower and decided that she might as well, so she took the flower from Richard's hand and placed it in her mouth, chewing and swallowing. It tasted like... Citrus, but not so sour. Like an Orange?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for about a minute, when an odd tingling sensation flooded her middle. She looked down to notice that she was actually gaining weight from such a small flower! Her belly and breasts pressed against Richard as they grew, coming to a halt. She gained three inches from that alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard gave her soft belly a pat and laughed at the otherworldly effects of this one flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we stop there, or should I keep eating these?\" Johanna asked, picking another flower. She really enjoyed the taste, and right now, in spite of her normal nature, all she wanted was to make Richard happy. But she was aware of the consequences of going too far.</span></div></div>",

It's getting darker, and that noise isn't easing my anxiety at all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey paused for a moment as Richard pulled out his flint and steel, striking the two together and lighting the torch that Johanna held out to him. As soon as the torch caught fire an lit the tunnel, the chattering grew into screeching as the two were swarmed by a rather small group of bats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna! Put it out, put it out!\" Richard yelled over the squealing din of their attackers, ducking his head down low to the ground and avoiding the swarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna was far too busy panicking however, screaming and swinging the lit torch in every direction about her. She managed to take out quite a few of the pests, but they still swooped at her, startled by the light of the torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard! Where are you, these thing are-MPH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's eyes widened in terrified surprise as she felt one of the winged creatures fly straight into her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was further surprised, though more perplexed than startled, when she realized that it tasted delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed at the \"bat\" intruding into her mouth, and then realized that it wasn't a bat at all, but instead a roast beef sandwich, packed with meat, stuffed with gravy, and flapping its wings of lettuce. The bizarre food construct tasted so good that, instead of pulling it out of her mouth as she'd intended, she pushed it in completely, swallowing the creature whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down Johanna! You're going to get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay Richard, these thing-MMMRPH!\" She was interrupted once more as another sandwich shoved it's way into her jaws. While Johanna found the situation to be extremely strange, she was still feeling oddly hungry and decided to consume this new sandwich as well. Almost as soon as she was done swallowing, licking and sucking the spilled gravy from her fingers, yet another sandwich bat dive-bombed into her maw, and Johanna opened wide as it did, letting it slide down her throat and into her hungry gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Johanna was satisfying her greedy stomach, Richard cowered on the floor, his hands on top of his head. He was still unaware of the true nature of the bats, but when he heard the torch clatter to the ground, he leaped to his feet, startled. He quickly caught sight of his wolfess partner, Johanna now snatching the flying sandwiches from the air with both of her paws and stuffing them voraciously into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard only stood there, puzzled at Johanna's actions. He had figured his partner needed to eat a lot to maintain her muscular physique, but even this seemed to be a bit much, even for somebody of her size. Johanna wasn't just hungry, she was ravenous, enough so to devour strange flying creatures neither of them had even seen before! He wanted to inquire about the adventurer's strange and sudden appetite, but he decided to remain silent, only watching as she grabbed the last sandwich, a tiny, squawking runt, and pushed it past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... now that's a meal!\" She said, murring with satisfaction as she patted her now even further distended stomach, the round white furred bulge sagging slightly past her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... Johanna....?\" Richard said, concern permeating his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess stopped patting her stomach, her pleased and hedonistic grin slowly fading as she gripped her swollen paunch, \"By the gods! Why does this keep HAPPENING?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue held his hand over his mouth to stifle a laugh at her reaction, \"Come on now, we can't keep delaying like this...\" He snorted, his eyes filled with glee, \"Besides tubbo, if we get moving maybe you can shed a few pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna snarled in rage, heaving her axe into her paws and chasing the cackling rogue deeper into the caverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of gnarled hands gently hovered above a crystal scrying orb as he observed his latest guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lair was receiving quite a few \"Intruders\" as of late, no doubt due to his network of allies spreading rumors in the taverns and inns of the land. There was the dog and the cat, the pig girl, and now these two. They seemed much more professional than the others, no doubt originating from one of the adventuring guilds or societies out there, but that didn't mean he could have a bit of fun with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite the contrary in fact, those who were more skilled, more experienced in adventuring, treasure seeking, and dungeon crawling were all the more fun to defeat! And it was always fun to throw just the right obstacles in their way and see if they could overcome them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer smiled, his wicked grin visible from beneath his terrible cowl:he knew just how to deal with these two. There were many interesting things he could do to slow the adventurer's down as they traveled through his domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had plenty more tricks up his sleeve.</span></div></div>",

Soon however, his amusement turned to concern again as he remembered how enthusiastically she  had scarfed down the flying sandwiches that had just attacked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Johanna....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" She responded, keeping her head forward as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you, err, just <i>ate</i> those monsters back there? That reeeeaaally doesn't seem like a normal response to something new that's trying to attack you. Well at least not from MY experience...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, \"One flew into my mouth, and I realized I was still rather hungry, and if it was edible then why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Richard looked over the wolfgirl, he felt an odd sensation, as if the blood was rushing to his head, but decided to ignore it, \"But did you really have to eat <i>all</i> of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly ate ALL of them! I whacked a few with the torch as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... a few...\" Richard smirked at his partner's excuse, chuckling as he noticed that a small, thin layer of fat was even starting to form on the part of Johanna's tail that met her back. It was adorable to see such a tough, strong wolf like her starting to get a bit soft physically, \"The rest you <i>ate</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna merely grunted in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's getting pretty big... pretty curvy...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard found himself looking his adventuring partner over a bit more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"In all the right places...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he just think that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So voluptuous... so wonderfully juicy...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe his own thoughts, he didn't even find anthros attractive! Well at least he didn't a second ago... Or maybe he just didn't know it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but stare at this point. She <i>did</i> seem to be getting fatter in all the right places... yet fat was another thing Richard didn't even know he liked. But he liked rubbing her stomach, didn't he? Maybe he did like heavier women and just didn't realize it... And if he didn't like them, then why was he staring at Johanna's rear intently? Why was that slight wobble of her buttocks, barely visible beneath her short leather pants, so damn appealing to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She eats like a pig already... so why discourage her? Is it such a bad thing if she gains a few pounds? A dozen? A hundred...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, he should be <i>encouraging</i> her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard, are you alright...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue started to gibber, caught off guard, \"I... uhh... oh yeah, why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been pretty quiet, it's quite unusual for you...\" The barbarian said, cocking her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I'm fine, just thinking about what we should do next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas?\" Johanna inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am bored\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard agreed, and the duo just kept going. But Richard slowed his pace just enough to be behind Johanna; he kept staring at Johanna's butt. They kept going, but Richard remained oblivious to where he was going, so he wasn't prepared when they walked into the next trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard didn't hear it. Johanna heard it, but dismissed it. It was just a small, high-pitched noise. They silently kept going, but soon, they could no longer ignore it. The noise was more and more frequent, louder and louder until Johanna finally looked around to see where it was coming from. When she looked up, she shrieked in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ceiling was hundreds of thousands of tiny, black insects. Richard, hearing Johanna's scream finally looked up, and leaped back. Johanna, caught completely by surprise, was just standing there. And that's when the \"things\" started to drop. Richard used his torch in one hand to keep the creatures at bay and his other hand to take away creatures from him. It seemed to him that the creatures were trying to make their way towards his face; he just did his best to keep those little beast at bay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna on the other hand, wasn't as lucky as her partner. Following the initial shock, many of the insects fell on her face and immediately made their way towards her mouth. She fell on the ground and hit her head; it knocked her out. Soon, she was covered by the black legions of insects. They were crawling all over her, heading for her face, and her slightly opened mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Richard had fend off all his attackers. He finally noticed that the tiny insects were in fact tiny pieces of chocolate, that seemed to have a life of their own. He now watched, amazed, as more and more of the insects found their way to Johanna's belly, distending it; she was now completely covered in insects; and more and more and insects were surrounding her. Richard immediately moved to help the unconscious warrior... but stop to consider... for a while. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Whatever it was, there were other things that were more important right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued to walk down the  tunnel, it wasn't long before they came across another fork in the road, though this one had a few more visual indicators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path to the right lead to a doorway, the hallway beyond not carved from the rock like most of the tunnels so far had been, but lined with tan bricks that reflected a great deal of torchlight off of their surface, yet were otherwise dark. The path to the left, on the other hand,  was carved through the rock like the tunnels they had been traveling down, but there was a faint glow shining from further down the tunnel. It seemed as though both paths showed possible signs of habitation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" Johanna said, hefting her axe atop her shoulder, \"Which way do you think we should go Richard?\"</span></div></div>",

His shoulders a bit slumped now, the rogue followed behind as the barbarian led the way down the left tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't too long before the two drew very near to the source of the light, and as they did, the tunnel widened just a bit, the ceiling curving upwards a little as well the further along they went. There seemed to be some water flooding the floor, but it hardly looked to be more than a foot deep at the most. Johanna looked around somewhat before returning her gaze to look at the light in front of them. It was pretty close now, though the orb of brilliant illumination was too bright to quite make out what exactly it was. The wolfess knew for sure it definitely wasn't a torch, as the thing just seemed to hang there in the middle of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Johanna, you <i>can</i> trust me, right? I've got your back rolls... err, I mean back, your back is as good as...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolfess silenced the rogue by raising her paw into the air, shielding her eyes a little bit with her other arm, \"What in the gods <i>is</i> that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, knowing this place, I'm guessing another trap strangely centered around getting us fat...\" The rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...\" Johanna said, stepping closer to the floating light, \"You know what to do, let it feed me just a tiny bit, and then once it's filled me up a little, try to get me out of... whatever it is...\" She groaned, moving even further towards the light source, \"Gods, what a stupid plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard nodded, waving her off as he stood back and watched, \"Don't worry Johanna, I'll take good care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, the blond barbarian didn't have much confidence in that, but as she continued to draw closer to the light, she began to feel like those worries were being pushed even further towards the back of her mind. Slowly, as though reacting to her presence, the light began to bob and sway, moving deeper down the dark tunnel, just a few feet in front of the plump wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna might not have been the most tactical thinker, but she knew when she was being led. Yet somehow... she didn't seem to mind it at all. The light was harsh, yet soft at the same time, comforting... despite its brightness, it didn't seem to hurt her eyes the longer she looked at it, in fact, it sort of soothed them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian plodded further along the tunnel, her tail swishing, her eyelids drooping, drool trickling past her bottom lip as it quivered in some repressed panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna...?\" Richard called out, carefully following behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the rest of the world began to fade from Johanna's vision, that bright, brilliant light replacing all of it. Her clawed fingers relaxed, loosening their grip on her axe until it fell to the cavern floor with a splash and a clunk, the rogue watching over her dropping his torch and stopping to heft the heavy weapon up with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the light stopped moving, and so did Johanna. She stood completely still before it, basking in its unnaturally vibrant glow, too enthralled to draw any closer and too transfixed to pull her gaze away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looked closely, not at the light, which was blocked by Johanna's body anyways, but at what it illuminated in the dank, wet gloom. He could see that the ceiling had given way, split open by a wide, deep fissure that seemed to disappear into complete darkness just a few feet into its depths. More distressing than that, however, was the long, dark blue tentacle that connected that darkness to the hovering light. As Richard watched, clutching his partner's massive weapon tightly, he let out a startled gasp as he observed more tentacles descending from the fissure, a strange series of clacking noises echoing from the darkness in rapid succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna!\" Richard cried, startling the woman out of her trance just as the four thick tentacles surrounded her. The barbarian growled, baring her sharp fangs, her snarl faltering severely as her paws tightened around an axe grip that wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My axe..! Richard!\" Johanna shouted as she caught sight of her axe in her partner's hands, the wolfess rushing towards him just as two of the tentacles curled tightly around her ankles. These appendages might not have had hypnotic lights, but their grip was strong as they yanked the muscular wolfess off of her feet, knocking the wind out of Johanna as she fell face-first onto the wet cavern floor. Her paws scrambled against the cold stone walls, claws scraping against the solid rock with a nauseating screech before two more of the tentacles wrapped themselves around the wolfess's powerful arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard just stood there, dumbstruck, as Johanna was lifted into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard! The axe!\" Johanna cried out, struggling against the unseen monster that now had her in its clutches and was lifting her higher towards the ceiling, \"Toss it to me, quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Richard gasped, looking down at the massive weapon and then back towards its owner, \"Hold on Johanna, here it comes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering all of the strength he had, the rogue tossed the axe into the air, about two feet below where Johana had been hoisted to be exact, and sent the weapon clanking against the wall of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...\" Richard grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>FUCK?!</i>\" Johanna growled, \"Richard, get me DOWN from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax! Just relax!\" The rogue assured her, \"Worst it will do is fatten you up a bit, and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna snarled as she tugged tightly at the tentacles wrapped firmly about her wrists and ankles, her muscles bulging beneath her flab and her soft, white fur, \"Yeah, sure, fatten me up! Unless it just plans on fucking <i>eating</i> me instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard cringed. He hadn't exactly thought of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the wolfess was struggling with her bonds, however, the tentacle with the bright light moved sluggishly back in front of her snarling snout. As it began to bob lazily once more, the wolf's curled lips slowly started to relax again, her eyes wide now, not with fear but fascination. Within seconds, the barbarian's once fierce struggles had completely ceased, allowing the tentacles to curl further along the length of her limbs. The same clacking noise from before called out from the fissure again, then turned into a soft, rippling coo as the light continued to bob in front of Johanna's eyes, her pupils following every bounce as her eyelids drooped once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, a sixth tentacle lowered from the fissure above the wolfess, this one ending in a pointed tip like those that bound her limbs, but much thicker than the other ones. It poked and prodded experimentally at the wolf woman's dazed face, her expression not even flinching in the slightest as its tip jabbed clumsily at her brow and cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard...\" Johanna moaned weakly, her eyes still fixed on the light before the tentacle finally found the barbarian's drooling lips and plunged deep into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue only watched as the tentacle squirmed deeper past Johanna's lips, lodging itself further and further down her throat, snaking into her plump belly. He continued to gaze in silence as the appendage began to twitch and pulsate, Johanna moaning lazily as her stomach began to fill with ooze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, that's right Richard, just watch and wait... it's what she asked for, wasn't it? Just a little bit to fill her belly...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little bit, to fill your belly...\" Richard mumbled, his eyes transfixed on Johanna's slowly curving stomach just as wolf woman's eyes were focused on the hypnotic light source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just let her drink for a few more seconds, let her grow a few more pounds, what harm could it do?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What harm could it do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"When it's all done, she will enjoy being fat just as much as you'll enjoy helping her gain. She will never be able to lift her axe again, she will never need to. Let her grow big, let her grow fat, let her grow happy...\"</i></span></div></div>",

She squirmed uneasily in the grip of four tentacles while a fifth continued to pump a thick, fattening liquid straight into her belly. Johanna wasn't uncomfortable as she gazed at a bioluminescent light attached to another of the unseen creature's appendages, in fact she seemed quite content, even as her belly continued to bulge further and further with every gulp. Even so, this sort of sight wasn't exactly the thing that would bring a smile to the face of anyone watching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet smile Richard did as he continued to observe his helpless partner's plight, awestruck by the wolf's rapidly curving stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look at how big she's becoming, look at how soft...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, soft...\" Richard sighed wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the barbarian did seem to be growing softer as well, even as her stomach was filled with the strange liquid. Whatever the woman was being forced to eat, it must have been absolutely packed with calories, and digested quickly, as its effects were almost immediately observable on the wolfess's waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of moments, the once plump barbarian started growing even more fat than before. With every gulp she swallowed from the creature, her belly sagged more and more before her, her already generous cleavage deepening as her breasts swelled bigger and fatter within her tightening leather top. Her arms, already soft, were now losing even more definition, what hint of muscle there once was on them swiftly being buried beneath a drooping avalanche of fat. The wolfess's leather bottoms, already having dug deep into a small, developing muffin top, began to creak loudly as her hips, ass, and thighs began piling on even more flab, thick blubber spilling both over her waistline and out the bottom of her skirt. Even the wolfess's face began to show the effects of her gain, despite having been mostly unaffected thus far. Before long, the wolf woman's once fierce features had softened, her cheeks puffing out as her chin began to swell and then multiply into double, then triple chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna moaned a bit more loudly as she blinked at the creature's bioluminescent lantern. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she could feel that she was getting fatter... way too fat. She could feel how it sagged and drooped heavier and heavier with every second she spent suspended in the air, with every moment she spent trapped in this monster's clutches. Yet... what could she do about it..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily, but still with a bit of effort, the warrior woman's eyes pulled away from the light to glance at Richard. She saw him standing there uselessly, doing nothing, staring, drooling at her lecherously, before her eyes were drawn back to the glowing light, before her thoughts began to sink back into her mind just as her belly sunk closer to the ground below. Something wasn't right about what she saw, she knew her guildmate wouldn't just leave her to her doom like this, wouldn't just sit around, leering at her like... like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush spread across her softening, pillowy cheeks, before she pushed those thoughts to sink along with all of the others, letting them be pushed away by that bright, soothing light. She stared deeply into it, but somehow it didn't hurt her eyes at all... There was a different feeling though as she continued to gaze into it, not pain though... but something odd, something... uncomfortable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look at her Richard... Isn't she beautiful?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard merely nodded, smiling imbecilically as he looked over Johanna's now fat form. The rogue was carefully studying every new fold, each and every new bit of flab and cellulite that formed on her fattening body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look at how fat she's letting herself get, how nice and soft... Soon she'll be fatter than a cow, too obese to even lift a finger, spectacular, isn't it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spectacular...\" He whispered to himself as he took in each and every curve of the now 400 pound wolfess's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Johanna's eyes began to widen as she gazed deeply into that blazing light, her eyelids quickly shooting open in fear as the discomfort she was feeling spiked from barely noticeable to terrifyingly unmistakable. The sensation was almost indescribable, unlike anything she had ever felt before. It was almost as though her mind had been suddenly plunged into a fathomless abyss, and then as though her thoughts had brushed something immeasurable, something she could barely comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming past the tentacle, Johanna tugged hard at her restraints, recoiling in terror as for the briefest of moments she peeked into the creature's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Johanna...\" Richard groaned as he saw her startle, grabbing his head in his palm and rubbing it before he stepped closer to her, \"Johanna?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Let her be! Can't you see she's at peace? Can't you see that this is what she wants?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic began to fill the rogue's mind as he saw his partner in so much distress, as he realized how far he had let everything slide. If he didn't do something to stop all of this, it would be too late, if it wasn't too late already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what? What could I possibly do?!\" He groaned as he looked up at Johanna's enormously fattened body in dismay.</span></div></div>",

She's turning into a blimp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes... soft and round Richard, just like you want her to be... Let her get bigger, let her get fatter... Don't you want to see her grow? Don't you want to care for her? Don't you want her to love you?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue groaned in frustration as his thoughts blended maddeningly with those of another. He held his head in both hands now as he doubled over, clenching his teeth, squeezing his eyes shut as he struggled to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No, I don't! That's not right at all, that's not me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It is though...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No it isn't!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It always has been!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The axe, grab the axe...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do nothing and leave her to her fate...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Run, you idiot, it's going to eat her, and then eat YOU next!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Get the axe! Cut her down!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human screamed as he dug his nails into his scalp, stumbling against the cavern wall. He began to gibber to himself, losing sight completely of his partner even as she began to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's mental presence had withdrawn itself, but the brief and sudden contact between it and her own mind had left the wolfess shaken. She whined past the feeding tentacle as it continued to fatten her up, the woman still reeling at the strangeness of those thoughts, at how alien the entire sensation had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Eat.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat word didn't come from her own thoughts. Johanna squirmed as she once more felt the strange presence in her mind, but this time it was far less frightening, much less overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnnph...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Bigger. More.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna began to relax now, the feminine voice connecting with her mind soothing her just as much as the light was. Maybe the two weren't mutually exclusive, but that kind of thinking was too much for the barbarian in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolfess relaxed further, a blue glow began to emerge from the fissure above, coalescing into thin shapes the closer the glow drew until several tendrils descended into sight. These tentacles were much thinner than all of the other ones thus far, and they each pulsed softly with a blue bioluminescense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Warm.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning softly, Johanna blinked, confused as she drank, as she grew heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Fatter. More.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the thinner tendrils curling around her obese body now, wrapping around the flab of her arms, burrowing between the folds of her belly, digging into the creases of her blubbery body. She shivered, not in revulsion now, but in discomfort. They felt so cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Richard was curled against the tunnel walls, muttering to himself as his mind roiled like a maelstrom. The two adventurers were within feet of each other, but each felt as though they were worlds apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just give in Richard. You're useless to her now. Just wait. Just a few hundred pounds, then when she's too fat to move she might actually need you instead of carrying you like the dead weight you are...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human rogue's mind was tearing itself apart now. He wanted to free Johanna. He wanted to leave her trapped. He wanted to bury himself in her fat and kiss her. He wanted to die from the shame. He wanted to scream, to howl until his vocal cords tore themselves apart. But then, something else began to emerge from these conflicting compulsions, the only thing that made sense to him as they each tugged him into a thousand directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his hands against the solid rock wall, pulled his head back from it, then slammed it into the stone as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna didn't hear Richard's body slump against the tunnel floor, she didn't see the blood trickle into a small pool around his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Warm.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarming tearing noise filled the tunnel as Johanna's now gargantuan breasts finally burst free of her top, ripping the tough leather to shreds as the white-furred orbs bounced freely, jiggling as they came to rest calmly on her vast curve of a stomach. Her stomach was tremendous at this point, folding over into soft, flabby rolls at the sides, doubling over at its middle to create the crevasse of blubber that lead to the deepening pit of her belly button right at its center. Her arms sagged heavily with her fat, the bingo wings so bulky that even the muscular wolf woman would have had a difficult time moving them were she not already bound, while her thighs were thicker around than some boulders now, her knees almost buried beneath their adipose. Soon enough, the ripping of thick leather could be heard once more as Johanna's bottoms an panties, having been turned into more of a thong as they sunk between her elephantine buttocks, tore into tiny scraps that fell to the floor, baring her wobbling ass to the damp air of the cavern tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan escaped Johanna's plump lips as she felt her now 800 pound body being hoisted upwards by the tentacles ensnaring her every fold. She began to worry as the thinner ones buried themselves in between her many neck rolls, as her heavy and still swelling body was hauled into the abyss above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the light followed her, and her fears were left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere far above, the Lipomancer smiled as he leaned back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his fingers steepled, tapping them together as he stared at his scrying orb, at the rogue, laying prone on the tunnel floor, and the space Johanna had occupied just moments before. He had been worried, he had to admit, the two adventurers had shown more potential than most who had taken his bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost disappointing, in that regard; that his plan had worked so swiftly, so effectively, nipping the problem in the bud before it could even grow into something interesting. Divide and conquer, exploiting weaknesses. How textbook. How boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned away from the glass sphere, remaining in his seat in his grand study as he pulled some parchments and tomes nearer. Johanna and Richard had proved to be fine distractions for the day, but now he needed to return to far greater plans. Soon enough, the two adventurers would be recovered, dead or alive. Perhaps then they would prove of interest. Perhaps not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he had much bigger things to deal with now than a half ton wolfess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><u><b>THE END..?</b></u></div></font></span></div></div>",

The wide open space she found herself standing was nothing like the confines of the tunnel. There was water under her bare feet, a calm, shallow pool that seemed to stretch towards the horizon in every direction she looked. Looking around, she could also see that the sky was filled with white, fluffy clouds, though they didn't seem stormy, their stillness reflecting the peace of the water beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna was confused. This place was unlike any she had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she had died?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very second thing that Johanna noticed when she opened her eyes was that she was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery, very fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's vast cleavage heaved as her breath quickened, her paw gripping at one of her titanic, breasts as she took in as much of her body as she could possibly see. Her current weight made it difficult, her chins pressing together, the morbidly obese woman unable to see past her breasts and massive boulder of a belly, nor could she turn her head much to survey the damage done to her monstrously large, naked buttocks and the rolls of soft backflab that sagged on top of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took in her new body, memories of how she came to be in this state began to flood into her mind. The thoughts became vague and unfocused once she recalled how she was hypnotized by that bright, orange light, then ensnared by the horrifying creature that it belonged to, but it was enough for her to piece things together. Yet it still didn't explain where she was, or how she got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese wolfess looked down at her bare, heaving breasts. If this was truly the afterlife, would she still be so massively fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna lifted one of her fat arms before her. Somehow, as her flabby bingo wing jiggled with the simple, yet laborious motion, it felt heavier than before. She gasped as she heard the leather armband on her right arm creak loudly, before it tore apart with a loud rip, the ruined bits of the piece of clothing dropping into the water below with a soft splash. Somehow, even now, even in this place, she was getting fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" The wolfess called out, her voice so deep now, so husky. She blushed, cringing at its deepness, but pushed herself to overcome the shame fast. There was no time for that now, \"Hello? Why am I here?! What curse have you placed upon me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are here because I wished to converse with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feminine voice sounded so familiar, but as Johanna twisted her corpulent body around, she could not find its source. Her ears perking as she listened, a snarl began to twist the canine's softly fattened lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... the monster! It's you! You trapped me, you did THIS to me!\" She roared, slapping her paws against her blubbery stomach, causing her enormous belly to jiggle and quake grotesquely, \"You who ruined my body! And now you trap me here? Why the fuck would I ever wish to 'converse' with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be calm, there is so much that I need to explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA violent splash tore through the calm, shallow sea as Johanna kicked the water furiously, the movement nearly toppling the massive woman onto her mammoth ass. Waving her fat arms to regain balance as she stumbled, Johanna growled again, \"What explanation could you possibly give?! How could you ever expect me to forgive you after all the horrible things you have done to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was silent a moment. Johanna looked around, still trembling with anger as it spoke again, but not before the waters around them had returned to stillness, \"I do not expect anything of you. I truly am sorry for what I have done to you Johanna Thunderpaw, but I speak to you now not for my comfort, but for your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna shiverred, the fat of her rolls rippling ever so slightly. She didn't want to know how this thing knew her name, \"Comfort? You trap me like a beast and turn me into a freak, and now you want to comfort me!\" She spat, \"For what reason? Does comforting me make me taste better to you? Does my anger taint your meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not need you for sustenance...\" The voice continued, its source seemingly more distinct now. Johanna traced it back to a familiar orange glow emanating from below the water before her, the light brightening a little as whatever it was began to rise towards the surface, \"I draw that in other ways through the caves around me, turning much of it into the feed which I fill you and others like you with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna was about to bark out an insult at the creature, but stopped as she continued to watch the rising glow beneath the water. As she watched, a figure began to emerge from beneath the flat surface, the water rippling around the being as it stood up. The figure was another wolfess, though its fur was a deep blue, the same shade of blue as the monster's thick, grasping tentacles. The wolf woman looked roughly to be around the same height as Johanna, though she had no headfur and her bodily proportions and face showed slight differences that gave her a distinct appearance when compared to the barbarian wolfess. She was also much, much thinner, her body almost as muscular in build as Johanna's had been when she first entered the Lipomancer's lair. The blue wolfess smiled warmly at Johanna, her bright, glowing orange irises contrasting the whites of her eyes as she stared at the morbidly obese and naked woman before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing morbidly obese and naked, Johanna already didn't feel comfortable in the presence of another, but there was something else besides that and the sheer alien nature of the blue wolf woman's appearance that bothered her deeply, \"Is this another way you intend to 'comfort' me?\" Johanna frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe a more familiar form would be more soothing Johanna,\" the creature continued, frowning herself, \"I know you are no fool, barbarian. You know I am no wolf, that I am not even of your world... The plane I come from is far different from yours. It can be a very cold, cold place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit... I'm sure you look at least a bit less terrifying than whatever those slimy tentacles of yours must be attached to...\" Johanna sighed, placing a paw on her fatty hip, \"But I'd be even more comforted knowing that my partner is safe from the same fate you've bestowed upon me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue wolfess looked down and gestured at the water between them, and suddenly a view of the tunnel from above appeared just below its surface. Looking down past the immense swell of her belly, Johanna could see Richard being lifted between two cloaked figures, a bloody bandage wrapped about his head. Johanna gasped as she watched them carry the unconscious rogue away, her eyes darting up to glare at the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to him?!\" She barked, spittle flying from her fat maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had nothing to do with it, he struck himself, fighting the influence of my captor.\" The blue wolf replied as she looked back up straight into Johanna's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your captor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. The Lipomancer.\"</span></div></div>",

Her expression and voice did not change, but Johanna could sense her distress nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are a victim as well? Then why not let me go to help my friend? Where are those two taking him?\" She growled as she gestured at the cloaked figures now carrying Richard out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would if I were able, and I would tell you if I knew, but I cannot.\" The wolfess replied coolly, frowning herself as she saw the barbarian's lips curling in anger, \"I need you Johanna... It would not be forever, but it would have to be quite awhile before I let you go...\" She said as she stepped closer to the round wolfess, the water rippling beneath her bare feet, \"I cannot survive without warmth... that is why I had to ensnare you, that is why I had to... fatten you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna tried to cross her arms as she glared at the other woman, but gave up after her blubbery body resisted the half-hearted attempt, \"Then I suppose you are an appropriate pet for somebody called 'Lipomancer', because that's rather convenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" The woman shifted her gaze to the ground, \"The ways I'm forced to obtain heat are strange here... many things are strange in your world to me. I guess my captor simply found that suitable to his plans.\" The wolfess continued, looking back up into Johanna's eyes. As the barbarian looked back, she felt entranced, though not in the inescapable way through which the light in the tunnel had ensnared her, \"I do not know... but I do know that I need you Johanna Thunderpaw... Heat to my kind is much like air to yours. Without warmth I would be forced back into... hibernation... and then soon after wither and die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna felt herself shiver a little at the other woman's words, huffing in frustration at both the situation itself and how those words made her feel. She hated feeling helpless, she hated giving up, but if what this woman... this creature... whatever it was said was true, she had no choice. Even worse, she couldn't even find a way to really blame the damn thing. She groaned as she pressed her paw into her belly and felt it sinking into the soft flab even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you at least stop plumping me up? Or at least slow it down..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" The wolfess said, \"It's pretty much a reflex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... this place I'm in...\" She gestured around them with her flabby arm, \"This dream, or trance, or whatever you put me in to comfort me... If this isn't reality, then why must I be so fat in here instead of, you know, thin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to prepare you I guess,\" The wolfess said, smiling a bit as she reached for Johanna's chubby paw and held it in hers, \"You are not trapped here forever after all. The Lipomancer's servants will eventually come to retrieve you as well... I thought it might be beneficial to grow used to your new body, though I can always change you if that's what you wish?\" She said, tilting her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot blush spread across Johanna's soft cheeks as the wolfess held her paw in her much thinner blue ones, but oddly enough, she did not wish to pull it away, \"No, this is fine,\" Johanna said. She looked up into the other's eyes again, her tongue hanging out as she panted a bit before she placed her other paw on top of the wolfess's and her own, \"Though I'm not sure what I should do in the meantime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain, but it could be a pretty long wait...\" The wolfess said, her smile widening as she squeezed Johanna's paw and glanced over her naked and corpulent form, \"I could simply place you into a deeper trance, though there is one way I can think of to pass the time... A way that could allow my body more heat, and allow yours a very, well, pleasurable experience...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna blushed even harder as she looked at the blue wolfess, her breath quickening as her still swelling chest heaved up and down with every pant, \"You mean... Us...\" Her eyes widened as she thought of her current state in reality as well as the true body of the blue 'wolfess', \"Oh... Oh wow... Err...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue wolf giggled, \"I know it is rather peculiar, but I assure you it will feel much more... familiar between us here. You don't have to, of course. I want you comfortable Johanna, I just figured it would be a bit... beneficial for us both...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna was silent for quite a while, finding herself rather astounded to be thinking over whether or not she was going to get intimate with a tentacle beast, before finally deciding...</span></div></div>",

The other wolfess watched her patiently, smiling as her blue tail waved, those brilliant yellow eyes of hers glowing as she waited for an answers. After a while, Johanna gave her one, almost surprised she had made such a decision herself. It hadn't been an easy one to come to, that was for sure, but as she felt her body slowly grow heavier and heavier, she felt she might as well have some other kind of stimulation to keep her mind off of things. Besides, it had been a while since she had laid with anyone, tentacles or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" She said as she gazed into those glowing eyes across from her, \"We may as well enjoy ourselves while we pass the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" The blue wolf said as she stepped closer, her voluptuous hips swaying. Her body had some nice curves, though there was also strength beneath them, subtle hints of tough, powerful muscle, \"There is no need to wait at all, if you wish I could simply make all this pass like a drea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we may as well enjoy ourselves for the sake of it,\" Johanna said, reaching her chubby paws out for the Wolfess's, giving them a gentle but firm squeeze. Despite this move, the barbarian's eyes glanced away as the Wolfess brought her face up to look at her, flinching somewhat as she moved in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue creature tilted her head, \"Is there something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just... besides the fur, the eyes... you remind me of a...\" Johanna said, before she stopped mid-sentence and pulled the Wolfess against her, her paws gripping the blue woman's hips as she pressed her lips to her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's bright, orange eyes widened in surprise before they closed and she brought her own paws to Johanna's much wider flanks.  As her fingers met the barbarian's blubbery body, soft orange arcs of energy danced between their tips and her soft flab, yet instead of pain Johanna felt a curious, tingling sensation that grew more intense and sensuous the further the woman sunk her paws into her obese body. The warrior gasped, breaking the kiss between them as the wolf woman fondling her gripped one of her larger rolls of belly fat in both paws and gave it a firm squeeze, sending shivers of rippling pleasure throughout the obese woman's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh my...\" Johanna panted as she looked down at the Wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you liked that...\" The woman purred up at the barbarian, tracing her fingers and their tingling, teasing touch down the vast mounds and curves of the warrior's stomach before slipping them under her sagging, monstrous paunch, \"Then you will absolutely adore this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's ears perked and she let out a rumbling husky moan as she felt one of the woman's paws lift her gut and the other grip below that, her bellowing groans echoing around them as the blue Wolfess's fingers plunged into the warrior. Elsewhere, her moans were muffled by her feeding tentacle while something much larger entered her in the waking world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetal screeched and chains rattled as the portcullis opened and two black-clad figures passed through. The cave was dark, but one of them held a torch aloft to light the way as the deep, stifled groans guided them. Despite the size of the cavern, the duo found what they were looking for quickly; The wolfess was hard to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods, she reeks!\" The man holding the torch gagged as his companion moved up besides him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood a reasonable distance away from the white-furred blob of a wolfess, all too aware of a second large body hidden in the darkness behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what did you expect? She's been sitting here on her fat ass for almost a month just glutting herself on that thing everyday.\" The woman besides him replied. She was holding something that would look very much like a rifle, were it not for the hose connecting it to a pack she wore on her back, \"We probably should have gotten here earlier. Going to be much harder to get her out of here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was still gagging as he strained to give a reply, \"Yeah, well let's just get started huh? Ready to push that... thing back..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" The woman smiled as she aimed her strange rifle towards Johanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna quaked and shook, sweat dripping from her brow and hair, tongue resting upon her plump, lower lip before retreating as yet another moaned boomed from deep inside of her. The water beneath her rippled with every gasp, mirroring the soft mountain of flab that was now her body as it bounced and wobbled. The massive, sweat drenched girl let out one last thunderous groan, her head sinking back into her neckflab as she squeezed her eyes shut, the constant rippling of her fat body ceasing for but a moment as her muscles tensed and yet another orgasm blossomed beneath an avalanche of adipose. Thousands of pounds of wolf began to shake again as the climax hit her, the canine curling her fat fingers into fists, almost the only movement she was even capable of at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to moan and whimper as pleasure shot through every last inch of her tremendous body, filling her quickly despite how huge she had become. Her belly was a mountain of lard at this point, mounds of blubber that rolled and doubled over one another, forming folds and creases and rolls that resembled valleys and cliffs at her humungous size. Her arms were sagging, heavy pillows that oozed atop hips that curved out from her sides, rolling into bulging, flabby thighs that nearly swallowed bare, plump footpaws that wiggled with delight. Her breasts were massive, big, fat tits that drooped down the sides of her boulder-like belly, yet still bulbous enough to press against her soft, doughy arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, one could barely even identify Johanna as humanoid, her fat-swaddled head and arms blocked from sight by her colossal buttocks, her tail nearly swallowed by her monumental ass crack, the only true defining feature of the boulders of fat once she once knew as a rump. The barbarian's freakishly huge rear bounced and shook with the rest of her, in tune to every spike of orgasmic bliss, every wheezing, huffing gasp, until finally the movement began to slow, the breaths, while still heavy, beginning to grow regular and restrained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a shadow moved under the water, emerging from beneath that towering canine ass. The form drew closer to the surface, the Wolfess rising to her feet as she turned around to look over her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoyed that one,\" She purred as she strode around Johanna's bulk, the water rippling beneath her feet as she stood in front of the monumental wolfess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course...\" Johanna sighed heavily past her plump lips, \"Amazing as always... gods, I hope it never ends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolfess's smile faded as she looked at Johanna and moved closer to her, \"Unfortunately Johanna, that time has come at last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna's expression grew worried, the barbarian frowning at her lover, but she nodded as best she could, \"I... I understand. The Lipomancer has come for me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so.\"</span></div></div>",

She tried to lift her blubber swaddled arms, but found even that impossible, so just settled for wiggling her plump fingers instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile returned to the blue wolf's face as she brought her finger to her lips in thought, \"Not... quite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Johanna groaned, frowning in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he took me here, came to inspect me for himself, I was able to gleam some things about that... monster... from his mind. Most of it was hidden, his mind is very powerful and somehow... distant... but there are some things I can share...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that she locked eyes with Johanna and the barbarian's irises briefly flashed orange before returning to their natural blue color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh wow...\" Johanna gasped, panting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is some magic there too. I can tell you do not have an affinity for sorcery, but I was able to impart some power to you still. It will not be strong, and it will not last forever... but it might be enough to fight back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian frowned, glancing away shamefully from her lover, \"But I'm so... so huge... I don't blame you, not anymore... huff... b-but what can I possibly do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping her finger under the highest of Johanna's flabby chins, she lifted her face to look at her, smiling warmly as their eyes met, \"You are strong Johanna. Stronger than any other adventurer I have met here, and I do not mean your body. If there is anyone who can stop him, it is you. I have gifted you as much of my power as I can, but it is because I know you will use it will, and you will be able to hold onto it for as long as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna closed her eyes, nodding in response to the Wolfess, \"Thank you... I... I don't even know your name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wolfess smiled wider, \"I do not have one. At least not in the sense you would consider a name... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..?\" Johanna asked before the Wolfess strode up to her, climbing the vast, soft curve of her belly, drawing close to the barbarian before she pressed her lips to Johanna's. The warrior blushed as she kissed her back, long and loving, until the Wolfess broke it and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll need something to remember me by, won't you?\" She said, \"And something to remember that you still are strong Johanna, even if you feel helpless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope,\" The Wolfess replied, smiling, \"Just call me Hope. Goodbye, Johanna Thunderpaw, and good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna smiled back, though her eyes were sad and full of longing as she gazed into the Wolfess's, \"Goodbye Hope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire massive bulk of the wolfess began to fade out of existence now, leaving Hope floating in the air above the water. She stretched out her legs so that she landed on her feet as she hovered back down, staring for a very long time at the spot where Johanna's body had been before she started to sink beneath the calm, still waters and disappeared from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna awoke to a cloud of thick, white mist, the extremely strong scent of her own arousal and musk, and the most horrific, unearthly noise she had ever heard in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to gag as the tentacle shoved down her throat retreated, pulling itself free from her mouth as she coughed and wheezed for air. The other tentacles began to withdraw from her massive body as that awful screeching continued, the sound so horrible it was causing her physical pain as well as heartache once she realized what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuuhh... huff... hnngh... st-stop..!\" She managed to bellow, tears forming in her eyes as she frantically wiggled her fingers uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, the poor little wolfy doesn't like it when we hurt her fuckbuddy, eh?\" A female cheetah standing before her laughed. She held her rifle in her paws and aimed it to the right of Johanna as she pulled the trigger, sending even more of the freezing cold mist spraying in that direction, causing the aberration that had both captured and yet bonded so closely with Johanna to scream even louder in pain, \"Well what a shame, tubbo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh! So that thing WAS mating with her?!\" Gagged a blond, male elf as he held a torch in one hand and his nose in the other one, \"You don't... hurk! Don't think it knocked her up, do you..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah growled at him as she looked over her shoulder, \"Stop being a dumbass and bring that fucking light over you fool!\" She snorted. The elf did as asked, illuminating the area to Johanna's left as she continued to spray it with mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna gasped thickly as she struggled against mounds of neck rolls to look to herself, reeling from both terror and sorrow at what she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething vast and alien was sitting there just beyond the torchlight, shrouded mostly in shadow though it was still clear it was the source of all the tentacles that had bound, hypnotized, and fed Johanna. Those tentacles now flailed desperately through the air as the creature drew further back into the darkness, but before it did, Johanna met the gaze of one of its many orange, glowing eyes, her heart fluttering in despair as she caught a hint of some deep, horrible loss somewhere within. The creature disappeared completely from sight now, only its wailing and the much softer sound of chains rattling indicating that it was still there, hiding in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... hurr... huff... p-please..!\"Johanna wheezed out desperately, tears streaming down the curves of her cheeks as she gasped and huffed, \"Please... just... just let her go..! Huff... puff..! Take me but... but set her free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Her'?!\" The elf gasped, frantically waving his torch towards Johanna to gape up at her face, \"She... She just called that THING a 'her'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurence would you shut the FUCK up and keep that godsdamned light steady, I'm almost bloody done!\" The cheetah hissed before sending one last blast of mist the creature's way before turning back to look at Johanna, \"Don't you worry now, lovely, we're going to take good care of your fat, squid-humping ass. Lord L has good plans for you, and everyone's going to make sure you're nice and fed. Every. Single. Day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohanna looked down at the woman, spittle flying from her lips as she growled at the cheetah, her cheeks and chins jiggling from the vibration of her furious expression, \"I'm going... hnnffh... to fucking rip you... apahhrr.. a-apar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah glared up at the wolfess before her face ripened into a smile and then burst with laughter, \"Ooooh really Miss Tons O' Fun?! With what, those pillow paws of yours? I'd jus' loooove to see that!\" She cackled before blasting Johanna in the face with her mist-gun. The wolfess sniffled a bit, but the only thing the cheetah had injured was the wolf's pride, \"Bet if you really tried to lift 'em your poor little heart would explode, that'd right fuck up my day alright, but at least I wouldn't have to move you out of here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, haha! I bet she could like roll over on you and crush you to death or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laurence just shut up and give me the damn grease out of your pack, and the spell tome too!\" The Cheetah groaned, hooking her gun to the backpack tank she wore, \"Its going to take a lot to move the world's fattest bitch from here to the dungeons and we're going to need to set the portal up as soon as we bloody can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to bicker and argue, even as the elf began to smear grease on parts of Johanna's massive body and the Cheetah started reading spells from her book. Johanna didn't pay much attention to them, instead trying to figure out how the hell she was going to get out of this. She wasn't sure where they were going to send her once they got their little magic portal spell going or what the Lipomancer had planned for her, but as she looked to her side towards her nearly immobilized paw and rubbed her fingers together, she smiled. She was going to get out of here, she was going to lose all this crushing, burdensome weight, and then when she was strong enough again, she was going to find Richard and set him free. She was going to find everyone who had gone missing here, lost in the vast dungeons of the Lipomancer's Lair, and set all of them free. Everyone. The odds were stacked against her, but even when she weighed more than a dragon, the barbarian wolfess was far from helpless, and as she watched the tiny, orange sparks dancing between her plump fingers, she was certain of only one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what, she would never lose hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/8c59/f/2018/248/0/7/curse_of_the_lipomancer__ensnared_illustration_3_3_by_infinite_loup-dcm5acy.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://orig00.deviantart.net/8c59/f/201...</a></span></div></div>",

A Hole in the cave's ceiling that actually led out into the world. Freedom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, she noticed that there would only be enough time for one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard, look!\" she said, pointing to the one beacon of hope before them. Richard's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, we have to get out of here!!\" Richard boomed, swimming towards the hole with difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to buy you some time!\" Johanna cried out. She had tears in her eyes, but she knew that someone had to get out of here to warn the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?!

Oddly, it took a strange turn. Instead of focusing on just the belly, her torso began to expand on all sides. Her arms and legs were forced apart as her torso expanded to roll up the limbs, engulfing the joints and eventually the entire limb itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a complete sphere, perfectly round. Her armor was already LONG gone. She couldn't even see herself underneath the fudge, however. Her head was the only thing above the surface, and besides the sensory stimulation, for all she cared she was still muscular and thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned however, when her belly began rising out of the fudge, having grown too large to remain under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the gods, she was *full*. She knew she was reaching max capacity, and the end would come soon enough. For now, though, she was comfortable with giving her belly one last pat, focusing on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer life flashed before her eyes as the pressure became painful. Her skin was as tight as it could get, her fur was spread apart and standing on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned to the present moment, she thought of her sacrifice, and of the Favor she requested. She had faith in Richard, that he'd avenge her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single tear rolled down her cheek as her skin passed maximum capacity. The thing she felt last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd everything went Black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCritical Mission Failure.<br>\r\nLipomancer's Motives: Unknown.<br>\r\nRichard: Lived to Fight another day.<br>\r\nJohanna: Exploded. :(<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though Mara herself did go questing she'd mainly use magic from her hands or staff that she carried around everywhere, her mages outfit consisted of a long flowing navy blue robe that had many bits of intricate gold thread weaved here and there, it was very baggy on her thin, skinny body but she was used to it as it was quite light and comfortable. Her hair was a long flowing red with a small bobbled ponytail in the centre, her face was sleek and slender and her eyes were a glistening silver which gave her a very mysterious and magical look about her which was very true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend and adventuring companion was a big burly dwarf engineer by the name of Grungor, he was a stout dwarf weighing about 160lbs which made him very wide and round on his 4ft 11\" frame, he was a jolly dwarf that liked nothing more than drinking ale and building his guns. Grungor was very adept at traps as well plus he always carried a big two handed axe so he was very useful to someone like mara who was not so good with either traps or combat but what she was good at was magic and runes. Grungor had many scars over his face and had even lost his left eye which he covered up with a eyepatch, his hair was long and white as was his beard which reached his knees, on his back he carried a musket called \"Old Flintshot\" which was the first gun he'd ever made and still as good as it was around 50 years ago. Grungor was about 100 which was rather middle aged in dwarf terms as they lived upto 200 or more, Mara on the other hand was a very young 20 which was almost childlike to the elder elf age of over 300, but she had the body of a late teen early twenties look about her which matched her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, the pairing heard of a great dungeon which supposedly held vast riches and many great and powerful arcane artifacts, so the pair decided to seek it out.

You know we don't have that much coin ourselves! Hell, I bet ya' my cousin's farm she was better off than we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara sighed, feeling like a child scolded, as she usually did whenever Grungor lectured her, \"I know Grungor, I know... but I just can't help feeling sorry for these people. Did you see all the empty houses and ranches we passed since the last town? Clearly this part of the world suffers, and if I had any chance, I would take it to ease that pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't give me any of your tree-lovin' elf crap!

The two argued quite a bit, but to Grungor's frustration Mara never quite took the arguments seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Mara's smile faded rather quickly and placed a hand in front of Grungor's chest to signal him to stop moving, putting her other hand's index finger to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the dwarf hear what had stopped the elf dead in her tracks, a faint shouting coming from the direction they just left from. They both turned to see the beggar from before running as fast as a withered old woman could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!\" She howled, her voice hoarse and sore from her repeated screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood there, not having moved regardless of what the beggar had said.</span></div></div>",

No, no young elf, if you're looking for the vault then you won't find it in there... no, what you're trying to find is to the northeast, not in a forest but under a town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor stomped his foot in protest, pointing an accusing finger at the crone \"Hold on you! How do we know yer tellin' the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman reached into one of the folds of her robes and pulled out a coin. Yet it wasn't one of the ones given to her by Mara, nor was it any other common kind of currency the two had seen in these lands before. The coin looked as though it were made of gold, though it seemed quite a bit shiny for just an ordinary gold piece, and then there was the logo stamped on its face: A single watching eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been there myself, back when I wasn't so old and weak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara stuck her tongue out at Grungor and chuckled, \"You see? Maybe you should be more trusting friend... now how do we find this village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow the road that leads north...\" She whispered, \"Follow the signposts to Pighaven... that's where the vault you seek lies.\"</span></div></div>",

That was until she showed them the coin. Simply breathtaking in craftsmanship, and the quality of the gold was unlike any he'd ever seen. While the witch gave instructions to Mara, the greedy Grungor ogled the eye-stamped coin, engrossed by his kind's innate lust for wealth. It was just so damn beautiful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grungor, did you get all that?\" Mara prodded the Dwarf's cheek with a slender finger. He shook his head clear of the fog, darting his gaze between the two women. The crone seemed much more relaxed in their company, and Mara waited with a hand on her hip. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, erm... no. Where did you find that magnificent artifact? Is there any more treasure like that? Tell us!\" Like a child in a candy shoppe, Grungor struggled against the urge to seize the coin for himself. He was absolutely enchanted by its unnatural shimmer. Mara slapped a palm to her forehead and turned back to the beggar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my companion's foolishness. I don't know what's come over him...\" The short elf smiled, flashing her pearly whites to the old crone. \"Oh well! Must be a Dwarf thing.\" Now looking back to Grungor, the mage pointed Northeast toward a much more amiable path. \"See? This is a far better lead than that creepy, empty forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStubbornness trumped by greed, the Dwarf nodded with sheer excitement. \"Aye, that it is. If there be more treasure like that lovely piece o' art, count me in!\" Hefting his old rifle onto his shoulder, Grungor began his march down the road, completely oblivious to the twinkle in the old crone's eye. His elven companion was even less aware of the beggar's true intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my thanks, stranger. May your path be one of joy and happiness.\" With that, the novice mage bowed lightly and jogged after the tenacious treasurehunting Dwarf. Behind them, the old woman snickered and tucked the coin back into her sleeve. She simply watched the pair stroll off around the winding path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The master will be most pleased...\" And with that, she slunk back into the shadows beneath the treeline.</span></div></div>",

But, before they began their long journey, Mara and Grungor stopped alongside the road in a clearing of trees to make camp for the night, not wanting to risk the dangers of traveling in darkness. Mara quickly had a toasty fire set up with her magic, and Grungor had managed to capture and kill a couple hares to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grungor prepared the hares for roasting, Mara turned to him and said, \"Do you believe what the crone told us? That the treasure we are looking for lies underneath a town in a giant vault?\". Grungor just glanced at Mara, then spoke in his gruff voice, \"I don't trust her, but, what else have we got to lose, eh? Hell, I'd rather make my way to a town then walk through a musky old forest anyways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara just left the conversation at that and stared at the roasting hares, taking note of the muscular structure and tissue of the two animals as they cooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the hares were ready to be eaten, and Grungor passed one over to Mara. Grungoer dug inside his travel pack and pulled out a wooden case of various spices. He pinched a little between his fingers and spread it onto the hare. As he was about to take a bite, he noticed Mara staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to share, or not?\" stated the stern looking elf. A disappointed look crossed Grungor's face, as he was almost out of his specialty dwarven spices he had brought with from his homeland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ehh, only for you Mara.\" said Grungor as he passed the wooden case over to her. Mara's cold demeanor disappeared with a warm, cheering smile as she laughed at the dwarf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" said Mara as she dipped her head down in traditional elvish fashion as a sign of thanks.

He gazed over the area, trying to find any sign of motion, but could not see a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...It be just the wind...\" whispered Grungor to himself as he lowered his rifle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he heard another sound from behind, and quickly turned to discover the source of the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!....What in the name of...\" gasped Grungor as he took in the site of...</span></div></div>",

When he knew he was right on target, he squeezed the gun's trigger and watched as the slug flew through the air to make contact with the odd creature. As the bullet neared closer and closer to the creature, it morphed it's figure and the bullet passed through a hole that materialized on the thing. Grungor just stood there, speechless as the creature continued to the still sleeping Mara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the hell is she still sleeping? My shot should have woken her!\" thought Grungor frantically in his head. Just then, as he aimed for another shot at the thing, he was knocked down onto his feet by another unknown enemy. He quickly tried to get up, but to no avail as he was forced back down as a cloaked figure pointed their deadly looking sword at the dazed dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you two would fall into my trap. You know, you should never trust strangers...\" said the figure as they removed their hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor gasped as he took in the face of the old beggar lady standing before him. \"Wha-? You? Why are ye doing this?!\" shouted Grungor. The beggar lady simply smiled and cackled, an evil sound that could be represented by cuddly animals being killed, or a famine falling over a crop. \"Because my master wills it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grungor sat trying to make sense of all this, the sludge creature was now covering Mara's face, her mouth unwillingly taking the creature into her body as she <i>still</i> unbelievably slept!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why ain't she waking up?! Get off of me, now!\" shouted Grungor in anger, his face getting red from seeing the creature going into Mara. The beggar lady replied in a flat tone, stating, \"You know those hares that you caught? I enchanted one of them and let them loose into the forest, knowing that you, the expert dwarf hunter, would catch them and likely eat them. Mara is in a deep sleep, and will not awaken until the sun rises.\" She followed her statement with a horrible sounding chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sword still pointed at his throat, Grungor watched in horror as Mara's stomach ballooned out from the ingestion of the sludge creature, most of the strange thing now inside of her. After a few moments, all of the thing had transferred itself into Mara's now bulging stomach, slightly red from the stress of holding the thing in. Mara didn't even move an inch as her stomach now gurgled and moaned from pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swift move of her hand, the beggar woman placed her sword into a scabbard at the side of her hip. She then walked away, leaving Grungor to sit and stare at Mara's now bloated stomach. He realized that he was no longer being pinned down, and sat himself up with vigor. He looked around for the beggar woman, only to find she had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all, shes gone...\" Grungor shuffled over to Mara, taking note of how peaceful she looked in her magic induced sleep. He cringed slightly as he looked over her burgeoning stomach in horror. \"Ohhhh boy....she won't be happy when she wakes up...\"</span></div></div>",

Usually she felt uncomfortable lying on the flat, hard ground, and would often awaken in the middle of the night just from how uncomfortable it was. It felt amazingly good to her, being able to just lie there in her makeshift bed and nod off as soon as her red-haired head hit the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have enjoyed her deep slumber much more however, if it weren\u2019t for the bizarre dreams that plagued her that night. She found herself in an enormous larder, so big that it felt like a massive cavern and packed with enough food to feed an entire village for weeks. The elf couldn\u2019t help but notice that each and every piece of food lining the shelves and stacked about the floor looked absolutely delicious, and felt that it would be a shame if she didn\u2019t try just a bit of each thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon however, as her robe grew tight around her and her breathing grew heavy from girth she was starting to realize that she had gone from tasting to flat out cramming food into her face. She kept eating regardless, staining her clothing with all sorts of juices, sauces, and icing until her robes tore away completely, revealing her plump and naked body beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreaming elf\u2019s avatar gasped in shock at this point, but when she caught sight of her traveling companion Grungor cheering her on happily. At that point, all shame melted away and she renewed her gorging with even more vigor, only slightly aware that somebody else was watching as well. As she kept eating, kept growing even fatter, and kept gaining even more rolls of blubber the presence made itself even clearer as a giant, disembodied eye that watched her every move. Yet oddly Mara didn\u2019t even slow as it gazed upon her with its shockingly crimson iris, nor when she was finally brought crashing down to her flabby bottom, as even though she was now immobile the food always seemed to be within reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor was gone now, but the eyeball seemed to grow along with the once tiny elf\u2019s weight as her flabby flesh spread across the floor, and then pressed against the walls and shelves. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of eating, even in her dream state, Mara had devoured every last scrap within the entire room. She also nearly filled the entire room, except for the space that was now taken up by the enormous eye. It glared at her naked, disgustingly bloated body, and the feeling of shame and exposure returned to her a thousand times over. She screamed as the eye stared at her, but was even more horrified to find that she didn\u2019t recognize her own voice which had been distorted by tons and tons of fat. The eye seemed to glint while loud, mocking laughter filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara sat up suddenly in her bed, sweating more than usually, a chill running through her as she was frightened awake. It was morning now, the sun having just risen, and as she looked over her surroundings, she grew calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was only a dream\u2026\u201d She reassured herself, closing her eyes and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hand to her chest\u2026 and then realized that something was off. Her chest felt\u2026 bigger than it used to be. She moved her hand down to her belly, and her blood ran cold with fright when it met the now curved surface of her paunch. She began to poke and grab at other parts of her body: the slight fat jiggling on her arms, her softer face and its double chin, her thickened thighs and plump ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara began to whimper at first, and then soon started to sob, \u201cThis can\u2019t be\u2026 It was only a dream, how is this possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor, now noticing that the elf was awake ran over to her and pulled her close in a comforting embrace. When Mara felt the way her soft, doughy flesh pressed against his well trained muscles she pushed him away, shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry lass\u2026\u201d Grungor said, looking at the ground solemnly, \u201cI tried to stop it, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop what? What happened to me!?\u201d She yelled, shivering in a robe that was now a bit less baggy on her pudgy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was\u2026 well, I must warn yeh, but it\u2019s gonna sound a bit odd, but there was this ooze\u2026 y\u2019know, not unlike some of tha\u2019 ones you\u2019d find about caves and forests like this and such\u2026 But the thing was actin\u2019 funny\u2026 it went straight for ya\u2019 while you were asleep! I tried to stop it, but the old beggar lady we ran into, she held me still with a blade to my throat as it\u2026 And you must understand, she poisoned the hares so that you couldn\u2019t wake\u2026 but the slime\u2026 the slime, it went into your mouth\u2026\u201d He shifted on his feet, noticeably uncomfortable as he recalled the disturbing sight, \u201cI\u2019d never seen quite anything like it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara sat still for a moment, her sobbing becoming less violent as she held her head in her hands. She was thinking, trying to determine what could be done, \u201cI guess you were right Grungor\u2026 that crone couldn\u2019t be trusted\u2026 But at least I think I know what she did to me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor scratched his head, his furry eyebrows raising a bit on his forehead in interest, \u201cY\u2019do, eh\u2026? Something you learned from your studies then\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, grimacing as even that felt different with her slight neck pudge and new chin, \u201cYes\u2026 it\u2019s something that ooze creatures like that can be made to do by some of the more powerful mages\u2026 it\u2019s called by some \u2018Forced Ingestion\u2019, they can control the slime and\u2026\u201d She put her hand on her rounded belly once more, sniffling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor shook his head, sighing, \u201cNow this is why I dun like magic ta\u2019 much\u2026 so is there anything that yeh can do Mara\u2026? Anything I can help with\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara thought a bit, then nodded slowly, \u201cYes. I can try to\u2026 force the creature out of me with my spells\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes now and put both of her hands on top of her sagging belly. She started to mutter to herself in an ancient tongue as a light blue glow surrounded her hands. Her eyebrows furrowed in deeper concentration now as she stopped chanting and started grunting, visibly using a great deal of effort in order to try to expel the creature. Finally, after a few minutes and no result, the blue aura dissipated and she pulled her hands away from her stomach, panting while a bit of sweat ran down her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use\u2026\u201d She sighed, \u201cThe thing\u2026 inside me is too powerful to extract with my magic. I\u2019m still learning even some of the basics of sorcery. But we should find somebody who can get it out and soon\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do yeh say that lass\u2026?\u201d Grungor asked, a look of concern appearing on his face as he noticed one of worry on Mara\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause this spell that the beggar woman used on the slime\u2026 it could still be in effect\u2026\u201d The look of worry intensified, mixed with visible disgust now, \u201cShe could still control it, even while it\u2019s inside. The fact that it\u2019s spread to the rest of my body already makes me fear that this is indeed the case. And if she has control of the slime\u2026 maybe she has control of me as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor didn\u2019t like the sound of that at all. He had seen magic do many wicked things in his long years of life, and one of his least favorite was when it turned friends against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, we should head off immediately. I\u2019ll pull out tha\u2019 map, let you decide which course of action to be best\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grungor packed most of the supplies up, as he felt sorry for Mara and let her be. With the stuff packed up, Grungor led the way with Mara behind, swaying slightly as she tried to get used to her new girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how far exactly is this trading post?\" asked Mara with slight hint of anxiety. Grungor looked back at the elf, and said in a flat tone, \"About a mile or two, almost in the center of the forest. I hear the post is run by a group of centaurs, though. Have ya ever seen one up close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara blinked, shaking her head. \"No, I can't say I have. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a couple of times, decent enough folk they are. Though, this was a different group I believe, so I have no idea if the ones at the post are gonna be friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets hope they are...\" muttered Mara, looking around the forest, keeping an eye out for danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an uneventful trek through the dense forest, Grungor stopped and listened for something in the woods. \"Hear that? Sounds like voices, I bet we're gettin' close to the post.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the gods, I'm starving!\" gasped a rather worn out Mara, bent over with her hands on her knees. Grungor looked back at the elf with stern eyes. \"Why didn't ya say something? We could have stopped to eat, for crying out loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara looked up at the dwarf with weary eyes. \"I...didn't want to impede on our progress...And besides, I thought it best that I hold my hunger while I'm in this...condition.\" Mara patted her  burgeoning belly, a sliver of pale skin showing through a gap on her robe. As if in response to her a touch, her stomach let loose a loud gurgling sound, which in turn caused Mara's face to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor couldn't help but grin, as he took in the sight of the embarrassed elf. \"Well, I think we can fore-go caution just for a bit to get some food in your tummy, lass. I'm sure it won't do ya any harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara sighed deeply as she stared at the ground. \"I..I suppose so. I mean, what harm could some bread do, really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit, Mara.\" And so the duo walked the last stretch to the trading post, their feet aching and tummy's rumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took in the sight of a number of tents surrounding the area, each with their flap open and a merchants table in front of them, most adorned with rare jewels or scrolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the trading post was deserted. \"Thats peculiar, I coulda sworn I heard voices...\" grumbled Grungor, his head swaying back and forth looking for any sign of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mara was gazing at the collections of jewelry and other objects at one merchant station. \"Oh these really are beautiful, Grungor. I wonder where they got these?\" She wandered over to the next stand, only to be met with an assortment of foods. Bread, cheese, pudding, some fish, fresh cut meat, and even cake! Mara's mouth began to water at the sight of such delectable food, and she licked her lips with hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mara, I haven't the faintest idea where those centaurs went, so I'm not sure what our plan is now. I think I'll go look around the woods, see I can call em out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara didn't answer though, as her mouth was occupied with a roasted lamb leg. </span></div></div>",

She drifted away for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and drifted back to the sound of her stomach gurgling.  Muzzily, she turned her head and looked out the window.  Unless it had been more than a day, which she doubted, she'd only been out for about fifteen minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How can I be hungry again?</i>, she thought unhappily.   <i>I just finished stuffing myself until I could barely walk straight.  I can't eat again!  I'm too fat as it is!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she reflected, was she really?  It was a spell, after all.  An intruder.   <i>She</i> wasn't fat -- she was just bloated with blubbery ooze.   Once they broke the curse, she'd be back to her old skinny self again.   She sat up -- oof, so heavy -- and looked down at herself, trying to hold the picture of the <i>real</i> Mara, the one trapped under the flab, in her mind.    Yes, that was her.  Thin as a whip.  What could it hurt to eat a little more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was munching her way through an entire loaf of sugarbread when it hit her.  <i>The ooze!</i>  It must be breaking down the food almost as quickly as she could eat it.  She shuddered to think about where it was storing the energy.   Had she gotten fatter, just standing here eating?   She threw away the last of the sugarbread.  By the gods, if she didn't watch herself this could get out of hand, quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mara watched as Grungor returned empty-handed, a look of disappointment on his face. Mara met him in the center of the camp and asked Grungor of the whereabouts of the centaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't tell ya! I looked for em everywhere, called out to them, but not a single centaur showed itself. I just don't understand what happened here...\" said Grungor with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps we should take advantage of this predicament and \"borrow\" some supplies while they are gone. I'm sure they wouldn't mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor grinned and scratched his beard while he thought of it. \"I don't know lass, maybe we should-- \" Just then, a sort of rumbling sound coming from behind them startled Grungor. Both Mara and the dwarf turned to see what the cause of the noise was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of about six or seven centaurs were charging at them from a clearing in the woods, waving spears and swords above their heads. Mara and Grungor instinctively got ready to defend themselves, the dwarf drawing his gun and Mara preparing a fire spell. As the centaurs got closer, they could hear them shouting something above their charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dirty thieves! You will pay for this!\" yelled a rather burly centaur with gray hair. It seemed he was the leader as all the other centaurs followed him. Grungor and Mara stood their ground as the centaurs surrounded them, spears lowering down and forcing them back to back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on here! We didn't steal anything! Dwarves honor!\" yelled Grungor. The gray haired centaur merely snorted and pointed a finger at Mara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lie! We know that cursed elf has stolen our food. Even now it rests inside her body, feeding that dark creature within her.\" Mara gasped in surprise at this statement. Grungor just sighed and placed a palm on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you know of our predicament then?\" asked Mara. She placed a hand on her stomach, hoping maybe with her being surrounded, the goo creature would remove itself from her body out of fear. But this was a false hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" grumbled the centaur leader, \"Our shaman sensed it within you as you approached our post. We hid among the forest, waiting to make sure you were not a true threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor now had a question of his own. \"So, how come I couldn't find you guys? I bloody looked everywhere for ya!\" The centaur leader revealed the shaman as the one who hid the group from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we still have a problem, elf. You stole most of our food supplies. Either you pay us with gold so we can restock our foods, or we shall take you both as prisoners as long as we see fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor angrily barked back at the centaur leader. \"Listen up ya horse bottomed bastard! We got to get movin' and find somebody to remove this thing from my friend here! We don't have time to pay you guys back. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it's gonna be, and you ain't gonna stop us!\" Grungor pulled up his rifle and aimed it right at the leader's head. Time seemed to freeze as neither person moved. Mara took this moment to channel a shockwave spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was worried however, as she had only successfully cast this spell twice before. With her mouth speaking unheard syllables, Mara shook with effort as the spell neared completion. Just a couple more sentences left and.........done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Grungor!\" yelled Mara as she let the spell loose around her. Grungor ducked just as the wave of energy hit the surrounding centaurs with the force of a rock wall, each flying head over hooves into the surrounding forest area. The spell even toppled over most of the trading tents the centaurs had set up, with books and scrolls and weapons and other supplies flying through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor pulled on Mara's arm as she collected herself. \"Come on Mara! Lets run while they're all scattered about!\" Mara stood up and started moving quickly with Grungor, neither looking back to see if any of the centaurs had re-cooperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara and Grungor managed to stumble upon an old trail after a couple minutes of running. They stopped to catch their breath, both red and sweaty from the run. Grungor leaned on a tree, one hand on the bark and the other on his knee. Mara had sat down on the ground, both her hands behind her to support her weight. Her blue robe had come undone partly, letting her pale stomach peek through to the outside world. At the moment Mara cared not if she was openly revealing her blubbery form. She just wanted to rest her aching feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Mara let her arms fall to her side and just laid down on her back, the already loose robe now falling away to fully reveal her soft form. She gazed up at the sky, which was remarkably clear of clouds, and a deep blue. A sense of peace washed over her, and her eyes began closing. Mixed with her body's aches and the serenity of the sky, sleep took a hold of Mara in an instant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unknown to our tuckered out adventurers, farther down the path a young man was making his rounds as a pie delivery boy, and he was just beginning his journey through the forest. He hefted a large leather bag on his back, the sweet aroma of a various assortment of different flavored pies wafting through the air. \"Sure is a nice day today\", thought the young man, who's name is Tod. He figured today was just gonna be like any other day. Deliver some pies, get payed, and go back home to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod began humming a song to pass the time, his eyes looking through the trees and bushes. He knew that the woods weren't always safe, so he usually brought a dagger with on his travels, just in case. The soft wind and the birds chirping dulled his alertness after awhile, the peacefulness of the forest taking a hold of Tod. His eyes were on the ground for a split second when he heard snoring up ahead. He raised an eyebrow inquisitively, surprised that someone -or something- was out on his trail. He put a hand on his dagger, his gaze darting forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod spotted what looked like a very plump woman laying down on the ground. He also saw a stout dwarf sitting and leaning against a tree. The snoring was coming from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd. Just a couple of tired travelers.\" said Tod, bringing his guard down. He crept forward, not wanting to wake either of them. He stood over the woman, red hair flowing around her head. Tod let out a gasp as he looked at the woman's ears. \"She's an elf! Oh wow, I've never seen one up close!\" A big grin showed itself on Tod's face. He had genuine amazement on his eyes. He looked over the rest of the elf's body, his eyes growing even wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod had always heard of elves as being tall and thin creatures, their stature giving off the aura of nobility and intelligence. This elf, though, was completely different. Her body was doughy and soft. Her stomach a small, but definitely impressive pot belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some odd reason, Tod couldn't take his eyes off the sight of the bloated elf. He felt his face growing flushed, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I feeling like this? This is all too weird...\" thought Tod. He took a slight step back, snapping a twig under his foot. Tod jumped and let out a curse, looking to the slumbering elf to see if he had woken her. Tod's face grimaced, as the elf was now stirring, a light groan escaping from her mouth. Tod looked for some place he could hide himself at, but the nearest bush was much too far away for him to be unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf looked up at Tod now, her eyes wide and alert. She took a quick glance down at herself and let out a yelp of embarrassment, pulling her robe over herself tightly. \"You better not have seen anything, mister!\" she stood, careful to keep her robe from opening up again. The whole time she kept her gaze on Tod, like she was trying to determine if he was a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod slowly stepped forward, his hands up. \"Don't worry, miss. I was just passing through-\" Tod covered his face as the elf shouted back at him. \"Don't take another step! Why should I trust you? Prove yourself, human.\" The elf's hand was glowing with energy, a fire spell ready for casting if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, I'm not here to hurt you! I'm just a normal delivery boy, honest! Look, I just bring pies to people who ordered them.\" Tod pulled off his leather bag and opened it up for the elf to see. The reaction he got was slightly comical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf dropped her arms, her mouth agape, drool appearing on her chin. She licked her lips in hunger, her eyes locked on to the bag of deliciousness. \"Are...are those apple pies?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod gave a cheer in his head. He was getting somewhere. \"Apple, blueberry, cherry, raspberry, you name it. You know, I think I might even have some chocolate creme pies in here somewhere...\" The elf moaned in ecstasy, creeping ever closer to Tod. The young man couldn't help but openly grin now. He had this elf in the palm of his hands. If it was either getting blasted by magical fire and dying, or letting this elf have his bag of pies and getting out of there unscathed...eh, it was pretty obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod placed the bag gently on the ground, backing away from it slowly as he watched the elf dive into the bag, pulling out several pies with both hands. One at a time, she took a bite out of each and every pie, savoring the flavor. Tod couldn't believe what he was seeing. In an instant, the elf had demolished two pies by herself, not even stopping to catch her breath. She reached right back in, bringing a blueberry pie to her face. One, two, three, four, five....five huge bites, and the pie was gone. The elf laid a hand on her chest, and let out a low burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod watched in disbelief as the ravenous elf got right back to it, sticking her head into the leather bag and eating whatever found its way to the front of her mouth. Tod found that he had somehow sat down on the ground in the time he was watching this strange, but weirdly alluring elf tear through his whole supply of pies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustling in the bag had died down now, the elf's head emerging from the bag. Her face was a pure mess. Blue, red, and whatever else was all over her mouth, her chin, and even her hair. She sighed deeply, her hands caressing her absolutely bulbous belly. The elf's robe had no chance with this behemoth sphere of flesh, and had parted once more. The maiden raised her arms over her head, a long and loud yawn escaping her lips. With one last groggy belch, she fell over onto the ground, her hands cupped under her head for a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod was, needless to say, speechless. He watched the elf as she slept, the gurgling from her stomach the only other noise besides her snoring. Tod let out a pent up gasp of air as he stood back up. He looked up at the sky to find that it was almost dusk. Time certainly passes by when you are watching an elf girl eat all of your pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although the pies had possibly saved his life, Tod knew he could not return to his father empty-handed. The boy's eyes scanned over the still snoring Dwarf and gluttonous elf, and an idea sparked in his mind. If these two were adventurers, maybe they were treasure hunting! Fear long gone after the witnessed binge session, Tod immediately dropped to the plump elf's side. He cleared his throat and placed a hand gently to her shoulder, hoping not to frighten the fluffy sorceress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss?\" He sat still, awaiting a response. The only sound to rise from the pie-pilferer was a gurgled belch. She wrinkled her nose and smacked her lips before nuzzling up tighter into a curled, chubby ball. Tod, the eager delivery boy, then nudged her some with the heel of his palm. \"Excuse me.\" His push elicited no response, but the motion flowed through her fattened form, jostling her pale cleavage and sending slight tremors through the expanse of her pillowy tummy. Again Tod was struck with a strange, heated sensation as his eyes lingered over the peeking poof of her softened middle from between her robes. What was wrong with him? Ignoring the fantasies that played out in his mind, he shook her harder, raising his eyes against the momentum that would undoubtedly roil across her softened body. \"Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally roused from her food coma, Mara rubbed her eyes and looked skyward, only to have her view blocked by the vaguely familiar face of a young man. \"Wha-- Who are you?!\" She immediately slapped his hand away from her shoulder and scurried back. At least, she tried to scurry but found the escape far more difficult than she anticipated. Sitting up, hands on the road behind her in support, she looked down at her midsection with utter horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had once been only a softened curve to her stomach, had now been overwhelmed by an absolute paunch. From her seated position, the mound of her belly now pressed against the once loose-fitting robes, emphasizing its roundness against the taut fabric. Her bloated gut now had the qualities of a blubbery cliff face, perching out from her skirt's waist sash at least a solid inch. Any shred of muscle definition had long since expired, as the flesh that ran down her tummy was equally soft but still held some firmness from the plethora of pies she had only recently gorged herself on. Trembling hands pressed against the sides of the swollen belly, but quickly recoiled. This was no nightmare! Succumbing to the shock, Mara let out a scream, shutting her eyes tight with terror and shame in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor ceased his snoring sleep and bolted to his feet. Seeing the stunned boy kneeling before the screaming Mara only offered the Dwarf one conclusion: danger! Grungnor swiped up his rifle from against the tree trunk and pounced on the knee-bent interloper. Although shorter than the human, he easily bested the boy in brawn and weight. Without so much as a struggle, he had the young man pinned beneath one heavy boot, rifle barrel jammed beneath his jawline. \"Mara...\" Grungnor spoke, not tearing his eyes from the boy. But still she screamed, expressing the incredible capacity of her elven lungs. \"<i>Mara</i>.\" No end was in sight for her shrill shrieking. \"MARA!\" Finally, as the Dwarf boomed his voice far above her own cries, the elf cut her screaming short. She panted heavily, one hand pressed to her full chest. \"Did he hurt you, lass?\" Grungnor jabbed the barrel harder into the boy's neck as he turned away, eyeing his elven companion up and down. \"Ho boy...\" Even he could see the change in her form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hem of her robe's shirt now fell a sliver too high, allowing the world to get a small peek at the very slight hang of the bottom of her belly, even as she now struggled to cover herself up entirely. In fact, just about everywhere was a bit more padded; her ass had grown noticeably, spreading out beneath her weight a tiny bit more than it used to as she sat. The robes in general were somewhat more snug all over, though it was clear she had grown the most around the middle, even if it was only slightly. She had probably only gained fifteen pounds, but a good portion now hung on her paunch, giving her robes a permanent tightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Grungor. He's just some delivery boy.\" She sighed and grunted, struggling to her feet. The effort was greater than ever before, and this only forced a defeated pout to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Yes! Please don't shoot me, Mr. Dwarf sir!\" Tod flailed his arms weakly beneath the weight of the Dwarf's boot. Grungor offered a stern scoff before lifting his boot and rifle from the boy. Tod hesitantly rose to his feet and dusted himself off. \"Your friend is right, sir. I was just passing through with my delivery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor gave Tod the hairiest of eyeballs. \"What sort o' delivery?\" The Dwarf's interrogating gaze seemed to shrink the boy some, and Tod found himself unable to maintain eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Pies.\" The word fell softly, and Grungor sighed in relief. Clearly he was no agent of ill-will. But then the weight of the word hit Grungor hard, though not as hard as Mara's waistline. He whirled about, looking at the sticky-faced elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, lass... You didn't...\" His eyes were wide, but before she could utter a response, another gurgled burp rose from the pit of her expanded stomach. Grungor sighed again, his rifle stooping to his side in defeat. Reluctantly, he turned to Tod. \"Right... I suppose we owe you for the costs now, aye?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tod had other plans. Too long had he followed his father's orders. Too long had he lived a life unfulfilled. \"I have a better idea! You two are adventurers, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor arced his arm upwards, slinging the rifle to rest on his shoulder. \"Aye.\" His brow perked high on his weathered forehead. Joining the questioning proved difficult for Mara, as she had to adjust to her now tighter robes. One hand steadied her churning belly as the other rested on a newly fortified hip. If this kept up, she knew she'd need a bigger wardrobe, and at that thought it was all she could do not to burst into tears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod flashed a grin to the Dwarf and folded his arms with an emboldened vigor. \"Take me with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Grungor and Mara replied in unison. Finally beside her stout companion, Mara rested her hand moved from plush hip to the Dwarf's stocky shoulder. Grungor had no trouble supporting the woman, but her added weight did not go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me with you! I know the woods pretty well, and I can be really sneaky!\" Tod splayed his arms and lowered himself into an appropriate sneaking stance to demonstrate his point. Mara rolled her eyes and Grungor rand a meaty palm over his head in frustration. \"Forgive me if I have me doubts, lad.\" The Dwarf and elf snickered together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTod once more rose from the stance and crossed his arms with a huff. \"I snuck up on both of <i>you</i>, didn't I?\" The chuckling fell to silence and the pair both turned and nodded to Tod without a word. \"Good! Then it's settled. I'll be your new guide through these woods.\" He puffed up his chest and raised a foot, planting the boot on a nearby stump, leaning out in a heroic  posture. His hand lashed out and settled above his brow, gazing out toward the forest's horizon. \"Many dangers await, and the roads are full of peril! But we shall persevere! We shall be victorious!\" His boasting was met with only the chirping of crickets, and as Tod looked to his new travel companions, Grungor and Mara weren't even paying him any mind. They were packing up their belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lad, unless you have some advice for our travels, please stop talkin'.\" Grungor took a swig from his canteen before offering it to Mara. She silently declined and slung her backpack over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... it's nightfall. Shouldn't we set up camp?\" Tod stepped down from the stump and took his side by the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already <i>slept</i>, silly.\" Mara laughed lightly, but immediately cut short and furrowed a frown as her hand steadied her tummy. The giggling had only encouraged jiggling. Grungor said nothing and took the lead, rifle grasped lightly in one hand as he marched. Mara gestured for Tod to follow, and set about behind the Dwarf, slowly growing accustomed to her new-found girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Wait for me!\" Tod scrambled behind, excited to begin his new life as an adventurer!</span></div></div>",

The sound of a snapping twig twitched the elf\u2019s ears, and she glanced around, scanning the heavy foliage. \u201cGrungnor?\u201d Rising to her feet, with a bit more effort than she would care to admit, the elf tiptoed toward the direction of the sound just as more rustling could be heard. It wasn\u2019t far now, and Mara stayed on guard, one hand already armed with enchanted fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the rustling, Mara squeaked as a substantially fat squirrel leapt from the bush and waddled toward a nearby tree. The elf let out a light sigh and aimed to return to the trading post until something glimmered from the corner of her eye. After facing the unusual shine, Mara realized it was in fact a brilliant portal flickering with purple light. With the knowledge that someone was targeting her, the elf knew better than to trust random magical doorways. Shaking her head at the obvious trap, she turned to walk away. Or at least\u2026 she would have turned around if her legs allowed it. Frozen from the bountiful waist down, Mara began to panic as her legs took on a life of their own, marching toward the gaping portal. \u201cOh no\u2026 Grungnor! Anybody! Help!\u201d She flailed her flabby arms to no avail as her foot crossed the glowing threshold. Once she was fully engulfed in the light, the doorway snapped shut behind her, leaving no trace of her exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so, the Dwarf finally stepped from the wilderness and entered the camp. \u201cLass, I couldn\u2019t find them anywhere.\u201d Grungnor paused, looking around for some sign of his elven counterpart.

He swore that the house wasn't there the last time. Grungor knocked on the door. After waiting for a minute a tall and almost doll-like woman appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! How may I help you?\" the woman said with an overly large smile etched on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have ya seen two centaurs? Ya can't miss the fellas.

No person I met ever cried jelly before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor raised his rifle and fired it at the woman. The woman's body cracks and starts spewing red jelly. The centaurs were oblivious and only focused on their trays of delicious desserts. Grungor looked at the jelly and the woman that it was coming from. A closer inspection reveals that the woman was no more than a mere doll, acting as a host for the ooze that dwelled within her porcelain body. Grungor dropped his guard when he saw that the plates were made of gold and silver. The jelly slipped away and found a replacement body. The ooze takes over the new doll and readjusts her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to leave. It's not safe here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaurs ignore Grungor and continue eating. Grungor's greed and hunger took hold of his thoughts. He might as well take the plates and all and get a bite to eat. As he bit into the cookie a huge hunger pain hit the dwarf. Grunor then begins chowing down. The strange woman smiles as she brings out more plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't resist my food for the master has provided me with several bodies stupid dwarf. Maybe later you can tell more about your companion.\"</span></div></div>",

My master requires new slaves that will serve him at his beck and call.He'll be here in two days. Once your done eat the house. It's very delicious and very fattening. Don't worry about me. I'm going to slave hunting to catch more friends for you. Bye now.\" The doll woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrungor tried fighting the hunger pains, but as his body started ballooning outwards the dwarf was reminded of the creepy incident involving Mara the previous night. Grungor watched in horror as the centaurs started eating the table. Fear crept on the usually stubborn and tough dwarf as his hands crammed a piece of the table into his mouth. To his shock and dismay the table was made out of chocolate. The dwarf came to the conclusion that the house is made of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to fight this and save everyone and Mara. That darn dolly is gonna ship as slaves to the Lipomancer. If only I can snap those centaurs out of their lil trance I may have a shot.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough sheer willpower Grungor is able to stop himself from eating anymore of the table, which seemed to be regenerating itself as it was being eaten. Grungor heaved his 300 lb. + body and tried walking over to the centaurs. Taking his rifle Grungor aimed for the chandelier hanging overhead. The dwarf fires his rifle and the rope holding the chandelier breaks. The chandelier falls violently to the ground. The sound is enough to distract the centaurs from consuming the ever regenerating table. The centaurs look at each other in horror once they discover that they have been severely engorged. The broken chandelier starts melting into a puddle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we and why are we so fat?!\" The head centaur gasped as his mountainous girth shook back and forth from the simplest movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were under the spell of an evil dolly.

Sora was not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but she definitely had the sharpest sword on the rack. Often she survived her ill-advised adventures with what onlookers and survivors described as a lethal cocktail of titanic strength, savage martial prowess, and phenomenal dumb luck. But all of these qualities would find themselves sorely pressed by the fiendish dungeon of the Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empty-headed swordswoman clambered through the dungeon door, which slammed shut behind her. Before her was a large room, looking to be a place of worship, judging by the mob of people in robes bowing with fevered reverence to a large statue of the Lipomancer in all his terrifying glory. In the scales he held there were two statues of immensely bloated women, one of them slightly larger than the other and thusly tipping the scale in her favor. The cultist with the fanciest robe made several motions over a potion on an altar before the statue, asking their god-on-earth to enrich it with his baleful blessing, before he was interrupted by Sora's exclamation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! HEY, YOU GUYS! You got any treasure in here?\", she asked with that same naive curiosity that often preceded the bloody brawls she usually found herself in for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single motion, the whole of the congregation brought their hooded eyes to bear on the audacious interloper. \"The only thing you will find in here, infidel, is your death! Seize her, brothers and sisters! She will be a fitting sacrifice to our lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora hopped up and down on her toes giddily, brushing back her shoulder-length cherry red hair. \"Oh, oh boy! A fight!

Not five feet away was one of the biggest boars that she had ever seen, and she aimed to be eating it before the sun went down. Fortunately, it hadn't seen her yet; Hikari prided herself on her illusion spells, and right now she looked and smelled like a tree to the animal. Slowly, she focused her magical energy through her body, until at last it was focused in her fingers. With a whoosh, a bolt of magic force leapt forward from her pointer and index fingers, and struck the boar in the side of the head. The boar died instantly, slumping over as blood poured from the wound behind its eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Hikari no time at all to then use her magic to prepare a firepit. A telekinesis spell retrieved some logs and stones, and all she needed was a low-powered fireball to set the campfire going. Having exhausted most of her magical reserves over the course of the day, Hikari opted to use a simple strength-enhancing spell to stick the boar on a spit, and was content to rotate it over the fire she'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she let the meat cook, Hikari shrugged off the green hooded cloak she'd been wearing most of the day. From under the hood, black hair went down to her shoulders, as he brown eyes took in the meal. Her sizable chest was covered by a yellow cotton shirt which stopped midway down her torso, leaving her chubby belly uncovered (a result of having spent several sedentary years doing nothing but learning magic). Over her hips was a blue, knee-length skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bit into the cooked boar, Hikari began thinking that he first adventure was going well. She'd spent a few years as the apprentice of a magician, and had finally struck out on her own after she felt she'd learned everything he could teach her. She was now finally out seeing the world, and putting the magic she'd learned to real use. In this area was rumored to be the lair of a sorcerer called the Lipomancer, a being no one had seen in decades. Hikari figured that the sorcerer was dead (all-powerful sorcerers tended to remind everyone that they were there once in a while), which meant that whatever valuables she could find in the lair were fair game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the size of the boar, Hikari was able to finish all of the meat, which caused her round belly to bloat out a little bit. Patting it with a sigh of contentment, Hikari cast a quick alarm spell which would (in theory) wake her up should anyone get near. She then lay down to sleep, visions of treasure hordes dancing in her head.</span></div></div>",

Afterwards, it was time for breakfast. Hikari didn't have any of the boar meat that she had eaten last night left, so she had to content herself with some jerky and water. After she was done, Hikari took what possessions she needed and left the rest behind her. She still had some distance to cover, though by the end of the day she would find the entrance to the Lipmancer's lair. At least, if the information that she had found was correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikari hiked for several hours, enjoying the lush wilderness around her. Many heavier people might have had trouble with long-distance walks, but Hikari had magical symbols tattooed all over her body which greatly increased her physical strength. In theory, she would be able to retain mobility no matter how much weight she gained, though Hikari never really wanted to test those limits. She didn't mind being chubby that much, but she'd rather stay at her current weight than get any heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later on in life, Hikari would admit that such thoughts were basically daring the universe to do what it did to her.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in the middle of a forest clearing, Hikari found it. A large cave, with several warnings in all kinds of languages warning people not to go inside. A smirk appeared on Hikari's face. She wasn't going to turn back now, after spending several days away from civilization. She incanted a spell that created an invisible shield around her which would hopefully protect her from anything inside that would attempt to harm her. Afterwards, Hikari stepped up to the cave, found some stairs leading down, and descended into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it became too dim to see, Hikari held up one of her hands and cast a spell which caused an orb of light to wink into existence. The orb began orbiting Hikari's head, allowing her to see clearly. At the foot of the stairs, there was a large corridor which extended a long way in front of her. Hikari began moving slowly down the corridor, prepared for anything to happen, when all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

It still hurt quite a lot though, and Hikari remained sitting for some time muttering obscenities under her breath.

Slowly making her way along a barely visible path through the only pass, Mist held her fur lined cloak ever tighter. A mask was taut across her face and the hood was pulled low over her brow, leaving only the barest twinkle of her eyes visible, though even that was almost entirely hidden in the drifting snow. All around the young woman was silent except for the mournful wailing of the wind passing around the craggy rocks, and the crunching of the snow beneath her boots. Ahead of her, she could just make out the crouching bulk of an old way station nestled between two outcroppings of rock. As she got closer, she could see that the structure hadn\u2019t been well maintained, but that wasn\u2019t surprising considering that most people tended to take the longer but safer journey along the seaside road along the other side of the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mist came close to the door at the front of the building, she saw a brief glimpse of a small fire burning in the central fireplace. Before she could make out anything else inside, there was a shout and a trio of men in mismatched armor with ill maintained weapons dashed out of the doorway. Mist didn\u2019t move, instead she watched as the men fanned out, with one swaggering straight at her, and the other two swinging wide around either side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHo traveler!\u201d the one in the center called, likely the leader judging from his marginally better equipment. \u201cNot exactly the best weather to be traveling in. Perhaps you might come indoors\u2026just until the weather breaks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine right here, actually,\u201d she replied to the swarthy man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this ain\u2019t a case where you can say no, girlie,\u201d the orc said with a laugh. Mist noted he had a rather eye-catching metal ball in place of one of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may, I just did,\u201d Mist calmly countered, though she couldn\u2019t resist a slight smirk from crossing her face; fortunately, between the snow and her mask, it went unnoticed by anyone but her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, boss, let\u2019s just get it over with, I\u2019m freezing my tail off here!\u201d shouted the third of the group \u2013 a stocky wolf with a scar tracing one side of his face over an unseeing eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cboss\u201d huffed \u2013 Mist could see the cloud of his breath as he did so \u2013 before saying, \u201cFine, let\u2019s get this over with, and try to save the cape if you can, I like the look of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two others smiled wide as they closed in on Mist, thinking they must have had an easy target, maybe even frozen in fright or something considering that she didn\u2019t move even as they stalked towards her, brandishing their weapons. Their thoughts were cut short as \u2013 quick as lightning \u2013 Mist threw one side of her cloak back, before a thunderous bang rippled through the winter air. The wolf fell to the ground, the previously untouched side of his face now mangled even worse than the scared side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of the other two brigands could realize what happened, Mist turned towards the orc and there was another loud crack. Unfortunately, the orc had lifted the crude replacement for a hand in shock, and the metal happened to deflect the crimson bolt that flew from the pistol still smoking in Mist\u2019s hand. Mist was more than a little upset at not downing her target, which gave the orc a chance to respond. With a throaty roar, he charged at the smaller human. Mist recovered, quickly slipping beneath the ham-fisted swing of the ball that would have crushed her skull. She then easily dodged the swing of the short sword that tried to separate her arm from the rest of her, before driving the barrel of her weapon into the orc\u2019s chest. The blast was muffled somewhat, but still enough to shake some of the nearby hanging snow free. He lurched back, and a second shot knocked him backwards to lie still in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBloody frell!\u201d the human shouted, trying to duck behind one of the large boulders that peaked through the snow. \u201cMiriam, where the fu\u2014\u201c he started to call out, but didn\u2019t get much further after another bolt flew from Mist; this one taking out his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe staggered several more steps, his sword dropping to the ground and both hands reaching up to prod the still smoking hole that had appeared below his chin. A fleeting look of alarm crossed his face before he pitched forwards into the snow. Mist didn\u2019t relax, between the report from the one trader that had encountered this group survived \u2013 though he was half mad from exposure \u2013 and what the human was saying, there was supposed to be a fourth around here somewhere. Almost as if on cue, an arrow punched into the ground just next to Mist\u2019s foot. She lunged to the side, darting for one of the boulders herself, as two more arrows plunged into the snow, narrowly missing their mark. Skidding behind the black rock, Mist holstered the pistol, and traded it for the rifle slung across her back. Of dwarven make like the pistol, the rifle was Mist\u2019s preferred means of attack, but the bulkier long barreled weapon wasn\u2019t so handy for being covert or for close\u2013in work, so she had opted to go in with the pistol in hand instead. She was somewhat regretting not being to find a nice quiet spot to take them out from range now, but couldn\u2019t dwell on what was past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing the rifle against her shoulder, Mist edged the barrel around her cover, keeping her gaze locked down the scope running the length of the barrel. Judging from way the arrows struck, the last target had to be on the bluff around the back of the way station. Scanning along the rocky ridge and ignoring the snow that tried to blind her, she saw a ripple of movement and was about to fire, when a humanoid shape fell to the ground and lay there unmoving. Suppressing a grin, Mist returned the rifle to its place under the back of her cloak, and marched over to the corpse of the fourth bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the rock towering over her, she called out, \u201cI was starting to wonder if you were going to show up before everything was over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly, a face appeared over the edge of the cliff, before retreating back. Soon after, the face and whole rest of the person hopped over the edge, sliding down the rough rock face to a shambling stop at the bottom. With a grumble only partially muted by the cold-weather gear, the figure stood up, revealing Mist\u2019s partner.</span></div></div>",

The scowl across their face and chattering teeth would go against that however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould\u2019ve been here fast\u2019r if not for this gods forsaken cold.\u201d He spoke. \u201cWhy are we out \u2018ere again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Kurz this group has been taking from poor innocent people for months now, someone had to do something!\u201d Mist said in a tone one would only use to show how deeply they cared about the situation they found themselves in. Kurz chortled and crossed his arms looking down toward his partner clearly not falling for the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a few rich and guilty people who\u2019s secrets were worth more than any gold a trader forced to walk through these parts would realistically have.\u201d Mist continued in a tone completely betraying her earlier sincerity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Ight.\u201d He replied. \u201cNow you can continue to remind me of our <i>sworn duty</i> while we\u2019re out of this blasted cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA touch too cold for the strong and powerful orc?\u201d Mist mocked. Kurz waved her off and stomped off towards the newly vacant cabin. Mist smirked as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurz was far from a stereotypical orc, potentially the furthest one could be withtout being half human. While most thought of orcs as walking masses of muscle Kurz was rather small compared to most people\u2019s mental images of an orc. While he was seven feet tall with a large jaw and hands and feet bigger than the largest humans his muscles were realatively small. While he was clearly physically fit evidence by his muscular body with cut abs, large arms, rippling back and strong legs he would sooner be described as \u201cskinny\u201d than \u201cmuscular\u201d when stood next to a \u201cnormal sized\u201d male orc of his age and a head or two shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile most orcs seemed to cave to blood lust and charge screaming into battle without a thought of their chances lugging a massive war axe or hammer with them Kurz preferred to stalk his targets with his trusty bow and throwing knives. He also knew how to throw his voice futhering his ability to sneak up on unsuspecting individuals.<br>\r\nAnd lastly Kurz was a huge wimp when it came to extreme heat or cold a fact Mist likes to remind him of whenever he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMist followed Kurz into the humble cabin; the orc was already crouched down by the fire warming his hands and stripped of his hood leaving him in his form fitting leather armor dyed with darks blues, dark browns and blacks to further help him stay in the shadows. Kurz looked over to her as she removed her own outer wear and gave him a nod. He stood up and they searched around the cabin. Their first big find was a plain chest at the foot of one of the two single beds within the cabin. Mist\u2019s attempts to open it were met with resistance from the single lock on it. \u201cKeys probably on one of them.\u201d She said curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it open.\u201d Kurz said placing a hand on the crack between the lid and body of the chest and in a sharp motion yanking the lid completely off of it revealing the rather stuffed chest filled with various seemingly valuable things. Mist scoffed and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost theives pick the lock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd most women would app\u2019eciate when a man presents he\u2019 with a box of jewels. Don\u2019t hear me complaining.\u201d Kurz said as he started to dig around the chests contents. As he did that Mist started to walk around and take note of the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a single story with two beds draped with furs in the corners opposite of the entrance, the seemingly only way in or out of the place, the fireplace was embedded in the left wall; the stone breaking up the logs making up the rest of the house\u2019s interior. A fire was actively burning in it, a fresh log having just been added by who Mist guessed was Kurz. Near the fire was a pile of furs. \u201cTwo beds and a makeshift sleeping area.\u201d Mist announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPermanently \u2018ad one on watch then.\u201d Kurz replied not looking out of the chest he currently buried himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right wall had several cabinets and counters along it. A search proved all of them empty. \u201cNo food or water here.\u201d Mist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey either hunt nightly or weren\u2019t planning on staying for much longer, judging by how full this chest is I\u2019d say they were \u2018bout ready to leave. As for water they probably just melt snow.\u201d Kurz replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle of the cabin was dominated by a wooden table a few plates, metal cups and sets of utensils were set up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMap.\u201d Kurz said. Mist turned around to see the orc bent over looking into the chest with his right arm straight up clutching a rolled piece of paper as he continued to scour the contents with his left hand. Mist walked over to him and took the map and without breaking stride walked over to the table and pushed everything on top of it onto the ground then spread out the map, using two of the cups to keep it from rolling back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe map was fairly rudimentary. Chicken scratches made out the location of the nearest town from where they were, about three days out, along with several other towns and cities through the land. Curiously across the sea was a large red X. \u201cSo what is it.\u201d Kurz called to her. Mist did a double take as she acknowledge the orc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he had found several gaudy rings and a fine robe and was currently wearing them all. The smirk he had let her know this was the reaction he was going for. \u201cWell your highness it seems one party of unfortunate souls had knowledge that cost them their lives. Which means all the profit is ours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave the map a once over. \u201cGonna needa ship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can afford passage now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hot in Gourdun...\u201d The orc whined. Mist looked to confirm the X was in fact on the continent Gourdun. Most known for attracting incredibly strange magical practices, vibrant natural colors to be used in dye, and the fact it was practically a massive desert with temperatures and quantities of sand to match. Mist laughed rolled up the map and shoved it playfully into the orc\u2019s abs. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Eymirn, it\u2019s the closest port city. We\u2019ll stay here for the night then head out.\u201d Mist said. Kurz nodded. \u201cDibs on the extra furs.\u201d He said gesturing to the bundle on the ground. Before long Mist was asleep as Kurz took the first watch.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kairi was a young woman of legend. Born to a family of humble librarians, the young Kairi discovered in herself an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. She poured over countless magical tomes, absorbing their wisdom and insight by the dozen each day. By age seven she had already mastered the basics of pyromancy. Not long after her thirteenth birthday, she earned an honorary diploma from the Academy of Elemental Magics, completing her mastery over fire, ice, earth, and air. Alchemy and Restoration came easily to the quick learner, shortly followed by Illusionary magic. Enchantments and Conjuration were little more than child\u2019s play for the up-and-coming seventeen-year-old girl, and at age twenty-three she began creating her own magics by combining the highest artforms of each school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, at age twenty-five the prodigal sorceress had attained incredible fame and magical power, earning her legendary title: Omnimancer. Indeed, her crowning achievement was the discovery of an ancient spell which could only be cast by one who had mastered all other magics: Eternal Youth. Confident in her abilities, Kairi created the proper magical array and attempted to cast the incantation upon herself, thus assuring a limitless lifetime of seeking knowledge. However, the spell did not cast as she had expected. The young sorceress created the correct runes, spoke the proper incantations, but the spell had no effect. The grand mages of the six schools stood dumbfounded at the failure. In a fit of furious disappointment, they threatened to revoke her title of Omnimancer unless she could perform the ritual. She pleaded and begged, but the magisters abandoned her without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi was not prepared to give up so easily. Although still young, she was determined to reclaim her title through research. Surely there must have been something missing from her practices, perhaps a spell or cantrip slipped past her studying. For weeks she scoured the archives of the six academies to no avail. Kairi returned home in defeat, visiting her parents for the first time in several years. They welcomed her home and consoled their sorrowful but talented daughter. Her father suggested she find something relaxing to read for a change, and she accepted, returning once more to the first library of her studies. It is here that our real story begins\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d For all her cunning, Kairi tended to fit the label of clumsy. She buried her hand into her golden locks, rubbing her head with more than a few curses beneath her breath before bending down to fetch the assaulting book. A soft velvet cover halted her fuming, and the girl examined the strange tome with the keen eye of an appraiser. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d She had never seen this odd book before, and it bore no writing on its purple, velvet cover. Turning it over, she blew the dust away from its spine, revealing one word carved into the broad spine of the heavy tome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLipomancy? This must be a joke\u2026\u201d The omnimancer sighed and cracked open the book purely out of bland boredom. If this was a ruse, it was an elaborate one. The pages were absolutely filled with diagrams, runes, and magical arrays she had never seen likes of. Unfortunately, none of the writing made sense. The words were all in common tongue, but the syntax was just gibberish. \u201cWhat madman wrote this nonsense?\u201d Kairi began to shut the book but paused as she remembered all of those ancient tomes written in code. \u201cCould this really be some long-lost form of magic? A seventh school of sorcery?\u201d Still sitting atop a pile of dusty books, the young mage drummed her fingers along the spellbook\u2019s spine, lost in thought. The runes and arrays were useless without the proper incantations, but it was worth some investigation. If by some sort of dumb luck she accidentally discovered the spells missing to cast the Eternal Youth ritual, she could reclaim her title!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat settles it!\" Cracking her knuckles, Kairi opened the creaky, dusty tome once more, landing on a random page near the middle. As it opened, something fell from between the parted pages. It hit the floor with a light clink, drawing the girl\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It appeared to be a solid ring of gold, inlaid with three of the most beautiful garnets she\u2019d ever seen. Even in the dim light of the empty library the ring seemed to shine with a light of its own. \u201cBeautiful\u2026\u201d Captivated by the golden trinket, Kairi unwittingly slipped it over her finger. She quietly gasped when it fit perfectly, almost as if it were crafted just for her! Turning her hand over, she admired the beautiful gold against her fair skin. \u201cIt would seem this is my lucky day.\u201d With a contented sigh, the young girl dropped her hand to the book, landing her ring finger directly at the center of an unusual array spanning the whole page. A flash of purple light erupted from the spell tome, swiftly engulfing the girl in its blinding aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever spell had activated from her touch left the poor unsuspecting girl unconscious. Before Kairi even awoke, she was no longer in her family\u2019s library. No, the ring and spellbook had actually teleported her away, but where will our heroine\u2019s journey begin?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was laying on the floor of what looked like a small bedroom with walls and floors made out of stone. The room was ornately decorated with fur skin rugs and finely woven tapestries on the walls. Only a noble could afford furniture like this, so she must be in a castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" The mage muttered to herself as she noticed that the book that was still tightly gripped in her hands and the strange ring was still on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that it was responsible for this, Kairi dropped the book like it was on fire. She then tried to pull the ring off her finger, but discovered that it could not be removed no matter how hard she pulled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... the book and the ring are obviously enchanted.\" The mage remarked. She always found that talking to herself helped to focus her thoughts, \"That book got me into this mess, so it's probably the only way to get me out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving carefully, Kairi approached the book and slowly opened it, afraid of any other tricks the book could have in it. Thankfully nothing happened. Kairi was surprised to see that some of the pages in the book had changed. Before, she could barely understand must of the words, but now it was like someone had translated some of the pages for her. The first page in particular caught her attention so she began to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Brief History of Lipomancy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLipomancy is a school of magic centered on various ways to control and manipulate the body weight of any living thing. Lipomancy has been around for thousands of years, but no one remembers the exact origins of this form of magic. There are theories that it was invented by an obese king that was desperate to lose weight so he could get laid. His experiments ended badly when he accidentally made himself so fat that he became immobile. No one knows if that story is true though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLipomancy was once an extremely popular form of magic. Lipomancers were often paid a small fortune by overweight nobles that wanted a slim physique, but were too lazy to exercise. However Lipomancy fell out of favor in the year 492 after a Lipomancer went crazy and turned every person in a small city into a fatass and then vanished. Common knowledge of Lipomancy slowly faded after that. Today, most scholars consider Lipomancy to be nothing more than a fairytale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange form of magic.\" Kairi remarks as she finishes reading the first page and turns to the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're reading this book, then you must be interested in learning the lost magic of Lipomancy. Learning Lipomancy can grant you great power, but it also comes with great risks. Many novice lipomancers have made themselves permanently obese after accidentally messing up a spell. Some Lipomancer spells cannot be reversed by anyone, even by the caster or another Lipomancer. In such cases, the only way to undo the effects is with diet and exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should start out with something simple. The most basic Lipomancy spell is known as the Touch Fat spell. It causes the part of the body that the lipomancer touches to gain fat equal to the amount of energy they put into the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi reads the instructions for the first spell and then forces herself to stop reading. The book is very interesting, but she should focus on finding a way out of this castle. She picks up the book and opens the door leading out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door, she comes face to face with a small male goblin! Kairi stares at the small monster in surprise and judging by the look on the creature's face, it is just as surprised to see her! Kairi is so surprised that she reacts instinctively and bonks the goblin on the head with the Lipomancy spell book.</span></div></div>",

However, as Kairi moved to pinch the bridge of her nose, she immediately realized she was lying on her back. The pain dulled beneath the panicked return of her last memories. The purple flash rendered her unconscious, but opening her pained eyes now revealed her surroundings. This was not her library, and somehow she was tucked into\u2026 a bed? Not her bed by any means, and Kairi had never seen this room before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage hastily sat up, swinging her feet over the side of the bed. To her relief, whoever tucked her into bed did not take the liberty of changing her clothes. Her hands mindlessly gripped the baggy waistline of her robes before laying their palms atop her slender thighs, lightly gripping the violet fabric. \u201cWherever could I be?\u201d She frowned and looped a strand of golden hair behind her ear before rising to her feet. The soles of her simple shoes met a wood floor, and peering around the room hinted that she may be at an inn. But her hometown had no inn. \u201cThis is absolutely strange\u2026\u201d The young woman glided toward the door, hoping to keep herself hidden for just a bit longer. With an ear to the door, Kairi could hear loud laughter and the hum of a lively tavern. Her room had no window, but she wagered it must be night if the pub had so much business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should thank my host.\u201d More than a little anxiousness filled the young mage, but she reached for the doorknob before her eyes set on the golden ring. \u201cThe book!\u201d Whirling about, Kairi leapt at the bed, frantically rummaging through the bedside drawers, baskets, and she even dove under the bed in search of that wicked tome which spirited her to this strange place. Yet with all her ruckus, she found no sign of the spellbook. The search did yield one result, however, as a knock came to her door. Prone on the floor, Kairi froze. The doorknob creaked, and the mage turned her head with fearful delay. The man who now filled the open doorway quite literally filled the doorway. His frame was almost as broad as it was tall. He wore rough, heavy clothing, but the stained apron tied around his hefty middle identified him as the barkeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like ye be awake, then. How\u2019re ye feelin\u2019, lass?\u201d A thick, northern accent poured from his  wide, gapped smile. The warmth of his voice melted the frigid fear in Kairi, and she stumbled to her feet, smoothing out her robes. After clearing her throat, the mage offered a deep curtsy, almost falling over to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for allowing me to stay in your fine establishment, sir.\u201d The mage offered a practiced smile, bowing her head some. To her shock, the innkeeper slapped a hand to his belly and burst into deep laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir? Ain\u2019t nobody be callin\u2019 me sir, lass. The name\u2019s Finn. I\u2019m just a simple man who enjoys takin\u2019 care o\u2019 good folk like yerself.\u201d He folded his arms across his wide chest, still beaming. Although still a stranger, something about the man left the young woman feeling more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-- I\u2026 Yes, how silly of me.\u201d Kairi, bowed her head again before glancing toward the bed. \u201cThank you again.\u201d A low rumble rose in the pit of her stomach, and she clasped a slim hand over her middle. Redness instantly flushed over the mage\u2019s cheeks, and Finn barked another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, lass. Ye must be starvin\u2019. Let\u2019s get ye somethin\u2019 to eat.\u201d The broad innkeeper bobbed his head, motioning her to follow. Turning about, his footfalls down the stairs sent a slight tremble through the whole floor. Having had no chance to respond, Kairi gnawed at her lip before following after her host. Kairi shut the door behind her and breathed in a familiar scent. The warm, spicy sweetness of cinnamon met her nose and left the mage salivating. Gripping the railing tightly, the poorly balanced mage tread down the stairwell, descending into the soft light of the main tavern. Hunger renewed as the savory scent intensified. To Kairi\u2019s astonishment, the tavern was absolutely packed with patrons, though perhaps the general state of each patron caused this sensation of occupancy. Not one of the people in the pub were anything less than overweight. These folks ate well, and with such a delicious scent in the air it was no wonder why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon over, lass. Ye\u2019re just in time fer a fresh batch o\u2019 the wife\u2019s bakin\u2019!\u201d Finn\u2019s voice pierced the buzz of the tavern, and Kairi turned her head toward the bar. Cinnamon rolls. Not just any cinnamon rolls, but the fluffiest, stickiest, most heavenly scented cinnamon rolls that Kairi had ever seen. A small pyramid of the delicacies sat atop a wooden tray, each roll drizzled with a heavy hand of sweet frosting. Kairi all but floated toward the beckoning baked goods. A few of the portly patrons stretched their thick fingers toward the perfectly stacked pyramid, but Finn swatted them away. \u201cNot just yet, lads. Let the lil\u2019 lassie have first pickin\u2019s.\u201d As Kairi approached the high counter, she looked up and was met with a grinning nod from the broad barkeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey smell divine, sir.\u201d She paused, and he raised a brow at her. \u201cFinn.\u201d She smiled and corrected herself before eyeing the pile of pastries. Again the girl gnawed her lip as a low rumble rose in her slim tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell go on, lass. No one\u2019s stoppin\u2019 ye.\u201d Somehow his grin widened, but Kairi still felt nothing but warmth from his presence. Each of the cinnamon rolls looked absolutely fantastic, but the mage could only imagine the unhealthiness of such a treat. The roll at the pyramid\u2019s peak was fluffier and stickier than the rest, still visibly steaming. Perhaps only one couldn\u2019t hurt. After all, she was dreadfully hungry...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kairi again glanced at the overtly salivating crowd around her, and decided against the baked delight. However, no proper lady wishes to offend her host, and as such the mage offered a polite bow. \u201cI apologize, but sweets often disagree with my stomach. Is there anything else I might be able to eat for supper? Perhaps you have some bread or vegetables?\u201d The innkeepers looked at Kairi as though she had two heads, but quickly sighed and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye, lass. Go on and find yerself a seat. I\u2019ll bring yer meal shortly.\u201d Finn threw the towel onto his shoulder and turned to the kitchen doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! One more thing\u2026\u201d Kairi leaned out across the counter, and the innkeeper paused to glance back. \u201cWhen you found me unconscious, did you happen to see a book?\u201d The barkeep shrugged and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBook? No, lass I didn\u2019t see a book with ye. Ye were just lyin\u2019 out there in the grass. Lucky I found ye before the snow came in.\u201d Snow. So she must be somewhere in the Northlands. \u201cWhat sort o\u2019 book was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi paused and made two L\u2019s with her thumbs, creating a square frame in the air. \u201cIt was approximately this large, and it was heavy with a purple cover.\u201d Finn still shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m still a little hazy, but I believe the word \u2018Lipomancy\u2019 was written on its side.\u201d At that point, the entire bar fell silent. Several utensils hit the tables with soft thuds, and from the kitchen a few mugs could be heard crashing to the floor. Fearful that she had said something forbidden, Kairi scanned the room for any sudden movements. \u201cDid I say something to offend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur town be lyin\u2019 in the shadow o\u2019 a terrible sorcerer, lass. Calls himself the Lipomancer.\u201d Finn marched back to the counter and snatched her upper arm in his beefy mitt. He squeezed far harder than necessary, and Kairi\u2019s eyes lit up with fear. \u201cWhat\u2019re ye doin\u2019 pokin\u2019 around in that sort o\u2019 magic?\u201d A vein began popping up along the side of his head. \u201cYe drop out o\u2019 thin air, ye cannot explain where ye came from, and now ye be askin\u2019 about dark magics. How do we know ye ain\u2019t a spy fer the wicked, crafty ol\u2019 Lipomancer?\u201d His nostrils flared, and Kairi uttered a one-word cantrip, sending a light shock into the man\u2019s hand. He immediately released her, and the young mage fell backwards, hitting the floor rump first with a thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d She gritted her teeth, but to her surprise, the pain wasn\u2019t coming from her backside, but from her stomach. Suddenly she felt like she hadn\u2019t eaten in days, though the sensation would soon be drowned out by fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck! The damn brat zapped me! She\u2019s a witch! I knew it!\u201d Finn barked, clutching his hand in pain. She hadn\u2019t intended to hurt him, but the panic in her chest must have empowered the spell a little. Now all of the overweight bar patrons were circling around the young woman. \u201cGet her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi uttered the initiator of a fire spell and stretched out her hand, palming a globe of fire in front of her. \u201cStay back! Allow me to leave in peace and I shall not harm you!\u201d The superstitious townsfolk begrudgingly obliged, stepping away from Kairi as she took her exit. With a slam she shut the door behind her, immediately gasping at the cold, night air. Her breath clung to the cold breeze before blowing off into the dark, and the abrupt change in temperature broke her concentration on the fire spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer time in the Northlands did not make much impact on the weather, and Kairi was dressed for her home in the far south. Each gust of bitter wind cut right through her simple robes. If she didn\u2019t want to freeze to death, she\u2019d need to fight off the cold. Weaving her hands, Kairi uttered her invocations and a soft glow encased her frame. A re-purposed fire enchantment would keep her warm, but only for so long. If she wanted to survive out here long enough to get back she\u2019d need to equip herself with proper winter wear. Scanning the dark street, Kairi saw what appeared to be a shop closed for the night. In a dash she scurried to the door and found it locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor any non-magic user this would have been problematic, but for the once and future Omnimancer, it was a simple solution. Kairi reached into her reagent pouch and withdrew a simple stick of copper, no longer than her index finger. Quietly she whispered her words of power, and the key seemed to almost melt into the lock. With one final word it re-solidified. A single, simple turn saw the door unlocked, and Kairi took no time to look around before scuttling inside. She shut the door behind her and leaned on it just as she dissipated the fire enchantment. It was still cold in the dark shop, but there was no wind to freeze her bones. From the initial looks of it, the young woman guessed to be some sort of general store. \u201cPerfect. They ought to have at least a coat or something I can--\u201d An audible growl rose from her stomach, and Kairi doubled over in pain. Just as before, the pain came out of nowhere, though this time it was twice as painful. Perhaps she should have eaten that cinnamon roll after all. Stumbling forth, the mage pushed the pain out of her mind, at least for the moment. Several minutes were spent rummaging through the various drawers and containers located about the poorly organized store, but what Kairi found was no coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one drawer, under a pile of scrolls lay a familiar purple tome. \u201cAh! There you are.\u201d Kairi grasped the book and immediately tucked it beneath one arm. With this she at least had some semblance of hope to return home. However, upon turning about, the young woman found...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon turning around, the young woman found a long, elegant fur coat. Kairi glanced about the shop before sliding it from the rack. It was a lovely shade of shimmering black, and upon putting the garment on, she felt immediately warmer. \u201cThat should keep the cold out.\u201d The mage\u2019s eyes dropped to the floor, and she snatched up a small traveling satchel. Smiling lightly, Kairi shoved the heavy tome inside before tossing the sling over her shoulder. Both hands could be necessary if Kairi ran into those tubby townsfolk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment something caught her eye. A small, purple glimmer shined from the darkness of another room, and slipping between the moonbeams, the mage stealthily approached the strange, purple gem. The coloration reminded her of the light that brought her to this strange place, but as a learned mage, Kairi knew picking up unidentified enchanted artifacts could spell trouble. She assessed it briefly, studying its form. The faceted cut of the gem did seem to reflect many of the arrays and patterns she remembered from the book, so it was very likely related. The question now was if taking it was worth the risk.</span></div></div>",

The men were on their way to slay the Lipomancer and his cult of worshipers and were discussing their plans until Trixie walked on over. Now Trixie stood at a stunning height of 6'4\" and had long black hair with hypnotic blue eyes. She tends to dressed in extremely skimpy clothing or tight dresses that show off her seductive figure. Like any succubus she would often lure men into perversion and screw them over. The mention of the Lipomancer had caught her interest. Then an idea formed in her head. She would use these adventurers to lead her to the Lipomancer so that she could drain him of his life force, taking his power and adding it to her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello boys, it sounds like you have quite an adventure ahead of you.\" Trixie said in a flirtatious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the adventurers starts drooling upon seeing the seductive Trixie. Trixie smirks knowing that it won't be long before the adventurers start following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang those are some large melons.\" Another adventurer said as his nose started bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys would you stop gawking at her and actually tell her our plans. I swear that you guys act like a bunch of perverts whenever a sexy woman walks up to you.\" Said the head warrior who was probably the the of the group. \"Please forgive these brutes all they ever think about is fame, glory, and ladies. The name is Gustav, the drooling werewolf is Rex, and the tiger barbarian is Mitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRex and Mitch attempt to grope Trixie's boobs only to be bonk on the head by Gustav.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you two knock it off! How many times do I have to tell you not to touch a woman's chest. I swear you two are the biggest pervs that I met. If there was a succubus here right now you two would be the first ones that she'll turn into sex slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie grins knowing that her spell is working perfectly. She can already tell Rex and Mitch would be too easy. Trixie actually likes it when men are hard to get. It makes seducing them a joy. Trixie usually uses her persuasiveness or beer to get guys like Gustav to submit. Trixie figured that someone is drunk can't really refuse any, but she figured romancing would probably work better for she observed that Gustav didn't have an alcoholic beverage in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now don't you think you're being harsh. I'm used to men touching my chest all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't encourage them. You'll only make it worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say and bye the way I'm Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie then kisses Gustav on the cheek which causes him to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you guys tell me more about this Lipomancer? I'm dying to know more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we know is that he likes to fatten people up, especially women. I'm going to slay that bloody pervert for the glory of the kingdom.\" Gustav said after regaining composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful darling. If you need an enchantress I'll be waiting.\" Trixie said while winking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie proceeds to leave knowing that they'll come to her sooner or later.</span></div></div>",

Whatever we heard back there is definitely getting closer, and if it\u2019s like anything else in this place I\u2019d rather it not catch up\u2026 Besides, we\u2019re almost out of this pit, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe donkey shook his head, his run slowing to an exhausted stumble as his breaths grew harsher and strained, \u201cPlease\u2026 I just need to\u2026\u201d The male came to a complete stop, the rolls on his hefty gut folding as he bent over to place his hands on his knees and take wheezing breaths. His dark green tunic seemed far too small for his body; several buttons on his shirt long having popped off to let his wobbly tummy hang exposed over pants that seemed far too tight on his tubby legs and rump, all seeming to imply that his corpulence was a recent development. The donkey looked up at the vixen as she stopped as well before he groaned, \u201cJust for a minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tVianna sighed as she turned around, but nodded, \u201cOkay Desmond\u2026\u201d She said as she held her torch up high, peering into the darkness past the burro, searching for any signs of movement, \u201cBut no longer\u2026 we can rest fully once we know we\u2019re safe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesmond grunted as he looked behind him, seeing not much more than she had, \u201cHow do you even know where we\u2019re going\u2026\u201d He said, pausing to wipe the sweat from his brow, \u201cThis place is like a maze!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes\u2026 that\u2019s because it is,\u201d The vixen said, placing a paw on her own stomach. While her body was nowhere near as portly as her associate\u2019s, it was clear that she was now nearing a chubby frame. Her pudge wasn\u2019t quite a hindrance yet, but it was beginning to make her beige linen outfit feel tight, straining the belts that held her adventuring equipment, \u201cThese tunnels, whether designed to or not, are probably meant to confuse and deter intruders\u2026 or maybe keep them trapped\u2026\u201d She gulped, her eyes gazing into the distance now, \u201cMake sure that they stay so they can be\u2026 Well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe donkey frowned as he patted his bloated belly, \u201cFattened up\u2026 I still don\u2019t know why but\u2026 I really hope we make it out of here before we find out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry friend\u2026 we will,\u201d The vixen said, placing her paw on his shoulder and smiling, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back to the Exploration Guild in no time. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a way to reverse what\u2019s happened to you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesmond smiled at that and nodded. He was about to say something to the fox, but before he could they were interrupted by a soft splash from the corridor behind them, \u201cThat was\u2026 but that means it\u2019s still following us\u2026\u201d Desmond whispered breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tVianna nodded, \u201cWhatever it is sounds big\u2026 We need to keep moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d The fat donkey boy replied, still grinning, \u201cI think I\u2019m ready no-HRK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe vixen yelped as she saw what had silenced her partner, her eyes widening in terror. A thin, syrupy green mass was falling from the ceiling right into the donkey\u2019s open mouth. The stream of ooze thickened as it continued to flow into the male\u2019s gullet, Desmond trying to stop the flow with his paws but only managing to slow its progress as it poured between his fingers. Soon he gave up trying to fight it, finding that his hands were more useful massaging his gut as the already enormous belly began to swell even more, looking past the ooze at Vianna as he whined in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDesmond! Oh gods! \u2026don\u2019t try to fight it!\u201d She shouted to him, not even sure if her advice would help, \u201cI-I think I can\u2026\u201d She bit her lip as she pulled open a leather satchel she wore to desperately fumble through some potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanwhile Desmond was still unwillingly consuming the slime attacking him, his belly growing ever tighter and larger as he held it in his hands. The last remaining buttons of his shirt finally burst free, letting the overburdened garment fall open to expose more of his growing paunch and heaving moobs. By the time Vianna finally found the vial she was looking for, the last of the slime creature had dropped from the ceiling and made its way past the helpless donkey\u2019s lips, causing him to let out a heavy belch as he gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2026?! What the-\u201c Desmond groaned as his overstuffed stomach gurgled loudly, \u201cWhat WAS that! What just happened to me?!\u201d He grunted sharply past gritted teeth as he grabbed at his massive stomach, \u201cOh gods no\u2026! I think it\u2019s still\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust relax\u2026 it looks like a slime got the j-jump on you\u2026\u201d She replied, trying as best she could to hide the concern in her voice. She stuck the vial in her mouth, biting down on the cork to hold it so she could retain her grip on her torch. She examined and felt  Desmond's belly with the other paw; his gut felt rock hard now and was now so big that it sagged down to his knees, \u201cThere was\u2026 a lot of it\u2026 b-but I can help! Slimes don\u2019t usually do this sort of thing, but it\u2019s not unheard of and there are ways to fix it. All you have to do is drink this and it should be\u2026 \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped mid-sentence, her eyes widening with absolute dread before whispering, \u201c\u2026.there\u2019s something on my leg\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Vixen yelped, moments later dropping the vial and her torch to the stone floor with a clatter as she was suddenly yanked backwards by her ankle. She immediately disappeared out of view past Desmond's belly as she hit the ground before being dragged off into the dark howling and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cVianna? VIANNA!?\u201d Desmond shouted after her, his stomach wobbling tremendously as he tried to waddle to her rescue, causing him to clutch it once more as the pain in his gut halted him, \u201cDAMMIT! Need to\u2026 hhnngh! Get this thing out first\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Donkey glanced about at the floor until he found the vial of potion Vianna had grabbed for him lying next to the fading, though thankfully still lit torch. Desmond waddled towards it, grunting and huffing as he tried to bend over and reach the object, not even coming close as his swollen stomach got in the way. After several attempts and a great deal of cursing, he finally gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<i>VIANNA</i>!\u201d He called out once again, wincing and braying as he clutched at his belly, the slime squirming within once more. To the donkey\u2019s dismay, he was beginning to realize, astoundingly, that he was hungry, \u201cWhatever this thing is doing\u2026 It can\u2019t be good...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBelieve me\u2026\u201d A voice whispered to him, feminine and dripping with menace, \u201cIt\u2019sss not\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDesmond's ears twitched, but the rest of his body froze entirely. He tried to let out a scream but found it was caught in his throat. He was only able to free it as the last light from the torch sputtered out and left him in complete darkness, his cries mixing with the laughter echoing from behind him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another cheerful day was coming to pass over the small village of Little Silverhorne. The sun shone brightly down upon the town square as men and woman of all races and creeds passed by one another, waving and cheerfully exchanging greetings before resuming their errands. The small town was a veritable beacon of prosperity, growing in so many different ways: whether it be the crops the village profited from, or the people living in it, both in population and hefty girth, or the town itself as new homes and buildings were raised. Little Silverhorne was truly an idyllic community, and from what Uturi could see, the closest thing to paradise she had ever witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the newly arrived deer girl walked through the town center, passing by a fountain being worked upon by craftsmen, she couldn\u2019t help but feel like she was turning heads. The young redheaded and brown-furred doe didn\u2019t think that it was her appearance at first, as she never considered herself as somebody eye-catchingly attractive. She always felt she was a bit average really, with no real curves to speak of and nearly flat in the chest. Others had called her things like \u201ccute\u201d or \u201cdainty\u201d before, but she never thought those were the kinds of qualities men or women found particularly appealing. Yet as she caught a few more glances she realized it might have been the bow slung over her back, or perhaps her leather armor that concerned them. To her, these were merely the tools of a ranger, things that felt as though they were a part of her, but to these peaceful townsfolk they might have stood for trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon found she wasn\u2019t the only one in town equipped this way as something caught her eye across the square. One man in particular stood out to her amongst the crowd, a scowling hyena , his fur dark grey and spotted, the man in nearly full plate armor leaning against the outside of a tavern, making certain to stay to the shadows. He looked up at her, his gaze catching hers and making her blood run cold before he slipped away through the bar\u2019s front door. She saw the sunlight catch upon a metal heater shield he carried upon his back, and the hilt of the sword sheathed at his side, before he slipped away into the dark. Unfazed by how ominous the brief encounter had been, the girl hurried her way across the cobblestone streets and into the very same bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInside it was dimly lit and smoky, but still had a pleasant feel to it thanks to the sound of patrons laughing and chatting as they ate, the sight of waitresses and barmaids running to and fro with fine ale and hearty dishes, and the succulent, heavenly smell of freshly cooked food of all kinds. The tavern was so appealing that Uturi had to remind herself that she was here to conduct business, not to grab lunch, so she scanned the packed dining hall until she saw what she was looking for. There in the far corner, as far away from any of the other patrons as he could get, sat the man she had seen outside, her eyes drawn to him by the glint of metal in the soft light. She could see that he had taken his cuirass and shield off, probably to make it possible to sit comfortably, but beyond that kept every other piece of armor donned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she moved towards the hyena sitting there, she saw that he was already looking at her, and while his eyes would occasionally dart about the room towards the other patrons they didn\u2019t stray long from the approaching doe. As she came closer, Uturi felt she had to be certain, \u201cWell then, I suppose you must be from the Exploration Guild too, Remus right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven before she was done speaking, the male lifted a gauntleted finger to his lips and hissed at her harshly, \u201cShut your fool mouth!\u201d He whispered at her as he glanced in the direction of a passing waitress, \u201cSeat yourself before you get us both killed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTrying to hold back a laugh, more due to the fear of hurting her new partner\u2019s feelings than worrying she\u2019d lose her life, she did as he told her, taking the chair across the table from him and lowering her voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t help but feel you\u2019re being a bit dramatic\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust being careful\u2026\u201d He whispered back, \u201cDon\u2019t bring up our guild, don\u2019t bring up our job, at least not until we\u2019re alone\u2026 I thought this place would be less crowded, should have known better, considering\u2026\u201d He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his plate armor clinking softly amongst the bar chatter. Uturi only smirked playfully as she looked him over, noticing that the only thing on the table between them was a small, full glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlright\u2026 Shall we get something to eat then? The food looks pretty good here for such a small village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus finished glaring suspiciously at a pair of men chatting at the next table over before looking back to her, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game kid...\u201d He grumbled, \u201cOr have you really not noticed what\u2019s going on around here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course I\u2019ve noticed! I\u2019m a ranger, I have to rely on my senses more than you do I\u2019d bet!\u201d She said, raising her voice enough to make him cringe, \u201cAnd what I\u2019ve noticed is there\u2019s nothing TO notice, this place is peaceful, quaint, and\u2026 well, dull...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe hyena boy could only growl to himself as he looked down at the glass of water before him, \u201cI knew they\u2019d send some rookie on this job, it\u2019s like they want us to fail!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c<i>Excuse me</i>?\u201d The deer grumbled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have seen it, Miss <i>Ranger</i>! How every single person in this town is\u2026 is fat!\u201d He whispered, gesturing around them, \u201cEven in this room alone you can see it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi rolled her eyes, but looked about the room anyways. As she did so, she realized that Remus was right: Everyone else in the bar with them ran the gamut from very chubby to massively obese. Each time she looked at a new patron it felt like they were the fattest person she had ever seen\u2026 until she caught sight of the next one! Not only that, but as she gazed about the room she saw that every single person had a plate before them piled with large portions, and it was rare to see somebody without food in their mouths. It was indeed somewhat unsettling, but the doe still didn\u2019t see it as anything to be alarmed about, \u201cWell this is a pretty wealthy community\u2026 with all the grain and produce they sell to other parts of the realm, it\u2019s no wonder most of the people here are eating well themselves\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust look at them,\u201d Remus scoffed, \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve ever seen people nearly as large as those here? You surely noticed\u2026 how else did you know I was your partner from the guild?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi thought to herself for a moment as she brushed a red lock of hair from her eyes before finally saying, \u201cYour armor I guess? I mean\u2026. That must be it. Otherwise I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must have known I was an outsider, whether you realized it or not, because you and me are the <i>thinnest people here</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened and her mouth hung open as she finally understood how her partner had felt this whole time. There was something wrong with this town, and worst of all they were right in the middle of it and stuck out like a sore thumb. Uturi suddenly felt as though everyone in the bar had noticed and was watching them, \u201cSo you think there\u2019s something wrong with them? Like they\u2019re hexed to grow big?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at his water again, Remus replied, \u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut who would do such a thing? And why?\u201d Uturi snorted. She was willing to entertain Remus\u2019s delusions now, but still found it all so ridiculous. What would anybody in their right mind have to gain from fattening up an entire village?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d the hyena admitted, \u201cBut still, we should be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could ask him more about the town, the two were interrupted by the arrival of a waitress, \u201cYou two want some grub?\u201d Her voice rang, sweet and heavy like dripping honey.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe deer and hyena looked up at her, a rather robust elf maiden carrying a large, steaming plate of roasted duck and boiled potatoes in one hand and two mugs of beer grasped in the other. Uturi looked over the elf girl before her, taken aback by how tubby the blonde was, her belly sagging over the top of her skirt and her bosoms looking as though they would spill over and out her overburdened corset at any minute. The doe gulped and tried to push this image out of her mind as she thought of her reply.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The waitress stood there for a moment, looking the two over as she waited for one of them to respond. Remus couldn\u2019t stop staring the elf down as if she were a threat and Uturi could have sworn that the woman\u2019s happy expression soured a bit when she caught the hyena\u2019s gaze. The doe shifted uncomfortably in her seat, now feeling as though it were much too big for her, even more so than normal for the tiny deer girl. Uturi couldn\u2019t tell if Remus\u2019s paranoia was contagious, or if he really did have a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elf spoke again however, it certainly seemed to reinforce the latter possibility, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You guys don\u2019t have any gold? I\u2019m sure we can open up a tab, you both must be starving after your travels\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Uturi began, certain that Remus was about to spit venom at the waitress. He was already growling softly at her, but Uturi was in the middle of trying to diffuse the situation more peacefully, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be leaving now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeaving!\u201d The tubby waitress chuckled, drawing the attention of some of the heftier patrons around them, \u201cYou must be mad! You poor twigs haven\u2019t even had a bite yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growl began to rise in Remus\u2019s throat, the canine almost barking his words, \u201cMy partner just said we were leaving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the frown upon the elf woman\u2019s plump lips was unmistakable as she slammed the tray onto their table, sending it rattling and nearly toppling over Remus\u2019s glass. Uturi almost leapt from her seat in surprise, but the armored hyena remained undisturbed, still baring his teeth at the waitress as almost all the other customers looked over at them nervously. The hyena boy ignored them, grabbing his cuirass off the floor as he prepared to leave, \u201cTake that plate away wench, we will not be eating!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d Uturi meekly added, sighing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress placed her hands on her considerably wide hips as she scolded the two, \u201cIt is a free meal! Who in their right mind would pass that up? Both of you should be ashamed of yourselves, spitting in the face of our hospitality! Balking as we offer you a share of our bounty while people starve in places like Mightreach, wishing they had your good fortunes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStarving, huh?\u201d Remus said as he stood up, grinning ear to ear while poking the hefty servant in the gut, \u201cIs it because you ate all their food bar wench? Now step aside porker, me and m-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus was completely caught off guard as the waitress slammed her incredibly bulky belly into him, the force enough to send the stunned canine into the wall, his chainmail undershirt clinking as he tried his best to stay on his feet. Before he could even catch his breath and reach for his sword, the elf maiden was already before him, pinning him to the wall with her hands to each side and her doughy but firm paunch pressed against him. He dropped his cuirass to the ground with a clatter as he was crushed, gritting his teeth in pain as the elf spoke calmly, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand me dogbreath\u2026 You want to stay in our village, you better learn our ways\u2026\u201d She hissed softly, her sweet voice growing even sultrier as she pressed her substantially curvaceous belly and tits against him with even more force, \u201cAnd that means clearing your plate, asking for seconds, and earning your girth like everybody else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid pressed even harder against him, forcing the air from his lungs and the links of his armor to bite into him, even through his tunic. Remus tried to cry out in pain, but all that escaped his throat were weak gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off of him!\u201d Uturi shouted, the doe on her feet the moment her companion was attacked. She kept her hand to the hilt of her dagger, but was desperately hoping that somebody else would intervene first. As she looked through the tavern once more however, she discovered that everyone had conveniently gone back to stuffing their faces and guzzling ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, I think your \u2018friend\u2019 is a little jealous,\u201d The waitress smiled, nodding towards Uturi as the elf cooed seductively at Remus, brushing her braided golden locks away from her swollen bosoms before shoving them into the squirming hyena\u2019s face, \u201cShe is clearly threatened by a <i>real</i> woman such as myself, a woman with curves and a nice... soft\u2026 body\u2026 Perfect to squeeze and love, don\u2019t you think so puppy man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus only grunted and gasped as she pushed her extremely exposed cleavage against him. His cheeks burned red even as he struggled to push the heavy maiden away from his body, sweat dripping from his brow from both his attempts at resistance and the heat coming from the blubbery elf. As his breathing shortened though, his struggles quickly weakened, his vision starting to cloud and fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned as she looked down her nose, and breasts, at him, \u201cYes, yes, that is all a puny weak man such as yourself would say! If I even wanted a twig like you, I doubt you could handle me, not without some meat on your bones! You shouldn\u2019t shy away from your meals, maybe then you\u2019d be more of a man than a pathetic dog, somebody with the strength and pride to heft a full belly before him. Maybe then your deer friend would pay you more attention, but don\u2019t worry, once you run out of breath I will fix all tha-OOF!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid stumbled as Uturi\u2019s elbow slammed into her side, almost keeping her balance before falling into one of the empty tables nearby and crushing it beneath her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould have watched your back!\u201d Said the deer girl, swiftly scooping Remus\u2019s gear from the ground as soon as she heard gasps from the townsfolk around them, gripping the dazed hyena\u2019s arm before tugging him towards the exit, and muttering \u201cWe\u2019re out of this damn pigsty\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met no resistance as they left through the front, most of the other patrons too busy either helping the fallen maiden up or murmuring fearfully amongst themselves. Even as they had made it safely outside though, Uturi still felt like they were in danger, \u201cSo much for keeping a low profile\u2026\u201d She grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus was still catching his breath, gasping heavily while he clumsily reached for his cuirass. Uturi shook her head, but lifted it closer towards him before he tugged it close and hugged it protectively to his chest, \u201cI\u2026 huff\u2026 unh\u2026 told you these people were <i>nuts</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer girl snorted a chuckle, \u201cYeah, okay, I believe you now, but you didn\u2019t help going off on her like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Remus looked back at the tavern warily, \u201cYou saw how she acted and heard what she said to us, she obviously would not let us leave so easily, at least not without eating all that food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi looked at him before frowning herself and staring at the ground thoughtfully, \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve got a point there\u2026 But now what are we supposed to do? We caused quite a scene back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena nodded, \u201cThat we did, and if there\u2019s some wickedness at work here then it\u2019s almost certain that there\u2019s more than an individual behind it. There was surely somebody back there at the bar involved in it, if not the barmaid herself,\u201d He pondered, looking over the piece of armor in his hands, \u201cEither way, those corrupting this town will know there are outsiders here, ones that have already caused them more trouble than they\u2019re used to.<br>\r\n\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really convinced all these people are out to get us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Uturi sighed, \u201cThen again after what I just saw I\u2019m starting to buy into it too\u2026 And if you\u2019re right about this, we should get moving, it\u2019s getting dark, any ideas on where to head next?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The streets were much emptier now that the sun was setting, but she still didn\u2019t feel safe anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAbout that, what exactly is our job anyways?\u201d She asked, easily keeping pace in her leather armor, \u201cI know one of our guildmates went missing around here\u2026 but if it\u2019s a sign of trouble, it seems odd to send other members without hiring soldiers to protect them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey did send a soldier m\u2019lady.

I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t send more than us to find your master, but like I said I don\u2019t worry myself with details... it just means more gold for me.\u201d Remus said as he looked over the houses they were passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaster? The <i>guildmaster</i>?! Vianna Monroe!\u201d Uturii said, her mind reeling at the very prospect, \u201cWhat\u2026 WHY, how?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus stopped and turned to see her having some sort of mental collapse and grabbed her roughly by the shoulder with one paw while covering her mouth with the other, \u201cKeep your damn wits about you! There are bound to be people looking for us after that mess we caused, you want them to find us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe frantic doe squeezed her eyes shut, taking deep breaths before grabbing at his paw and pushing it away from her, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s just\u2026 Why wouldn\u2019t they tell me any of this? Why would they tell <i>you</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus shrugged, \u201cThey told me I\u2019d be meeting a rookie, maybe they just don\u2019t trust you yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve been a member of the Exploration Guild for over three years\u2026\u201d She said, her voice growing soft and distant, \u201cI haven\u2019t been an initiate since I was a teen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Remus replied, grimacing to himself as the conversation came to a dead halt. He watched as Uturi started walking again, though aimlessly now, not even waiting for him to lead her. Before he let her pass him however, Remus placed an armored paw on her shoulder, \u201cLook\u2026 Maybe this guild of yours doesn\u2019t trust you, but maybe that\u2019s why they still sent you. This mission must be important if it\u2019s your Guildmaster we\u2019re after, maybe they want you to show them who they can trust?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus felt a sudden jolt of confusion at what he had just said. He didn\u2019t want to see his partner in such low spirits, especially if they had to work together. But for a moment he didn\u2019t feel like he was trying to cheer her up to be sure she could carry her weight; It almost felt like he felt sorry for the deer girl. He pulled his paw away from her shoulder, but before he started walking again she pulled him into a hug, the deer fighting back tears as she murmured, \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe hyena only chuckled as he patted her on the back, \u201cYeah, sure, and thank you for saving my ass back at the bar. Just pull yourself together though, huh? I have a feeling we might still have a lot to go through before this is all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two walked down the streets of Little Silverhorne as night slowly fell. Remus truly had no clue how right his statement was, and if the two knew what lay before them then they wouldn\u2019t take all the riches in the world in exchange for one more second in that town. For now however, the hyena was blissfully unaware and for the first time in a while he caught himself genuinely smiling.</span></div></div>",

Uturi and Remus walked over the stone cobbles, these much older and more worn than the ones in the town square, and there was silence between them as they looked about the manors. Thanks to Remus however it wasn\u2019t an awkward one at least, and Uturi was the first to break it, \u201cSo what are we doing here\u2026? You think Vianna might be in one of these old manses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot exactly\u2026\u201d Remus said, \u201cShe might have been here before, at least that\u2019s what a few of the friendlier locals told me. They said she came here to talk to the parents of some missing girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUturi rubbed her chin as they neared a mansion at the end of the road, \u201cThen goes missing herself not long after\u2026 No way that\u2019s coincidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, those were my thoughts as well. The family is very rich, own a great deal of land around these parts. Usually it's not hard for people of their status to find a helping hand in matters like this... and yet nobody seems able to find their kid.\u201d He said as they finally reached the mansion's doors, the hyena grasping a rusty knocker on them and slamming it loudly, \u201cHello? We're here to meet with the Berrywaters!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey didn\u2019t need to wait long before one of the house\u2019s servants, a brown haired ocelot girl, opened one of the doors to greet them. By this point it was no surprise that she was pretty fat as well, almost bursting from the maid outfit she was dressed in. She was actually one of the thinner residents they had met, but Uturi couldn\u2019t help but think she must feel uncomfortable in those clothes. Yet the maid was all smiles as she spoke to them, \u201cHi there! Something I can help you guys with? I\u2019m sure the Mistress wouldn\u2019t mind treating you two to a hot mea-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo thank you,\u201d Remus said, pushing the door open, the plump ocelot girl shying back a few steps as he made his way inside, \u201cWe\u2019re here on business only.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cS-Sir! I c-can\u2019t let you in without the Mistress or Master\u2019s ap-p-proval\u2026!\u201d The maid cried meekly, gasping as Uturi stepped in after him, \u201cN-No, please wait miss!\u201d She pleaded, locking the front door behind them and running in front of the two as they entered the main foyer, a lavishly decorated room with stone tile floors and a grand staircase leading to the second floor, \u201cI can fetch the Mistress! Just please, wait here and don\u2019t touch a thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Uturi nodded, looking over to Remus and smiling as he nodded curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd with that, the feline maid ran as quickly as she could up the staircase, her pudgy rear shaking back and forth as she did. Uturi looked over at Remus and couldn\u2019t help but notice he was staring after her as she reached the end, the girl panting a little but still energetic enough to run through a wide set of oaken doors at the top. It wasn\u2019t one of his usual scowls oddly enough, in fact he almost looked interested, \u201cRemus\u2026? Back at the tavern, what that woman said, was it um\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe hyena averted his gaze from the maid almost immediately, instead choosing to look over at a portrait of a young, surprisingly thin cow girl nearby, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean Uturi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou do!\u201d She said, blushing a bit while she folded her arms, \u201cWhat she was saying about\u2026 um, big girls. Do you agree? I mean, do you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAm I attracted to larger women? As odd as it is to bring it up now, I believe that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking,\u201d Remus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEr yes, well are you\u2026?\u201d The deer gulped, this whole conversation turning out to be more uncomfortable than she had expected, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to judge\u2026 just wondering I guess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd how do you know I like girls at all?\u201d He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUturi\u2019s face grew even redder, and she looked away embarrassed, \u201cWell I guess I merely a\u2026 assumed\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know, I\u2019m just making it harder for you,\u201d He chuckled, the sellsword scratching the side of his face ponderously as he walked over to get a closer look at the painting, \u201cI\u2019ve been fond of plenty of women in my time, including plumper ones, and I still enjoyed their company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh, well\u2026 Okay then,\u201d She glanced over to the painting then back to him, \u201cBut I mean, do you <i>prefer</i> them or\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus lifted his paw up to silence her, and for a moment Uturi felt an intense twinge of shame and regret, fearing she had offended him. His next words though brought a surge of relief through her, \u201cQuiet, I think I hear someone coming\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first the thuds were soft, and she could barely hear them even though they were repeating at regular intervals. Soon enough they grew louder and, as the two waited in the foyer staring up the stairs in the direction the sounds came from, thunderous. The two partners exchanged quick glances before their attention was drawn back to the double doors at the second floor as they began to rattle in their frames. Uturi took a moment to reflect on just how wide the doors were before they swung open to reveal why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding at the landing atop the stairs was a cow woman who now stepped forward, the weight of her bare hooves shaking the banisters of the stairway as they revealed themselves to be the source of all the commotion. Uturi stood there, gaping in awe as she saw the Mistress of the house. Even Remus seemed visibly surprised, his eyebrows arched as he caught sight of the cow. The titanic bovine looking down at them past bloated breasts and a boulder of a belly had to have been the fattest person in this entire town, and in a town where everyone was portly this fact alone stood as testament to her size. She wore quite a bit of jewelry, most of it much too small from the jeweled rings adorning her sausage-like fingers to the golden necklaces swallowed by neck fat, but they suffered little from her mass compared to the dress she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery breath she took looked strained as she wheezed, her sizable bosoms heaving against the white silken gown, the brown-furred orbs pressed tight against it even though the once exquisite garment still looked as though it were many sizes too large for Uturi herself to wear. The gown might have once been a thing of beauty, but now it was ruined by a large tear down the middle that ran from the bottom almost all the way up its length, stopping just short of the cow\u2019s breasts. This left the dress wide open to expose her colossal belly, the intact parts of the garment flowing around to the sides of the massive paunch like an improvised and very expensive cape. What little that remained of the front of the gown was stained heavily, most likely from sweat and food such as the large turkey leg she chewed on even now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then!\u201d The Mistress boomed, her voice regal with the inflections of southern Bitemarsh, distinguishable even past the deepness given to it by her girth. Said weight had affected her speaking in other ways as well, the bovine constantly pausing to take heavy breaths before continuing, \u201cTell me why it is you have come to my home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus shook his head as if snapping free from a trance, still taken aback by the appearance of the cow woman. She waited for him to compose himself, taking a bite of the turkey she held as he spoke, \u201cWell Mistress, you see we have come searching for-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA handout?\u201d She bellowed while grinding the food between her teeth, \u201cYou two look like the hungry type, I didn\u2019t even know there could be anyone so skinny left in Silverhorne\u2026 But if you came here looking for scraps, go bother somebody else. I\u2019m a very busy woman and I don\u2019t have time for dealing with the rabble anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi stepped forward, \u201cMadame Berrywater, the thing is we aren\u2019t from this town at all. I am Uturi and this is Remus,\u201d She explained as she motioned towards the canine, \u201cWe are from The Exploration Guild, and we came here looking for someone; we have heard you were looking for somebody as well\u2026 And we want to help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean Sally\u2026?\u201d The woman gasped softly, her expression almost immediately changing from one of indifference to that of pain and grief, \u201cServants\u2026 help me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTwo maids appeared from behind the Mistress, one of them the ocelot from before and the other an even fatter human woman, so plump that her pale belly could be seen sticking out from between her top and skirt. They each grabbed one of the Mistress\u2019s blubbery arms as she carefully walked down the stairs, the wood trembling beneath each slow step she took. Remus and Uturi watched the trio descend, the cow and her servants already starting to pant heavily from their own exertions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHold on now!\u201d Remus exclaimed as he held his hand in the air, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, we can meet you upstairs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease Sir Remus, I know my physical state\u2026\u201d She grunted between gasps, \u201cAnd I will not let it limit me, not yet. I am still a lady regardless of my size, and I will greet my guests as they should be greeted\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus wanted to object further, and Uturi did not look too comfortable either, but they remained quiet as the Mistress descended the rest of the way with the maids aiding her, her exposed and gargantuan gut swaying and bouncing with each stair. Finally she made it to the bottom, wheezing heavily while her lighter servants caught their breath as well, though still held onto her to make sure she did not keel over. Now that she was closer, the deer girl couldn\u2019t help but notice the bovine\u2019s strong scent, her repugnant odor mostly a mix of perfume and sweat; an example of the clash between elegance and girth just like her outfit. She looked at the two, speaking even as she still struggled to regain her energy, \u201cTell me what you came here for\u2026 who is it you need to find?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s our Guildmaster. She went missing around these parts,\u201d Uturi answered, \u201cWe\u2019re not sure why but Remus was told she may have been searching for a missing girl\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRemus nodded, \u201cThe Guildmaster\u2019s name is Vianna Monroe, a vixen not much older than I, or so I hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, yes\u2026 Vianna\u2026\u201d Lady Berrywater sighed. She waved her free hand to signal the maids, and they let go of her arms, the Mistress shoving the turkey leg into the paws of the ocelot servant, \u201cShe was indeed here, but that was over a week ago\u2026 She said she was here in search of a nearby castle, and when I told her how that was the place we thought Sally disappeared to she promised she would bring her back to us. I should have known she wasn\u2019t coming back by now, but she was the first person we sent looking in so long\u2026\u201d She trailed off, absentmindedly wiping the juices from the turkey onto her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUturi watched as the hefty woman waddled over to the portrait hanging on the wall, her rear wobbling visibly even beneath her flowing gown, the long fabric trailing on the floor. Looking down at it, Uturi noticed small cracks webbing their way over the stone tiles each time the Mistress\u2019s hooves met them, realizing that much of the floor showed slight disrepair just from her strolls. The deer followed behind the obese woman though, taking note of how the thin cow girl shared her hair and some of her fur color, \u201cSo that <i>is</i> Sally then?\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe cow nodded, or at least tried to despite the chins in her way, \u201cYes\u2026 my daughter\u2026 She left us on her own you see, almost three years ago now, moved out to a nearby farm.  She didn\u2019t like how protective her father and I were\u2026 But we still kept an eye on her, making sure she was safe in her new life\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cDaughter?\u201d Asked Remus, \u201cI had thought her a ward of yours, you look much too young to be her mother.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nThe bovine let out a short, throaty chuckle as her plump lips curled into a slight smile, \u201cYou flatter me Sir Remus\u2026 But come, I need to check on my husband,\u201d She paused as she looked back up the stairs, the servant girls suddenly looking paler than usual, \u201cMaybe you two could meet me up there\u2026 I might be a while. In the meantime, please feel free to look around\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Mistress\u2026\u201d Uturi said, bowing before her.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nRemus smiled and bowed as well, \u201cWe are grateful for your hospitality fair Lady, and look forward to conversing further.\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cAs do I,\u201d Lady Berrywater said before turning to face the stairs, grabbing the turkey leg again to allow both servants to assist her in the harrowing ascent.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nUturi and Remus looked around the foyer, trying to figure out what to do in the meantime\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first it was more of a distraction while they waited to speak with the Mistress again, but as they were walking down a musty side-corridor, Remus suggested they should look about for any trace of Vianna as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot a bad idea\u2026\u201d Uturi said, gagging as she accidentally ran into a cobweb and frantically tried brushing it off, \u201cEch! Though I doubt we\u2019d find anything here, especially not in this part of the house\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProbably not\u2026 It looks like nobody\u2019s been here for a long while,\u201d Remus agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe entire hallway was covered in thin dust, even on the floor, and it seemed as though cobwebs clung to every other surface. The dim lighting from only a few candles and the fact that the doors were boarded up and still looked to be their original size also suggested this particular hall\u2019s disuse, at least by anyone but the thinner servants of the house, \u201cLady Berrywater must have sealed this wing off when she grew too big for it\u2026 maybe these rooms weren\u2019t important enough to her for remodeling\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems you think that the Lady\u2019s weight gain was a recent development\u2026 could she not have been large her whole life\u2026?\u201d Remus questioned the deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stopped to look around the hallway, shaking her head, \u201cNo\u2026 No she couldn\u2019t have been\u2026\u201d She replied, placing a paw upon one of the sealed doorways and wiping the dust from it, \u201cOtherwise she wouldn\u2019t have fit through these!

Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm, the doe had to admit it was a pretty nice area, if a bit simple. The floor was a stone tile similar to that of the foyer, though quite a bit more roughly chiseled so that it looked more natural, working well with the understated look of the plaster walls. What immediately caught Uturi\u2019s eye however wasn\u2019t the stonework, but the enormous brass bathtub that sat in the middle of the room, not large enough to make the place feel cramped, but still big enough to fit four or five people comfortably and, much like many things she was seeing today, larger than anything else of its type she had seen, \u201cOkay, I guess that\u2019s something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cQuite so,\u201d Remus said as he removed a gauntlet to rub his paw to the gleaming surface of the tub, \u201cLooks and feels almost brand new\u2026\u201d He muttered, his fingers squeaking against the polished metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUturi\u2019s ear twitched as she considered what Remus said, \u201cAnd yet still looks too small for Lady Berrywater to fit in comfortably\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe hyena boy chuckled before gently punching the ranger\u2019s shoulder with his still-armored paw, \u201cNow you\u2019re getting it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe deer girl meeped at the playful blow, rubbing where it hit before continuing, \u201cBut that just doesn\u2019t make sense!

No, this tub is suggesting that she\u2019s managed to gain hundreds of pounds in the span of, at most, <i>months</i>!

The maid stopped at the end of the short hall and stood in front of another fairly wide door before turning to face the two guests, \u201cThe Mistress and the Master are ready to meet you, but please be polite\u2026 They haven\u2019t exactly fared well after young Sally went missing, and it\u2019s hit the Master\u2019s health espec-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Miss,\u201d Remus said, pushing the feline aside and causing her to let out a squeak as he made his way into the room, \u201cWe may be adventurers, but we\u2019re not tactless dolts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ocelot girl whimpered and mewled meekly to herself as Uturi followed Remus in, \u201cI think he means we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d She grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bedroom they found themselves in seemed to match the rest of the manor\u2019s d\u00e9cor: elegant yet at the same time not too outlandish, unless of course you considered the bed itself, built large and sturdy, modified like so many other parts of the house to fit the owners\u2019 growing size. It wasn\u2019t the bed that caught their attentions though, but rather its occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi almost fainted at the sight of the house\u2019s Master, the male so massively obese that it was nearly heart-wrenching. His belly sagged and spread out before him as he leaned back against a mountain of pillows, the bloated paunch clearly immense even though it was partially covered by silky white bedsheets. Atop this rested two plump moobs that sagged to each side of his gut somewhat, rising and falling in tandem with each slow and heaving breath. His arms were likewise enveloped in thick layers of blubber, one reaching towards a plateful of chocolate cake that laid upon his the light brown fur of his apron-like stomach, the other resting atop his flabby chest. The morbidly obese bull was grabbing a large chunk straight from the cake as the two walked in, squishing it between clumsy fat fingers. Wasting little time, he shoved the mess past his lips, smearing and dropping rich frosting and heavy crumbs over them and down his many chins as he amazingly continued to feed himself even now. A shiver crawled up Uturi\u2019s spine as she realized that the male cow was nearly twice as large as his already horrendously corpulent wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mistress of the house herself was present as well, and sat next to the bed. Her tremendous bulk was supported by two large chairs, but even then her rump fat spilled over the edges a fair amount, though still given decency by what was left of her gown. She too was eating, though from a bowl of cherry sweet tarts, her etiquette little better than her mate\u2019s as she chewed and slurped noisily. She stopped abruptly as Uturi and Remus entered the room, a blush spreading over her tubby cheeks as she caught their shocked gazes, and she hastily attempted to swallow the fair amount of sweets still crammed in her mouth. Once she did she cleared her throat and grabbed her husband\u2019s paw in hers, giving it a firm, but gentle squeeze. The Ocelot servant had followed Remus and Uturi into the room, seating herself in a chair on the other side of the Master before beginning to soak a cloth in a bowl of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull ceased stuffing his pudgy face immediately, grunting and licking the frosting from his lips as he huffed and wheezed, struggling to speak, \u201cPlease\u2026 fuuuhh... Forgive\u2026 urf\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Berrywater silenced her spouse with a gentle shush before addressing her guests, \u201cHe asks you forgive him\u2026 and I ask the same of me, for our current\u2026 predicaments. Our bodies\u2026 our situation may seem obscene, maybe even repugnant\u2026 But I have to assure you, it is of no fault of our own we are this way\u2026 It may be hard to believe, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Remus interjected, stepping further into the room, his nose twitching at the smell of sweat and musk, \u201cYou were not always fat-\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi ribbed him in the side with her elbow as she walked up next to him, though she herself struggled not to offend their hosts as the cows\u2019 stench overwhelmed her senses and made her woozy, \u201cWhat my partner here meant was we realize your state has been caused by\u2026 unnatural forces, and it is possible that the source of your woes may be affecting the townsfolk as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mistress sighed and nodded solemnly, \u201cYes, but how could you two have known? Did you not say you had just arrived?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody outgrows a gown like yours, or a tub like the one downstairs so quickly through normal means\u2026\u201d Remus said, pausing for a moment, \u201cWith all due respect Madame\u2026 And then there\u2019s the fact you haven\u2019t decided to replace either\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Berrywater frowned and nodded again, her chins pressing together before she spoke, \u201cYes, because\u2026 well we figured it wouldn\u2019t do any good frankly. We\u2019d just as likely outgrow them not long after spending the gold\u2026\u201d The bovine said, her eyes looking away from the doe and the hyena to avoid their own before grabbing another handful of tarts and shoving them into her mouth. Her husband had likewise gone back to eating his cake almost right after he had addressed the two, seemingly having forgotten their presence entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi was appalled at what she was seeing, unable to believe the two could keep stuffing their faces so fervently like this in front of them, especially after what the Mistress had said literally moments before. The ranger knew it was horribly rude for someone of her station to question one of such noble birth, but her concern for the well-being of the Mistress and her lover had started to make her reconsider staying her tongue.</span></div></div>",

It could <i>kill</i> you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Berrywater looked up from her snack, tears coming to her eyes as they met Uturi\u2019s. The pain of the bovine\u2019s expression was enough to make the ranger cringe, a surge of shame speeding through her now, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d The cow said, sniffling as she wiped the tears from her eyes with a big, meaty arm, \u201cWe would stop if we could, but\u2026 the food is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoison\u2026 hurrgh\u2026\u201d the bull grunted, gazing up at his wife with a brief look of concern before he continued his sloppy gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d The Mistress continued, \u201cPoisoned\u2026 The food began coming around the same time things began changing in Little Silverhorne, about half a year ago\u2026 delivered to our doorstep, packages and baskets,\u201d She began to sniffle even more now, \u201cThings addressed from our friends, we figured it was them trying to console us after our daughter had been missing for so long\u2026  by the time we had found out the truth, it was too late\u2026 we became\u2026 addicted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why would your friends do such a thing?\u201d Remus pondered, scratching his chin, \u201cThere seems to be a sort of corruption affecting the town as a whole, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noble shook her head, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it was them, but rather the new ruler of the town and its holdings, a man who came to power around the same time we received the food\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you said this was around the same time things changed in the town?\u201d Uturi said, \u201cWho is this man? What is his name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither bovine said anything for a moment, the bull once more pausing momentarily from his meal to exchange a glance with his mate before she finally spoke, \u201cWe\u2026 don\u2019t know. All of the villagers here have only ever called him one thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019Lord L\u2019\u2026\u201d The bull gasped as he lapped and suckled the frosting from his plump fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange\u2026\u201d Remus said, tapping his chin with his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery much so,\u201d Agreed Uturi as her ears twitched, her eyes wandering down to the ground in thought, \u201cSo this Lord L is the mayor of this town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly\u2026\u201d the cow woman frowned, shifting in her seats and sending a creaking groan through the room, \u201cHe didn\u2019t come to power through any official means, the mayor simply stepped aside once he took power\u2026 but everyone else here doesn\u2019t seem to care. It\u2019s one thing for someone to come along promising safety, wealth, bounty, but when a person actually delivers on those promises people seem more than willing to look the other way\u2026 We aren\u2019t even sure if word about it has reached the Capital yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 but how is that even possible?\u201d Uturi sputtered, \u201cSomebody takes over a chunk of Bitemarsh, a whole town, and the Ruling Council doesn\u2019t even know about it for months? It\u2019s practically secession! Rebellion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus continued to think on the matter before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s simple really: The Council doesn\u2019t know because nobody wants to tell them. It was hard enough for me to get any information out of the locals, let alone a scrap on this Lord L, so obviously they don\u2019t trust outsiders, possibly to avoid confrontation with the Capital. A nobleman appears from nowhere and declares himself absolute ruler\u2026 it sounds impossible for it to escape notice, but when he comes with assurances of prosperity, a way of life beyond The Council\u2019s grip, and more than enough food to keep even the poorest of peasants not only satisfied but full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho in their right mind would want to throw an opportunity like that away?\u201d Lady Berrywater sighed, letting out a hollow laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you did!\u201d Uturi said, frowning at the implications, \u201cDidn\u2019t you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noblewoman nodded, \u201cYes\u2026 Somewhat\u2026 our investigations into our daughter led us to think she\u2019d been taken to the same castle this Lord L now resides in. We didn\u2019t trust him before, but now with this food\u2026 we\u2019re trapped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrapped?\u201d Remus said, quirking his brow, \u201cHow do you mean? Blackmail?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi gasped, \u201cHe isn\u2019t threatening your daughter, is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe would never admit he even knows where she is\u2026\u201d Lady Berrywater sighed as she nibbled on another tart, \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t dare to incriminate himself like that, for the same reason he hasn\u2019t had us outright killed. We may not be what we used to be, but our family still has roots in this town. If we were to disappear without cause or reason, or if word were to leak out that he was threatening us, he would risk losing support, I\u2019m sure! Instead what he\u2019s doing is even worse in some ways... After we became addicted to the food sent to us, it began to come in larger quantities and with more frequency. Eventually he didn\u2019t even bother hiding it anymore, we knew without any doubt the crates of food were coming directly from his castle\u2026 At first\u2026\u201d She sniffled, tears once more beginning to well in her eyes, \u201cWhen we realized, we tried to just not eat it\u2026 to get rid of the food and ignore the hunger pains\u2026 But there was just so much of it, and the smell\u2026.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Berrywater\u2019s husband looked up at his wife, his plump paw squeezing hers gently as he huffed, \u201cIt\u2019s alright\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not dear\u2026\u201d She said, squeezing his paw back as tears rolled over her soft, doughy cheeks, \u201cIt isn\u2019t\u2026 Lord L wants us to stop looking, so he\u2019s killing us\u2026 Nobody in this town will notice if we eat ourselves to death\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the gods\u2026\u201d Uturi whispered, starting to feel more than a little sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that either\u2026\u201d Madame Berrywater continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve grown dependent upon him, not just for the food but other things as well\u2026 The clothing, the furniture, even the bath tub you saw. He\u2019s somehow able to create all of these things and trade them to the residents\u2026 for gold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t care to be indebted to this Lord L?\u201d Said Remus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could answer, Sir Berrywater stopped eating, letting out a grunt of discomfort before grabbing for his chest. The Mistress gasped as she saw this, but her husband merely waved his free paw at her dismissively as the Ocelot girl placed the soaked rag on his brow, \u201cJust indigestion\u2026 mmff\u2026 dear\u2026 nothing to worry\u2026 hnnngh\u2026 \u2018bout\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadame Berrywater let out a worried sigh, waiting for her husband\u2019s discomfort to pass before she finally answered Remus\u2019s query, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we are afraid of losing it all, Sir Remus, when your child is gone... material things start to lose their value\u2026 it\u2019s just that the last thing we would want is for our money to end up in this Lord L\u2019s coffers, being used towards whatever disgusting plans he has in store for our town\u2026 and maybe for those who\u2019ve gone missing like our Sally\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi could only stand there for a moment, digesting what the Mistress and, to a limited extent, her husband had told the two. She considered the missing girl, wondering what they could do for her. At the same time though she knew that she and Remus were already in way over their heads, and she had a feeling that their mission here in Little Silverhorne had only just begun. If she told the Berrywaters that they would help them, they might not be able to keep that promise.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find out something. I am sure Madame Berrywater would be just as happy to know her daughter is still alive, so if we can discover even that it will be worth it.\u201d She said to the maid in an attempt to set her mind to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the bottom of the staircase, the maid escorted them from the mansion and out onto the street.

Even if they couldn't get a meal or a room, they might find another lead via local gossip. They made their way towards the well-lit building, the successfulness of the business obvious by it's size and well-maintained woodwork. The sound of laughter and the smell of spit-roasts floated on the air, drawing people towards it. Little Silverthorne seemed to have benefited from this, as the entire area of the town that surrounded the tavern seemed to be better-off than the outer areas of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus reluctantly opened the door, and entered in front of Uturi. He took a seat nearby, close enough that if a speedy escape was needed, there wasn't too much of a distance to make. Uturi took the seat opposite him, taking off her bow and setting it neatly against her stool. She noticed the Hyena still kept his sword and shield equipped. \"Still suspicious, hmm?\" She asked. \"Nobody seems to have made a fuss about us returning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... it's strange.\" He replied, his voice a low whisper. \"If they offer us anything for free, don't take it. We don't know what they're planning, if anything.\" They hyena warned, before placing his elbows on the table and scratching his forehead a little bit. The deer responded with a huff. Surely they couldn't be that bad, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the elf from earlier on in the day made her way over to them, a large tray held in her arms. The tray was adorned with a massive display of food and drink, from boiled vegetables, roasted meat and thick cream, to sugary desserts and sweet, foam covered beer. \"Ah, welcome back.\" She said in greeting, placing the tray down on the table. Uturi's eyes were wide, while Remus kept himself from looking. \"I apologize for earlier... especially to your friend over there.\" She nodded at Remus. \"I think I almost broke something when I sat on him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ranger let out a laugh, while the soldier let out a grunt. \"Oh, don't mind him too much. He seems to be suspicious of everything.\" She responded to the waitress, who also laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as an official apology from myself and the rest of the staff, we've prepared this complementary apology dinner, just for you two.\" She said with a wink, like she'd spent years practicing and reciting that phrase over and over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how can you afford to give away such a massive amount of food!?\" Uturi spluttered, completely dumbfounded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress winked again. \"It's a bit of a trade secret, I'm afraid.\" Uturi looked at Remus, who was also slightly taken aback by the amount of food at the table before them. \"Well, I'll leave you two to it.\" She told them, before turning away. Remus finally looked at her, eyes seemingly drawn to the elf's wobbling derriere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was for only a second, and he pulled his gaze back to the food. \"Don't eat anything.\" He mumbled... followed by the sound of a grumbling stomach. He hadn't eaten for a while, and the food was making him hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi couldn't decide whether to heed his advice, or to dig in... she didn't want to waste the food, nor did she want to upset the waitress. But Remus was looking rather grumpy, and she couldn't tell what he'd do if she ate.  </span></div></div>",

It was packed full of vegetables and meat and adorned with a thick layer of meaty gravy, giving off an aroma that the deer girl could not resist. She grabbed a mug of beer, and set it down in front of her. It was all too much for her senses; there was so much food for just the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus grabbed the wrist of his partner, and stared into her eyes. \"I told you; Don't. Eat. Anything.\" He growled, annoyed at the fact that he had to repeat himself. As she tried to pull her paws away, he glared at her even harder. <i>If looks could kill</i>, Uturi thought. \"Fine. If you end up regretting this, don't come crying to me.\" He told her, letting go. \"Godsdamn it.\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned her attention back to the food, feeling slightly odd. She ignored the feeling though; it was probably hunger. She grasped a knife and fork and began cutting into a chunk of smoked-steak, juices pouring out of it as she did so. Once she had cut a piece, she lifted it to her mouth and took a bite. There was a moment of silence, as the two wondered if anything was about to happen. \"It's...\" She began, mumbling as she chewed. \"...wonderful!\" She told him, as her mind began to be blinded by taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus looked at her for a moment. \"You don't feel sick? Does it taste strange?\" He queried. He really wanted to know if it was safe to eat. His stomach was threatening to eat itself if he didn't get something inside it. <i>Should've eaten before I got here, stupid idiot.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another silence, before the ranger answered. \"It's perfectly fine... in fact, it tastes better than any other steak I've ever had!\" She soon began to take larger and larger of pieces of steak and shoving them into her mouth. \"You should really try it, you'll be surprised.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus watched her, and his stomach was growling louder now. But he couldn't afford to let anything poisonous (or magical) into his system, and compromise the mission as a result. \"I'll pass.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi shrugged and began to eat even faster, shoving food down her gullet like a mad-woman. It didn't take long for it to begin building up in her stomach, as she ate more and more. Her flat stomach began to push outwards just a little bit, a small bump on an otherwise well-built physique. But that bump became rounder and larger, causing her a little discomfort as her armour was now pushing tightly against her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus was staring now. He couldn't believe that the lithe ranger was now stuffing herself with food. But at the same time, he couldn't keep his eyes off the food. He was getting turned around in his head, conflicted by his feelings. Would he be betrayed by his stomach, or keep himself under control and refuse to eat? </span></div></div>",

He looked at the other side of the table to witness his partner still gorging on the food. Uturi's leather armor strained even more as her belly continued to expand, getting rounder and tighter as she crammed more food down her gullet. Remus shifted uncomfortably in his chair while watching the sight. \"Uturi, you should probably stop eating\", he said, concerned for his partner. She crammed the remains of a steak in her mouth, and answered back, \"Why? The food here is excellent! Anyways, I'm still hungry.\" \"How are you still hungry!?\", he growled silently but furiously, looking at her protruding gut, \"You've been non-stop stuffing yourself for who knows how long and you can stil manage to say you're hungry? Look at yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi looked down and gasped, only to see her armor straining against her gut, \"But how...\" \"I told you there was something wrong with the food here.

She looked at Uturi, and at the worst moment, the stuffed deer's stomach growled, and her face quickly reddened as she tried to look away from the elf's stare as she grinned. \"Your friend over here sounds like she still hasn't gotten her fill...\", she responded, patting the stuffed belly of Uturi, making her face redden more, \"I think she should choose whether she's eaten enough or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus growled at the elf but said nothing, not wanting another incedent to happen similar to last time, but continued to glare, occasionally looking at other large features on her that weren't her face. Now Uturi was stuck under the pressure of either infuriating Remus or the elf, again, and if the elf didn't like her answer, she might go out of her way to cram the food into her mouth herself. She could already feel the magical food taking affect, as her once flat chest grew into two very small lumps, and her pants seemed a little tighter than usual. Most of the fat seemed to go to her butt, as it splayed out a little more on the large chair, and her thighs followed as the second biggest gain on her body. Although she felt more womanly in this figure, she knew that she'd regret getting any bigger. In the end, she looked back up and said... </span></div></div>",

At that Uturi decided they were going to leave, something was obviously off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as the doe girl opened her mouth to decline the food her belly rumbled again and without even meaning to she said, \u201c\u2026have some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf\u2019s smile turned into a grin as she placed the next huge round of food onto the table and Remus growled angrily as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the food now in front of her the last of Uturi\u2019s resolve disappeared and she went straight back to shovelling food into her elongated mouth. As she tasted the delicious enchanted food Uturi\u2019s mind glazed over and she could only focus on stuffing more food into her already strained stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like your friend is still hungry.\u201d The elf taunted Remus as Uturi continued to gorge on food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus snarled at the elf girl and stood up from his chair and stretched to his full height, his plate covered body an imposing sight before the plump elf. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here but I\u2019m going to find out and stop whatever scheme you have going.\u201d With that threat the hyena turned and stormed out of the inn, not even glancing at his bewitched companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elf stood and watched Remus leave with a smile, she wasn\u2019t worried about forcing him to stay, if he went to find the lipomancer he wouldn\u2019t be a problem for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and looked back at Uturi. The young Doe girl was still sitting at the table stuffing her face, not having noticed her companion\u2019s departure. She was still quite thin, the lipomancer\u2019s enchanted food not having had time to take full effect, although the foods enchantment to cause incredible hunger was obviously in full effect as evidenced by the way her belly looked pregnant, forcing her tight leather armour to pull apart at the seams as the young deer girl shovelled more food into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi just kept eating and eating for hours, shovelling the enchanted tavern food into her mouth as fast as she could swallow it in an effort to sate her unending hunger, only stopping to take huge swigs of foamy beer to quench her thirst. The thin deer girl\u2019s already stuffed belly was quickly swelling up with even more food as her gorging continued unabated. Her once form fitting leather armour was now bulging out as her stuffed belly struggled to find room for her humongous meal, until finally her armour could make no more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Uturi chugged a flagon of beer after finishing her fifth platter of food her armour finally gave way. With a loud rip that caused everyone in the tavern to turn to look, the seams along the left side of the stuffed deer girl\u2019s stomach gave way and her huge brown furred belly surged out into the warm tavern air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi finished her flagon of beer, let out a huge belch and dropped the now empty stein onto the floor to a cacophony of cheers from the entire tavern. Drunk and stuffed beyond any normal means, Uturi let her arms drop to her belly and she let out a moan as she started to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump elf waitress from before walked over to Uturi;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s quite an appetite you\u2019ve got there.\u201d She said with obviously insincere awe, \u201cIt looks like you could use a nap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, no, URP, must find\u2026.\u201d Uturi moaned before trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry about your friend, he knows where you are I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come back for you when he\u2019s done.\u201d The elf said quickly, \u201cCome on let\u2019s get you upstairs to a bed so you can sleep of this meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrp, okay.\u201d Uturi said slowly, the thought of slipping into a food coma on a soft bed too enticing to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf helped lift up Uturi and then practically carried her up the stairs as the deer girl used both her arms to cradle her belly. The elf carried Uturi into a bedroom with an almost unnatural strength and moved her towards the sole bed in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi let out a loud sigh as the elf eased her down onto a soft bed. She collapsed onto the bed and quickly sunk deep into the soft mattress, the tattered remains of her leather breastplate still clinging to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi simply lay there as still as possible, breathing loudly and groaning softly. The elf grinned and gave Uturi\u2019s bloated fur covered belly a quick rub and turned to leave;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright dear, you rest up, feel free to come down for breakfast when you wake up.\u201d The elf said with a short giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elf left the room, closing the door behind her, Uturi passed out on the bed, the gurgling of her belly and heaving of her lungs the only sensations that mattered to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though it wasn't exactly rented was it? Uturi could barely even recall coming up here and falling asleep, and she certainly didn't remember paying for a room at any inn. Just as her eyes adjusted to the light, so too did her mind adjust to her memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inn from before, where she had first met Remus, the one with the elven waitress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had they even come back here in the first place? Where had Remus gone and how could he abandon his companion so easily? And why had she ever dared to eat even a morsel of that accursed food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe girl sat up, using far more effort than she had ever used for such a simple action. She could feel soft flab on her arms pressing together, her now gravid belly bouncing freely from her torn armor, her once muscular thighs now flabby, not just touching but rubbing together as she swung her legs off over the side of the bed. How could this possibly have been from just a single meal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting sharply as she hefted her body to her feet, she took a deep breath, steadying herself, before she opened the door and walked down the hall. Not only was she exhausted from her newly plumpened form, but the deer's head was pounding as well, likely hung over from the huge amount of booze she'd consumed last night. By the time the doe had made it down the stairs into the tavern section of the inn, she was already panting and sweating, bending down with greater difficulty than she ever had to place her paws on her knees to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they do to me?\" She thought to herself, \"I need to find Remus, where's Remus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the ranger was turning for the door, the scent of delicious food filled her nostrils as a waitress walked by carrying a tray of sizzling bacon. The girl's mouth began to water, her stomach gurgled, and her headache and nausea started to clear immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was asking the wrong questions, she had realized. What she should have been asking was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear!\" The elf from last night replied, grinning sweetly before lowering a colossal platter piled with eggs, bacon, potatoes and soft, fluffy biscuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi's eyes widened as she glanced around, finding herself seated in the same seat as last night. This wasn't right! She was just about to leave, about to find help, about to... to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in!\" The waitress said beaming, slamming another mug of beer onto the table, \"And don't worry, I've brought you plenty to wash it all down with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\" Uturi moaned, mouth watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no worries, a little booze this early never hurt anyone! Now eat up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she had even finished speaking, Uturi was already shoveling the hot, greasy food into her drooling mouth. She didn't bother to use any silverware, didn't even check to see if there WAS any. Her paws grabbed desperately for as much sustenance as she could fit in them, brought it to her mouth, paused once in a while to wipe the grease from her maw or wash it down with a chug of beer, before doing it all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, the elf girl continued to bring her more and more plates of food. Uturi continued to eat fatty strips of bacon, gigantic eggs, gravy soaked mashed potatoes, tender and juicy mutton... shepherd's pie stuffed with meat and cheese... rich, sweet cake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi's mind whirled as her hunger came to a screeching halt, crashing like a runaway carriage as it hit a wall of agonizing stomach pain. Cake? Mutton? These didn't seem like breakfast foods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ranger looked around the room and saw, for the first time that all of the tables were empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll except hers. Night had already fallen in what seemed like the blink of an eye, and it was just her and the elven waitress, who leered down at the seated and overstuffed deer with that smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done for the day, hmm big girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrggh... soooo... hic!\" Uturi grunt, stifling a belch with one paw, cradling the tender balloon of a belly that now pressed heavily against her table, \"Too much... food... please, I need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have some rest...\" The waitress finished assuringly, wasting no time in grabbing the deer's flabby arm and lifting her to her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Need to... need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deergirl groaned groggily as she found herself plopped into the soft, fluffy bed, sinking deeper into the mattress, deeper into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...to eat!\" The waitress chimed cheerfully, slamming a plate full of ham, flapjacks, and sausages onto Uturi's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whuh...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said 'I hope you're hungry, because there's plenty to eat!'\" The waitress repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi groaned, holding her head in her paws, rubbing her temples as they pounded. What was going on? Wasn't she just sleeping? Wasn't she trying to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate was steaming, sizzling, its noxiously appetizing scent drifting in seductive and enticing curls as it assaulted Uturi's nose. Her head cleared. Her nostrils flared. Her mouth watered. She was trying to eat. Trying to eat as the waitress came by again and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" The doe moaned past a mouthful of roast beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another cup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Uturi gasped, belching as she swallowed two pawfuls of sweet tarts, \"More, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room for another plate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ranger only nodded up at the waitress, chewing down the sausage and toast in her mouth, grunting an affirmative, \"Mmmnnff...\" Before taking a huge swig of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was whirling like a maelstrom for Uturi, slipping away like sand through her fingers, a quickening march. The only constants: Her soft and warm bed, the cocky but familiar voice of the elf barmaid, the rich and delicious food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pawtips pressed against her temple as she groaned and panted, Uturi shaking her head, trying to clear it of this fugue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to stop... she needed to... to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything was so familiar... like her thoughts were going through a routine both comfortable and somehow... wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and whining with exertion and discomfort, the titanic doe shoved her fat ass off the bed and onto her hooves. The frame creaked loudly and even cracked a little as she did so, the sweat-soaked sheets clinging to her mammoth and nearly bare asscheeks before they slumped onto the floor behind her. The girl grunted thickly as gravity and momentum began to tug her girthy body forwards even further, nearly toppling the ranger, Uturi just barely able to maintain her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling for the door, Uturi attempted briefly to cram her body through. This ended quickly enough when she realized that she was so wide both her hips extended past the door frame, so she opted to shove herself through sideways instead, just barely managing to squeeze her ass and gut through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the doe had reached the stairs at the end of the hallway she was already tired, panting and wheezing. Pausing to catch her breath for a few minutes, the doe gathered her strength and carefully maneuvered her bulk down the stairs step by step. Not only was her head pounding, but her heart as well, a slight pain welling up in the tubby deergirl's gut, forcing her to pause halfway down to catch her breath before resuming her descent. By the time she had reached the bottom, the pain had only worsened, the morbidly obese woman huffing deeply, her fur drenched in pungent sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi had to pause again, her paw pressing against a nearby wall as she leaned her hefty body against it. She stood there for a while, her breaths slowly becoming less ragged, but the pain in her belly not going away, increasing more and more until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe leaned forwards, bending over slightly before letting loose a thunderous bout of flatulence. She groaned out loud with relief as her short fluffy tail fluttered, moaning as the pain subsided, reflexively ignoring the patrons and tavern staff as they glanced and cringed and snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething within her mind knew she should be ashamed of herself; not just the gas but the weight she had put on, the way she came down here to stuff herself everyday, and most of all the fact that she had long ago outgrown her armor. For a long while now Uturi had been eating and sleeping at the tavern nearly in the nude, scraps of her leather armor still clinging to her, pinched between the deep, rolling folds of her obese body. The only things keeping her decent were her cloth undergarments, stretched and strained, her top barely covering her plump nipples now, her bottom all but invisible beneath her surging belly flab, lost between her elephantine buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Uturi knew all of this, knew that she had to be pushing about 500 pounds now, if not long past that milestone as well, but somehow it just didn't register. It all just felt so clouded, so foggy... Was it another effect of that addictive, delicious food, or just her mind's way of dealing with this whole situation? It was impossible for her to tell in this state...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe girl looked down at her body for a moment, feeling more lucid than she had been for a while... Her breasts were the first thing she saw, heavy and drooping but still a bit perky as they sat on a stomach that bulged, then folded at her deep navel before sagging over her lap. Rolls of fat hung over her sides and back, her arms meaty and coated with flabby lard, her thighs and hips so wide and blubbery... Uturi could barely look back to see her rump anymore, but she was sure her ass was just as huge as the rest of her now, she could feel it shift and bounce and jiggle with every lumbering step she took now. She looked back down now, lifting her paws, wiggling her sausage-like fingers before she pressed them to her layers of chins, her soft, doughy cheeks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" She panted to herself, looking about the tavern, \"This... this can't be right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her paw away from her head, shook it, then maneuvered her freakishly obese body through a clumsy turn. Her belly grumbled in protest as it was turned from food towards an exit, but she didn't care, not until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where do you think you are going, fatty girl..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ears of the doe twitched and so did her nose as she smelt the food, the scent so strong now, so close. She looked back against her better judgment, to the elven waitress over her plump should, to the platter she held in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right porky,\" She said, holding the huge plate of breakfast meats and other delights up towards the now captivated ranger, \"You're not going <i>anywhere</i>...\"</span></div></div>",

Now however, there were two sturdy seats, one for each cheek as Uturi plopped down onto them without hesitating, the chairs groaning and creaking already under her immense weight. The doe drooled as the elf set the platter down, stacked with pancakes, piled with potatoes, overflowing with sausage and bacon. She grabbed a boat filled with steaming hot gravy that was shoved onto the side of the plate. She poured it on everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf watched the entire time Uturi ate, digging her paws into the mess she had been served, cramming it all into her mouth as crumbs and grease and gravy spilled down her chins, fresh stains joining those that had dried on the fur of her breasts and belly. The woman finished her humongous meal quickly, grabbing for the mug of ale that always seemed to be there, chugging it to wash the food down before letting loose a heavy and satisfying belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your meal?\" The waitress said, nearly sneering at Uturi, \"I hope you weren't having second thoughts because you didn't like the cooking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi sat there a moment, holding her stomach, rubbing it before she looked up at the waitress, \"What... mnnf... what did you do to me? To this... this food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf laughed, shaking her head, \"You should have listened to your friend! Maybe then you would have caught on a lot sooner like he did... He was right though, we do have a little extra we put into the meals sometimes... for those we think could cause trouble in this town...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extra..? Extra what?\" Uturi grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just some spices shipped down from Lord L's castle... I'm sure you've heard of him by now, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer girl thought back to the Berryweathers, how the cows had told them of the food that had been sent to their very doorstep, how they couldn't stop eating. Uturi had become a victim of the very same trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is behind this then... The reason this town is... nnf... so fat...\" The doe groaned, leaning forwards and huffing loudly as she let loose another loud bout of gas against her seats. Some of the patrons around her covered their noses or moved their chairs further away, but none of them caused a fuss: In fact hardly anyone looked Uturi's way whenever she came down to eat here. For the first time though, Uturi noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, have some decency adventurer!\" The waitress laughed, \"I'm sure you are not used to showing any manners, but we aren't in a cave or tomb if we haven't noticed. Show some respect to those around you, you filthy pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't...\" She paused, the ranger gripping her full stomach as it gurgled, rubbing it, trying to sooth it, \"They don't care... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf smiled as she grabbed the deer's plate and empty mug, pulling out a rag once she stacked the two and wiping down her table, \"Now that is a good question isn't it? Not everyone's food is spiked you know... Some just are enjoying the prosperity, some enjoying that they can have a full belly instead of a starving one... and when a town like this is doing so well, why risk that success by asking questions like yours..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi groaned, \"That's... that's horrible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's true... Nobody here will help you ranger... in fact, those special spices I mentioned? I haven't used them in your food for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lying!\" The doe snapped, slamming her fat fists on the table, \"You... you have to be...\" The ranger knew she was... her will couldn't be that weak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress could only shake her head as she looked down her nose at the deer, \"Tell yourself whatever would make you feel better, fatty girl... But I think you have wanted to let yourself go... you have wanted to grow big and fat all along, and this is just your excuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl came past the doe's plump lips and she held her head in her paws, shaking it profusely, \"That's just... just so wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? You think we have been feeding you tainted food this whole time tubby? Forcing you to eat here for two whole years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two..?!\" Uturi sputtered, her eyes wide, heart beginning to pound frantically now, \"Two years?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat couldn't be right! She had to be fooling with her! Uturi may not have been thinking straight since she first ate here, but there was no way she'd been living at the tavern so long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi heaved her massive body up, clumsily but frantically as her hooves clopped against the stone floor. She reached for her dagger, her bow, but they were long gone. Her paws searched for silverware, but as always there was none. She glared at the waitress in front of her who stood firm, her free hand defiantly on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behave yourself, lardass...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong here?\" Another voice chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was female as well, somewhat familiar, until Uturi looked over and recognized another of the waitresses. A blond haired cow with tan fur, taller than the elf and much fatter, but built with so much muscle it seemed as though she carried her weight much more gracefully than Uturi could ever hope to hers. The bovine would be a difficult opponent for the ranger even if she weren't burdened by all this heavy, cumbersome fat, even if she weren't also carrying another two platters of wondrous, steaming breakfast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually...\" The elf grinned, looking over to her coworker, \"The doe here was just waiting for her second course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow smiled knowingly, setting both platters down onto Uturi's table, the aroma of rich, fattening food assaulting the cervine's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" The elf said as the cow nodded and moved out of the way, the doe ranger already grabbing pawfuls of meat and pancakes, wolfing down even as she whimpered helplessly, \"I think our guest will be joining us for lunch again today... and dinner too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" The cowgirl chuckled, taking the empty platter and mug from the elf before moving back through the crowded tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf moved behind Uturi, firmly gripping her fatty shoulders and pushing her down into the set of chairs to allow her to eat more comfortably, \"I'm sure you're wondering if today's meal used our special spice though, hmm deer?\" She grinned as she kneaded the feasting doe's shoulders, \"A week without it is a pretty long time... it could be useful, remind you why you love being our guest so very much, yes? Well I won't tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi groaned deeply, resisting the gnawing hunger in her overfed belly for a moment, her paws gripping the table's edge as her stomach gurgled and churned, \"If I don't break free... huff... nngh... Remus will find me... he'll come back and then we'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will what? Punish the evil bar wench?\" The elf laughed loftily as she pulled her hands from the doe's shoulders, \"Oh I do not think so... Besides, we already have your mongrel friend in our care! He's been with us for quite a while just like you... maybe you can meet him again one day! I think he has a thing for porky girls... the bigger the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress laughed again, giving the doe's thick, blubbery ass a hard slap, a loud smack carrying over the chatter of the other patrons as her mammoth cheek jiggled and rippled in the barmaid's groping hand, \"I'm sure he'll just love the sight of you... But don't eat too much now fatty girl!\" She snickered, letting go of the doe's fat ass, \"You see, as hard as you might make your man, none of it would matter if you are too fat for him to reach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barmaid chuckled as she walked away, leaving Uturi to resume her meal in peace. And resume she did, as much as she told herself she wouldn't, then told herself she would after one more plate, one more meal, one more day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that the elf was lying to her, that Remus would come... whether he'd fight through the tavern to rescue his partner of arrive in her room in the dead of night, they would escape this town together, they would be together. She just had to wait, and eat, and hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi was right about one thing: The elf had lied to her, but not about everything. What the ranger didn't know was that she would eventually see Remus again, and she would leave this awful tavern behind one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not the town of Little Silverhorne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep below the lair of The Lipomancer waited a cell for the poor doe, one that the girl would be brought to once she was big enough. There she would grow fatter, there she would slowly fill that cell, and there she would realize  a fact that she had hidden from herself but not the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the months and then years would pass, the immobile Uturi growing bigger every day as she eagerly sucked down the fattening slop fed to her by tube, the doe would realize one important thing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she needed was an excuse.</span></div></div>",

He also silently hoped she would snap out of it soon before she ended up as big as the townsfolk, or worse... bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching his new partner chow down however, his stomach was quick to make its protests known. He blushed and cast his gaze downwards to avoid the nonexistent stares and caught sight of the mouth-watering steak that took up three-fourths of the massive plate in front of him, drowning in the most aromatic gravy he'd ever encountered, surrounded by greens so fresh he swore they were just harvested. He watched as spill off juice from the steak oozed its way under the greens, making them even more tantalizing: He just wanted a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes shot upwards and then towards the wall. \u201cNo. I can't eat anything, it's clearly a trap and no good will come of it.\u201d His stomach loudly argued. \u201cI don't care what you say, I'm not letting you drag me into any trouble!\u201d Another argument was made. \u201cYes...Uturi does look fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe ranger was currently working on the first half of her steak, a second mug of ale and another serving of vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Uturi....still feeling alright?\" Remus asked. His question was met with the sound of chewing, gulping and the occasional pleasured moan, \"Uturi?\" He asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remus it tastes <i>great!</i> and if something bad were to happen, wouldn't it have already?\" Uturi replied while unconsciously loosening her pants. This went unnoticed by Remus, who was currently spending all his energy on not starting to pig out on the meal laid out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus looked down at his meal again. \u201cI'll just eat the vegetables, it's not like you can get fat off those anyways,\u201d He madly rationalized to himself as he picked up a sprig of asparagus and bit down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was soon washed down with a drink of ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Remus was cutting up pieces of the juiciest steak he had ever seen and practically shoving them down his throat. Soon the rest of the pub was a blur to Remus as all he was concentrated on was eating or drinking and sometimes both simultaneously. He felt as if he was never going to run out of food or drink as he ate more and more but yet every time he checked he still had more than half a steak. If he was paying attention he would know it was his third half, meaning he should have already been finished. But Remus wasn't noticing a lot of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike how Uturi was now nowhere to be seen but her bow and scraps of her clothing were around the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr how strangers had walked over and removed his armor leaving him in just his small clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how his small clothes were now a literal title as his stomach bulged outwards and he steadily grew wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this seemed to concern the hyena, his only concern was filling up his stomach which still felt completely starved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ate and ate until a sudden darkness over took him and he awoke in...</span></div></div>",

He pushed off the covers keeping him warm, then tried to do so for the second layer, but found that it wouldn't budge, and that he could feel more of it than he should. Blinking, the hyena pushed again, and as he fully awoke, realized that it wasn't a blanket, but his own flesh. Resting on swollen thighs lied a gut comparable to a medicine ball, thick, heavy and soft, with massive man boobs resting on top of that, all of which jiggled with the slightest movement. Even his arms were soft and plump, though thankfully all of his muscle was still there, so they at least still looked strong. And his face, even though he couldn't see it, touching it showed that it too was not spared, plump cheeks and a second (going on third) chin was proof enough of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flurry of thoughts and emotions flew through his head: What happened to him? Was he safe? What was going to happen to his career?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where was the Ranger!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could properly realize that he prioritized the last one the most by far, there was a knock on the door to his room, \"Come in,\" He said, surprised at the fact that his voice sounded a fair bit deeper than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf waitress walked in, a half apologetic look on her face and her hands raised slightly. Looking at Remus as he started to let out an angry growl, she spoke up, \"Look, I know you're angry about what we did, but we did it for a reason. You noticed how you were the skinniest guys in town? Well other people were noticing too, some of them wouldn't have your best interests in mind,\" Sighing as he simply frowned at her, she continued, \"We know that you're trying to... uh, be heroes and all that, but if we let someone else get to you first, it wouldn't just be your bodies that got changed, and it wouldn't have stopped at that size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus looked down, prodding his massive gut, which seemed to be gurgling quite contently now for some reason. Ignoring the pleasant sensations it caused, he looked back at the maid, \"So you're saying you fattened us up... to save us from being fattened up even more?\" He asked, scrunching his face up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it sounds kind of bad, but it's far better than the alternative,\" She admits, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Remus slowly nodded, \"Yeah, I guess. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, just make sure you do good by us and we'll do the same back,\" She replied, smirking, \"Oh! By the way, your friend Uturi is up here too. Having breakfast, I reckon. Don't worry, the food isn't going to fatten you up any more so you can eat in peace. Also, the name's Kaeda, just in case you were wondering.\" And with that, the elf walked back out of the room, swaying her hips slightly knowing that he would be looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away with a blush, the hyena sighed and made his way out of bed. Rolling over to the side, he swung his legs over and heaved himself up. He was thankful that whatever he ate last night didn't cause his muscles to atrophy or anything, because since he was struggling as is, he would have been far worse off otherwise, possibly bedridden without help. \"Possibly like, Uturi...\" he whispered, suddenly realizing that he was likely the much more well-off member of the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

Also it would be embarrassing if people saw him running around fat and nude. Remus searched the room for clothes. He spotted a vest and trousers folded up on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess these will have to do. I have to get dressed and check on Uturi. Hopefully she's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus puts on the vest and trousers. To his surprise the clothes were surprising roomy on his larger frame and yet they fit like a glove. Remus quickly exited the room and heads to the dining area of the pub. When he arrived he saw Uturi eating a hearty breakfast. He was relieved to know that Uturi was as bad off as he thought. At the very least she was possibly 150-200 lbs. heavier, but it appeared that he's might be fatter than she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Uturi, I glad that you're alright,\" Remus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi looked up from her meal and smiled. \"Morning Remus. I see that they fattened you up too. It's weird that they did that to us, but it was probably for the better. Grab a plate and dig in. We have to maintain our new sizes so we can go undercover,\" Uturi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus sat down and began digging into the food on the table. As he was doing so Kaeda brought out several plates filled to the brim with food ranging from ham and sliced potatoes to juicy steaks with biscuits and fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by go undercover, Uturi? Isn't our new heft enough that we can seamlessly blend in?\" Remus asked between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To blend in with the townsfolk, yes. To get into the Lipomancer's castle freely, no. I've heard a few people state that the Lipomancer rarely allows people to visit his castle. The only way in is to work for the Lipomancer or receive an invitation to one of his balls or feasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do that Uturi?\" Remus asked as he began working on his third plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Remus. Not many people seem willing to talk,\" Uturi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be an issue. Let's just finish our meal and then ask people about getting into the Lipomancer's castle without falling prey to his traps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus and Uturi continued to eat their food. As they were eating a large hulking figure slowly approached them. This person had overheard there conversation and decided to greet the new visitors to Little Silverhorne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, but you were talking about visiting the Lipomancer's castle, right?\" The figure asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus and Uturi perk up at the sound of the stranger's deep masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why do you ask?\" Uturi asked the massive orc standing by their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help you get in to the castle.

Our job here is already complicated enough and I don\u2019t need you making it worse\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it making it worse?!\u201d Uturi hissed at him, arms outspread, \u201cIf we\u2019re already looking for one person, what harm would there be searching for another in the same place! Think about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you think about it!\u201d Remus spat, \u201cFirst of all, we barely have direction! All we know is we need to head to some stupid castle and somehow find out where the guildmaster is! Not to mention we don\u2019t even know what we're dealing with here, considering owner of said castle has enough power to take over an entire village, and either kills those in his way or makes them disappear! That doesn\u2019t seem complicated enough for you? Because I'm sure as hell not getting paid enough for this kind of bullshit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi scoffed, shaking her head, \u201cAre you seriously telling me you don\u2019t care about these people? About what\u2019s happening to their town, or what could have happened to their daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do!\u201d Remus said, \u201cBut I also care about being realistic, about not making these poor people promises we <i>can't</i> keep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we could keep them if you took that stick out your ass and worried about something other than yourself,\u201d Uturi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA furious growl shook it\u2019s way from Remus\u2019s throat, before he pushed past Uturi and walked down the hall, \u201cI don\u2019t need some novice ranger judging me, I\u2019m going to get some godsdammned air\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all her resolve not to go after him, to hold back from chewing the hyena warrior out for running away yet again, but Uturi resisted. Knowing it would do no good, and that Remus was far too stubborn at this point to see reason, she merely groaned with pent-up frustration as she leaned against the nearby wall and held her head in her paws. Perhaps, had Remus maintained a cool head; perhaps, if Uturi had followed him down the hall, then the events soon to come might have played out differently.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t count on such a simple task backfiring though, grunting sharply as one of the dark strands became snagged between the plates of his gauntlet, \u201cDammit..!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena yanked it free, ripping the hair out in the process and grunting further as he thought to himself, <i>\u201dWhy does this have to be so damned difficult? Why is </i>she <i>trying to complicate things so much!\u201d</i> He sighed, tugging his gauntlet off and looking at his paw, closing it into a fist as he saw the scarred palm beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus\u2019s breath grew heavy as thoughts flooded his mind. His contemplation did not remain uninterrupted for long though, as the sound of clanging metal rang from down one of the nearby halls. Immediately he slipped his gauntlet back on, his ears standing at attention as he trotted out of the foyer, but instead of entering the same corridor as before, he entered the one at the opposite end of the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving further down the hallway, Remus realized the source of the noise was most likely the kitchen, the sound possibly some kind of utensil being disturbed. Though he didn\u2019t know his way around, he assumed it\u2019d be in the vicinity of the dining room, the hyena making his way into and through the large chamber and heading for a door that lay behind the dinner table, finding it ajar. Remus paused a moment, making sure to place his paw on his sword\u2019s hilt before opening the door with the other and stepping into the dark room beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flickering candlestick atop a counter at the other end of the room might have brought comfort in any other situation, but Remus only saw it as another sign of things gone awry. He carefully approached the weak light source, looking around the room carefully as he did so, knowing all too well how easily the candle could be bait for a trap. As he reached the candle, the canine pulled his paw away from his sword, moving it to pick the light source up by its handle before looking back around the room. The candle unfortunately didn\u2019t provide much illumination though, and it was only when Remus heard the sound once more that he find its source. This time it was he who caused the commotion, his boot collided with a brass pan on the floor, sending it sliding across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit\u2026\u201d He cursed under his breath, looking around to be sure he hadn\u2019t alerted anyone. It seemed as though he hadn\u2019t, but he was still sure somebody had been here to knock the pan over. Taking a closer look around the room, Remus saw two likely hiding places for any possible intruder. The first was obvious: a doorway on the other side of the room that opened onto stairs leading into some kind of cellar. The other was a man-sized alcove to the left of the doorway that was covered by a white curtain.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pondered for a moment about who or what may be hiding within it, waiting for him to turn his back, <i>\u201cMaybe it\u2019d be best to head down there first\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning and cautiously making his way down the steps, the hyena held his candle down low to better cast its light into the gloom of the basement. Once he reached the bottom of the steps, he could almost see the entirety of the cellar thanks to the candle's light, but it seemed there were still plenty of hiding spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThought it wasn\u2019t an especially large room, the basement was crowded with an assortment of crates, barrels, and sacks. Remus assumed they were used to store food, making it a pantry of sorts: the assorted herbs and roots that hung from the ceiling only added weight to his hypothesis. Regardless, the warrior was less concerned with the purpose of the containers than what could be lurking behind or even inside them. The cellar was at least somewhat tidy, the boxes and sacks mostly set along the walls to leave the middle of the room open. It wouldn\u2019t be too difficult for him to sweep the place to find whatever it was that might have knocked over that pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena boy lifted his candle higher, sweeping it about to get a better view before moving over to the nearest object large enough to hide an intruder. Once he drew near the large oaken barrel, he set the candle down on a crate next to it before tapping the barrel\u2019s lid with a gauntlet, hearing a hollow thud from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, probably not full of grain or oats\u2026\u201d the canine grumbled before gripping the lid\u2019s handle and lifting it up. Glancing inside, Remus was almost disappointed not to find an intruder, but a few measly cabbages instead, wilted and browning, \u201cGreat, I guess I\u2019m getting a-head of myself here,\u201d Remus grinned, apparently not understanding the difference between lettuce and the actual vegetables he was punning at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the lid, Remus glanced about the rest of the basement. Though the room wasn\u2019t huge, he could still count almost thirty good hiding spots, and if there were somebody else in here then turning his back to check them all was a bad idea. Just as the hyena was thinking that he needed a way to narrow his search, he spotted a large chest at the other end of the room, sitting just a few feet away from the back wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached it, he suddenly heard a soft creak from behind him. Every muscle in the hyena's body tensed as he twisted to face the stairs, half-expecting to see someone upon them but finding the steps empty. Did he imagine it? Possibly, but he wasn't quite sure...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grabbing the candle once again, Remus crept closer to the chest for a better look. As he drew near, it didn\u2019t take him long to realize that not only was the chest big enough for him to fit inside, but it was also ajar, if only ever-so-slightly: If there was indeed someone hiding down here, then this was the perfect spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena warrior drew his sword and steeled himself for a fight as he slid the tip of the blade beneath the chest\u2019s lid and thrust the container open as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being greeted by a cornered burglar as he expected, what burst forth was a billowing cloud of dark, pink smoke. Remus tried to back away from it, fearing some kind of toxin, but found escape impossible as the thick smoke continued to spread forth from the chest. Soon enough, the cloud had filled almost the entirety of the basement, sending the startled hyena coughing and sputtering as the strange mist was drawn into his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What the fu-Huurrk! Ackk\u2026! Huuuurrrrr\u2026.!\u201d The male wheezed, struggling to breath as his vision was clouded by the seemingly thickening miasma. As the smoke showed no signs of dissipating, breathing only became more difficult for Remus as his coughs grew louder and more forceful. Before long the hyena boy was literally choking, dropping his sword and the candle to the ground as he fell to his knees, clutching at his throat as his eyes watered and his vision began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he felt like he was about to pass out, the smoke finally seemed to clear, and the shadows cast by the spilled and still-lit candle flickered into clarity past the pink haze. As Remus\u2019s wracking coughs settled though, he noticed that the last of the cloud was condensing, pulling together into a singular thick area in front of him. Once this small mass was all that remained, Remus wheezed one last time, sucking in the mist like a vortex until no trace of the bizarre cloud remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what was that?! What the hell was <i>that</i>?!\u201d He snorted, gasping and huffing as he pulled himself to his feet. He considered his sword and the candle for a moment, before deciding instead to peer into the chest now that he had the chance, finding it to be completely empty, the interior the same exact color that the mist was. Remus dragged one of his fingers across the surface of the inside, drawing his gloved hand closer to his face and finding a film of the pink stuff resting upon it, like fine dust, \u201cPoison\u2026? Have I been\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus\u2019s words were interrupted by another sudden cough. This time however he caught sight of more of the pink mist as it spewed from his nostrils and mouth, \u201cA-Aaahhhhggghhh\u2026.!\u201d He groaned, stumbling backwards as an unexpected pain tore through his stomach, \u201cDamn\u2026! Need to get back upstairs\u2026\u201d He grumbled, cringing as his paws gripped the plate armor covering his belly, \u201cGotta get h-help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even turn to leave however, another pain hit the beleaguered hyena square in the gut. He bent over and grunted harshly through his teeth, his mind reeling as he began to feel nauseous. Slowly, but steadily, he became aware of a different sort of pain around his stomach as he broke out into a cold sweat, moisture dripping from his brow, \u201cNeed\u2026. Help... Need... N-Need\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus\u2019s stomach gurgled fiercely and the pain abruptly returned, followed by the new sensation of discomfort he had felt until the hyena boy realized it was his cuirass tightening around his abdomen. His paws shook, suddenly feeling clammy as he moved them over the chestplate\u2019s leather straps, wondering how they could have become pulled so taught. The canine tugged the straps loose, only to feel them slip from his paws as they came undone, the chestplate sliding free as it fell from his body with a loud clatter against the cellar floor. As soon as the warrior had seen what was causing so much pressure, he let out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him, sticking out a good two feet, was a bulging curve of a belly. His bloated gut sagged over his lap, partially exposed as the chainmail tunic and the shirt beneath rode up its curve. Remus brought a trembling paw to touch the bare, furry flesh, only to feel them suddenly sink into a few inches of flab as his gut surged outwards with disturbing speed. Even as he continued to hold onto his stomach in his armored paws, the hyena could feel it stretching and swelling, growing heavier and heavier in his very grasp, \u201cNo, dammit!\u201d He panted, cringing as he coughed out even more of the wicked dust, \u201cN-No, this can\u2019t be happening, not when I was so careful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he lamented his current situation, Remus was starting to realize he hadn\u2019t been through the half of it. Not only was his belly continuing to surge outwards, but he was starting to feel the rest of his armor growing increasingly tight as well. Pants and legplates began to squeeze against his ass and thighs as they engorged with fat and cellulite, gauntlets began to creak as the sausage-like digits filled up the spaces within, and a swollen, girthy set of moobs was beginning to strain the shirt and chainmail that rode up his fat belly. In mere seconds the hyena boy was wincing and then groaning in pain as he felt the plate metal armor that had once protected him begin to dig into the bloating, soft flesh of his fattening body. Remus\u2019s paws moved quickly as he cursed under his breath, loosening straps and pulling free his armor and shield as fast as he could, the various pieces of his outfit crashing against the ground next to his breastplate. Even though the warrior had years of practice, he nearly stumbled over as he fumbled with pulling his boots off, his balance thrown off completely by his ballooning body and his rapidly increasing weight. Finally though, he felt sweet relief as he tore free of his chainmail tunic, tossing it on the ground and panting heavily as the pain was ended, the pressure removed with the last bit of armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy Emperor\u2019s blade, no wonder everyone in this gods-forsaken town is so fat! Foul sorcery\u2026 or alchemy, or whatever it was, it acted so godsdamned fast\u2026\u201d He whimpered, gripping his disgustingly bloated, sagging gut in his now bare paws and hefting it to get an idea of its weight. The hyena groaned as he realized that his new gut\u2019s girth and shape had more in common with an overstuffed sack of flour than the once-toned abs he used to possess, \u201cSo many hard years of training, so many bloody years shaping my body into perfect fighting material\u2026 gone in an instant\u2026 Godsdammit, how could I be so stupid!\u201d He thought, cringing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena shook his head, trying to clear those thoughts from his mind as he focused on the present. He couldn\u2019t let thoughts like that get to him, not now, no matter how true and disturbing. He had fought in enough battles to know that you didn\u2019t survive by giving up when you were knocked down. While this wasn\u2019t exactly a battlefield, there seemed to be some kind of war being waged on this town, no matter how unconventional, and this trap he had triggered was just another attack. Whether it was meant for him or one of the inhabitants of the house didn\u2019t matter, what did was that he had to warn Uturi and the Mistress. While Remus turned towards the stairwell and started to leave the cellar, he took solace in the fact that at least whatever affliction the strange dust had stricken him with, it left him thin enough to still move around with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>PLINK!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEars twitching, Remus stopped cold in his tracks. While at first he\u2019d thought the sound had come from somewhere in the room, he soon realized the source was actually much closer as the same noise repeated once, and then twice more. His heart sank in despair as he caught sight of a small round object flying free from his belly, the broken shirt button sliding across the stone ground before him as a terrible realization dawned on the obese canine. The stomach pains he had felt before only confirmed his fears for him as they returned with even more intensity now, signaling that his unnatural weight gain was still far from done. He gripped his belly again and let out a startled yelp as his shirt swung open, letting his hefty, engorged moobs rest freely and fully exposed atop his vast gut. As if jealous of the damage his top had received, the warrior's already strained pants began to tear in several different spots, the sounds of shredding fabric breaking the uneasy silence of the cellar as they finally gave out under the boy\u2019s billowing rump and thickening thighs. Not to be outdone however, the seams of Remus\u2019s shirt joined in the chorus of tears and rips, falling to shreds beneath multiplying layers of arm flab. It didn\u2019t take long for Remus to realize he had never stopped growing at all, but only thought he did due to no longer being squeezed continuously by his armor. By the time he had come to this conclusion, the only bit of clothing left clinging to his now morbidly obese body was the cloth underwear he wore, now turned into a thong after being swallowed between his mammoth, pants-shredding buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 huff huff... No, no, no! Why won\u2019t it stop?!\u201d Remus grunted thickly, finding it harder and harder to breath as he grew fatter and fatter, \u201cWhen will it stop\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Remus was once again trying to pull himself together. He began to move towards the stairwell as fast as he could, though by this point he had already gained so much weight that his thighs were now rubbing together, his massively bulky and heavy body reducing his walk to a slow, laborious waddle. It felt like somebody had tied several large sandbags to him, his ballooning, blubbery body becoming increasingly burdensome as rolls began to pile onto his massively corpulent form. With each and every step the obese hyena took, his fat seemed to quake with greater intensity, his elephantine buttocks crashing into each other with every lurching movement before he finally found his escape cut short. As much as he wanted to, as much as he <i>needed</i> to, Remus found it impossible to lift his legs another inch. His energy was already completely spent, the colossal hyena struggling to catch his breath, his fur absolutely drenched with sweat, and his heart pounding as if it were about to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had only moved a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit\u2026 huff huff\u2026 gods help me\u2026 it can\u2019t end here! Not like this!\u201d He groaned heavily before mustering all the strength he could and shouting, \u201c<i>Uturi!</i> Lady\u2026 huff! <i>Huuurrrr\u2026!</i> Lady Berrywater! <i>HELP</i>\u2026.! P-Please help\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Remus had worried his efforts were in vain, that the cellar was too deep underground and his pleas fell on deaf ears. But as he looked up the stairwell he could see a shadowy figure standing at the top of the stairs, obstructing the faint moonlight that shone in through the kitchen window. Before he could get a good look at it though he heard a loud creak, and then the whole doorway went dark as whomever was standing there watching him closed the cellar door, trying to silence him even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What\u2026? No!\u201d Remus growled, the timbre of his voice thickened by his new girth, \u201c<i>Dammit, no! </i>\u2026.hufffff \u2026wheeeeeeeeze! GET BACK HERE...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother cough sputtered drool and that accursed pink mist past Remus\u2019s thick lips, shaking his triple chins as he desperately struggled to catch his breath. His heart was beating like a drum now, his blood rushing with both exertion and panic. Who was that? Was it the intruder? The person who had set this trap? What were they doing now? Was Uturi safe? Remus wheezed and gasped, struggling to breath. He was lucky he had been so healthy when he\u2019d gained all this weight, otherwise he\u2019d be having a heart attack right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Remus, despite this infuriating distraction his weight gain hadn\u2019t slowed one bit, the hyena only made aware of this by the sudden tightness of his underwear against his crotch. The overburdened garment lost it\u2019s struggle, snapping apart, the sweat-soaked rag falling to the ground between his chubby footpaws. He was thankful for what was now an apron of a belly, if only because it allowed the titanic and nude warrior to retain <i>some</i> modesty. As the weight piled on, Remus\u2019s knees trembling and energy all but spent, he found he had no choice but to collapse, falling onto his mammoth ass as gravity finally pulled his immense body to the ground. The now nearly 700 pound hyena\u2019s flabby body was still jiggling from the impact when he began to try to get back onto his feet. Despite having said feet placed firmly on the ground, and despite his still powerful muscles buried beneath all that fat, Remus could barely lift his ass an inch, achieving little more than causing his still swelling body to wobble even more violently. He was stuck on his big, fat ass and slowly starting to resemble a bloated, grey-spotted blob instead of the hyena warrior he really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, godsdamn you\u2026! Hurrr\u2026 huff\u2026!\u201d He whimpered, attempting to rock his huge body forwards as he pushed his feet harder against the ground, only struggling more and more as he steadily grew heavier and his energy was drained even further, each attempt becoming more futile as time went on, \u201cThis can\u2019t\u2026 nnnnffff\u2026 this can\u2019t be happening\u2026. Huff\u2026 not to me dammit\u2026 Grrr\u2026! I just need to\u2026. Huff.. huff\u2026 I just need to get up\u2026 Come on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuck on his ass, completely helpless, the Hyena\u2019s mind began to fill with panicked thoughts just as his body continued to fill with fat. The image of the huge, brass bathtub returned to his mind, the one he had thought obscenely large and yet quickly enough it would be too small for him to fit in\u2026 if that wasn\u2019t already the case. The rapid gain of the Berrywaters that once seemed impossible made so much sense now that he was a victim of it, and yet Remus was powerless to tell anyone of it now. He whimpered weakly as he tried one last time to get to his feet, but now found his legs almost impossible to move due to all of the energy he had wasted and the rings of fat now encircling them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow nearing almost 850 pounds, the canine adventurer certainly wasn\u2019t going anywhere in his current state. He stopped struggling once he realized that he could barely feel his legs, let alone move them now, and instead he fought mentally to stay as calm as he could. The titanic,  obese hyena gnashed his teeth together fiercely, somewhat due to the now ever present pain surging through his guts as the poisonous dust continued to assault his body, but mostly because of the mix of humiliation, dread, and self-loathing he now felt. He cursed himself a thousand times for his stupidity, for making a foolish rookie mistake that could very well leave his body in this horrible state for the rest of his life, effectively destroying what little dreams he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena continued to bloat even now, his immobile, fat-swaddled body spreading steadily across the floor. He grunted, wincing with discomfort as he vaguely felt his humongous bulk crawl across his armor, low, rumpling groans escaping from under his tremendous ass as it slowly crushed the sturdy plate metal into scrap. A slight warmth indicated that his bloating rear was now approaching the still-lit candle that lay on the ground, the heat growing with intensity before a brief spike of pain shot through his blubbery body as the surging flesh snuffed the tiny flame out, sending the already dim room completely into darkness. He wondered briefly how long it would take for one of the servant girls to find him like this, and how they could possibly get him out of here if they couldn\u2019t fix this, when the door at the top of the steps creaked open once again...</span></div></div>",

The steps creaked and groaned as the figure approached through the pitch-black dark, whistling merrily as it drew closer to the immobile and helplessly obese hyena boy. Whoever it was stopped their jaunty tune once they drew near, and Remus felt a small hand press against his vast belly momentarily, then pull back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Now what\u2019ve we got here?\u201d A female voice with a heavy, westerlands accent said, \u201cLet\u2019s get a good look at ya now, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus heard soft scraping before a diffused light filled the room once more as the person lit a match. The hyena grunted as he tried to look down at the woman, but found that his head had become just as immobilized as his legs due to the rings of fat surrounding it. He gave up trying to crane his fat neck almost immediately when he realized that even if he could look down, his gargantuan gut and moobs would likely just eclipse the speaker from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, hard to tell just from lookin\u2019 at ya, but you sound like a lad, and\u2026 aye, smell like a lad. Yep, definitely a lad ya are, what a shame\u2026\u201d She continued before delivering a firm kick to Remus\u2019s gut with her boot, sending it wobbling wildly, \u201cSee, that\u2019s strange! Complicates things a little. Only man that\u2019s s\u2019posed to be in this house is the bull, and none o\u2019 the servants are canine according to what we know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena grunted sharply from the pain of the kick, letting out a powerful belch that expelled even more of the pink gas, then growled as fury began to fill him. This wasn\u2019t one of the servants at all, it was whoever had set the trap. Remus briefly felt satisfied that the suspicions about an intruder were proved to be correct, but that satisfaction was quickly mollified when he realized said suspicions had landed him in this tight spot. The gigantic warrior tried desperately to speak, finding it even harder than before as his fat-choked voice groaned out, deep and strained, \u201cUhhhnn\u2026 huff\u2026. Huuuhhh\u2026 who\u2026 mnnf\u2026 Who are\u2026 nhhn\u2026.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving trouble there, are we tubbo? Hah! \u2018Who am I?\u2019 Who are <i>you</i>! That\u2019s the problem here. Seems the reports of \u2018interlopers\u2019 is  true\u2026 Said you was a \u2018hyena man\u2019, they did! And judgin\u2019 by these stretched ol\u2019 spots o\u2019 yours\u2026\u201d She said as Remus felt her hand again on his sweat-soaked fur, rubbing his fat gut, \u201cI\u2019m guessin\u2019 they were right\u2026 Hehehe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growl in Remus\u2019s throat only rose further, but it was weakened and lazy, barely threatening as spittle flew past his plump lips and landed on a slope of fat chins and neckfat, \u201cWhen I geh\u2026. Huff huff huff...! Get\u2026 thin\u2026 urrrghhh\u2026 enough to... unnnghh\u2026.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman let out a hearty laugh before she kicked Remus\u2019s belly even harder, exacerbating the pain roaring through his insides and causing him to let out a thick, husky yelp, \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you!\u201d She laughed as she walked around his tremendous body. At the very least the hyena\u2019s expansion seemed to finally be slowing to a halt, but that was little consolation when he was already over half a ton and completely immobilized. The hyena boy could barely lift his arms anymore as they rested on the sagging, plump rolls of his belly, \u201cNah, you just do not\u2026\u201d The voice said, now behind him, \u201cYou\u2019re stuck like this hon\u2026 Ye\u2019ll never be able to get on those chubby little feet o\u2019 yours again! And ye\u2019ll most definitely never be able to get any kind o\u2019 revenge on me\u2026 Oh you poor tubby bastard\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus\u2019s heart thundered, his blood pumping with rage and slight fear as he tried to growl louder, drool spilling down his chins. Again this was more sad than frightening, especially since his snarls were constantly interrupted by desperate gasps and wheezes. The once healthy warrior groaned as his growls ceased completely, the massive hyena\u2019s fur and even the black mane that coated his head absolutely dripping with sweat as he realized with a twinge of shock that simply getting angry was causing him unbearable exertion. By now the woman had reached the chest that had caused this whole mess and was inspecting it, admiring her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my, they said that stuff were magic! Looks like they were right about that, haha! Only put a little bit o\u2019 it in this chest, small pile really, and it made you fatter than a prize sow on market day!\u201d She said, giving his monstrous ass a smack and sending it jiggling, \u201cOi! Who am I kiddin\u2019, yer so fat you\u2019d make a hippopotamus blush! Ahahah! Pathetic! And oooohhhh, look here now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus grunted softly as he felt something being tugged free from beneath his humungous ass, realizing that it was his sword, \u201cHah! Quite a nice blade you\u2019ve got here big guy! Strong enough to survive being sat on by you, amazing aint it! A wee bit large, but I\u2019m sure I can get a few gold for it at a shop\u2026 <i>you</i> sure as fuck won\u2019t be needing it anyways!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whimper escaped from Remus\u2019s lips now, his ears flattening in shame at the momentary but audible lapse in his resolve. He regained his composure soon enough though. If he couldn\u2019t kick this person\u2019s ass, then at least he could try to get some information out of them he figured, \u201cWhy\u2026 why are\u2026 huff\u2026 rooohhhhh\u2026  urrghhhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, ya godsdammed mongrel!\u201d The woman said before kicking Remus in his flabby side, eliciting another pained bark from the hyena warrior, \u201cYour gonna need to save what little breath ya have for <i>my</i> questions!\u201d She said as she walked around in front of him again, \u201cFor example\u2026 the scouts said ya were with a ladyfriend\u2026 a lil\u2019 doe girl\u2026 Is it true then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus didn\u2019t say anything, the only sounds coming from him the constant panting and the occasional stomach gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman wasn\u2019t silent however, and Remus\u2019s ears perked slightly, his breath quickening as he heard his own blade slowly scrape across the ground threateningly, \u201cI\u2019m gonna ask you again fatty boy. There anything ya can tell me about that deer friend of yours\u2026? What\u2019s her name\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Remus refused to even let the lady know he was listening, and even as he felt the blade she had took lightly pressing into his fat stomach he did his best to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast chance fatty!\u201d The woman said in a sing-song voice before pushing the blade more firmly into Remus\u2019s overflowing belly fat, starting to draw blood and staining his gray fur, \u201cTell me what you two are doin\u2019 here and I\u2019ll let you live\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus bit his lip as he felt the blade press into him, knowing full well how he'd answer would determine how this would end for him. Deep down, Remus already knew what he'd have to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead he caught hold of his scream before it could escape his throat and channeled it into a growl. Unlike his previous attempts however, this bark had some bite to it, even if he could only keep it up for a few seconds before it succumbed to his wheezing gasps. It seemed to work though, to the hyena\u2019s surprise, as moments later he felt the woman remove the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa have guts lad, both literally and in the moxie sense of the word,\u201d The voice said, \u201cBut it won\u2019t matter a bit in the end.

See, we got a patrol waitin\u2019 around outside, and once I sneak back out there and give \u2018em the signal\u2026 well\u2026\u201d She chuckled to herself before heading slowly towards the stairs, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want things to get messy, but you nosin\u2019 about down here leaves us no choice. Shoulda just kept your fat nose to yourself. Don\u2019t worry about deer girl though, were gonna try to keep \u2018er alive for the time being so she\u2019ll tell us what you won\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDohh\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 mnnff\u2026 you\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax tubby!

Well I don\u2019t know what my bosses will do with you once they get their mitts on ya, or even how they\u2019ll get you out of here, but that\u2019s something for you to fret over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus heard a series of creaks echoing through the dark as his unseen adversary slowly climbed her way up the steps, \u201cDon\u2019t worry though, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re proper fucked, lardass. Unless ya got an in with Lord L, then anyone who goes up to his castle aint ever seen again\u2026 Hell, that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m blabbin\u2019 so much to you! But oi, look on the bright side: At least you\u2019ve got a nice, big cushy seat to listen to all the ruckus that\u2019s gonna happen upstairs. Anyways, toodle-loo, tubby!\u201d And with that, the door at the top of the steps opened one last time before the shadowy figure stepped through into the kitchen beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door closed, the room was once again filled with darkness and silence. As the hyena was left alone with his thoughts, regrets, and anxieties, he realized he would have almost preferred the taunts of his enemy. What was going to happen to him now that he was almost 1,500 pounds of useless canine blubber? What the hell was this \u2018pollen\u2019 and how could it have done so much damage to his once fit frame? And worst of all, what would happen to the Berrywaters and their servants, what would happen to Uturi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these questions, all these worries, maybe they could have been avoided if he wasn\u2019t so goddsdamned foolish. He let out a whine, only a little happy that nobody could hear the pitiful noise now. The one thing he\u2019d been trained from youth to do, the one thing he\u2019d still wanted to do deep down even after he had left the military of his far away homeland was to protect those who needed it. To protect people like those in the house above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t now: He\u2019d never be able to again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother groan rippled through the immobile hyena\u2019s hideously fat stomach once again, but this time it wasn\u2019t painful. This discomfort wasn\u2019t a direct result of the poison, instead it was caused by something that disgusted the hyena even more, something that would no doubt only grow over time: Hunger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Uturi scrambled to the top of a hill near the village walls, crying out in pain. She clutched at a crossbow bolt that had found her left arm, glad that it had not struck anything vital, not so glad at the pain she'd feel removing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped her dagger, forgetting the blood coating it, and forgetting what she had to do to escape the manor for a minute. She let the sharp pain replace those thoughts instead as she withdrew the bolt and tossed it down the hill towards a tavern below, and then wrapped the wound with a bandage she had pulled from her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should probably sit. The hill might have been exposed in the day, but not now. She wouldn't be seen, but after making her way through town she needed a rest. Uturi couldn't though, not when her body was still trembling after how quickly things had gone wrong, not after what she just went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manor was on the other side of Little Silverhorne, but she could still make it easily, the flames consuming it almost entirely now. Tears began to well in her eyes now that she had a chance to reflect on everything, now that the adrenaline was dying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had happened as she made her way out into the foyer to look for Remus. She had just met with the Berrywaters to reaffirm her promise and say goodbye, the Mistress and her Ocelot servant following along behind her to see her off, when over a dozen guards broke in through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following events were a blur to her, yelling between a guard captain, a tall and brutish wolf, and the Mistress and Uturi herself. Accusations of treason, the refuting of such claims. Then as though waiting for the opportunity, the thugs closed in. Uturi drew her knife, the close quarters leaving her little room for her bow as she was separated from the other two women on the stairs. Uturi had plenty of training, even with her dagger, though she had little actual experience in combat, and had never actually taken a life before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her face in her palms. Tears flowed down them towards her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow the fire started, perhaps deliberately by the guards and their torches, perhaps accidentally in the scuffle, but the manor burned all the same. Maybe the Mistress and her servants had made it out. Maybe they had only been taken by the guards. But what about the Master? There was no way they could have moved him out in time. Then there was Remus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi's stomach turned. Did he flee like a coward and leave them to this? Was he still in the house when it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer knees trembled. She wanted to sit, but she wouldn't let herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her paws away, the night air cold on her wet face. Through the smoke rising from the manor's flames, past the village and near the summit of a nearby mountain she saw it. Lights flickering in the night, a dark silhouette of towers and parapets against the the nocturnal blue of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Lord L.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grief and shock started to fade now, replaced by a stronger, and much simpler emotion to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping as she shifted her weight, Uturi flexed her left hand, the movement causing more pain from her wound. First she would need to properly treat this thing, preferably find somebody in town or nearby who can help with that. After that though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept looking at the castle, even as black smoke hid it from view. She would find Sally. She would rescue her guildmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent down to pick up her dagger. Looking at the blood, still fresh, realizing it was on her paw as well. She wiped the blade on her leather leggings, then sheathed the dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to do what she came here to do, and then she would make sure that this town wouldn't suffer any longer. Not at the hands of its cruel master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course she could have treated it herself, but who knows how long it would take to heal? By then she could wind up suffering the same fate as the poor townspeople.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to find a healer. If I can heal my wound from when that bolt struck my arm I should be as good as new. Then I'll rescue my guildmaster and find Remus if he's still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Uturi continued her search. After several more failed attempts she was about to give up until she bumped into an extremely rotund man. The collision knocked the doe back a few steps. When she looked up she saw that the large man was wearing cloak with strange markings she has never seen before and  that he had jet black hair, crimson eyes, and stood at least 6'5\" tall at a total weight of over 600 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? What happened to you? How did you hurt your arm? I can heal for you if you would want me to take a look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi was speechless. Here she was looking for a healer when the healer bumped into her just as she was going to give up and treat herself. \"I'm fine except my arm got hit by a crossbow's bolt and the Berrywaters home burning down. I also can't find my partner, Remus anywhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible. Please stay with me for the night. I can treat your wound and give you something to eat for the night. My place is close to Lord L's castle. Lately Lord L and his mistress have been gathering every maiden for purposes unknown. Some say its to offer them up as sacrifices to the Goddess Lipocia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually have business here with Lord L. I'm here to rescue my guildmaster from his clutches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Follow me milady and I'll fix you up in no time.\" The man said as he smiled subtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi follows the cloaked man out of town. He leads the doe to a a fairly large cabin. The cabin was located at the base of the mountain, roughly 200 feet below the Lipomancer's castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come inside dear. I was about to have some stew when I sensed a disturbance in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious 600 lb. cloak man pours Uturi a bowl of stew. Uturi's stomach gave a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be starving. Here's some fresh made juice.\" The made said as he used magic to pour Uturi a large glass of what resembled pink lemonade.\" I'll be right back. I just have to go get my special medicine that will patch you up in a jiffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi tries to start eating the stew with her good arm, but the stew proves to be a touch too hot to eat. She then decides to wait until the kind stranger finds his special medicine before she starts to eat the stew.  The cloaked man walked towards the back room of his cabin. The room had various magic artifacts and several magic book on every magic known to the world. He then walks to the round wooden table in the middle of the room and picks up a crystal ball. The man chants in the language of the ancients. Then without warning the image of a lab appears. In the lab a severely overweight hyena could be seen struggling, but his 1550 lb. body was pinned down on the enormous table. A lady with blonde hair, blue eyes, and with a large bust could be seen staring back at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lord L, have you found that doe yet?\" The lady asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have. She's the last one we need for the ritual. What do you plan to do with that hyena?\" The Lipomancer asks the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I plan on turning him into one of my beats of gluttony. He'll make an excellent servant, especially once we resurrection the Goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful news my dear. Soon we will get rid of all this senseless violence and bloodshed. I have to go now. I'll see in a bit my lovely wife.\" The Lipomancer said as he deactivated the magic in the crystal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer proceeds to get the \"medicine\" he was looking for and walks back towards the fireplace, where Uturi begain to eat her stew and drink her juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that took a bit long, but I had to find the right one.\" The Lipomancer said as he smiled contently knowing that Uturi was falling into his trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. Drink this vile until it is all gone. You may feel a bit drowsy, but you'll be as good as new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you kind sir.\" Uturi said before she drank the vile of blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUturi then passes out like a light. The Lipomancer grins evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you dear Uturi for being such a fool. Now the Goddess will live again thanks to you. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\"</span></div></div>",

She panted as she came to a stop, letting herself rest for a bit before getting back to her feet and heading towards the town wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall itself was quite tall, but seemed to have several areas along its flank that could act as sturdy hand and footholds for climbing. Uturi could have easily scaled it were it not for her arm, but thankfully the area she now found herself in served as a good enough hiding place as she recovered. The hill would serve to shield her from view of the town, while no guards that might be patrolling atop the wall would be able to see her thanks to a small thicket of trees growing near its base. Uturi made her way to a nearby log, sitting down and leaning back against it as she rummaged through her pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Must be something here...\" </i>She thought to herself as she searched through various tools and supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a small vial of healing potion, eyes lighting up a moment before she held it up to the moonlight and saw it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" She cursed as she was about tho toss the vial aside, then thought better of it as she stashed it back in the bag. Those things were like bottled miracles, a potent mix of alchemical innovation and magic that could speed along the body's natural healing abilities. When had she needed to use one of those...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"On the trip out here, was pretty dehydrated on the road...\"</i> She recalled. She then tugged out her canteen, the water inside sloshing heavily enough to block out the chorus of insect chirps filling the night, \"Oh! ...by the gods, what is wrong with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned at out of frustration at herself before letting loose a few soft chuckles as she unscrewed the canteen and took a long swig. The laughter was almost as refreshing as the water, but she was still weeping a little as she stowed the canteen away again and continued looking through her pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of Remus for a moment, but pushed him out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dead. And even if he wasn't, he was a traitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she tried to focus on something else. Something happy. She remembered when she was just a child, her mother showing her how to shoot a bow, her father watching from the fields, resting his paws on a shovel as he took a break to watch her growing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, wiping at her eyes with one paw as another pulled out a small book. <i>The Joys of Magic</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile found its way across her lips and she let out another giggle as she held the book before her in both paws, studying the simple leather cover. It was a gift from her mother, something she gave her when she went off to become a ranger. Both her parents saw the practical advantages of learning spells, but only her mother would practice using them, and even then just simple things to aid her around the house. Fixing a broken plow, making water appear for the plants, or just an easy glow spell to light up the house. Uturi was always eager to learn and loved reading whatever books her family could find, so she cherished the small book, both as a source of knowledge and a reminder of the home she left behind going out on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she hadn't had much practice with the book in her time at the Guild, preferring to socialize or work on her archery and other skills more suited for a ranger. Still, she knew at least some things about how magic worked... It was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uturi, remember the basics of spellcasting...\" She whispered to herself as she flipped through the book. About midway through she found what she wanted. A spell to heal minor injuries! Something that seemed to work similar to the healing potions she was reminded of earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I just need to say these words, think of the effects, and focus my... errr... energy?\" She said before reading the words out loud, moving her right palm over her bandaged wound, and closing her eyes shut tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft green glow began to radiate from her palm, and Uturi opened her eyes to watch the spell's effects. As she did though, the glow turned into small bolts of green electricity that arced briefly but painfully between her paw and arm, causing her to breath in sharply through her teeth, \"Crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed suddenly now, her throat feeling immensely dry as she wheezed a bit. She grabbed her canteen back out of her back, pulled the cork back out and took a few deep swigs as she re-hydrated herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Forgot that magic does that to you...!\" She huffed, wiping her mouth with her arm. Once she had drank her fill from the canteen, she pressed a couple fingers to the bandage where her wound was. It still stung a little, but not nearly as bad as you'd expect from something so deep. She carefully unwrapped her dressings with her right paw and tossed the blood-soaked linens aside as she looked over her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flesh around the wounded area was still red and somewhat inflamed under the bloodstained fur, but it at least was now sealed completely. The thing would definitely still be tender for a while, but as Uturi flexed her left hand, she knew it would be nothing that would hinder her too greatly. Plus now she didn't have to worry about the damn thing getting infected and causing more problems for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in a bit of relief, happy that at least something had gone right tonight. She put the spellbook and canteen back in her pack as she set it behind her, leaning back to rest her head on it like a makeshift pillow, trying to push the painful memories that had got her in this state aside for now. She needed to rest, whether that meant a cautious break or a full-night's sleep, she wasn't too sure...</span></div></div>",

Uturi would probably understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Remus started to say before a loud rumbling in his now massive gut, interrupted him. A bubbly sensation in his stomach became more and more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you? Hurry up and tell me everything you know!\" The evil woman says as she waves the sword in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Remus moaned before he opened his mouth and let out the biggest belch he'd ever heard in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink mist he breathed in earlier, came spewing out of the hyena man's mouth. The mysterious woman was so surprised that she accidentally breathed it in. She closed her mouth a moment later, but it soon became obvious that it was far too late as her body began to rapidly bloat up with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No!\" The woman wailed as she looked at her ballooning body with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus couldn't help but laugh, \"Karma's a bitch, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman screamed in horror as her growing gut ripped through her shirt and pants. Her thighs plumped up and were soon rubbing together as she waddled around the room. A double chin, and then a triple chin form around her neck as cellulite formed all over her body. Her belly sagged lower and lower with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the evil woman porked out, Remus' own body began to feel lighter. At first he thought that it was his imagination, but after a few moments he was certain. His own body was loosing weight at the same rate that the woman was gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman suddenly tripped over her own sagging gut and fell to the ground. She moaned and wheezed as she struggled and failed to stand back up. She whimpered and sobbed as she rolled around on the ground in a futile attempt to stand back up. Soon she stopped wiggling as she became too fat to move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus looked down at his own body and was relieved to see that he was now back to his normal size. He stood up off the floor and felt grateful that he was able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never take walking for granted again.\" Remus muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one look at the shredded remains of his clothes and armor, and realized that they were a lost cause. His body was back to normal, but gear had still been destroyed by his weight gain. He would have to find some replacement clothing at the earliest opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus turned his attention towards the mysterious woman that had tried to threaten him. Remus left the room for a moment and returned with a torch. With the light of the torch, Remus was finally able to get a good look at the woman. The woman was now a total blob of fat, incapable of moving a single muscle, but Remus was still able to recognize her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the several hundred pounds of additional blubber, Remus could easily tell that his former attacker was the ocelot maid from before. Before he could make any remarks about the matter however, he noticed that her face seemed, off, her eyes were pitch black, and she had noticeable markings all over her. \"What the hell is on with you?\" He asked, inspecting her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned, then let out a deep belch before responding, \"It's not me, I couldn't help it, I wasn't supposed to end up like this...\" She muttered to her self between moans and burps. Remus looked at her in confusion, before stepping back in shock as her belly started to act on its own. The flesh around the navel seemed to ripple, then it suddenly expanded, spreading the maids large belly out even more. The belly button itself was pitch black on the inside, but seemed to be leaking some kind of shadow like gas. The ocelot started to whimper, though not seemingly from pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to the shock of the hyena and the dismay of the ocelot, a head emerged from the tunnel. A full mane of silvery white hair flowed all around, covering the front of the maids gut with its sheer amount. Two horns could be seen emerging from the head itself, curling and curving around to the face like claws. What skin could be seen was a vibrant purple from some kind of human like creature, with eyes a familiar pitch black with glowing purple irises, it was clear to Remus that the entity was a female, or at least incredibly feminine. Grunting, the creature continued to pull itself out by stretching her hosts belly out more, finally releasing her fleshy arms and then her titanic breasts from the fleshy tunnel. The two meaty sacs of fat and milk dangled freely down the expanse of the gut while her limbs patted the blubber around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at Remus, who was still staring at her in shock, and smiled, \"Why, hello there handsome~\" she cooed, causing him to blink and blush slightly, feeling emotions that he wouldn't imagine he would be having at all in this moment. \"I must say, turning the summoning ritual back on my thrall was pretty amusing, shame about losing all the weight though, you looked wonderful as an immobile tub of lard~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling himself blush even harder, he growled to keep some sense of strength to him, though his notable erection was only making things worse for him, and was deeply amusing the entity before him. \"What the fuck do you mean summoning ritual? And what did you do to the maid? Who the hell are you anyway?\" He asked. He tried to ignore the hungry and pleased look spreading across the entities face as she noticed just how much of an affect her 'charms' were having on him. The ocelot looked away, clearly ashamed by what happened to her throughout all of the ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the powder you breathed in is usually used to turn people into big blobs of fat to be used to summon demons like myself,\" She answered softly, turning her head for extra effect, \"As for this butterball I'm currently inside, I did a bit of mental manipulation, made her my, somewhat unwilling servant for the night to prepare someone for me to use to enter this world properly and permanently~\" she cooed again, giggling as the maid suddenly lets out a loud and large fart, causing Remus to crinkle his face in disgust and the maid to whimper and blush in utter horror and embarrassment. The demon meanwhile seemed to love it and the way her 'portal's fat jiggles all around her from the simple passing of wind. \"She'll be fine now, but like she said to you, she won't be slimming down at all any time soon, so she better get used to her new body~ Oh, and the names Miaka.\" She replied with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemus frowned, before sighing, crossing his arms over his chest as he looked down at the demoness, \"Well then Miaka, what are you going to do now that you're finally in the realm of mortals?\" he asked, before looking at the now clearly distraught maid with a pitying look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon hummed to herself, thinking for a few seconds before looking up at the hyena- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the country of Phillander there was a fear warlord who ruled it with an iron fist. Deep inside a Gothic styled fortress a three headed dragon sat on his throne. Thoraxum Versa is what he was called. Thoraxum Versa was a brute of a dragon man. Each of his heads or who he calls \"brothers\" has their own distinct personality. The head on his left had the air of a gentleman, but was actually a manipulator. The central head tends to be gruff, but is the kindest out of the others in many cases he lets prisoners chose eternal servitude or to chose how they would like to die. The last head is a certified genius and a bit of a wack job. He enjoys using people as experiments and is usually bloodthirsty when bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Thoraxum Versa has a vibrant scale color of black and silver. He stands at an impressive height of ten feet tall and is heavily muscled. His wings have a wingspan of thirty feet and are capable of supporting his beefy figure during flight. His armor is gold and white and emblazoned with his family crest, which is that of a Hydra with three heads and usually colored red. Due to his intellect he has mastery over many forms of magic and can even resurrect the dead. Thoraxum Versa was currently planning to take control of the entire continent of Meldran, the continent in which his country resides. As he was studying the map of the continent a servant girl approach his throne. She was a rabbit who was caught stealing from his treasury, but now she is his maid for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'lords! The troops are ready for departure!\" The rabbit said as she curtsied before the three headed dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent Abigail, now go fetch our amulets. My brothers and I will need them for the journey.\" Thoraxum's left head said in his usual manipulative manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget this list either. You'll need it to deactivate the traps in each of the rooms. If you survive then my brother may reward you, but if you die then I'll use your corpse as a test subject.\" Thoraxum's right head said as he smiled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit quickly curtsies before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go bros. We can't be late. The earlier we leave the better.\" Thoraxum's central head spoke in a gruff manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoraxum heaves his 800 lb. muscular body and heads to the airship bay. Once there he notices Abigail with the amulets. Abigail had several cuts on her body and was about to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done.\" Thoraxum's central head spoke up. He then heals Abigail of her wounds. \"Take these clothes and change on the airship\", Thoraxum's central head continued. \"You've just been promoted to a spy. Your payment will vary on the details of your report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you m'lord\", Abigail replied to Thoraxum's central head. She then curtsies and boards the ship with her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoraxum Versa heads to the captain's quarters and starts up his air ship. He then pilots his airship full of troops to...</span></div></div>",

He then pilots his airship full of troops to Brisleton. a country who's king is dying of old age. Each of Thoraxum Versa's grin as they imagine their first new addition to the empire. Thoraxum then pulls down a horn and his left head begins speaking. \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are almost at our destination. We are to invade Brisleton, but before we do that we'll need to send  our newest spy to map out the terrain. Thank you and may the odds ever be in our favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Thoraxum's men start cheering, yet when it came to motivational speeches Thoraxum's left head always knew what to say. In truth that's how he manipulates others into his bidding. For months Thoraxum had heard that the king of Brisleton was on his death bed. King Dravomore was also a hydra-based dragon like Thoraxum himself. King Dravomore was a powerful ruler and often earned Thoraxum's respect through his reputation as a strong leader. Lately there have been rumors of Bristleton's recent power grab of other cities and towns on their border, but most of this has taken place during King Dravomore's illness. Yet Dravomore's only heir was his daughter Aleatha Cundrum. Rumors say she's a violent and manipulative beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also say she is an expert in science and magic and is the strongest in her kingdom. This however led to the idea of an alliance. Thoraxum could easily conquer with brute force Brisleton, but if he wanted an heir to his empire then marriage may be the way to conquer Brisleton. Thoraxum landed the airship and let his new spy, who's still a maid but also a spy to do her job. Thoraxum then pulled a book off a bookshelf. It was titled <i>Legends of Meldran</i>. The book itself had the entire mythology of Meldran and its history. He already knew hydras exist due to his draconic bloodline sprouting off from hydra anthros and that Brisleton is the only other country to have hydra dragons in their populace. Yet what intrigued him was an ancient cult known as Lipomancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir have been allegations that a new modern sect of the wayward cult has began spreading like wildfire. Word also says that the high priest who is only known as the Lipomancer has been eager to spread the cult across Meldran. One thing Thoraxum Versa couldn't stand was competition. If he ever sees this Lipomancer face to face he would rip their head off and feed it to the beasts. What's even more ridiculous about this cult is that all worshipers must binge in order to worship their deity who is solely known as the Lord of Feasts. Now Thoraxum wasn't a stranger to being fat since all dragons have to build up blubber in order to live through the winter months, but he has figured out a way to metabolize the winter blubber into muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoraxum finishes reading his book when he hears the door to his quarters creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the report?\" His central head asked in a gruff tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this how you treat a fellow noble? You should be careful bub. I caught your little pet sneaking into my chambers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoraxum turns around to see a strong three headed dragoness standing in his doorway with his servant tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive work. Why don't we talk over a meal.\" Thoraxum's central head said as he tried romancing the dragoness before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great!\" Aleatha Cundrum's right head said enthusiastically.</span></div></div>",

Now Silas was a strong, powerful, and charming man with black hair and deep blue eyes. Many women would swoon over his impressive physique, but unfortunately he was far too greedy to start any serious relationships. One day while he was boasting of his greatest escapade in a bar in a town called Miramora a mysterious and charming human woman walked into the bar. The woman was dressed in a sorceress's cloak and she had chocolate brown eyes and hair. She was minding her business until she spotted Silas bragging to a bunch of drunkards and women serving the booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no treasure that I Silas Gallientstone have not found. Whenever I hear treasure I speed off with haste towards it.\" Silas bragged as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so Mr. Gallientstone?\" The sorceress asked in a condescending tone. \"Have you heard of the treasure of the Lipomancer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lipomancer, eh? Isn't that some old fairy tale?\" Silas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so too until I found this map to his treasure trove,\" The sorceress replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress shows Silas the map. The map indicated that the Lipomancer's treasure was in a city called Gourmandalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the map? Are you sure it isn't a fake? For all I know you could be scamming me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coming from a playboy? You barely give any woman the time of day when treasure is mentioned. You're a liar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You accuse me of being a liar? I'll check out this Gourmandalia place out. How much for that map?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No charge at all. Maybe I'll see you around sometime.\" The sorceress said as she handed Silas the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress walks out of the bar in the same fashion that she entered. Silas was confused that such a mysterious and beautiful woman would just waltz up to him and tell him about the Lipomancer's treasure, but nothing can beat an adventure. Especially if it means that he'll be as rich as a king. Silas looks over the map and sees that...</span></div></div>",

According to the index provided on the place the city has a 99.9 % obesity rate. If that's true then that must mean that place must have some great food and wealthy people. If there are wealthy people then there must be abandoned treasure troves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may check it out the city later. There's also a another place that is near Gourmandalia. It will still take a week, but Aromaca sounds less bizarre than Silverhorne. They also are known for their amazing women and sports. It's settled then! I'll take the route that doesn't go through Silverhorne, but on my way back I'll see if the info on Silverhorne isn't a hoax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Silas Gallientstone packed his things and set out for his adventure. As he triumphantly left Miramora the memory of the quiet and rosy town would be a place that he'll write about in his adventure journal. For every adventure Silas would record his own escapades, which were often written in third person. He even considered going to a publisher in Calta-Nosteronk, but then he decided that it wasn't the right time. After venturing for an hour Silas was in Thumbeline Forest, a magical forest whose fruits have a strange effect on whoever eats them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe index on the map even warned travelers to not eat anything that grew on the trees. The index states a rumor that the Lipomancer cast a spell on the forest to curse those that dare to defy him. Silas, however, shrugged it off as another fairy tale meant to frighten children and the superstitious magic users. As Silas was walking he heard a rustling noise from the bushes. Silas draws his sword in preparation for a confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out! You have made a grave mistake if you think you can ambush Silas Gallientstone, the world's greatest treasure hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bushes rustle at a faster pace.

These questions circled in Sulfrous' head as she continued to worry. She could still remember the first time she saw him a few years back. She was terrified, her eyes filled with fear as her family traded her away for cash, unsure what the world had in store for her. It took her some time to get used to, but once she did, she realized this man wasn't so bad after all. In fact, he was quite amazing! He was always kind, never took advantage of her, regardless her assets. He even owned a large mansion (which was where they lived), in which he let her roam free. Thing was, she preferred to stay around him, because that was where she was most comfortable. She felt safe, and when she was scared, he always hugged her and comforted her. Even while he was away, the words he spoke made her feel like nothing could go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to well up in her eyes. This time, those words couldn't hold for so long. SOMETHING had to be wrong, and that scared her. What if he didn't come back? What would she do then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to cry, and as tears streamed by her face, something in her mind lit up. She's going to have to go out there and find him, regardless how much fear is coursing through her body. She slowly rose up, wiping the tears from her face, and thought. He had to have some map around here somewhere, something to mark his path...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I forgot to add this, but she does have wings, and she can fly with them. Also, this is just a request, but please keep face/neck/chin gain here to a minimum.

From her head was draped locks of long brown hair and her body was donned in long yellow robes with plentiful pockets. Her gaze formed form a pair of green eyes rose up off of her parchment towards the table in front of her. The surface of which was covered in glowing runic symbols, alchemical ingredients, and pots burning incense. In the middle of the whole mess lied a plush. A simplistic brown figure that looked to be a mere ragdoll with a texture resembling a burlap sack, though without the messy strands rising off of it and much softer. Roughly a foot tall, it's design consisted of a pair of short legs, long arms, and a round head with a stitched mouth and button eyes. Catlike ears and a fluffy white cotton puff of a tail completed the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished jotting down the final bits of information into her book, she shut it and returned the quill to the inkwell before rising up. beside her, to her left was an intricate wooden wand with the occasional gem or precious metal bored into it's shape. Seizing it and raising the implement into the air, the wand began to glow. As she waved it around over the plush, she brought her free hand forward until it too began to glow and she hovered it just above the figure. As the spell progressed, the ingredients around the table also began to glow and the runes began to crackle with energy. shutting her eyes, a gust picked up within her house, gently rattling the surrounding knick-knacks. Finally, the plush its self began to glow, light emanating from it's pours. In moments it had begun to float towards the sorceress's hand which she raised along with it. Eventually, as the light reached maximum intensity, the mouth of the plush began to open and pour our more yellow light before a bright flash burst from it in a display that could light up the surrounding forest. After that, everything in the house fell still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nleaning over the table, the tall sorceress inspected the construct she had just cast a spell upon, staring anxiously. For the first minute, nothing seemed to happen. Afraid she may have made a mistake, her gaze hopped between each of the ingredients she had used in her ritual, hoping they were still good. However, as expected, they had either shriveled or burned after satisfying their purpose. The sorceress sighed at the notion that she would have to gather everything again and start the ritual over. However, before she turned away, she noticed something. It was a twitch from the hand of the doll. The sorceress's eyes opened wide and seemed to practically light up with joy. The creature twitched again before slowly raising its hand in the air, meeting it with its button eyes. observing the structure, it turned its hand around before inspecting the other. Slowly, it then rose up into a sitting position, looking over its body before examining the room. It seemed to be in wonder. Eventually, its eyes met the sorceress who smiled with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you... can you hear me? can you understand me?\" the sorceress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plush just sat there for a moment, not saying anything before it slowly rose to its feet. Stumbling a bit as it got used to the feeling of standing, it looked back up to the sorceress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress?\" the creature asked, looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress stared in awe for a moment before practically squeezing with delight. quickly, she reached out and scooped the creature up into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, that's right! I'm your mistress! my name is Aelita. I created you\" the sorceress explained, her face beaming with Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature looked up to her, taking in the information. the ritual had at least given the plush some basic rudimentary knowledge, however, it would be able to learn as time went on. The creature, seeing her so joyous, smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress... Aelita. Mistress Aelita\" the plush repeated, practicing it's voice and memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then reached out and returned the hug, noting the sensation of her body against its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh... but... you're gonna need a name too, won't you little guy... hmm...\" said Aelita before looking around the room for inspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nher eyes skipped around to the various objects within her house but nothing seemed to click, that is until she noticed a bundle of lavender sprigs beside the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's a good one. I'll name you Lavender my favorite scent\" Aelita declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lavender... okay, my name is Lavender, Mistress\" said the plush, committing its new name to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita smiled before her eyes shot open. she suddenly remembered what it was she was really doing and knew the little guy would require an explanation. Noting this, she set the plush down on the table before backing up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, so, as you've already been imprinted to know, you are a golem and I created you for a very specific purpose. You see, I'm going to need your help with a certain problem that the lands have been experiencing. For a while now, people have been talking about a wizard with odd powers. Powers that he uses for ill intent. To be honest, I really don't know anything about it or what this guy's actually doing, but I've heard stories of many adventurers going after him and never coming back. the few who have.. well... they returned under strange conditions, notably, they were severely overweight. nobody has even seen them, so we don't know what they look like, though, they suspect the individual is male. Well, I probably haven't been following these stories like I should have been, but recently, the lands not far to the north of here have been changing. they say settlements no longer respond to messages and trade has been cut off. Those who have been to the lands say that it's full of odd wildlife and plants, and worst of all, it's spreading... so, umm you with me so far little guy?\" Aelita explained, stopping just in case this was too much for Lavender to take in all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender was silent as he processed everything. However, when he finished up, he smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress, I will help you find the bad wizard. What is it you wish me to do?\" Lavender asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita rubbed the back of her head. She didn't want Lavender to get the wrong idea from how she would explain this. Even though she had just created him, she already valued him and was afraid that whatever she may say might sound like he was insignificant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well... You see, we don't know why this guy does what he does, but thanks to the cases we have seen with whoever returned, se think he uses some sort of magic that people have started to call lipomancy. I don't know how he does it, but if the rumors of lost adventurers are to be believed. it seems powerful... So, that's where you come in Lavender. I need you to be my... umm... surrogate. I don't expect to get out of this one unscathed, but if something happens with my bod, you know, if the wizard does something that makes me... you know... get fat... I need somewhere to transfer it. I've created a link between us that should let me convert any fat I gain into stuffing in your body. You see, if we humans get big, we loose allot of energy and have a hard time getting around. If that happens, I might fail as well. You however, stuffing doesn't weight much, and you're further strengthened with magic. You shouldn't have any problems with it. Not to mention I can unstuff you whenever you need it\" Aelita explained to the best of her abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender was silent for a moment. he actually appeared to be growing worried and looked down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I really don't want to get too big mistress. That might be uncomfortable... but, I will help you in any way I can\" Lavender promised as he rubbed his plush body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAelita smiled meekly. She didn't want to put her new friend through that if she could avoid it, but if the rumors were true, she would have to stop it before the corruption spread too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lavender, I'm sorry if it just sounds like I'm using you, but I promise I'm not! after all, I gave you intelligence and self awareness. You'll be a nice companion on the road\" Aelita explained, trying to make Lavender feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender looked around. fortunately for Aelita, he didn't feel as if he were being used, but still had his own reservations. Regardless, it's what he was made for, and even if he was nervous about it, this is here his mistress needed him. In the end, he was fully accepting of the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aelita looked outside, it appeared to still be dark out. She had stayed up for much of the night. Despite her eagerness to set out now, maybe it would be best if she waited until sunrise to set out.</span></div></div>",

Amongst old, dead trees, which had perished a long time ago due to the infertile soil, the fog drifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance was a castle, its walls and towers a silhouette against the night. It was a sight that would make ordinary men leave in terror and brave adventurers nervous. It's why Gark decided that it would be the perfect place to start his quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlapping his leathery wings, the thin, grey gargoyle flew across the sky. He landed on a branch of a nearby tree, which shook under the sudden weight, but held. He sniffed the air with his short, stubby snout, scanning the area with his yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze fell on the castle in the distance, and a happy, slightly goofy, smile spread across his face, revealing his sharp teeth and two disproportionately large fangs, one portraying out of his mouth from his lower jaw and one from the upper jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGark was on a mission, not from some dark overlord or sorcerer, mind you, but from himself. The gargoyle liked to boast that he was the first creature of his kind to try and break away from the miserable life this world had set for his kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the other gargoyles laughed at him when he told them what he wanted to do. After all, they were creatures born from the heart of darkness, things that were seen at best as loyal servants to some dark being and target practice for heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not anymore! Gark was going to smash that stigma to peaces by doing this mission. He was going to break into the castle of the legendary lipomancer, acquire object of great power, and become fabulously rich in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting the rusty short sword, which was tied to a piece of rope around his waist, he took off again, flying to the castle, oblivious to the fact that he was being watched.</span></div></div>",

Empty suits of armor, which Gark thought were actual guards for a few moments, stood neatly against the walls, a few feet of space separating each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was looking around, searching for something to steal, the portraits caught his attention.

Some of them were gorging on mountains of meals, being slowly reduced to immobility, while others were simply doing kinky activities, such as groping, suckling on large breasts, kissing wildly, and just having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, when Gark looked around again, he saw that the empty suits of armor was meant for a person that was on the corpulent side.

With one arm behind his back while the other scratched his bare, hairy chest and continued to stare out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe covers shifted next to him. He looked and a small smile touched his lips. The innkeeper's daughter, a slim woman with golden brown, curly hair, was lying next to him, nude under the covers but still fast asleep. Ferris sank lower into bed and recalled the events from last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a ball: ale flowed like a massive waterfall, the inn packed with people laughing, shouting, cheering, and even dancing on the tables while they were getting drunk off their asses, stuffing their faces with meat, or doing both at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of all the chaos was Ferris, singing with his sweet voice while his talented fingers played on his guitar. Some remained quiet, sipping their mugs, listening, while others sang along with their  unbearable, hoarse voices, their noses beet-red from all the beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Ferris drank too, but he had to remain sober enough to entertain. The innkeeper, who thanked him greatly, claiming all these villagers came to see him perform (which was an exaggeration (though Ferris himself would have boasted this as well), for the town was rather large and they were celebrating another successful harvest before the bitter winter settled in), rewarded him handsomely, throwing in his daughter Edna as a bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she came willingly, for Ferris had seen her eye him while serving his drinks, occasionally showing slyly her cleavage. The minstrel wasn't quite sure why she was attracted to him. Sure, he was handsome to look at, clean-shaven with short, raven black hair, but he was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe guessed that she was one of those who liked her men on the corpulent side, which should come as no surprise in these parts of the land, for people were rather thick of waist around here. As Ferris lay in bed, he wasn't sure if he should owe the bountiful amount of food they had to a certain fairy tail that was spun around these parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome say this area was the place where the Lipomancer roamed, a legendary wizard who, strangely enough, like to fatten his victims. It was a good ghost story for parents to tell to their children, saying that the Lipomancer would catch them, make them so fat until they nearly drowned in their own blubber, and take them to his castle where he would eat them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ferris didn't believe in such nonsense. And it was high time that he got out of bed. Being a minstrel, he disliked staying in one place for very long, and would like to leave as quickly, and drawing very little attention to himself, as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe silently got out of bed, put on some clothes, a plain tunic and brown pants, gathered his belongings, and went for the door. Just as he was about to leave, he stopped and looked at the bed. Edna was still sleeping peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerris smiled. \"Perhaps I'll see you soon again, my love,\" he said, blowing her a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went downstairs, got his horse and was soon on the road again, following the large dirt road that led away from the town that was nestled in the bottom of a valley. The Autumn winds were kicking up fallen leaves and plucking a few from trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter was coming fast. Ferris could feel it, which meant that he had to find temporary shelter com these three months (he wondered if any lords were hiring), but for now the nights were mild and the days still warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out his guitar and began to sing.</span></div></div>",

Always a cheerful group, nothing was ever to come their way, until that fateful day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was going as usual. The sun shimmered in between the shoots as the hidden group lay peacefully among their roots. Usual chatter filled the air as one panda sit down for her morning snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another day in the forest\", the panda sighed with glee as she reached out her plump hand to grab some bamboo, \"Another day to eat without any worries.\" She placed the long green stick in her mouth and began to chew as her stomach growled. Reaching down with her free hand, she pat her belly, feeling the extra flesh as it jiggled in her lap. Like all the others, she was large, likely from her laziness and eating habits. Thighs that touched and shapely bottom just above them, comfortable for sitting on. Her arms were thick and hefty, and her chin was only surprisingly starting to double below her soft, welcoming face. But those weren't her biggest features. Just below her face sat a sizable chest lazily resting on her even larger belly. When she stood, it hung just a few inches over her waistline, more rounded in appearance with noticeable creases adding depth to her sides, and she was proud of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay down, stuffed, after eating so much, and almost passed out until... \"Lilly! Come look at this!\" Lilly slowly rose from her comfortable position, gradually walking over to the sound as she rubbed her stomach. \"What is mom?\", she asked curiously. \"Look down there, at the ground, the bamboo is growing so fast!\" Lilly bent down and looked at the ground, as the shoots shot up much faster than usual. \"What's going on?\" \"I don't know\", her mom grinned, \"It could be a blessing from the gods.\" Within a few minutes, there were many times the bamboo than before, the most plentiful the forest had ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they finished, both the large girls' stomachs growled with hunger. \"Who's gonna test the new snack first?\", she looked at Lilly as Lilly said-</span></div></div>",

I'm starving, and we need to figure out just how good this new meal really is! I'm ready to feast.\" Her mom took her place next to the freshly grown treats, picking at one and taking a bite. Almost as soon as she took a bite, her eyes shot wide open, making an approving grunt as she quickly went back in for more. Lilly watched as her mom picked up pace, eating faster than she ever had before. \"It sounds like you're enjoying it. Is it really that good?\", Lilly asked, but her mom was unable to answer with the amount of food she was shoving into her mouth. Something didn't seem right, and this was starting to concern Lilly. She stood up and stepped closer, and froze up at what she was witnessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom's gut started to expand, getting larger and more taught as she continued to stuff herself. She groaned in pain as she kept eating the bamboo, but she couldn't stop herself. Lilly stood there in shock as she watched her mom grow larger and larger. Once she regained her senses, she tried to shake her mom out of it, but nothing would work, and she was left to watch as her mother gorged herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoot after shoot, it found it's way into her gargantuan gut, forcing it to stretch to accommodate the newest piece of the meal. Her stomach stretched beyond her outstretched paws, and suddenly, it stopped. Lilly looked around only to realize her mom had eaten every single bamboo she could lay her hands on. She let out a belch before speaking to Lilly, \"I think that is the largest meal I've ever had\", she groaned as her stomach growled in pain, \"I think the new bamboo is cursed, Lilly. I don't know what came over me. How am I going to dig-\" Suddenly her stomach started gurgling, only leaving more confusion until it began to soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body started to grow and spread out as her stomach began shrinking as the fat started to redistribute itself all over. She watched as her legs spread out across the ground, and her backside stretching much further behind her, leaving her only able to sit as all the fat weighed her down. Her stomach shrank back down to just past her knees as her lower roll blanketed that half of her legs, still holding title as the largest part of her body, and as a larger rest for her bigger breasts. The tattered cloth over her chest and bottom were now well beyond shredded as she sat there, an even fatter form of her former self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly, you need to leave, this place is no longer safe.\" \"What do you mean?\" Lilly didn't want to hear those words. \"Look, Lilly. Just one bite and I've gorged myself worse than any other of our kind. Please go, before you end up like this, because I don't know when it's going to stop, if it's ever going to stop. Be one of the few that makes it out of here so you can find whatever angered the gods, and fix it. Please\" , here mother begged. She didn't want her child to suffer, something many parents never want. Lilly stood there, frozen, until she weakly muttered, \"Okay... Bye mom. I'll do this for you. I love you\", and after her mother wept, \"I love you too, sweetie\", she ran off before she could see any worse...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sorry about that, got a little carried away there Kami...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, you and your dramatics,\" The young elf girl huffed as she stopped outside her usual bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeet Kami, a young elf girl (still in her teens, so that's really young for an elf) known for her long sandy blonde hair (which was usually tied back into a pair of tails), short and petite body, and the usual scar on the side of her otherwise cute face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Way to emphasize on my figure,\" Kami sighed as she looked down at the tight, black leather vest, matching skirt, the several belts around her waist (which held her various kinds of weapons for her job) and the black cloak that she usually had to cover the rest of her attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever, just get the plot going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about this plot,\" Kami muttered rolling her eyes, making sure that those who walked by couldn't see her talking (after all, it looked like she was talking to herself). \"You only told me that there was a special job for me to take... What exactly am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust go, you'll find out from your usual informant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Kami muttered as she quickly turned and entered the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Kami was seated at a booth table, seated across from her was her usual contact, a rugged human named Genzo, a guy who didn't really care for his appearance save for the white fedora hat he had atop of his greasy black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Genzo,\" Kami started sipping on virgin Bloody Mary (she was only seventeen after all). \"What's this job you've got for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you're going to fall in love with me for this Kami,\" Genzo chuckled pulling out a small photograph from his jacket pocket. \"I got you a job that'll pay you a ton of dough for this if you're successful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenzo slid the picture across the table, allowing Kami to catch the picture, seeing a rather busty, yet slim, young cowgirl wearing a pair of overalls and a tight shirt that showed off her rather impressive curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Kami had a weird look on her face as she turned towards Genzo. \"Uh... You want me to off this cow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... Nope,\" Genzo chuckled wagging a finger. \"The girl in the picture named Sally, she dissappeared about a day and a half ago from a small village...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Kami questioned tossing the photo to the side. \"In case you forgot, while I do find people, I tend to kill them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait till I'm done,\" Genzo continued. \"You see, she disappeared yes, but rumors say that she was kidnapped and taken by... And get this, the infamous Lipomancer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKami nearly dropped her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those of you curious, while the Lipomancer was considered a legend, there were several accounts about his work, and there was evidence to it. Thanks to that, there was a large bounty on this infamous spellcaster if he was taken to any kingdom's head honcho alive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Or dead, it didn't really matter as long as the body was successfully retrieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You want me to go to that girl's village,\" Kami smirked as she cackled, catching her drink. \"And find the Lipomancer... Should be an easy job...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold up,\" Genzo coughed holding his hand up. \"There are a few conditions that you should know about. One, make sure you find Sally, and bring her back to the village. For a dirt town, there's actually quite a bulky reward if she comes back alive and in semi-mint condition. Turns out she's the gem of that dirt town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, you should be careful... You're not the first girl to go after this Lipomancer. If it looks like you're getting in over your head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Kami interrupted before she drained the rest of the virgin bloody mary down her throat. \"Just give me the information, and I'll get started on the job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenzo sighed loudly as he produced an envelope, \"There's a stage coach leaving in thirty minutes. It'll get you to the village before the sun comes up tomorrow... I suggest you get some sleep before you do your head-hunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Genzo,\" Kami announced as she jumped from her seat, snatching the envelope. \"You'll get your cut as soon as I get back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... If you get back, promise me a date...\" Genzo chuckled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to get a punch upside his head, courtesy of Kami.</span></div></div>",

Apparently Sally had moved from the family's mansion in a rebelious action (something about a boy or whatever) and was working in the village at a farm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the important information was Sally's last known whereabouts, the woods at the edge of the village where Sally usually napped when she was slacking off from work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit later, Kami was standing at the edge of the woods... And aside from a few scratch marks on some of the trees and a pair of empty buckets thrown to the side, there wasn't a lot to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, sitting on a stump near the edge of the woods, Kami sighed loudly, her back to the woods... Unaware of a small creeping vine that slithered along the ground at the base of the stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a bust,\" Kami growled placing her hands at her small chin. \"I'm willing to bet that cow just ran off like a spoiled little girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines slowly began to crawl up Kami's boots, the petite elf not even noticing...</span></div></div>",

If this is the Lipomancer's base, he certainly isn't that creative of a spellcaster... Oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure she had one of her small daggers in her hands, Kami slowly began to walk around the moat, noticing that the castle was quite large, and seemed to have several low towers and windows. There was even a moment she thought she saw a shifting shadow moving around in one of the windows... But immediately dismissed it as a ragged curtain or something of that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the hot headed, petite elf girl came to the lowered drawbridge of the castle, tightening her grip on the dagger she kept concealed. 'The front door? Number one rule of assassins, don't be seen...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Kami nodded to herself as she turned around, unaware of a creepy shadowed figure who watched her from the woods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and at the back of the castle, Kami had pocketed her dagger and produced a grappling hook from her belt (interestingly enough, it was once enough to kill one of her targets, but it still had its practical purposes...). And since there appeared to be an open window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLANK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Kami hissed as she immediately swung over the moat and began to climb towards the opened window. Moments later, the young elf crept into the room... Which seemed to be a well lavished bedroom with several lush furniture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And a bed that seemed to be able to fit over ten people on at a time. \"... Yeesh, at least he keeps it clean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKami quickly held her breath as she heard footsteps echoing through the hallway outside the room, immediately she ran into the nearby closet, nearly closing it so that she could see that whoever was walking into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the door to the room opened up to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was almost a dead ringer for the cow girl in that picture. Same hairstyle, same face, and much to Kami's cargin - She had the same dynamite figure that she secretly wished she had. Although, looking a little closer, Kami noticed that the cow girl seemed to be a bit thicker around the middle and thighs... And of course the overalls seemed to strain over the enlarged melons that the girl had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Is this the same girl?</i>' Kami thought as she continued to watch the cow girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the thick cow girl took in the sights of the room before she turned back towards the door.

Only for seconds later to stumble back, revealing a large feedbag was strapped to her mouth, and it was visibly shown that the girl was chewing on whatever food was in the feedbag.

Unable to remove the feedbag, she had no choice to chew and eat while Sally watched.

She felt her pants getting tighter and tighter, her belly swelling to form a muffin top over her pants yet still growing even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good five minutes till the feed bag ran out of food and detached itself from her, slipping away back into the depths of the castle.

Did you meet him?\u201d Sally asked, her curiosity getting the better of her to Kami\u2019s annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026who?\u201d Kami asked grumpily, eyebrow rising as she fluffed a pillow: It was just as soft as the bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 just\u2026 a neighbor of mine\u2026 he\u2019s very nice and he cares about me a lot I think!\u201d The cowgirl looked away from the elf, a dreamy look spreading over her features as she blushed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there was a boy then, and she seemed to be rather enraptured with him, enough so to do something ridiculous like throw away her parent\u2019s money. This definitely had to be the Sally she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026. Whatchya doing over there\u2026?\u201d The blond bovine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKami frowned groggily, \u201cWas thinking of taking a nap actually\u2026 I know this place is dangerous, and it might not be the best idea, but I\u2019m running on very little sleep and these beds are just so nice\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally yawned and nodded in understanding.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The limber black cat, with a stripe of white across her belly, wore skintight clothing she had paid for an enchantment on. They acted like a mix of armor and rubber, stretching to her form, able to take a lot of stress without ripping, and very intolerant to attacks no matter how sharp the blade. Known as the Blackest Night by her peers for her ability to sneak into and out of areas leaving only empty rooms and the occasional guard with a slit throat, she was one of the best rogues in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi headed to her new target after hearing a discussion at a local tavern about a \"temple stuffed to the brim with treasure.

It was her favorite thing in the entire world, to have money, and the fact that she had to work for it made getting it even better. The idea of piles upon piles of riches, gems, scepters, jewelry, all of which she dredged up and made off with herself, made her positively wet. And to think that this place, within it\u2019s halls, was purported to hold more treasure than all the rest combined, well, to put it lightly, it made her want to warn the nearest town of floods, because she was about to cum a tsunami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was so clouded by thoughts of riches and grandeur, that she failed to keep in mind the first and most basic rule of thievery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDON\u2019T GO IN THE FRONT DOOR. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDON\u2019T. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDO NOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDUMB. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut god rest her soul, all she was thinking about was the pile of gold and silver awaiting her. Thinking so hard about it, in fact, that as Mimi stepped inside those glistening arched halls, she completely failed to notice the golem rushing at her from her left flank screaming drunken obscenities about why 2+2 equalling 4 was a crock of shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he beaned her across the face with a sausagey fist, he changed the subject to his favorite romance novel. Then he changed the subject to nothing, because golems can only form thought for so long before getting bored and doing something else. Anyway, more to the point, Mimi was now on an all-expenses-paid trip to the quaint village of Knocked The Fuck Out, which means that we will predictably cut away for a while and come back to her later. Parcheesi, anyone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Mimi felt was the cold. Wherever she was, it was dank. Wet. Shivery. The first thing she heard was the rattling of the chains that shackled her to the table as she attempted to shake out of them. And the first thing she saw was him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a dark, tall, imposing figure, hooded, bleak. He didn\u2019t look nice at all, but that was probably to be inferred by the fact that he had locked a women in his dungeon. Mimi began to say something, but before she could, he cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to steal from me? Trying to, break into my home, take my belongings, add ever more to that burgeoning pile of spoils lying in your pitiful little shack?\u201d he said, snarking. \u201cWell, honestly, I would have to thank you. And I thought tonight would be boring!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis earlier sarcasm had turned to a fiendish, sick sort of joy. Mimi was immensely confused, and a due bit scared as well. Just what was this man planning? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the way you people think. Thieves, rogues, whatever the name, I know what you\u2019re like. Your personality can be summed up in one word. Do you know what that word is?\u201d he asked, leaning in a bit to meet her gaze, but not enough for her to get a clear look at his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The word is more. More, more, more. More, more, more for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had returned to his earlier condescending snark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think that for all of your trouble, you deserve more. The best kind of more, the closest kind. More YOU. More YOU than you could ever hope to handle!\u201d He was shouting now, his tone a mixture of passionate anger and a sort of childlike excitement, and as he said this, he drew from his robe a single slice of Black Forest Cake, and he shoved it into Mimi\u2019s mouth more quickly than she saw him reach for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was the best goddamn thing she had ever tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery thought she had, every escape plan she was plotting out, every way to make this guy pay for tying her up... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvaporated. Replaced with pure exstacy. She couldn\u2019t think of anything else but tasting something, anything that tasted as good as that. And her captor was happy to oblige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookies, cake, sausage, ribs, all disappeared in instants down Mimi\u2019s gullet. And, not by coincidence, reappeared in her ever growing gut. What, hours before, had been a perfectly flat washboard of a stomach, was currently slowly and ominously swelling outward, the thin strip of white fur across her belly stretching ever larger. As food of every variety was shoved down her throat, her slender body began to grow, her enchanted jumpsuit attempting to keep up as best it could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Mimi noticed, or even cared. The only thing on her mind was the food. Give it to me, all of it! More, more, more. The minutes disappeared into hours as her dizzied stupor continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, where am I, Mimi thought, coming to. The world was spinning, a blur. Make it stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld, stop spinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s rude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, why can\u2019t I move? Oh, right, I\u2019m still in that creepy dungeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the when Mimi snapped the fuck out of it and woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d she shouted to nobody in particular. \u201cYOU BETTER LET ME OUT OF HERE OR I\u2019LL... I\u2019ll...\u201d Her voice trailed off as she began to look herself over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that looking herself over was particularly hard, because there was so much of her to look at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lithe abdomen had ballooned into a corpulent belly, a massive ball of marmalade that helped a new pair of beach ball sized breasts weigh her down to the table, still chained there as she was. The stripe of fur she bore there now looked more like a blob, a blob of white floating in a sea of black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower half of her body fared no better, legs of lard and an ass with cheeks bigger than some people, but she couldn\u2019t exactly get shocked at that, seeing as she couldn\u2019t see them past her gut. No, that was enough for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there with mouth agape in total disbelief over what she had become for what felt like hours, when who came sauntering in but the bastard who made it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cEnjoying the new you?\u201d he said sarcastically, straining himself as he dragged something large in with him. \u201cYOU!\u201d Mimi screamed hysterically. \u201cYOU DID THIS TO ME! CHANGE ME BACK RIGHT NOW!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man tore the tarp off the large object he dragged in to reveal a massive glass tube full of some kind of brown liquid. \u201cOh, but we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d he said as he ominously lifted up a hose. Mimi\u2019s fat face went from anger to paralyzed nervousness in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cmew...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tell a lot of stories about that creepy old castle up north. About how the master is some kind of fat-bending mage, about all of the \u2018foolish adventures \u2018to fall into his grasp. I always liked the one about the cat girl he caught one day tryin\u2019 to rip him off. Locked her up in his dungeon. Think it was a poem, actually, lemme see if I can remember it... Oh yeah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere once was a catgirl named Mimi.<br>\r\nShe was strong, steadfast and greedy.<br>\r\nShe met with a fright<br>\r\nWhen her clothes got real tight<br>\r\nCause she got caught by a guy, he was seedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe locked her up in a dungeon<br>\r\nCause see, she couldn\u2019t outrun him<br>\r\nShe tried to steal<br>\r\nSo he made her a meal<br>\r\nThat just kept comin\u2019 and comin\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fed her cookies, and pies, and cake<br>\r\nAnd her jumpsuit, it started to break<br>\r\nCame apart at the seams<br>\r\nBecause custards and creams<br>\r\nPoured down her throat in a lake<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly grew to be massive<br>\r\nAnd she then grew to be passive<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t care anymore<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t fit through the door<br>\r\nSo escape, she couldn\u2019t have had it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome say she lays down there<br>\r\nStuck in neverending despair<br>\r\nShe\u2019s gotten so big<br>\r\nShe used to be such a twig<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo perhaps we should leave her a prayer</span></div></div>",

He wore the garb of a druid, a hooded white robe that reached from his shoulders to his knees with regular clothing underneath, a large white cloth shirt and stretchy cloth pants. He was handsome but unremarkable, and appeared to have a large money bag with him. Mimi sensed an easy steal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretending to stretch, she pulled a knife from the back of her shirt, and hid it behind her arm. Slowly sauntering over the dog, she asked \"And who would you be, stopping me from an easy raid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky threw out a hand, and Mimi's knife flew out of her hand, landing harmlessly 15 feet away. \"First of all, lady, you're not killing and robbing me, especially when I'm giving you a hand right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's J.T.

Trying to turn, the walls around you would close, and the room would fill with gas. You'd be knocked out, and when you awoke, you'd be strapped to a large banquet chair. A chute in front of your face would pour a mixture of the most fattening potions ever made into your mouth. You'd gain about 400 pounds in minutes flat. Finally, you'd be dumped back at the entrance with nothing to your name but a quarter ton of blubber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily for the both of us, this temple's qualities had been made clear to me by a few... let's just say these women had a lot more to love. Making my way through here, I was stopped by a few different people- a wolf who looked as if she'd been made to eat an entire pig, a cowgirl who appeared to have about 7 glandular problems, and an elf female who had about 17 love handles on each hip. Each warned me of this temple's qualities. It's the prize possession of one called the Lipomancer, who enjoys making a game out of his dungeons. The traps in here aren't deadly in most cases; they're weighty, as in weight-gainy. He likes to fatten people up. If you're going in there, I'm helping you out. While those women who assisted me had... VERY deserving qualities when I... \"consensually repaid\" them, I couldn't stand to see a beautiful wench like yourself needing to go up about two dozen sizes. I'd like to try my luck as well; as you could see, I wore my loosest garb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your chivalry, Mr. Templa, you crazy horndog.

She had always worked as a loner- not because she didn't like people, but because she could never find anyone competent to deal with. They'd always bumble, or fail, and she'd end up framing them for one of her treasure hauls. But this Templa guy seemed different. He seemed a bit full of himself, true, but he seemed quick on his feet and intelligent. And a bit cute, she ventured. If it worked out, she thought, maybe they could team up. \"And if not, there's always the quick blade to the throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog had padded off to the left side of the building, so Mimi hurried around her side. Along the brick wall, there seemed to be about 6 entrances. Three wooden doors, each with a small number carved in the side- respectively a 1, 5 and 100; two large windows, one reachable by one person, the other requiring a boost of teamwork on the second floor- and a basement cellar. Oddly, none were locked as far as she could tell. She quickened her pace before running into Templa on the back side. He had been resting against the back wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half a dozen entrances of varying sizes and types.

The cellar seemed normal, just a barren room. About half the size of the building itself, it expanded out both ways from them, with a large staircase about 500 paces ahead leading up into the normal room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there's our path-\" Mimi began to say. However, a large metal noise cut her off. In front of the two, a large machine appeared, decloaking from an invisibility spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine began to whir its motor, and as it did a large splash of dirty-appearing water started to flood into the room. Flowing at the rate of a vacuum in reverse, the liquid quickly spread over the surface of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make a break for it!\" J.T. yelled. The two furries sprang into action towards the cellar stairs. However, the machine had different ideas. As they came close to it, it began to whirl two nozzles towards them, each spilling out more of the water. Mimi opened her mouth to say something, but before she could, SPLASH! The nozzle's aim hit her square in the face. Sputtering, she swallowed some of the murky water. \"Hey, this isn't water, it's-\" SPLAT, another burst in the mouth. \"It's chocolate-flavored!\" she spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know-\" J.T. too was cut off in midsentence by a splash of water in his muzzle. The two continued to run until Mimi slipped and fell face-first into the knee-high drink. The nozzle reached her in its pursuit and grabbed her legs, wrapping around them like a snake. It spread around her body until closing in on her muzzle, where the water directed itself right down her throat. As J.T. diverted his course to her, her belly quickly inverted, clearing her abs away for a small gut. Once her stomach reached capacity, the tubes suddenly dropped her to the ground harmlessly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nonly to turn and hit J.T. He was wrapped up quickly, but the nozzle only had time to put a little liquid into his stomach before a panting Mimi sliced it in half with a knife. With this, the machine gave a defeated whir and collapsed into a pile of scraps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you were right...\" Mimi trailed off, poking her bloated belly.</span></div></div>",

I am the Lipomancer, and you have broken into my fortress. Although, instead of killing you thieves, I think we'll play a little game instead.

I'll even be nice enough to send a map your way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his words, a sheet of parchment appeared in front of the two. The extended paper ran about four feet long, two wide, and had floor plans of all seven (eight, with the basement) levels. The different rooms were labeled as well; some with T, some with S, and three with PH. Of course, only half of the map was labeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're mobile by the time you get up here, we'll have a meeting on your reward. Otherwise, too-de-loo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you might be wondering what just happened. That machine was meant to separate the various liquids flowing through the fortress, but it broke down one too many times. I decided to modify it. You both just got stuffed with fattening liquids. It's a handicap you get for entering the easiest way. I can see the cat got filled to the brim with the stuff, but the dog in the robe only got a splash. I'd say it's about 5 pounds per splash, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shot each other looks and glanced at their bodies. Templa's single splash led to a quick spurt around his body, but the 5 pounds did nothing noticeable to his 150-lb frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mimi not only got a lot of the water, but she wasn't too big to begin with. Her lithe 120-pound frame began to quake. Her bloated belly shrank in on itself for a moment, only to jut out further with fat. Her entire body, covered with the stretchy black cloth, began to expand outward. She was helpless as her chest and gut expanded outward about 3 inches, her arms thickened some, but her thighs took the brunt of the damage- they each rounded out two or three inches. The clothing began to stretch, and a faint strip of her white belly became visible around the end of the shirt and the start of the waistband. She seemed to gain 40 pounds in the instant. She began to cry, and was once again cut off by the Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, there's more where that came from. Good luck, kiddies!\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, she caught site of her newly acquired paunch, and had to fight back fresh tears all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your hurry anyways!\" She snapped at the impatient husky, still sniffling as she wiped her eyes with a pudgy arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine barely acknowledged her, looking back briefly as he continued to run forward towards the tunnel ahead, \"Hey, my fine figure took a hit as well, but we don't have time to stand around feeling sorry about a inch or to added to the waist.

All of a sudden, he bolted down the tunnel towards the shrinking entrance, with a startled catgirl following close behind, screaming out warnings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! You don't know what's down here! You damn stupid mutt, STOP!\" Yet she was still right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi was even more startled when he did stop, nearly falling over as he barked in what sounded like pain. She was puzzled until she felt a sharp pinching in her side, instantly stopping and reaching for whatever the hell hit her. She gabbed at her chubby thigh and pulled out a small dark, black liquid still oozing out the tip. She looked up and saw J.T. was doing the same with the one that had hit him on the shoulder. Yet after a brief examination, he merely shrugged it off and tossed the dart aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?! Are you nuts dog! We walked right into that, it could kill us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I'm not dying for nothing!\" He called back to her as he ducked beneath the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing she could do was follow him in. Besides, if she was going to die, she'd want to do it in the company gold coins and precious gems than out in this cold, dark tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet what she saw as she entered the room beyond the door wasn't a treasure trove, and it definitely was not cold, in fact, it had a warm cozy feeling. It was a gigantic banquet hall, filled with tables stretching as far as she could see. And as if that wasn't incredible enough, each table was overflowing with food, everything from thick, spicy sausage to warm cherry pie. It was a feast that could literally feed an entire city... if not two, maybe even a nation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be an illusion...\" She said, simply awestruck by the size of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohnathan picked up an apple, brushed it off upon his robe, then took a bite, \"No, it's very real...\" He said swallowing, then taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi looked from the apple to the rest of the food, walking down the length of the closest table and examining what it had to offer. Meanwhile, J.T. had already finished the apple, and was picking up a rather large turkey leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J.T., don't you think that can wait? I mean we already brought some food along and we should keep moving, it looks like there's no treasure... here...\" She was interrupted by her stomach grumbling in protest to her, demanding food, \"Then again... I am hungry... one bite, that's it...\" She wasn't sure whether she was talking to the dogboy or herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she was talking to him, Johnathan wasn't paying attention, he was too busy stuffing his muzzle feverishly, not even caring as his robe became stained with juices and sauce, grabbing a massive jug of wine and chugging it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi saw this and began to worry, yet all her common sense was soon drowned out as she suddenly clutched her belly in pain, \"I'm... I'm... what's wrong with me... I'm... STARVING!\" She roared as she leapt upon a nearby ham and sunk her sharp, feline teeth into it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the potion that had been so suddenly introduced into their bloodstreams took effect, the stone door finally sealed shut with a grim thump, falling on ears of those too lost in gluttony to notice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin his dark chamber at the top of the tower,, the Lipomancer grinned wickedly. He placed his hands upon his crystal globe as he watched the two doomed adventurers consume mindlessly, lost in the thralls of his toxin. They ate and ate and ate, growing larger and larger before his eyes as food was turned to blubber, rolls formed, tripled, then quadrupled, and clothes tore to shreds: He couldn't help but to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought they'd actually make some progress into my little abode... looks like I was wrong, but how can I complain? It's such a delicious ending...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe howled with laughter, leaning back, kicking up his feet as he waited for some other naive explorers to fall for his trap, passing the time as he watched the two who already had eat their way towards their heavy fate.</span></div></div>",

Her chubby frame masked the pure hatred flowing through her veins. \"Templa, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We go up the stairs, Mimi.\" The husky was motivated. \"I feel awful about this, and I think I know it's going to be us or him. I'm on your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, dawg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that the insulting form or the slang form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky led the charge up the staircase and out of the basement. The top of the stairs held a small doorway with two doors. One simply said SUMO, while the other said SGAL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know what one of those means,\" J.T. said, turning toward Mimi and away from the doors. \"The other, I have no clue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BETTER THE DEVIL YOU KNOW, THEN,\" screamed a voice from inside the door marked SUMO. Before J.T. could react, the husky was snatched by a massive black-furred figure that blasted from inside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi ran inside the SUMO door to find a medium-sized room. At one end was a traditional sumo ring, the other held Mimi's husky friend in a makeshift prison attached to what appeared to be a strange obstacle course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Lipomancer's voice filled the air. \"Well well, I see Mr. Sanchez has made a decision for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi began to ask \"Who's Mr. Sanchez?\", but before she could begin pronouncing the surname the same voice from before boomed from atop J.T.'s makeshift prison, a fenced-in square covered by a glass ceiling where the husky had been forced into a silver suit. What appeared to be a black-furred creature ended up being a sleek-furred black skunk in a mawashi, weighing about 350 pounds, standing atop the cage. \"CAT, YOU WILL GUIDE THE DOG THROUGH THE SUMO COURSE. HE MUST COMPLETE THE COURSE AND DEFEAT ME IN BATTLE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you always have to yell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY VOICE WAS CURSED BY THE LIPOMANCER. HE SAID I SOUNDED TOO PRETTY, SO HE MADE IT SO I SCREAM EVERYTHING I SAY. BUT HEY, I LIKE BEING A SUMO SKUNK, SO SUE ME.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this suit about, anyway,\" asked the husky from the cage, \"is it magic or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES, DOG. IT'S SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE SUMO COURSE. DUDE'S GOT MAGIC ALL OVER THE PLACE. IF YOU EAT ANYTHING IT INSTANTLY GETS CONVERTED INTO FAT. SPEAKING OF WHICH-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk lifted a side of the prison. As he did so, the strange obstacle course pulled itself into place. Its common theme, which neither Mimi or Jon had noticed, was of food. Specifically, cake. Suddenly, it became clear: the obstacles were food, which launched even more food directly toward the competitor's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENJOY THE CAKE. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU IN THE RING.\" The sumo skunk climbed off the cage and sauntered over to the sumo ring, awaiting his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempla opened his mouth to talk back but found his speech halted by a gob of triple chocolate cake. A slow flurry of cake began to rain directly upon the silver-suited husky, who gasped for air after swallowing his first piece only to find a second, even bigger hunk of quintuple-fudge quickly following it down his windpipe. Beginning to run into the obstacle course, the dog called out for help from the cat. \"Mimi *gulp* help! *gulp*\" he cried, each swallow a major cheat on his diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cat surveyed the course, she checked to see how Jon was doing. Yep, the silver suit was doing what the skunk said it would. Even though Jon had only eaten about half a cake, his gut was two inches thick, his arms and legs' thickness slowly growing.  But the course was about to change, and as Mimi told Jon to get ready to jump, the cake stopped attacking. The husky hit his stride as he lept off a sudden decline, only to find himself falling into a pool of green water that appeared to be about Olympic-sized. His extra twenty pounds betrayed the husky as he prepared for impact, a planned dive falling off-center to instead form a spectacular belly flop. Dazed for a moment, Jon accidentally took in a gulp of the off-color water, which he immediately knew was a bad idea. The effect was instantaneous. The silver suit suddenly stretched around an immediate gain of about fifty pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swim, Jon, swim,\" Mimi cried, \"you can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog regained composure and quickly began to swim across the pool, lapping it quickly and reaching the stairs. \"What's next, Mimi?\", he asked as he began to climb out. \"There's only one more obstacle, take a second to breathe and then keep going,\" the cat called. \"Sounds good,\" Templa replied, pausing at the top of the stairs to lean on their armrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the wrong move. Instead of holding his weight, the armrest immediately broke in two, sending Jonathan into a surprised backwards tumble back into the water. The sheer surprise of the armrest's treachery left the husky off-balance and confused, not remembering to take a breath until he was already half-submerged. He sputtered in the water, trying to avoid drinking any more of the fattening drink, but it instead sent more down his windpipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi winced as she watched the dog slink out of the water a few seconds later, embarrassed and all-around fat. What a way to have a setback, she thought to herself as she viewed the damage. Jon's gut was now pronounced, though his arms and legs had swelled. Though it wasn't covered by the suit, Jon's face wasn't immune to the gain, two and a half chins and some incredibly chubby cheeks now resting where his skinny face once had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this over with,\" the now-300-pound husky muttered half to himself as he waddled toward the final obstacle. It was... a chair. \"There's no way I'm sitting in this,\" Jon thought to himself. As he tried to walk past it, it appeared he didn't have a choice; an unseen force pulled his fat tush into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA card with five questions appeared in Mimi's hand. She began to read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHELLO, MIMI<br>\r\nSKUNK HERE, THROUGH MAGIC<br>\r\nSO YOUR BOYFRIEND OVER THERE IS ALMOST READY TO FIGHT ME<br>\r\nTHE REST IS UP TO YOU<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQUESTION 1<br>\r\nWHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE CANDY<br>\r\nQUESTION 2<br>\r\nWHAT ARE YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS<br>\r\nQUESTION 3<br>\r\nWHY ARE YOU WITH THE DOG<br>\r\nQUESTION 4<br>\r\nSWEETS OR MEATS?<br>\r\nQUESTION 5<br>\r\nDO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN HIM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSINCERELY, SUMO SKUNK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Mimi was perplexed. \"Answer the questions, dummy,\" the skunk said, having snuck up on Mimi. He handed her a pen. \"By the way, the benefits here aren't bad. You know, for when he offers the package.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She had no idea what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you'll learn,\" he said. He then wandered back to the sumo ring, ready for Templa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... answer the questions,\" Templa said, still sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFavorite candy? Um... I'll go with caramel, Mimi thought to herself, writing the answer quickly. A thirty-six pack of inch-thick caramel candies appeared in front of the dog. An invisible force began to thrust the candies into Templa's waiting, unwilling mouth every five seconds, each one adding a pound to his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion two, she quickly thought, hoping the candy wouldn't do much harm. \"Hopes and dreams? To get out of this dungeon,\" she thought, answering the question. \"Correct,\" the card scrawled in reply. Turning to the third, she thought for a moment. Should she answer honestly? At the same time, Templa's force-feeding had concluded, his frame now showing close to the thick, fatassed build of the skunk. He carried it well, though, she thought. It was true; his strong frame could hold some weight, she thought. And the suit, which was now beginning to truly stretch? Mm. \"I like him,\" she wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, crush?\", the card replied. \"Just joshin. Finish up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion four: sweets, she said. Has to be sweets. As she wrote down her answer, a vat full of a thick ice-cream candy mix apparated, the tube pouring into Templa's mouth for thirty seconds. Each gulp of potent, calorie-laden fat made Templa's gut swell, his 360 pounds becoming 380, 400, then 420 pounds before the vat disappeared to wherever it started. At this point, the dog was a level past obese, his white, wide gut, tree-trunk thighs and puffy arms making Mimi almost forget his recent past as a skinny puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final question. Did she see herself in Templa? She looked him over. He was still full of anger and confidence despite his fluffy exterior. He was driven for revenge, just like her. \"Yes,\" she wrote. With a gasp, her middle felt strange; the forty pounds she had gained suddenly disappeared, then immediately reappeared on Templa, whose suit doubled its effect. From 420 to 500 pounds, the wide mutt sighed, relieved that his bout with the skunk, and his first shot at revenge, was close at hand. The skunk was waiting for him; whatever Mimi just did to him could wait for now.</span></div></div>",

Well then,\" he said through a grin, \"let's see what's through Door Number 1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door itself was locked, but Mimi found it no challenge to pick the simple thing into compliance, and the door creaked open into what appeared to be a simple stone antechamber, lit up by simple torches. There was nothing else inside the room but another door, larger and made of thick iron. The duo skulked inside, examining the forbidding portal before them. In the middle of the door there was the image of a corpulent human woman's face, her mouth open as though waiting to receive something. Mimi bent down, looking inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's some sort of mechanism... Maybe a lock of some sort. But it doesn't have any tumblers that I can see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the wooden door, and their only escape to the outside world vanished, melding into the stone. J.T. whipped around, and slammed his fists on the hard stone wall where the door used to be. \"It's a trap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA commanding, self-assured voice sounded out from thin air in reply, reverberating through the room. \"Yes. A trap you blindly walked into, like so many other idiot adventurers have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, fools, to my lair! The Lair of the Lipomancer! You have come here seeking material gain... And so I shall give it to you! Perhaps you noticed the number on the door, and chose it due to being the smallest one out of the three. Fools that you are, you never realized that the number could stand for a single unit of great quantity! The only way to escape this room is to suck on the lips of the beautiful iron face before you. Doing so shall activate a mechanism that will drain a solution of my own devising from a hidden container in the walls and into your mouth. This container holds enough of my solution to induce a weight gain of one TON! How fortunate for you that there are two of you... Perhaps you can split it! Not that it will make any difference in the long run! And if you choose NOT to drink... Hohohoho... Well. Let's just say that you'll wish you had. If you make it past here, seek me at the highest point of my fortress, that I might give you your 'reward'! Until then!

None of your porkers squeal about this one when you were fooling around with them?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!

She was beginning to think she had found something, but stopped pressing at whatever it was when she heard a sudden, loud whirring coming from above. J.T.\u2019s ears perked and Mimi\u2019s fur prickled as they both looked up at the ceiling for a moment. Seconds later the catgirl shouted in shock as her arms were pulled into the mouth up to her elbows and the sound of rushing air filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ.T.!

I\u2019m sure a \u201cgentleman\u201d like you was all too happy to oblige...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.T. scoffed, \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I've had plenty of women, thin <i>and</i> plump, more than just those today! I doubt it will matter anyways, it seems like you'll be in need of some comforting soon enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! There\u2019s no way either of us aren't sharing this load. Think about it J.T., you think either of us would be able to carry a ton of fat gracefully? We\u2019re going to need to be in shape\u2026 or at least as fit as we <i>can</i> be if we\u2019re going to make it to the treasure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I don\u2019t think you two will have to worry about sharing much longer!\u201d The Lipomancer\u2019s disembodied voice cackled once more before a loud, metallic thrumming was heard coming from the door in front of them. As the two treasure-hunters watched, the corpulent face in the middle of the steel portal began to morph, slowly stretching apart and then reforming into two identical faces, each equally spaced upon the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d Mimi said, her voice shaky, \u201cIs this so we can divide the ton of weight more easily between ourselves\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not you foolish girl!\u201d The Lipomancer replied with unrestrained glee and malice, \u201cSince the two of you seemed so content with trying to find a way to avoid my ingenious little trap, I have decided that you both must gain one ton each! Unless that is\u2026 One of you wishes to devour all of the liquid, though I wouldn't suggest it... Otherwise, good luck deciding!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair you bastard!\u201d J.T. barked in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is mongrel! I told you if you chose not to drink that there\u2019d be consequences! I warned you, you dog!\u201d The Lipomancer cackled once more before his voice faded away like an echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u2026 J.T., you said you\u2019re a druid right? Is there any magic or something you can do that\u2019ll get us out of here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky boy stood still for a moment, rubbing his chin with his paw whilst thinking\u2026       </span></div></div>",

Please!\u201d J.T. cried out in panic as he backed away from the seriously pissed off woman, \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re overreacting?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThere\u2019s only one way out now, thanks to you!\u201d She hissed as she stepped closer to him, keeping the knife pointed in his direction the entire time as she held the other one behind her, \u201cAnd I've trained too hard to get such a perfect body! You\u2019re going to drink it all or die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.T.\u2019s eyes widened in shock, and Mimi felt a rush of guilt as she realized this was not what he had been expecting at all, \u201cAre you serious right now? Mimi, think about what you\u2019re saying! I can\u2019t drink it all; I won\u2019t be able to move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry J.T., but it was your decision, \u201c She said grimly, her grip on her blade not wavering in the slightest, \u201cAnd it\u2019s better that one of us can stay in shape and avoid any other traps than both of us being reduced to clumsily waddling through a dangerous fortress\u2026 You got me into this mess, and you\u2019re getting me out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to stuff me and leave me to die like a barbaric sacrifice then!?\u201d He growled at her, \u201cOr do you expect to be able to move me once I weigh more than a herd of cattle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we can figure that out later, now get drinking mutt,\u201d She said, smiling, \u201cUnless you\u2019d prefer to die now, rather than <i>maybe</i> dying later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.T. sighed before shrugging as if in defeat. Mimi smiled even more, that is until she felt his foot swiftly connect with her paw, a quick kick knocking the dagger from her hand, \u201cWhat th-?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Mimi could even say anything, the husky was already charging towards her with his elbow raised. Luckily for the rogue however, her feline reflexes allowed her to dodge just before he would have knocked the wind out of her; the cat landing nimbly on her feet as she threw her extra knife into the air to catch it in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could bring it to bear against her attacker however, the husky was already following up his charge with a sweeping kick. Once more Mimi found herself jumping into the air just before he struck, barely dodging the attack on her footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty impressive, for a druid!\u201d She quipped, smiling as she was beginning to enjoy this dance of conflict, \u201cI didn't know they taught you guys to do much more than petting trees and hugging squirrels!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky growled as the rogue brought her claws into the fray, their sharp tips grazing lightly against his face before he backed up against a wall, \u201cThere\u2019s plenty for you to learn when you\u2019re not busy lusting after other peoples\u2019 coin\u2026\u201d He barked back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored the comment, too caught up in the moment as she saw him pinned against the wall. This could be the perfect time to act, but then again if she was careful, he might make even bigger mistakes. Besides, it was rare for her to be part of such a challenging straight-up fight\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Mimi was swinging her knife in a slashing arc towards the canine, all she found herself hitting was bare wall, her steel weapon clanging loudly against the hard stone.

Immediately she gagged, trying desperately to spit it all out, trying as hard as she could to pull away, but found she was unable to. As her groggy mind cleared, she could feel the paw on the back of her head holding her head firmly against the door as another soothingly rubbed her throat. She tried struggling once more, but it felt like something more held her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Hold still you stupid cat!\u201d She heard J.T. plead from behind her, \u201cI think you\u2019re almost finished with the second lock, and then I can finally get out of this damn room\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dSecond lock?!</i> Mimi thought to herself, her heart racing with realization, <i>\u201dBut that means\u2026!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi struggled even more fiercely now, but it felt almost impossible just to move her arms, almost as though they were bound in heavy iron shackles. She grunted against the constant flow of gooey liquid as her breath grew short from her exertions and she felt just how much the druid\u2019s paw was sinking into the flesh of her chins and neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, chins?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just tiring yourself out thief!\u201d The husky chuckled as he patted her head, \u201cJust keep drinking and maybe I\u2019ll be kind enough to come back for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi furrowed her brow in anger as she tried to look back at him, but that proved just as futile as fighting his grip, so she gave in and kept drinking from the door. Fortunately enough, J.T. was right, and it wasn't much longer before the flow turned into a soft trickle and then ceased completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth adventurers\u2019 ears perked as suddenly a loud metallic clanging could be heard inside the doors and around them. J.T. looked about as he let go of Mimi\u2019s head and throat, and the cat girl was finally able to pull away. She gasped and wheezed as she tried to stand up, but found it physically impossible for reasons she was dreading she already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thankfully momentarily distracted from her current condition however as she caught sight of the mighty iron gate before them creaking open. The two faces parted as the doors revealed the dark, stone hall beyond them. Before Mimi could look too closely however, her vision was blocked by her husky \u201cfriend\u201d, the dog still as skinny as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then Mimi, it was fun travelling with you as little as I did, but I'm afraid it is now time for us to part\u2026 Don\u2019t worry my dear, I\u2019ll split some of the wealth with you, but that all depends on how forgiving you are and whether or not you want to kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mimi once more felt his paws sinking into her now much softer flesh, and felt a rush of dizziness as the dog rolled her off her belly and onto her padded back as he continued talking, \u201cYes I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in no shape to follow me, sadly\u2026 But that doesn't mean I\u2019m not willing to share with my new friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi hissed at him as she felt his paws grasp her shoulders, the canine grunting with great effort as he hefted her into a sitting position, \u201cYes\u2026! But\u2026 hnnngh\u2026! Of course\u2026 I\u2019d have to cut your share\u2026. Nnnf\u2026 quite small!\u201d He sighed as he finally sat the now gigantic catgirl up and walked around to her front once more, dusting off his  paws, \u201cAfter all, I think 2% is a fair price to pay you for sitting on your ass while I\u2019m neck deep in danger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helpless rogue growled furiously before spitting at the husky boy, the bit of saliva landing harmlessly at his feet, \u201cOh come now girl, I\u2019m not the one who tried to kill their partner, now am I? You were going to do the <i>exact</i> same to me!\u201d He replied as he walked around to her other side and out of her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi groaned, her breath becoming more strained as her bloated breasts heaved and her heart pounded even faster, \u201cFuck\u2026 huff\u2026 huff\u2026 you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard him chuckle once more before she felt his paw smack hard against one of her now bare buttocks, sending it quivering and jiggling, \u201cDon\u2019t worry m\u2019lady, there will be plenty of time for that later if you'd like\u2026 It might be more challenge than I\u2019m used to though\u2026\u201d He cooed as he walked back in front of her, \u201cI mean at least all the other girls were still able to walk out of here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi only glared at him, blushing hotly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, see you love me already!\u201d He snickered as he began walking down the hallway, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back kitty girl, don\u2019t go anywhere now, hear me?!\u201d He called out before rounding a corner and disappearing from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was walking away, Mimi tried to shout after him the first thoughtless expletives that came to mind. Before her voice could even attempt to leave her fat swaddled throat however, she felt herself gagging. As her breathing became more strained and suddenly blocked, Mimi\u2019s mind began to race. <i>\u201dWhat\u2019s happening to me!?</i> She worried, <i>\u201dAm I choking?! Have I become too large to breath!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her panic fled as a loud, thunderous burp burst forth from her lips, as well as one half of Mimi\u2019s lockpicking set along with it. The incredibly obese catgirl wheezed and groaned as she caught her breath, but she was also filled with relief, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 huff.. hrrrgh\u2026 going to kill\u2026 huuugh\u2026 that bastard\u2026\u201d She groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there, she pondered what to do next. She tried to look down, and even though her new set of chins and neck fat allowed little movement, she was still able to assess some of damage done to her body. The first thing she saw was the remains of her meal: Thick, black sludge that had escaped her lips and trickled down her chins to her chest.  Her breasts were now swollen with fat from that meal and resting atop her enormous belly, sagging to the sides slightly. Thankfully they weren't completely bare, as her undergarments still clung to them, reinforced by a similar enchantment to her armor\u2019s. Unfortunately, <i>that</i> enchantment <i>had</i> given way, leaving much of her large body exposed. She couldn't exactly see all of her belly, but she knew it must be even more titanic than what she saw before her as she felt it spread across the cold stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, much of her rear was out of her view, even as she tried to turn her head to look, but she could definitely feel that her ass and back had changed dramatically. As with her bra, her panties had remained largely intact, but were now stretched into more of a thong as it was swallowed between her enormous, black-furred buttocks. Even though she didn't know exactly how big they were, she could get an idea from the draft that gently blew across them, and it was an idea she didn't like at all. She could also tell her thighs and legs hadn't escaped the fattening effects of the liquid she had consumed, as she was barely able to move them, the limbs wiggling uselessly as they straddled her huge, stuffed gut. Her arms too could do little more than wobble as they were pinned down by rolls of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no avoiding the thought now: Mimi was a giant ball of lard, and she knew just how much she weighed thanks to that asshole on the speaker\u2026 Question was what was she going to do now\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed helplessly, cringing as she felt her chest quiver from the slight action. She was four thousand pounds of cat now, and there was no way she was going to be able to carry that much weight without the intervention of the gods\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201dCarry all this weight\u2026? Maybe..!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline\u2019s heart leapt as she suddenly remembered something. Many of her tools now lie on the floor in the tool belt amongst her shredded armor. Yet there was one nifty trick she kept quite close to her heart. A feather-weight potion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long-shot for sure: The potion was stored between her breasts, and even if her heavy arms could reach her cleavage, the potion still might not be enough to help her stand. The thing was created to help carry heavy objects weighing hundreds of pounds at most after all, not catgirls weighing several times that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to try though! And as she looked down, she saw that the vial of potion was in sight, it\u2019s cork sticking out from between her plump boobs and giving her a brief glimmer of hope\u2026 She might even be able to reach it with her mouth alone, but whatever she did, she had to proceed carefully\u2026</span></div></div>",

Time was wasting, and if she hoped to catch up to J.T., she had to act fast, yet she had to be careful too or else she might knock the bottle over or simply nudge it deeper in between her mammoth breasts. Sighing to herself, Mimi decided on the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Even if I could move my arms, I still probably wouldn't be able to reach the damn thing! It's a long shot, but...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting, Mimi tried her best to move her head forwards and grasp the bottle between her lips. Just as she'd figured, the many neck rolls and chins in the way made the task incredibly difficult, but she pressed harder, holding her breath before just barely managing to get the cork into her maw. She sighed deeply in relief as she lifted her head up, then tilted it back into the air so the vial's neck would slide between her plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Bottoms up...\"</i> She thought as she tugged the cork free with her tongue and let the small vial of liquid pour into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixture was unpleasantly bitter and had an odd soapy aftertaste, but Mimi didn't care as long as it did it's job. She still made sure to spit the empty vial and cork out however once she was certain she had swallowed every single ounce of liquid and waited patiently for the elixir's effects to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she figured she had waited long enough, and even though she was worried it still might not be enough, she figured she might as well find out sooner rather than later, <i>\"Here goes nothing...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath before using what energy she had left to push her legs against the ground. At first she was barely able to lift her fat rear off of the stone floor, but as she kept trying she finally managed to shift her heavy (Though now a bit lighter) bulk onto her feet and stand, panting heavily from the exertions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"By the gods! Who would have thought standing up could be such a pain in the ass!\"</i> She worried between heavy breaths <i>\"I just hope that damn druid hasn't gone far...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering her strength for the walk down the hall, Mimi slowly began to waddle forwards. As she struggled to maintain her balance, her belly dragging along the ground in front of her with every wobbling step, the fat catgirl's mind was clouded with doubt. She had no real immediate plan other than finding J.T. and getting retribution, but just how she was going to do that was obviously going to be troublesome. Already she was having difficulty simply walking, growing tired just from taking a few trembling steps, so how did she expect to confront the druid: With harsh language?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to focus on more immediate concerns now however. She had enough to worry about right now without thinking ahead, such as trying not to tumble forwards and making sure to pace herself and not die of fucking exhaustion. Thankfully the obese catgirl made it around the corner at the far end of the hallway, though the small sense of accomplishment she felt at making it this far was crushed by what she saw before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... huff! Huff! Huff! Fucking... unfff... kidding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming before her was something that would have been completely ordinary before, yet now seemed like an impassible obstacle: A flight of stairs heading upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mimi wasn't so damn tired, she would have screamed. Instead she bit her lip, squeezed her eyes shut, and inhaled deeply, <i>\"It's just stairs... no big deal, you can do this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as she looked up the flight of stairs, she wasn't so sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should rest first? If she was going to risk this climb when she was as out of shape as one can possibly be, she was going to need all the energy she could get. At the same time however, she had a hard enough time standing in the first place, and if she sat down, she might not be able to get back up again. She could possibly lean against a nearby wall for support, but she wasn't even sure how much that would help... It was a seemingly simple decision, but as Mimi was beginning to realize, things aren't as simple as they used to be when you're bigger than an ox... </span></div></div>",

Sorry to disappoint but not a new chapter just yet...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four thousand pound catgirl panted, already exhausted as she looked up the flight of stairs. She should probably rest and play it safe, but she knew that it might not be the best option, especially considering the feather-weight potion she had drank earlier was only a temporary solution. She looked back down at the ground, sighing and mustering all her strength before mounting the first stone step of many, many more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/vignette6.png\" alt=\"*Vignette6*\" title=\"Vignette6\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How much time would it have taken to climb these shitty stairs before...\"</i> Mimi thought to herself as she neared the top of the steps, <i>\"Minutes? Maybe even SECONDS if I ran!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mimi continued to slowly trundle up the next step, taking great pains to make sure her still agonizingly full belly was clear of the stairs, she was sure it had been hours since she started her ascent, and she wouldn't be too far off. Her entire body constantly quaked and jiggled with every step, making it even harder to keep her balance and feeling generally uncomfortable. Adding to her discomfort were what was left of her underwear, as even though the enormously stretched bra and panties gave her a shred of decency Mimi couldn't help but think she'd be better off without them chaffing against the more sensitive parts of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she finally cleared the last stair she found herself aching and sore, especially in her knees and legs. Her heart pounding at a frightening pace and sweat soaking her fur, Mimi just wanted to sit down and rest for just a moment, but was too afraid that she'd fall asleep as soon as she did after all the energy she had just spent. Instead she kept moving, finding that the stairs led to a new hallway, this one shorter with a door at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... hufff.... ooohhh... don't know how much longer... huff! Pant! I can keep this up...\" She gasped to herself between deep, wheezing pants, stopping to catch what breath she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Mimi's exasperated pants were interrupted by a loud, high-pitched metallic squeal before the ever so boastful voice from before rang out once again through the halls, \"Oh not much further at the rate you're going!\" He cackled, \"In fact I'd say you're pretty close to keeling over tubby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi looked up around the room for the source of the voice, her face already red from exertion flushing even more, \"How bout... hurrf... huurr... you say that... to my face!\" She huffed heavily, pausing to let out a deep belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice merely laughed in response, \"I doubt you're in any shape to be making threats, you hog! But I think I'll stay right where I am in case you decide to SIT on me! ...still I have to say I'm impressed: Usually intruders are clever enough to make it through more than a few traps before they pack on weight, and you managed to reach nigh-immobility after the first!\" Before Mimi could sputter a reply, he continued, \"But I suppose I SHOULD be fair... I must say things between you and that husky boy got absolutely <i>entertaining</i> back there, and I'd hate for you to lose your shot at payback! So I'll give you one last chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said this a small hatch in the floor slid open and a stone pedestal rose out of the hole it hid, carrying a silken pillow and two large glass bottles. The bottle to her left looked to be filled with a bubbling light blue solution while the one on her right held a dark green opaque fluid. Mimi waddled forwards towards the objects before her, the pedestal rising high enough so that she could reach them even at her immense and clumsy size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urff... hufff... what the fuck is this...?\" She groaned, \"Another damnable puzzle...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those concoctions you see before you are elixir of potent strength, able to bend and reshape the flesh with ease! One of the will cause all of the excess fat you have gained to simply VANISH, freeing every inch of you from all 4,000 pounds of burdensome girth! The other potion though will AMPLIFY your weight instead, multiplying your tonnage to a vast degree! Quite simply if you make the wrong choice, you will become immobilized for the rest of your LIFE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup... huff... huurrr... another godsdamned puzzle...\" Mimi grunted in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, but you better make up your feeble mind soon cat! You'll have to catch up to your traitorous friend soon if you want your revenge before he stumbles into another of my traps...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi looked past her massive chest and enormous belly at the two potions, trying to make up her mind. She knew that if she screwed this up, it could change her life forever.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mimi frowned as she looked between the two elixirs before her. One green, and one blue; One that might save her life, the other could damn it to irreversible obesity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, she wondered if this whole thing might be just a trick, that both bottles might be the wrong choice, but in the end decided it didn't matter: This was the only chance she had now, and she couldn't turn it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then...\" She panted to herself, wincing as she felt her full, heavy belly churn through the sludge within, \"I... hufff... choose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the green bottle, the liquid within clearly thick, heavy, and viscous. The fluid contained within the blue one, however, was bubbly and light. It could have been a ploy, a way of duping her to pick the wrong one.... but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi's plump lips curled into a smile as she lifted her flabby arm with great effort and grabbed the neck of the blue bottle with as much grace and delicacy as her pudgy fingers would allow, <i>\"Obviously he wants me to think this is a trick and drink the other one...</i> the rotund rogue thought to herself, <i>\"But just in case...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a... huff... good feeling... about this one...\" She said out loud, grinning wide and hoping the owner of the antagonizing voice could hear her clever idea. She moved the cork of the bottle towards her mouth with a bit of struggle before yanking it loose with her teeth and spitting it out, \"But why.... hurf...! ...don't I have a taste first..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response this time as the rogue tipped the vial of potion back slowly, sticking out her tongue as she did. With the utmost care, the catgirl made certain that only the smallest possible drop landed upon her tongue before she waited for the effects of the liquid to take hold. Besides a strong, sweet taste filling her palate but for a moment, though, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe withdrew her tongue and waited a moment longer for something to occur, licking at her lips to be sure the drop didn't spill, \"Huff... shit... it's a fake...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the still mostly-full bottle down the hallway, causing it to clatter and roll along the floor before turning her attention back to the pedestal. Before she could make a grab for the other elixir however, the pillar was already sinking into the ground. It was quickly much much lower than the rogue could bend in her current state before it sunk into the floor, and a trap door slid over top to block the green liquid from sight and reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Great! Knowing this jackass, though, the thing was probably another placebo anyways!\"</i> She thought, growling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger was soon replaced by worry, however, as she realized she was already starting to feel heavier again, <i>\"No...! The featherweight potion! It's already wearing off!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... this your sick plan...? huff..!\" She groaned at the ceiling, hissing \"When I... huff huff... find you...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you plan on doing that, fatty!\" The voice finally chimed in, \"Do you really think a five-ton pussycat is going to pose any threat to me if she could even make it through this place? Ahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you... mmff... what I'll do...\" She grunted, \"First... I'm going to... Oooff... hurrf... sit on your spine till I make it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Snap!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi's heart stopped a moment as she heard and then felt her bra strap burst apart. Not long afterwards, her bulky breasts bounced freely before coming to rest atop her tremendous shelf of a gut, her tits bared as the once-intact garment slipped off her blubbery back and down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, a shocking realization sunk in that sent a chill through the entirety of her obese body, \"F-Five... huff... t-tons...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi cringed and let out a heavy groan as her tremendous belly gurgled and churned. A grimace of discomfort spread across her thick lips as she grabbed hold of her paunch, her paws sinking deep into the black-furred flab, \"But... huff huff... the trap... urrghhh... was only supposed to... nngh... to...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Supposed to add two tons' is what you were probably trying to sputter out of that fat-choked throat of yours! Hahaha!\" The voice crowed. While Mimi didn't notice any abrupt changes to her weight, a strange heaviness was filling her stomach, making it feel as though she had swallowed a cannonball, and it was a feeling she did not like one bit, \"Oh yes, you thought you were <i>soooo</i> smart drinking only one drop of the potion, but sadly for you, one drop of the special slime I concocted is all it takes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi could feel her heart pounding faster and faster in her chest as she heard these words, still clutching the folds of her stomach as it grew heavier and heavier, the weight doubling, then tripling! Were her paws sinking further into her fat, now? Were her panties growing tighter now against her ass, ready to share the fate of her bra?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, my corpulent kitty, even the smallest ounce of this marvelous ooze can breed and multiply within that glutton gut of yours, growing in your tummy, first, before spreading to the rest of you!\" The Lipomancer called out, \"Best of all, once the slime has grown enough, it will begin to digest into pound upon pound, ton upon ton, of wonderful, <i>permanent</i> fat! Very soon, you'll be stuffed tighter than a Luxumentum Meat Pie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son... urrgh! Of a bitch..!\" Mimi shouted as best she could, quite terrified now. Not only was her stomach starting to grow incredibly heavy, the feline forced to let it fall to the ground, but it was beginning to feel uncomfortably tight as well, \"Make... hugh... it stop...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahah, <i>stop?</i> It's barely even <i>started</i>, my dear! There's no turning it back, now tubbs; in mere moments, you'll barely be able to lift a finger as your own body swallows you in a sea of lard!\" The voice said, sounding as though he was relishing the thought, \"And then you will be a magnificent feline, a true beauty, a servant of the Lipomancer, Mwahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell!\" Mimi spat at the air, wheezing a little as she looked down at the belly spreading before her. She could already see it slowly rising now as the slime inside her prepared to spread throughout her body. The bloating catgirl winced again as she tried to lift her growing gut with her paws, barely able to lift it from the ground as she waddled forwards, looking at the doorway at the end of the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shit! Maybe if I can make it out of this room, I can find another potion, a scroll, SOMETHING to reverse this bullshit!</i> Mimi thought as she gazed desperately at the door, <i>It's a longshot... But I don't have much fucking choice, do I...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat looked down once more at her belly, already looking larger and feeling heavier and tighter than before, <i>Of course, I probably won't be able to make it out in time... It's... gross, but... maybe if I can force this damn slime out of me, then I'd at least stop myself from becoming a helpless blubberball...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she had precious little time to spare, Mimi chose to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The turn around is slow. With the feather weight potion rapidly wearing off, she could feel every pound of her two tons now. Before, it was merely the task of moving that much volume, but now the mass weighs down on her. Instantly, her arms now feel like saddlebags, weighing down on top of her hips. Each step required her to pull her calf swallowed feet off the ground, which she could now only manage a few inches off, then plant the foot back down. Suddenly what was merely a rough undertaking became a monumental task.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe sweating began in earnest. Each movement required shifting her massive thighs, each three foot wide, touching each other almost all the way to the ground. That in turn required shifting the matching ass cheek, a massive weighty globe that struggled against its twin for space so it could move. Then the step forward and shifting her stomach, the fat heavy apron that weighed down to below her knees, swollen forward with potion, and soon slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nngh...\" she gasped in sudden struggle as she tried to get some momentum going. The true weight of her body was on her, a sweltering two tons of lard. Sweat dripped to the floor as she worked on her fifth step towards the door when the slime decided to make itself known. It made a horrendous <b><span class=\"clblue\">GLORP</span></b> from inside her guts before it stirred to life. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nPanicked, Mimi redoubled her efforts. Sticking her fat doughy arms forward, she took smaller but more hasty steps, shuffling her feet forward. She could lift them just barely off the floor, move them, then start again, without having to shift the considerable weight of her belly and ass. Soon she was a jiggling rippling ocean, heavy fat tits swaying back and forth over her belly in their sling. Ass crashing back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach took a sudden surge forward. Mimi's paws with down to her gut as it began to push outward. The soft doughy lard of her belly began to shift, pushing upward and outward from the middle as the slime reproduced swiftly. She struggled forward again with new panic. It was tough enough to get into the room in the first place! Sweat dripped quickly down her face, dripping over rolls. Her stomach became noisier with every step. The gelatinous weight inside shifted back and forth with every shift of her titanic thighs. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe got to the door, but just as she tried to shove her growing stomach through, it took another surge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b>BOOOOWWWLOOORP!!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! C...come on!\" Her stomach wedged itself in the door, pushing around both side of it as it continued to grow with slime. She pushed frantically, trying to shove herself through the door as her stomach reached the floor, brushing the cool stone with soft fur. The expanse surged up and out, going from a soft melting mass into a growing ball. Her stomach strained as it filled with more. The stomach of a lardblimp even the size of her was only made for so much food. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nExcess built up around the frame, a blue tint under her fur developing. Her breasts rose up on the rising mountain of stomach, blocking her view of salvation. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nBLOMPH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than explode right in the door frame, her belly pushed her back and out, forcing her onto the floor. Bra and panties snapped, leaving her stranded, naked on the floor. Her wide ass spread out behind her, forcing her into a sitting position, while her breasts sagged down to either side of her belly. The slime continued to surge, meanwhile, growing in heaving surges, making her blue tinted belly rise up further and further in front of her face. It pinned her breasts back, locking her arms in place under their weight. It pressed up against the door frame, covering it completely. The skin of her belly took on the cerulean hue as it began to stretch, bloating from that doughy mound now into a taut sphere. Each surge pushed her back under its weight, further into the flesh of her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelves fell over as the front of the room filled with her growing stomach. It would need enough mass to fill her up to three times the size she is now! Mimi groaned at the sudden realization. She was stuck... As her stomach pressed itself against the ceiling, flattening out against the walls and space in front of her, she realized she would shortly become the fattest thief who ever lived.</span></div></div>",

But what if one of them will remove your excess baggage, do you really think you'll last long in my dungeon without taking the chance...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rogue frowned, realizing that this jerk had a point. She'd be a walking trap magnet in her current slow and cumbersome state... if she could even fit her humongous hips through the door at the end of the hall. Besides, she had no idea how much longer the feather-weight potion would last, and then she'd be no better off than before. This was an opportunity she couldn't pass up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\" She grumbled under her breath as she returned her attentions to the bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne blue... One green... While the blue one looked lighter in consistency thanks to its fizzy appearance, Mimi was sure it could be just a trick. The colors didn't matter and their appearance didn't matter... so the only way she could do this was randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi closed her eyes tightly, moving her heavy fat-covered arm towards one of the bottles. Just lifting the hefty limb felt difficult and clumsy, so she reached slowly and carefully until her sausage-like fingers felt the cool hard touch of glass, her plump digits slowly wrapping about the neck of the chosen bottle. She opened her eyes to see what she had chosen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" She sighed, steeling herself before lifting the bottle to her mouth and pulling the cork free with her teeth. The whale of a feline looked skeptically at the potion, swirling it about in it's bottle and noting its odd, sludge-like consistency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, interesting choice!\" Rang the voice of the castle's master, \"But are you sure it's the right one...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" She grunted defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a weighty decision! You might regret it if it becomes too much to bear!\" The voice cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh fuck you...\"</i> She thought before pushing the bottle to her lips and taking a huge quaff of the thick potion within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fluid was definitely thick alright, and though it had a smooth texture and sweet taste it was almost too sweet, and Mimi couldn't help feel like she was chugging down maple syrup. She paused for a moment as she swallowed the first mouthful, wondering if it was safe to be drinking so much at once, before throwing caution to the wind and downing the rest of the stuff. She figured if this was the wrong one, and if this stuff made her as fat as the Lipomancer said it would, then even a drop could doom her. If that was the case then it simply didn't matter how careful she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finished, the catgirl licked her plump lips before letting out a long, wet belch. She panted lightly before letting the now empty bottle drop to the floor, waiting for the elixir to take hold one way or the other. As she continued to wait however, she began to grow doubtful. After a few minutes had passed with still no results, the exhausted catgirl's patience ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... urrgh! Gives!\" She spat as she pushed in on her belly with her paw, making it ripple wildly, \"Nothing's... Huff... hap... huff...! Happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happening?\" The mechanical voice crowed, \"That's interesting, isn't it? I guess there IS a slight possibility that, say you chose correctly, the potion MIGHT not work if you're already too fat... Ah well, nothing to be done about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going... ngh... to come up there....! Huff... hurrr... and...URK!?\" Mimi grunted sharply in pain as her indigestion seemed to intensify, her paws immediately reaching for her sagging, massive stomach, \"The... fuck...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she first grabbed her gut, her paws sunk heavily into the thick flab that weighed down her paunch, but it wasn't long before the feline rogue noticed something odd. She didn't recognize it at first, merely thinking that somehow her stomach was growing firmer, but she quickly realized that it wasn't her gut pushing her paws out of her belly fat: The flab itself was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much longer to feel the more obvious effects of the potion; The burdensome fat that had clung to every inch of her body slowly shrinking as if it was never there to begin with. She lifted her arms up before her, smiling at the ease with which she could move them now and enjoying as she watched them and her paws grow thinner and thinner. She looked them over in amazement as she was once more able to see the lean muscle that had laid hidden beneath so much flab. The once obese catgirl's reduction in weight was not without drawbacks however; As Mimi's breasts and ass shrunk back down to their normal sizes, the overburdened cups of her bra and the rogue's strained panties fell away from her limply, leaving her shrinking body exposed. She barely noticed, nor cared about her nudity though, too overcome with joy at being back to her fit self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great!\" She shouted, laughing giddily at how easy it was for her to speak and how much lighter her voice was now, \"No more waddling, no more trouble with stairs, and I can finally fucking <i>breath</i> again!\" She grinned, stretching her muscles and cracking her knuckles, \"I thought I was going to be stuck as a total fatass forever... haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sure!\" The voice of the Lipomancer boomed overhead, \"There are still plenty of opportunities for THAT! In fact, here's one to get you started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi's heart sank as she heard the villain's words and the odd sound of grinding stone that soon followed. She looked up to find it's source: Another trap door sliding open, this time in the ceiling behind her. She stepped back from it towards the door at the far end of the hall, and nearly yowled in shock as something large, yellow, and blob-like dropped from the opening. While suspicious at first, Mimi cautiously approached the odd mass and quickly realized that it was a pile of crumbs and frosting that was almost as tall as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what is this thing?\" She said, poking at it and letting out a meep as the blob suddenly began to squirm and wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT is your newest challenge!\" The voice cackled as the crumbly ooze began to come together, the mass beginning to take shape until it formed into a large, humanoid creature comprised of pink-frosted wedges, \"Don't worry, it's a piece of cake! MUHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damnable son of a <i>bitch</i>!\" Mimi groaned before turning tail and running as fast as she could for the door at the end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake creature was already moving towards her though. The thing barreled straight through the stone pedestal and the remaining potion that lay between it and its target without a second thought, knocking them over and crushing them. Mimi's heart raced as she grabbed for the doorknob, thanking the gods that it was unlocked before swinging it open and slamming it shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, finding that the door intersected into another hallway. Which way should she go now though: Right or left? The wrong choice could lead to a dead end or worse, another trap, but Mimi was running out of time.</span></div></div>",

The feline darted down the hallway to the left with two things on her mind to get back at J.T. and to kick the ass of of the Mastermind of this castle.  The hallways loomed with an eerie glow each torch a few feet apart and dimly lighting the halls.  Even in the dim lighting Mini saw an upcoming trip wire ahead of her in the path and vaulted over it with ease smiling as she did \"Thought I'd never be able to do that again after earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like minutes of running she came to a door, wooden and cold to the touch.    Carefully the rouge opened the door slowly and cautiously entered the room.  As she did a force smacked her in the face that felt like a piece of bread after getting a hold of the object and pulling it off  her face she saw it was a large ham, bacon and cheese club sandwich   Mimi imeaditly threw it to the floor \"Nice try asshole.\" she shouted out to the voice hoping it could hear her even from this new room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah but that was just a reward sandwich, now why would go waste such a good sandwich like that,  I figured you earned yourself it by following your former ally's path.   You'd best be moving though he's a quick one...for now.\" the voice called back.  Mimi gritted her teeth running for the door as she approached the door she saw a pair of daggers which she quickly grabbed, \"These will be helpful fighting off any monsters around here.\"    She then went through the door to find.</span></div></div>",

She huffed and wheezed angrily as she glared down the hall in the direction J.T. had left her, trying to think of the best way to reach the feather-weight potion she kept stored in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Probably can't run all that fucking great after what that bastard did to me...\"</i> She thought to herself, wincing as her voluminous stomach gurgled, still churning through the literal tons of goop she had to devour, <i>\"If I even have a hope of catching up to him now, I'm going to have to act fast...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking her options over then, Mimi immediately decided that trying to grab the vial with her mouth would probably be a waste of time, especially with so much flab in the way. Her best bet now would be to simply try and grab the thing with her paw... Even if her arms were almost pure lard now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering all of her remaining strength, Mimi concentrated hard on trying to move her right arm mere inches. Even though the muscles still remained strong, the blubber that coated them weighed several times as much now and it was tough going. Thankfully Mimi found that they hadn't become <i> completely</i> worthless as her flabby limb slowly shifted towards her heaving, wobbling chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes! I've almost got it! Just a little more and then I'll be okay...! I'll be moving around in no tim-\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Mimi's muscles may have still had the strength to move her fat arm, she didn't even consider how clumsy the heavy appendage might be... at least not until it knocked straight into her right breast. The feline rogue felt her blood run cold as she sent the huge mammary jiggling with the accidental collision, the movement just enough to shake the vial of potion loose and send it tumbling free. Unfortunately for her, it fell right onto the curve of her belly before rolling down its slope and off the side of her gut. The vial fell out of view but Mimi could hear it shatter, cringing as she sat there helpless to prevent it smashing along with her hope of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi tried to shake her head in denial, but even that was hampered by her enormous weight. Her breaths grew heavier and more frantic as her heart beat harder within her chest, the catgirl refusing to believe she had failed so miserably. She grunted as she strained her legs, pushing her fat feet against the ground and trying as hard as she possibly could to simply stand but to no avail. She kept trying, not letting herself see how fruitless it was until the only thing her efforts managed to do was break wind from her immensely fattened and jiggling rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatass feline sat there defeated upon her rump, hot tears rolling down her fat cheeks as she thought of the potion now soaking into the stone floor beneath her belly and a growl spread across her lips as her mind returned to the druid. She stared down the hallway for any sign of J.T., the asshole that had done this to her and now possibly her last hope of getting out of this place... if he even made it back himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show that fucking mutt the price for screwing me over...\" She hissed to herself furiously, \"Once I'm back to my former self I'm going to kill you J.T., you <i>son of a bitch!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last echoes of her threat faded down the open hallway however, she was left with only silence, indigestion, and a couple tons of doubt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually, dogbreath,\" Mimi started. She slowly meandered toward him, trying to deflect his attention with a well-placed hip thrust. When the husky temporarily darted his eyes to her hips, enticed, that was all the time the cat rogue needed. In one movement she had tripped the dog, grabbed anything he had in his pockets (a few spells, some gold, not much else) and pulled her blade, which she put to J.T.'s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dog volunteers to drink it all,\" the cat spat at the Lipomancer, who was momentarily taken aback by her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, the cutthroat lives on to fight another day! Unfortunately, the dog you've tricked lives on to 'fat' another day. Ha... well, they aren't all winners. Do know, Dog, that I'm lowering the total amount gained to 750, if only because I want to see you two make it a little further. It's rare I have company, might as well stretch you out. And your waist, too. Ciao!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the faces decorating the door merged back into one, and the Lipomancer's vocal presence was silenced, leaving only the cat, still with a knife to her companion's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get drinking! I wasn't about to get myself screwed over by inaction. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was clearly pissed, and more than a little scared, Jonathan regained enough posture to sneer. \"Well, cat, I'm going to show you what you just gave up. Enjoy the show, sweetcheeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear swirling a bit in his mind, the husky calmed his nerves, stripping down to his skivvies right in front of the cat, who at the very least blushed a bit. He wasn't jacked, but Jonathan wasn't exactly husky, with a solid frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly walking to the container of his imminent doom, the husky dog tried to rack his brain for a last-minute way out of the scenario. There was some spell way, way back mentioned as a weight-loss between the girls in his druid classes in his school days. It was... what was it, again? He couldn't be sure. A name popped into his head, and after a second of consideration while simultaneously placing his paws upon the door, he whispered the possible savior under his breath before placing his lips upon the iron ones of the mechanism., which clearly held three swigs (originally four, one magically removed by the 'Mancer for Mimi's act of, well, cowardice and bravery simultaneously).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few unsure moments without change, a sudden puff began to fill the husky's body. It seemed that about two-hundred and fifty pounds descended into his gut, his cheeks, his butt, chest and legs, quickly growing him into an obese, though well-proportioned, husky dog. The sudden onrush of fat had taken the husky aback, but considering he didn't know how much time he had before more dire circumstances would come into play, the husky husky downed the final two swigs in the door lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi was stunned, watching the transformation from a few feet away. In front of her very eyes, J.T. had gone from a relatively lithe, skinny pup into a wide, winter-ready dog, before his sudden decision to finish the drink took her aback. The effects were slower this time, but she swore she could see the dog's already bulging body slowly sponge out more, his light fur only adding to the visuals. His thighs thickened past thunder-thighs, finding a new definition of fatty thighs, while his gut didn't expand as much outward as wide. The spell he remembered to cast upon himself didn't control how much he gained so much as where it ended up, so while he was still a dog with 750 new pounds on him, the mutt felt great, the weight evenly distributed among himself. Sure, the beach was a thing of the past, but upon seeing himself out of his peripheral vision, J.T. could tell the change wasn't all that bad. Meanwhile, though she was oddly fond of the dog's new form, thinking it more friendly than usual and more than a little powerful, Mimi searched the room for a way out. Two exits became visible after a moment - one wall had a hidden slide, strangely jumbo-sized, while another had a hidden switch, which she flipped to reveal a staircase heading up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Lipomancer sat excited at his chair, watching the proceedings. \"I've roped the dog, admittedly pretty easy to do, but this cat here... how do I slow her down?\" he thought to himself. \"Well, let's see what happens next.\"</span></div></div>",

From the looks of it, both paths up and down were quite dimly lit, so there was little they could see as they ascended or descended into the inky darkness. Mimi scratched her chin while J.T. looked at her with a glare, perhaps envious that she still only had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich way do you say we go mutt?\u201d She purred, ignoring his sour mood, \u201cI\u2019d say up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if I weren't so mad that I didn't want to speak to you, I\u2019d say down, but I\u2019m not,\u201d Jonathan grumbled, looking away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown?

More than likely it just leads deeper into this fattening deathtrap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Mimi said, her brow furrowing in concern, \u201cAnd why might you think that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe druid whined gloomily as he looked down the chute, \u201cBecause just think about it for a second, alright? He\u2019s got us trapped in here already: the wall sealed shut behind us as soon as we walked into this room and it still hasn\u2019t opened, even after \u201cwe\u201d solved the puzzle. It\u2019s clear he wants to keep us in here and moving deeper into his fortress, so why would he just give us the exit like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill went through Mimi\u2019s spine. She was somewhat expecting he would say that, but it was still a troubling thought, \u201cBut\u2026 what about the adventurers you met on the road here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing they were just the lucky ones\u2026\u201d J.T. said, \u201cI bet there are plenty more still stuck in this place, maybe in trap rooms, or maybe somewhere else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi was really starting to become worried now, but she pushed her fears aside: They wouldn't get her anything, whether it was treasure she wanted or escape, \u201cWell then, if it doesn't matter, then I say we go up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine\u2019s ears drooped as he whined in protest, \u201cBut it\u2019s so much easier to go down! And you just said it didn't matter anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 true\u2026\u201d Mimi purred as she held her dagger up to the husky and poked him in the back with it, \u201cBut I think I\u2019m the one in charge here, so I decide where we go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d J.T. winced as he began to climb up the stairs slowly, \u201cIs this how we\u2019re going to treat each other now? With distrust and cruelty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi chuckled, \u201cSorry, but after what I put you through big guy, even <i>I</i> think you\u2019ve earned some payback\u2026 Besides, you <i>really</i> need the exercise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re a real bitch\u2026\u201d Jonathan grumbled under his breath as he continued to lumber up the stone steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight of stairs didn't seem to be that long, but it was slow going with J.T. in the lead. The obese husky boy was still getting used to his new bulk, and was already panting heavily and slowing down as the reached the halfway mark. Mimi would have been less patient with the druid, and maybe even prodded him a bit with her blade, but something about watching his tubby, almost bare rump jiggle with each step was quite\u2026 entertaining?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019d normally say eyes forward\u2026\u201d Templa snickered, \u201cBut I think that\u2019s the problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi scowled as she muttered a response, \u201cJust keep moving your fat ass before I give it more motivation\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the top of the steps, J.T. still gasping for breath a little, Mimi could see it led to a rather long and straightforward tunnel before them. Unfortunately the lighting wasn't any better here, so she wasn't sure for how far the hallway went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMimi\u2026?\u201d J.T. gasped as he bent over to catch his breath, \u201cNot that you have a track record for\u2026 huff\u2026 huff\u2026 being selfless, but can we take a bit of a break? Those steps\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi frowned as she waved her dagger in the air, \u201cIt was only a small climb, you can\u2019t be seriously wanting to take a break now, we\u2019ll never make it through this place if you keep <i>this</i> up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.T. looked up at her and whimpered pitifully.</span></div></div>",

Startled, she looked up to find a sheet of glass quickly lowering right above her head. The cat quickly sprung ahead of her past its dangerous grasp... only to hit another as it lowered quickly, pinning her between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\", the cat yelled, as Templa, finally recovered and ready to go, entered the tunnel to find her trapped. The obese husky quickly looked around his surroundings; nothing visible he could see to get her out.

You can let her off easy, but where's the fun in that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange pink mist began to fill Mimi's vision, and she quickly held her breath to prevent unnecessary breathing. \"Jonathan, I'm sorry,\" she stammered, choking on the last word and taking a sharp breath. The five pounds that jumped onto her frame was nothing compared to the twenty that followed when she shrieked; her tight bandit clothing suddenly looked two sizes too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan needed to think fast, or at least make his decision soon. While it seemed fitting for his reluctant friend to get some payback for her actions, he wasn't sure if she'd be happy sharing the same fate as him. Plus, the Lipomancer was clearly tempting him to work against her when they needed to work together to survive, or at least avoid surrender. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was clear to Jonathan that he couldn't exactly get revenge on Mimi, per se. Considering he was already carrying close to a thousand pounds on his frame, he'd surely need her in the future if they had any chance of getting out of this godforsaken hellhole. Seeing things from her side, it was clear to him that she only pulled the knife on him out of desperation, and despite literally fighting like cats and dogs, the two were slowly bonding. Sure, it might have just been a form of Stockholm syndrome, but they definitely got along better than they had been at the outset of their journey. Still, though, he did want to at least pull one over on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog turned his back on the cat, who gasped in horror and started hyperventilating at her supposed fate. With every gasp her frame curved out a few additional pounds, and in mere seconds the twenty-five pounds she had added doubled itself. Realizing that she would quickly swell herself up if he didn't stop it, the dog spun back around as quickly as his bulk would allow, calling out \"I accept the apology, you can stop now!\" Just as he said the word \"apology,\" the sweet pink air around the cat dissipated and the glass receded into the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jonathan and Mimi immediately assessed the damage from this latest trap. The cat's tight clothing was pretty close to giving up the ghost, revealing all of her puffy midriff. It still covered her slightly-larger breasts, with her pants still easily containing her lower half, so she wasn't close to nudity yet, but she had put on a quick 50 pounds in just a minute's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asshole! What did you think you were doing there?!\", the cat immediately yelled, getting as up close in the husky's face as she could. \"Look at what you've done to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As compared to what you forced me into just a few minutes ago?\", the dog replied. \"I wanted you to feel how I felt, without actually having to feel all of what I felt,\" he continued, referring to his overlarge body. \"Seriously, you're fine. We need to stay as mobile as possible, and you've still got a hell of a lead on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat paused for a moment, reflecting, before accepting Jonathan's argument. \"OK. I get it. Let's just keep moving so we can still get out of here at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No argument from me,\" the husky replied. The two continued to head down the tunnel, and found their next move lying at its far end. On the left, a wooden door; on the right, another hallway.</span></div></div>",

Sitting on a table in the middle of the room was a simple glass of water and a note. The brick room had one exit across from them, a simple door. Things seemed simple... too simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi sauntered over to the note and began to read aloud. \"Welcome to your latest test!\", the note began. \"I've decided to give you two an easy challenge to make things more interesting. As you can see, there's a glass of water on the table. Of course, as you've probably guessed, it's no simple glass of water. I've enchanted it with an interesting spell. When the glass is empty - and don't think about dumping it out, I'll pump this room full of pink mist if you do and you'll never leave - the door will open and you'll progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The interesting thing here is that the water has different properties depending on who drinks it. If the dog drinks, nothing happens. No, really, I'm not pulling your leg for once. The chunky cat and fatty dog get to move on. If the cat drinks it, however, things get interesting. I know how much you love your precious figure, thief, so you'll be losing it. I think you'll double your weight? Which will still be a major change for you, maybe 150 pounds? However, should you accept that, the dog's weight will be halved, I'd say by about 400, 450 pounds? And seeing the way you're already struggling through the halls, husky boy, that'll be a big relief. You've got as long as you need to make the decision. Once again, don't drop or spill the glass, I'd hate to puff you up for good when you're such clever adversaries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi finished reading the note and looked up at Jonathan, directly into his best puppy-dog eyes. If nothing else, his chubby cheeks made him much more sympathetic. \"Mimi, think about this. It sucks - this whole thing does - but for once we'll get out of here with a net positive. For every pound you add, I lose two. And that keeps us a step away from losing to this crazy bastard. I mean, shit, you've seen me in this place lately, it would probably take me an hour to walk a mile at best. Mobility is our friend here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if it isn't?\", Mimi replied. \"Woah, not like that,\" she added, seeing some lines of anger cross the dog's face. \"No, I mean, what if the next room has some kind of antidote hanging from the ceiling and it takes me climbing up to do that? If I'm 300 pounds, I can't do it, and you're out of commission there completely, so we'd be screwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could make you gain 1,000 pounds instantly in the next room too,\" the dog curtly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Mimi tried to reply, but yeah, that was a possible outcome. After a few more minutes of deliberation...</span></div></div>",

In the time it took her to blink, Mimi's, well, everything lurched out and lurched out far. Her belly was instantly more than swollen, her hips forever lost the ability to lie, she'd never have to worry about a thigh gap again and she gained the ass and breasts a porn star would love to have if it weren't for all the other fat around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Jonathan's frame halved itself, and the husky was elated. His formerly hugely stocky frame shrunk drastically, his belly pulling in a good two feet in every direction and his legs becoming just a bit less cumbersome to use in any way, shape or form. He was still huge, but as huskies are built for stockiness, falling from five chins to three was nothing but a victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they moved on, each looked the other over, trying to determine whether the move was worthwhile. Jonathan had fallen from 900 pounds to below 500, while Mimi was now quite the fluffy kitty at 300 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon broke the silence. \"Before we go any further... thank you,\" he said. \"I know it was a hard decision, but I'm grateful you made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you big dog, I'd lie to say you weren't cute with the extra weight, but it's the right move if we're gonna get out of here in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi turned to the open door, while Jon lingered a moment before following. She was cute before, he thought to herself, but somehow the weight suited her well, in some weird way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi caught Jon when she looked back. \"Are you staring at my ass?!

An impatient grumble loosed her lips while she tried to recover. Her hope to clear the corridor with some scrap of dignity faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Said J.T. Mimi needed not turn around to see the smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl took a deep breath and tried to stand straight, despite her rather front heavy situation. Deep beneath her new body lay years of well-toned muscle mass, no way a little fluff changed that. Just try again, Mimi thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaby steps, Mimi, baby steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs chafed together within a few paces while she floundered in her stride once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what the problem is.\" Jonathan said. \"Well, despite the obvious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, pray tell, is that.\" Mimi seethed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're trying to walk like someone half your size.\" He said in a matter-of-fact tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What suddenly makes you an expert on fat people?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A healthy understanding of anatomy and the flow of energy is kind of my thing.\" Said J.T. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky shuffled over to Mimi and stood beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" He prodded her belly-roll with his forefinger, \"is hindering movement in your legs. And speaking of your legs, you need to stand with your feet further apart. Trust me your thighs will still touch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fat-boy, how do I fix it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wider steps, like this.\" J.T. took a bit of a waddling step, the heft of his belly shifted to the side and gave his meaty leg enough room to walk forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi rolled her eyes, and did her best to emulate the husky. Her hips wagged a little more than she felt comfortable, but true to his word, walking felt a little more natural with her frame. Any chance of stealth disappeared with a jiggle, but if they made it out with the treasure there might be no need for sneaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate to say it Templa, but you're right.\" She waddled ahead of the husky. \"Now try to keep up, I'm not too keen on waiting for anything to find us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'd protect you.\" Jon said between winded breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see how you're fit to do that.\" Mimi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Course I am, I could just sit on anything that comes our way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi let out an exhausted, but genuine chuckle.  The two walked on in silence, well for the most part. A steady cadence of fat laden foot falls backed a duet of wheezing and grunts. Mimi's thoughts turned to what horrors awaited them along the line. Spells, monsters, booby traps, <i>stairs</i>, gods please no stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you plan on doing after we get out of here?\" Jon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno, not exactly a lot of job opportunities for a fat rogue.\" Mimi shrugged. \"You?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to go live in the woods, eat berries and twigs a for a few years until I'm thin again.\" Jon said. A low grumble filled the air. Jon rubbed his stomach without giving it half a thought. \"Maybe I'd supplement my new diet with shepherds pie. Some mutton chops and a sweet roll or two. On second thought make that eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're too set on being thin again with a diet like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess I'm a little hungry all of a sudden.\" Jon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stopped walking down the corridor for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we're stuck like this?\" Jon said, his eyes widened. \"I mean it's magic fat, not normal fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like regular old fat to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Mimi, how might you get in shape again?\" Jon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might start with swimming to get my endurance up.\" Said Mimi sighed and leaned against the wall. \"Though at the rate I'm going, I might just float instead. Hmm, just relaxing in the water not a care-\" Mimi caught herself mid-sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two anthros looked each other in the eye, then at their own bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, how about running.\" Said Mimi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a start, I used to jog at my old town all the time. I passed this one tavern every day, and they had the most amazing honey mead, I could just sit there for days drinking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're drooling.\" Mimi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky snapped to attention and wiped his chin. Delicious thoughts of savory foods still danced in the back of his mind. A whine escaped his lips while he slumped against a wall, his hands planted firm on his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right, Jon.\" Mimi looked down at her bloated stomach. \"At this rate I'll only get bigger when we leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon let the thought sink in, even if they \"won\" he still might end up bigger than before. His rational mind wanted to panic, but what disturbed him was a side of his mind that did not mind it so much. Living life fat and happy with treasures he pilfered from the lipomancer's temple. Such a life did not sound too bad at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was starting to like it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, looking at Mimi, he could not shake how well she carried her extra curves. Her bell-shaped hips flared out with a smooth layer of fat, clutched tight by her form fitting gear. Her plush belly hung tantalizing inches over her waistband and threatened to cover her pudgy mound.  Her breasts bulged out even further than her gut, the taught material of her enchanted shirt kept the suspended in air in a way only magic can conjure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, you're drooling again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, sorry, can't stop thinking of food.\"Jon blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well, I think we've lost enough time already freaking out about this. We'll deal with it later, right now we need to concentrate on leaving this damned temple or well never even get to find out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded and followed behind her, contemplating the cursed fat more. His thoughts impeded by the occasional glance at Mimi's bouncing ass cheeks.

Despite feeling sorry for their misfortune, he oddly felt a strange lust for the extra curves that they carried. Then his thoughts returned to recent events when he was forced to drink that potion. It was then that he was slowly becoming addicted to his own girth. It's like being larger made him feel more empowered than before. Jonathan starts rubbing his belly regretting that he halved his previous size, but then again it was worth seeing Mimi blow up with fat. In the end the Lipomancer only brought this hidden addiction to the forefront. After walking for a few hours the duo find a large door. As Mimi proceeded to the door Jonathan spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi, I've been thinking that maybe being fat isn't a bad thing.

At no point before had he ever really been focused on weight in his life, and now it was taking precedence in his every thought. He needed to do a few things, he thought to himself. First, he'd need to avoid the Lipomancer's tricks at all costs. Second, and just as important, he'd need to move quick and help Mimi, especially if he found an outlet for his newfound interest. It would be bad enough if he got addicted to size - he didn't want to drag her down with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as the two reached the latest thing standing in their way, he realized both of these goals were about to become a bit harder.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The latest room that the cat and dog found themselves wandering into was much like the past ones they'd made it through. Locked doors and tables with something on them. But here, things were a little different. The locked door (made of wood) had two small holes in it, about the size of a small jewel. More importantly, there were seven different tables, all of them loaded with stacks of baked goods. Cookies, muffins, cakes, donuts, danishes, pastries and fancy breads all sat on different tables, seven in all, as if they'd come fresh out of an oven, with heavenly smells to match,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi was the first to see the latest note from the Lipomancer, located on the floor in the center of the room. Here, the name of the game was to discover two rubies hiding underneath the food on two tables of the seven available. Upon discovering these rubies and putting them into the door's holes, they could keep moving. However, the food was magically enhanced - whenever a piece of food was to be touched, it would automatically fling itself into the person's mouth with whom it made contact. And there was enough food here for a small army, to make matters worse. Compounding the situation more, the Lipomancer added that he'd thrown an extra hazard into the game. With every table completed without a ruby found, the other tables' food would become still more fattening. At the outset of the game, the eater would gain 50 pounds from completing a table - that number would rise 25 pounds each incidence. 75 after two, 100 after 3, 125 after 4, 150 after 5. Which means a potential 500 pounds would be added onto someone's body in a worst-case scenario. That said, the tables hiding rubies would not affect their eaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing about this new rule, Jon's mouth started watering. If things went wrong here, he'd regain his prior weight, close to 1,000 pounds. As unappealing as that sounded to part of him, the other part (the one with the curse) was truly excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start eating so we can look,\" Jonathan offered at the beginning of the trial proper. \"You had to take a big hit in the other room.\" He was equally hoping he'd find the rubies early and not find them at all. Mimi pointed him toward a pile - the one loaded with donuts. He immediately started eating, half wanting to treasure the sweet and fatty flavors, half wanting to complete the table's food so he could get the new weight on him quickly. Just by sweeping his hand across the table, treat after treat flung themselves directly into his mouth, and in just a minute, the table became barren, with no gemstone to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Mimi said, just as the husky dog let out a burp. Though his 500-pound frame didn't make it too obvious, 50 new pounds had made themselves at home on  his body. Without even thinking or consulting with his partner, Jonathan walked to the next table over - the one lined with thick cakes - and triggered another eating frenzy, again coming away fruitless when it came to the two leaving the room. Rubbing his belly as the food settled, turning instantly to fat, Jonathan was satisfied with how things were going, relishing the 125 pounds newly added to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was all set to eat more before Mimi finally stopped him. \"Jonathan, I appreciate your... willingness... to eat here, but we really need to plan better than just attacking a random table,\" the cat said. \"Plus, you're already more than a hundred pounds bigger. Let me take the next table,\" she said. Mimi hesitantly walked up to the cookie table and started touching treats, letting them flow into her mouth. Jonathan sat back and watched with happiness - she was getting bigger, just as the curse wanted him to like - before he found himself drawn to the muffins. Mimi, busy eating, didn't notice as Jon started eating again, and when the last cookie disappeared to reveal a ruby, he didn't hear her excitement. \"Not only am I not gaining weight for that, but we're getting out of here!\", she excitedly said, only to turn and see the final muffin disappear down Jonathan's throat. Mere minutes after he had lost 450 pounds, the husky was quickly tubbing up, another 100 pounds on his frame for a total of 225 pounds gained in just the last seconds. What's more, the dog happily burped and rubbed his belly again, lost in a state of bliss.</span></div></div>",

Jonathan almost lost all of his will as the curse created a new more pro-weight gain personality that only yearned to grow bigger and fatter and to make Mimi and anyone else he came across bigger and fatter as well to the point that he would start acting hostile if he were refused what he now desired. Fortunately Mimi wasn't affected by the curse, but with a cursed JT she had to be wary that the overgrown mutt didn't try to betray her for his new cursed desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stop for a bit... Huff... My legs are aching!\" JT whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi turns around to see Jonathan panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll rest but you seriously need to lose that excess weight. I can't believe you let yourself get so damn huge again.\" Mimi said as she took a sip from her canteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan started to let out a low growl. The curse took over again causing Jonathan to get offended by Mimi's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How dare she suggest I lose weight. I've never been happier in my whole life. Maybe I should use my magic to force her to accept the new and improved me.</i> Jonathan thought as the cursed personality replaced his original one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the cursed canine could think of a spell he saw a flash of blue light. The blue light died down to reveal a plump fairy wearing a dress a size too small for her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jonathan Templa, I'm your fairy girth-mother. I'm here to grant all of your fattening dreams.\" the fairy said as she rested on the dog's fat pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can really grant my desires?\" Jonathan asked as he gave the fairy puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to? There's no one else here.\" Mimi replied as she hoisted herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy girth-mother rolled her eyes as Mimi approached Jonathan to help him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only be seen and heard by you my dear flabby pooch. Tell me your wish. I can grant any wish relating to girth. I can even make it easier for someone of your size to move. Would you like that JT?\" The fairy said as she  flew and landed on his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan starts wagging his tail happily. This new development causes Mimi to worry that Jonathan had finally lost his mind. However, she failed to realize that the fairy girth-mother was the Lipomancer's servant and that she had cloaked herself from Mimi's senses. The fairy girth-mother taps Jonathan's snout and her magic takes affect as he found it easier to hoist up his 900 lb. body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Jonathan.\" Mimi said as she noticed that the dog had an extra bounce or two in his step.</span></div></div>",

You were expecting this one? Fine, ruin my run,\" the Lipomancer's voice said. \"Alright, there's a massive feast around the corner, and you need to, I dunno, find a key or something inside one of the meals, but you have to finish the whole dish before you can see it, and the food makes you gain weight, obviously. Man, I was really excited to present this one and you spoiled everything, now I have to start over on the next one.\" His voice trailed off into nothingness, leaving the cat and dog to turn the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, as the three looked up and down the 15-foot buffet table both Mimi and Jon's fairy asked a question. As Mimi said, \"you want me to go first?\", the fairy asked, \"you want me to make her fat too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied to both simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy flicked her wand, and a single spark hit Mimi right in the nose. The cat sneezed, and said, \"Alright, then. We'll take turns. I guess we need to eat all of each dish as we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat turned to face the buffet, sat down and picked out a plate of roast beef to start. She took a bite. \"Wow, this is incredible,\" she thought. Then another, then another. That was the point of this trial, right? They had to keep eating? It didn't seem so bad now that she was doing it. As such, she let herself enjoy the rest of the plate, and when the key didn't appear, she shrugged and turned to a bowl of mashed potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished the potatoes and moved onto some stuffing, Jonathan took a seat next to her. \"How are you feeling?\", he said with a smile. Beginning her third course, the cat was slowly but surely getting fatter, with about 30 pounds on her frame from before. Her stomach was slowly drooping outward, her chest and breasts swelling up just a bit from their resting places, the seat and her belly respectively. Looking up at him with a grin, the cat said, \"this feels amazing. You can dig in now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon looked over his shoulder to his fairy godmother, who was beaming. \"Growing boys need food! You heard her!\" Smiling, the dog saw a nearby plate of chicken and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother twenty minutes passed, and Jonathan looked back to Mimi as he himself finished up a bowl of pudding. The cat was noticeably larger now, having cleared out six plates. She was nearly 400 pounds, with the weight spread all over, and started digging into some ice cream. On the one hand, his cursed mind was more than enjoying their feast - he had gained some weight as well. On the other, his saner side knew he couldn't let Mimi start eating herself to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought that, he licked up the last of the pudding. He was surprised to see the key they'd been looking for appeared suddenly at the bowl's bottom. He started to grab for it, knowing they'd made it out of yet another challenge, but his fairy godmother flew in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Jonathan! You have a perfectly good opportunity to let your friend get fatter right now, and I'll be disappointed in you if you don't take it! Think of how happy food makes you feel - she's only now getting to experience that! Plus, take another look - she's getting more and more beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to agree, even on the non-cursed side, Mimi was wearing her weight well, even as she was eating faster and gaining more - the ice cream was vanquished, and had slapped another 20 pounds onto her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to let that slip away, Jonny? Honestly!\" He glanced down at the key again as Mimi tore into a massive, two-foot steak. Which side wins?</span></div></div>",

In the end Jonathan ate more than Mimi. The feast had caused the corpulent canine to gain 500 more pounds bringing the husky to almost a ton at 1,400 pounds! Mimi on the other hand was now 800 pounds! The fairy godmother's spell had worn off and Mimi was terrified at what happened.

I haven't seen a good sumo match in a long time, but he's a bit too thin to face who I have in mind.\" The Lipomancer voice said as it echoed throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without warning the fairy girthmother casts a spell on Jonathan. Jonathan  gained 600 more pounds. Mimic however was panicking since she couldn't see that the fairy cast the spell and was believing that something that Jonathan ate during the previous challenge was causing the seemingly unexplained growth. Mimi watched in horror as Jonathan happily played with his heft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be the gift I gave you. Looks like the dog has been enjoying it for quite a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What  gift is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling you. You're supposed to find out what gift I gave that fat pooch. Mwu ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan stepped into the ring. His flabby tail was wagging furiously with excitement.  The  fairy girthmother flies up and lands on Jonathan's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my gift Jonny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan gives a wide grin. Mimi panics thinking that the dog she had grown to know was replaced by a fat seeking psychopath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Templa is starting to creep me out. Is he speaking to his imaginary friend again? Hopefully we can reverse the curse on him. But what kind if gift did that lard for brains dog get.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mimi could calm herself down the room shook at the sound of heavy footsteps.  By that time the fairy flew off the druid's nose and sat on the golden chandelier hanging 1000 feet above the ring. As the footsteps drew closer and older a massive male figure could be seen. The figure was not only fat but he clearly had well developed muscles to complement his girth. Once the figure emerged from shadows it was obvious what species he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure was a large dragon dressed in armor. Judging by his sword he must have been a warrior in his skinnier days. Before entering the ring the dragon tossed off his armor til he was clad in a mawashi. He then tosses Jonathan a red mawashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put this on dog. I can't believe your running around this place in your suit and can someone please cloth the cat. The Lipomancer will meet with you if you fools are properly clothed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy godmother uses her magic to put Mimi in a stretchable rubber suit that shows off her plump feminine figure.  By the time the spell was cast Jonathan had just finished putting on his mawashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. Now to explain the rewards if you win. If you win then I will take you to the Lipomancer. If you lose your cat friend will be fattened until the Lipomancer decides to sacrifice her to the Diety he serves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I did not agree to this! I'm not going to be some sacrifice to some cult's god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he better win if you want to stay alive. Now we just need a reference and we're good to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe platform next to the ring opens up and a plump maiden in a cage appears. The maiden was a human who used to work for the Lipomancer until she decided to cross him and take over the position for herself.  The maiden gives the word for the match to begin.</span></div></div>",

You will be paid handsomely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of getting paid a lot of money piqued Mimi's interest, but for all she knew it could be a horrible trap. The Lipomancer let's out a loud belly laugh. All 10,000 lbs. of him jiggled like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to decide now. You have until the end of this feast to reply. Choose wisely.\" The Lipomancer grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi gulped down the wine she was drinking. The Lipomancer was offering her life or death. That's the vibe that she got from this monstrously huge man. Even if she was thinner the Lipomancer's unnatural heft would make killing him near impossible and that combined with his mastery of sorcery made him a deadly foe if she was to confront him head on. The only way she could kill him was by gagging him or poisoning him.

However, her stubbornness stalled the effects of the persuasion spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like our meal is almost finished.

People will think you're up to mischief if you wear your underwear in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan blushes upon hearing the remark. He was so busy trying to keep tabs on Mimi that he forgot to make new clothes, yet if Mimi didn't rush him it wouldn't have been a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I have just what you two need.\" Marsha said as she magically whipped up clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know magic!?

For such tiny creatures they were surprising strong and fast, which the group learned the hard way. At the start of the fight J.T. began an incantation, hoping to reinforce themselves with some ents. So concentrated on his spell, he did not notice a red gumyum dash towards him. Before he got halfway done with the spell, he was knocked out from a quick jab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one member of their group dropping so fast, hope for winning this fight faltered. The group was already outnumbered by the tribe, losing a member so easily was not reassuring. Despite their doubts, Mimi and Marsha fought hard though not to great effect. Mimi, with her daggers, could not hit the small creatures as they easily dodged her stabs. Marsha, while having better luck with her spells, could not keep up with the overwhelming number coming from all sides. As a last ditch effort, Marsha prepared to unleash one of her most powerful spells. She never got to finish the cast however, as a sneaky foe had climbed a nearby tree to drop a rock on the mage\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a thud, Mimi got a glance of her last companion falling. Fear flooded the thief, knowing she could not win this fight alone. Panic and selfishness took over the girl as she attempted to flee, leaving her friends to their fate. Unfortunately for her, she was not careful and tripped over a fallen tree branch. Before she could get herself up, she felt a huge force hit her in the head, causing the world to go black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi groggily awoke an hour later. Her head still dazed out, she didn't question why she couldn't move most of her body. While trying to recall what happened, she noticed she moving. Did she fall asleep on a cart? A sudden bump shifted the thief\u2019s head, giving her a quick glance at her friends tied up, being carried by strange creatures. Memories of the previous fight flooded the girl\u2019s brain, getting her out of her stupor. Instinctually the girl tried to struggle, only confirming the fact she already knew, that she was tied up as well. The Gumyums apparently were professionals at capturing people as the ropes gave no budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly Mimi was propped up against a wall, finally giving her a better view of the situation. She found herself in a small enclave, surrounded by woods on all sides. Besides some ruins and a wagon, there was not much to the area. Martha was right next to her, still apparently knocked out from their previous encounter. J.T. on the other hand was on a stone table in the distance, with a strange cloaked woman checking him out. While Mimi wanted to shout at her for her freedom, she knew she couldn't as the group was smartly gagged. All she could do was listen in and pray that an opportunity would present itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he will do fine for her majesty,\u201d the hooded figure cackled. \u201cAs promised, you can keep the others.\u201d  Swiftly J.T. was throw into the back of the wagon by the Gumyums. As the wagon slowly headed into the distance, the Gumyums turned their attention back to the girls. Picked back up, Mimi was dragged to what would be her final destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during their forced trip, Martha had woken from her unplanned nap. Martha as well tried to struggle before realizing she was having no such luck. Turning her head a tad, she crossed paths with Mimi\u2019s gaze. Martha\u2019s eyes were full of fear, believing that this would be both of their ends. Though Mimi didn't want to admit it, she was starting to believe that as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the two found themselves entering a strange village, presumably the home of their captors. Home might have been kinda of a stretch though, as neither of the girls saw any type of house. What they did see was a large cauldron, with some strange markings on the side, containing a glowing liquid. Another member of the gumyum tribe stood on top of the pot, slowly stirring the liquid with a wooden spoon. Without warning, tons of gumyums seemed to spawn from this pot, slowly climbing out of the goo. While some walked off in various directions, most of the newly created creatures slowly marched to an unknown destination around the corner. The girls got an answer to where they were headed off to as they rounded the bend, though they wished they hadn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner laid a huge blob of an elf girl. From a distance one could be forgiven for thinking that she was a house because she easily was the size on one. Fat rolls cascaded her body, with massive breasts laying on top of them. Her appendages were mostly sucked into her body, with only her hands and feet being barely visible. Her wide thighs and gargantuan ass were battling her belly to make themselves visible, currently doing a pretty good job. On top of all the fat laid her head, way less massive then the rest of her body but still had a double going on triple chin with some chunky cheeks. Her face wore a blank expression, as if she was in another world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha and Mimi were so shocked by this discovery, it took them a couple seconds to notice what happened to the gumyum line. The group slowly climbed the expansive body of the elf girl, almost like explorers climbing a massive mountain. When a few finally made it to the top, the girl slowly opened her mouth, allowing them access to march straight through. One after one, the tiny creatures marched to their doom, straight into the girl\u2019s waiting mouth until there were none left. As if on queue, as soon as they all finished their task more tiny footsteps could be heard behind them, as another group prepared their own climb. It would seem that this was to be their fate. Horrified, the girls went back to struggling against their bindings. Just like before however, the rope didn\u2019t budge at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued through the strange village, finding more girls in similar positions as the elf earlier. All were massive blobs of their formers selves. A human girl laid on the left with breasts so massive they fell over her extended belly. A cow girl on the right was so enormous that her GumYums had to build structures to climb her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the two girls found themselves entering what seemed to be the only human structure in the village. It seemed to be a storage area of some kind, as the place was loaded with extras of the enchanted cauldrons. In the center rested an ancient contraption, that they were being brought towards. The girls were finally put down facing towards the strange device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it sensed their presence, the device seemed to turn on. A rainbow of colors seemed to erupt, as words began to form on the front of it. A spiral pattern suddenly started to form around the words, forcing the girls to stare at the device. Finally the words formed stating two instructions, relax and eat. With the device fully operational, the two girls found their minds being cleared of everything but these commands. Memories of previous adventures, friends, and lovers were locked away inside their brains. Both girl\u2019s eyes slowly started become glassy as they stopped struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the device doing its job on pacifying the girls, they were slowly moved over to a pair of the cauldrons. The Gumyums moved the girls like rag dolls, positioning each girls breasts to point into a pot. The gags and ropes were removed, as they were no longer necessary. Now with their captives all set up, the show could begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge army of Gumyums entered the room, making a beeline straight towards the girls. Just like outside, they climbed up the two dazed girl\u2019s bodies and entered open mouths. Though their minds were lost, they could still taste the almost disgustingly sweet candymen enter their bodies. They could also feel their bodies slowly start to bloat up from all the empty calories. As they continued to swell up their breasts started lactating, emptying into the awaiting cauldrons. After the first drop of milk hit the pot, the weird inscriptions on the side started to light up. The magic of the cauldrons slowly started to take form, as the milk inside was turned to match the glowing liquid from before. After their pots were full of strange liquid, they were herded outsides to join their fellow captives in forced gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later a wagon slowly pulled up to the strange village. While the delivery of fresh pots was a regular occurrence for the village, the driver of the carriage was. Apparently the Queen of Tarts had decided to visit her creations on this day to marvel in their work. While the feeders continued their marches towards their victims, the other Gumyums bowed and cheered at their masters visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her servants delivered the cauldrons, she marveled in some of her creation\u2019s works. She gaped on how big her favorite victim had become. The elven girl had stupidly tried to overthrow her and payed the price. She now must have weighed at least a ton, maybe even more. As she took in the massive fat rolls, the jumbo breasts and juicy bottom a sudden heat took over her. After calming herself down she decided that the elf would have to become her new bed or throne, sending a message back to her castle to gather some slaves to transfer the elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued her way towards the storage room, the Queen noticed two new additions to the GumYums lair.  She wasn't familiar with the chubby bunny but she definitely remembered the obese cat girl. The cat was one of the newest adventurers to try to take on the lipomancer, and now she shared the fate of most who tried. The girl was now three times the size of when she entered her kingdom and only growing fatter by the minute. Even if she could free herself from the spell, she couldn't escape her fate as she was now immobilized by her own body. After a quick fondling of once proud thief, the queen chuckled as she left the foolish girl to her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate: <br>\r\nC.T. : slave of Queen of Tart.<br>\r\nMimi : hypnotized and force feed for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(First bad end of a story, how did I do?)</span></div></div>",

Once they were there, magic lights sprung to life, and the two saw two magic hoses spring to life.

Despite her girth however, she also had a considerable amount of muscle, her face was soft yet at the same time still strong looking, her meaty yet firm arms could flex to easily reveal plenty of muscle, and her stance showed she wasn't troubled in the slightest by her sheer weight, even after long treks or sprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her soft girth made wearing armour difficult, a combination of her pachyderm nature and magical defences (such as enchanted clothing, talismans and magical skin markings) meant that she still had plenty of protection, meaning that hammers, bolts and arrows often bounced off or smashed themselves apart against her flesh, swords, axes and pole-arms failing to cut through her skin, and even spells could simply wash over her without doing much damage (though that would prove mostly ineffective against what she would later face). It was for these reasons that she often overcame unsuspecting adversaries with ease, as they tended to underestimate her due to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer latest endeavour would find her trekking to a far away land ruled by an unknown entity, the place was known mostly for the fact that practically every part of it tried to fatten up residents and visitors as much as possible, often leaving people far larger than normal even if they know their way around the place. For Coco however this was assumed to be of little significance, as her already massive frame wouldn't mind a few extra kilos considering how heavy she already was. Still the rhino knew not to underestimate the place, as she may be large already, but getting too cocky or careless may cost her her mobility, which even for her would be going too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter days of travelling, the knight finally reached her destination, and noticed right away that the reports were completely accurate.

She thought it was silly, but Sally has always had an adventurous spirit, sometimes daydreaming about going out into the world, exploring the ends of the earth, meeting new and interesting people, and finding lost treasures....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, finding a man and settling down was also somewhat appealing to the young cowgirl, especially if that man was the young wolf who moved into the house by their farm... She had asked around town, finding out his name was Roland, yet she was still far too shy to introduce herself to him. Yet that didn't stop her from sneaking out at night to peek into his window while he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUNK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuooo....\" She grunted, shaking her head and wondering why the hell it hurt so much. Then as the stars faded from her vision, she saw the tree right in front of her, \"Whoops... heheh, must not of been payin' attention again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright there? Looks like you hit your head pretty hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" She gasped in surprise, turning her head to look behind her and seeing the wolf boy standing there smiling and holding a stack of books on archaeology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off guard, Sally pushed her shirt down past her overalls, exposing a fair bit of cleavage and thrusting out her bosom in an sloppy attempt to look more... appealing. \"Oh, I'm fine...\" she cooed in a sultry voice as she turned toward him, \"Just carrying these heavy buckets back to my little abode...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoland didn't seem too seduced though, as he simply looked off to the side a little and snickered, \"Need any... err... help miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, quite offended, snorted, trying to act gruff in order to distract him... or herself... from the fact that her furred cheeks had turned a bright red, \"I think I can handle myself, thank you.... Now why don'tchya run along back to your little home puppy? Looks like you've got quite a bit of studying to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted again, turning abruptly away from him as she stuck her snout into the air and continued on her way down the road, leaving the wolf boy to blush this time, confused and somewhat embarrassed by his neighbor's odd behavior...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods, between this and having to put up with her peeping tom habits...\" He mumbled to himself before marching on to do what he was doing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued on, the young, flirtatious cowgirl was started to get tired. Between carrying around this huge weight on her back, and getting all hot and bothered from meeting with her hunky neighbor, she was really starting to sweat.... She pondered on whether or not to kick back and take a tiny little rest...</span></div></div>",

Roland.... you goooorgeous pup! How 'bout ya come over heeerrre... gimme' somethin'....\" She muttered in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if accepting the invitation in the wolf boy's place, the vines snaking their way through the grass began to curl themselves up and around the amorous cowgirl's legs, sliding across her thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted a little bit, yet still continued to doze, \"Oh Roland... You tease!\" She moaned, licking her lips, \"If you want me so bad, then go ahead and take me you biiig boooy....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines ignored her, continuing to wrap around Sally's legs... pulling them closer together and binding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhh..... you DOG!\" She grunted, blushing and smiling coyly, \"Bondage...? I hardly knew ya were sooo.... kinky....\" She lazily opened an eye, but when she awoke, she found her fantasy not being acted out by her hunky lupine crush, but by the local flora, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAIIIEEEEE!\" She screamed in terror, trying to desperately pull the unrelenting tendrils off of her legs, only to have them wrap about and bind her arms as well, \"Nuh, NO! Help me! SOMEBODY HAAAAYLP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly the vines began to pull at her, dragging her across the ground, taking her towards where they came. She kicked and screamed uselessly, even attempting to grab at one of the buckets, yet only succeeding at tipping them over as she was drug deeper and deeper into the forest and away from the path with increasing speed and roughness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she was drug through the forest screaming, Sally tried to think fast, attempting to grab onto anything she could to slow the vines snatching her away. Her hands finally found the trunk of a rather large tree, her nails digging into the bark desperately as she called out for help. Yet even though this did stop her forced journey through the woods, the plant only began to tug harder and harder. This increase of strength didn't help her at all as her grip slowly began to weaken, the pain from the efforts of the vines increasing. She yelled in dismay when, finally, her grip slipped and she began hurtling backwards again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her voice got tired and the vines grew more careless, her screams turned to grunts and whimpers as she slid across the ground, hitting all sorts of rocks and crashing through several bushes. By the time the wicked tendrils finally returned to their lair with their prize, pulling her past some obscuring shrubs and into a dark tunnel, the poor cowgirl looked worse for the wear. She was covered in minor cuts, scrapes, and mostly dirt, sobbing helplessly as her \"captors\" took her deeper and deeper into the cave system. Her clothes weren't in such good shape either, her overalls torn here and there and stained with earth and grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey seem to take hours for the poor, distressed cowgirl, but it was actually only a few minutes since she was snatched from her peaceful slumber. Finally, after being drug so far, she began to slow down, gently coming to a stop in a large cave filled with lush vegetation. The vines binding her hands and feet together unwound, yet the ones curled tightly around her individual limbs remained as she was hoisted into the air before the largest plant in the cavern. What appeared to be a large purple pod soon began to open, petals unfurling to reveal the most exotic and beautiful flower Sally had ever seen, so beautiful, in fact, that her sobs soon turned simply to sniffles as she gazed in awe, not realizing that the vines constricting her were slowly bringing her closer to it as even more vines began to curl about her limbs and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer awe soon turned to concern however as one of what she had mistaken for the flower's many stamen began to prod at her, curling around her body as if it was examining her. The cowgirl whimpered at the prodding, her lip quivering as she whined, \"Please don't kill me or eat me... I'm not that tasty... I promise not to hurt ya if ya let me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, the prodding tentacle retracted a bit, then shot towards her, forcing it way past her lips and down her throat.  Her eyes widened in terror as she screamed past the tube invading her esophagus, thrashing and struggling wildly against the vines holding her in the air. Yet it was useless, the tendrils only tightening their grip on the young girl as something began to pump through the tube and down her throat. Slowly, her stomach started to fill with the warm, sap-like liquid, soon forcing her belly outwards more and more. She grunted in pain, closing her eyes as tears seeped out out and the rips in her clothes began to widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the rest of her was swelling out as well, the strange sap reacting with her metabolism in new and bizarre ways. Yet it didn't feel that uncomfortable, more like a warm, pleasant sensation spreading throughout her body as it bloated with fat, inch by inch. The feeling of this even began to sooth the bovine, her eyes opening a bit, hardly even crying now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her frame began to grow curvier, the helpless cowgirl tried to struggle less, the increasing girth feeling almost comfortable, even as it strained her clothes, the buckles on her overalls barely able to hold back the overwhelming tide of her belly and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't completely at ease though, worries starting to stir her out of her daze as she realized what was being done to her. She knew she had one last chance to escape from this, or else she might never escape at all...</span></div></div>",

She chomped down on the vine as hard as she could. The vine in her mouth must have been more sensitive than the vines that dragged her through the forest, because biting it proved to be very effective. The strange plant let out a piercing shriek that echoed around the cave. The vine in her mouth yanked itself out and the vines holding her arms and legs dropped her to the floor of the cave. The vines pulled back inside the huge flower then the petals of the flower closed protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn't want to wait for the plant to recover so she got to her hoofed feet and ran out of the cave. As soon as she was out of the cave she examined herself. Thankfully she had gotten away before the stuff that the plant was pumping into her stomach could cause her to gain more than a few pounds. Her breasts and udder definitely looked bigger, but the rest of her body had gained so little that barely noticeable. In fact she wouldn't have noticed at all if it wasn't for the fact that her clothes felt a tiny bit tighter than before. The cowgirl shivered at the horrible memory of what just happened. Despite the small change, the experience still horrified her. She has always worked extra hard on the farm in order to keep a slim figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced herself to put it out of her mind as she took a look around. That was when she realized that she had no idea where she was. That plant had dragged her so far through the forest that she was now completely lost! After thinking for a few minutes, Sally picked a random direction and started walking. She just had to hope that she would get lucky and find someone to guide her out of the forest. It wasn't much of a plan, but it was the only one she could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally walked for about 15 minutes before she saw something through some trees far in front of her. It was hard to see what it was, because of all the trees. She squinted her eyes for a moment before she realized what she was looking at. It was a castle! Feeling excited, Sally ran towards it. When she arrived she realized that the castle was very large and it looked very old. There was a small moat surrounding it, but thankfully the drawbridge was down. Something about the water in the moat looked strange but she couldn't figure out what so she put it out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd, I don't remember ever hearing about a castle in this forest.\" Sally muttered to herself before she shrugged, \"Well, maybe there is someone inside who can help me get home.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling curious, Sally leaned forward and closely examined one of the feedbags. The designs stitched into the feedbag looked quite ornate. Sally felt a small tinge of jealousy as she silently wished that she had equipment this expensive on her farm. She knew that would never happen, but she could at least admire such a fine piece of craftsmanship. After looking at the feedbag for a few moments she reached out and lightly touched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Sally touched the feedbag it appeared to take on a life of its own. The leather straps on the feedbag moved like legs as they pressed against the table. The leather straps launched the feedbag into the air and towards Sally! She barely had time to gasp before the feedbag hit her. The leather straps wrapped around her head and the feedbag was jammed against her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MRRFFF!\" Sally's startled scream was muffled by the feedbag on her face as she desperately struggled to pry the leather straps off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the poor cowgirl lost control of her mouth. Her mouth startled chewing and slurping down the oats and grain in the feedbag at a furious pace. Her mouth kept gulping down the horse food despite the bland and disgusting taste. No matter how hard Sally tried she couldn't get her mouth to stop. Sally's belly began to feel full and her shirt rode up a little as her tummy bulged a small amount. Thankfully the feedbag was soon empty. The leather straps that were holding the feedbag to her face suddenly loosened on their own and the feedbag dropped to the stable floor. As soon as the feedbag was off Sally regained control of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does everything want to stuff me today?!\" The cowgirl yelled as she quickly scrambled away from the feedbag on the floor. She didn't want to stick around in case it decided to do anything else to her so she ran out of the stable and closed the wooden door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stood in the courtyard catching her breath as she examined herself. First that bizarre plant had made her gain a few pounds and now that force feeding feedbag had done the same thing. Her stomach now had a small yet noticeable bulge and her entire body felt slightly heavier all over. Thankfully, the damage to her figure looked minimal. She could still... technically... be called thin, her body was just a little... chunky in places. She got a lot of exercise working on a farm so she could probably get back in shape after a month or so. The real question that disturbed her was how she was gaining weight so quickly. It shouldn't be possible to gain so much weight in such a short amount of time, no matter how much food a person eats! It was almost as if any food that entered her stomach was being digested and turned into fat at a furious pace. She knew It didn't happen instantly though, because her stomach had felt full for a few minutes after being forced to eat that grain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious to her that something magical was going on. The cave with that strange plant in it wasn't too far from this castle so these places were probably connected somehow. She knew that she should get out of here; unfortunately, the drawbridge had raised after she crossed it so she was trapped in this castle. It looked like she had no choice but to keep on exploring this strange place. She just had to hope that she could find someone here that could help her escape and get home. Sally knew that she wasn't an adventurer. All she wanted was to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked at the main doors to the castle's keep as she prepared to go inside, but then she saw another door nearby. She must have overlooked it the first time she looked around the courtyard. That wasn't too surprising considering that the doors were against the ground. It must lead into the castle's dungeon. Sally isn't sure if she should head into the castle's keep or the castle's dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could make up her mind she heard the sound of the stable doors opening. The cowgirl turned around and gasped when she saw the feedbag from before pull itself out of the stable and into the courtyard. She was on the other side of the courtyard, but even from there she could see that the feedbag was once again full of grain and oats. It must have refilled itself from a supply in the stable somewhere! Despite its lack of any eyes the living feedbag must have seen her as well, because it began to move towards her. The feedbag was quickly pulling itself along the ground with its leather straps in a way that looked very bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn't want a second helping of oats and grain so she quickly made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

Her hooves clomped loudly on the courtyard's cobblestone path as she got closer and closer to the door. She spared a second to cast a quick glance over her shoulder and saw that the living feedbag was chasing her. Despite the bag's small size and strange method of moving it was slowly gaining on her! For a moment, Sally wasn't sure if she would reach the door in time, but an extra burst of speed caused by adrenaline helped her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl reached the door and after quickly grabbing the handle she yanked the door open. Sally darted inside, then pulled the door shut behind her. She made it just in time, because a moment later she heard the feedbag hit the door. She could hear the sound of the feedbag's leather straps scratching at the other side of the door like an animal trying to get in. Sally leaned against a nearby wall as she struggled to catch her breath. A minute or so later she realized that she couldn't hear the sound of the feedbag scratching at the other side of the door anymore. She put one ear against the door and still didn't hear anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be gone.\" Sally said aloud to reassure herself and calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped the doorknob and opened the door a little, then stuck her head outside to take a peek. It didn't take her long to realize the stupidity of her mistake, because the second her head peeked out the feedbag lunged at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shi... MRRFF!\" Sally was interrupted as the feedbag latched itself onto her face with its leather straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor cowgirl once again lost control of her mouth as it started chewing and slurping down the grain and oats inside the feedbag. The horse food tasted no better than it did the first time. Pulling on the straps holding the feedbag to her face still proved useless. After a few minutes, the feedbag was empty and it released her just like before. The feedbag then skittered away back towards the stable. It was doubtlessly going back to refilling itself with more oats and grain. Sally obviously didn't want to wait for it to return so she pulled her head back inside the castle's keep and closed the door. She had gained a few more pounds just like last time. Her clothes were starting to feel tight around her chest and butt. She knew she couldn't let herself dwell on it, because she could start panicking so she put it out of her mind and focused on her surroundings instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing in what looked like the main entrance hall. There were several doors nearby as well as some strange paintings on the walls and a few odd statues on top of large ornate pedestals.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally decided to get a closer look at the lone \"normal\" painting out of the collection that hung upon the walls. She walked over to it carefully, unsure she should quite trust anything not to go wrong today. Upon examination, she found the painting to be a still life of a feast-laden table, rather exquisitely done, in fact. It was almost, she thought, like looking in a window\u2026 like you could just\u2026 reach out and touch that delicious, delicious food\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, perhaps not fully in control of herself by this time, slowly raised her hand and touched it lightly to the painting. The world suddenly swirled and spun, and she closed her eyes to steady herself. When she opened them again, she was no longer in the castle\u2026 but nor was she yet free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods\u2026!\" she gasped, nearly breathless, \"This looks like the painting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, before Sally lay the extravagant feast so exactingly rendered in the painting she had been looking at just a moment ago. But, if the smells that hung heavy in the air were anything to judge by, it was as real as she was. In fact, she might have been inclined to believe she had just stepped through a door into another room were it not for the fact that\u2026 the fact that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shook her head, brow furrowing. \"What painting? There's no paintings in here\u2026 Just all this food! Good thing, too; I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her roaring stomach, unmindful of the way it squished slightly under her hand, Sally moved forward to the feast. She spotted a particularly scrumptious-looking slice of cake and bit into it. Moist and flavorful as she had never experienced before, it was easily the best cake she had ever tasted\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I thought nothing could beat my cooking, but it seems I was wrong!' Sally thought happily, moving further down the table while munching on another few slices of cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPies, cookies and brownies disappeared one by one, but not quite into her stomach. Instead, as she ate, Sally was slowly swelling outwards underneath her overalls. She felt simultaneously stuffed full and completely unsatisfied. Her belly began to take on a stuffed look, remaining round as it grew to press against her overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips were not excepted, straining the stitching on the sides below as her rump rounded out behind her. Even her bust grew more, lifting up the shirt she wore beneath her overalls and putting more pressure on the already-stressed straps holding it together. Sally had grown to the size of many of the doughy housewives her age she had so desired to avoid imitating, a soft and weakened shade of her former self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally suddenly paused with her hand perched over a plate of rather perfect-looking steaks. Eating the feral members of her own half-species wasn't something she generally did. It felt too close to cannibalism\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet she was so hungry! Her stomach was roaring fit to frighten a dragon, and those steaks could very well be the only things to satiate her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally swallowed hard, closing her eyes as her head swam with all manner of confused thoughts\u2026</span></div></div>",

The steaks looked so delicious... what harm could it do to eat one? Sally slowly reached out and picked up one of the steaks. She brought it up to her mouth and opened wide to take a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could bite down, a mental image flashed through her mind. She saw a painting of herself hanging on the wall of the castle. But in the painting she was incredibly obese to the point of immobility. Her painting looked just like the paintings of all the other obese people in the hall. She had a strange feeling that that would be her fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Sally shouted as the mental image shocked her back to her senses. She tossed the steak away from herself and it hit the wall with a disgusting splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the room was filled with a bright and overwhelming light. Sally squinted her eyes shut reflexively as the light became unbearable. As soon as she closed her eyes, she felt herself being flung through the air. The air was knocked out of her when she landed on a hard stone floor. After she regained her breath she opened her eyes and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was back in the castle where she was before she touched the painting! The cowgirl looked over to where the painting was and saw nothing except an empty picture frame hanging on the wall. Resisting whatever mental enchantment the painting had put on her had somehow caused her to be ejected from the painting which was destroyed in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one. Thank goodness I escape unhar...\" Sally's voice trailed off as she looked down at her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had all the fat her body gained when she was in the painting! Her slim figure was officially ruined! She now had a small pot belly and her body jiggled a little all over. Her clothes still fit, but they were feeling quite snug in places. Thankfully, she couldn't quite be called overweight let alone obese. But if she didn't escape this place, she knew that would change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could things get any worse?\" Sally sobbed as she looked at her ruined figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in answer to that question, the living feedbag from earlier skittered out of the shadows on its leather straps. It had once again refilled itself with more grain and oats from the stable and had come back after her. The front door was still closed so it must have found another way into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, that question was rhetorical!\" Sally shouted at the feedbag as it ran towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was close enough, the feedbag pushed off of the ground with its straps and leaped through the air towards her face. Sally almost dodged it... almost. The blasted thing smacked into her face and immediately latched on with its leather straps. Just like the two previous times, Sally lost control of her mouth and started gulping down the oats and grain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, Sally swallowed down the last of the grain. The feedbag detached itself from her face and skittered off into the shadows. It was doubtlessly going back to the stables for more oats and grain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone already!\" Sally shouted at the feedbag as it disappeared from sight. Thankfully the feedbag only causes her to gain 3 or 4 pounds each time it attacks her, but raw grain and oats taste terrible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she should get out of this part of the castle before it showed up again. There was an ornate staircase leading up to the next floor as well as several hallways connected to the entrance hall.</span></div></div>",

The stairway was quite ornate with a small curve at the bottom and a fancy rail on one side with a wall on the other. There were more paintings of obese people on the wall of the stairs, but Sally was careful to stay far away from them, she didn't want to risk being sucked into another painting after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but wonder though if all the obese people in the paintings are actually real people that got trapped in the paintings like she almost was. Sally stared at an obese person in one of the paintings and saw the eyes move! The people in all of these paintings are definitely real people! For a moment she wondered if she should try to rescue them, but then she saw one of the paintings that had several obese people in it gorging themselves on a large feast. That was probably what happened when more than one person touched one of these paintings. One person would get pulled into a painting, then their friends would try to rescue them only to get pulled into the painting to. After that, none of them would be able to resist the delicious food and they would all end up being trapped in one painting. There wasn't anything that Sally could do to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl looked away from the paintings and continued to climb the stairs. She still wasn't used to the added weight on her figure so she was out of breath when she reached the top. She looked out a window at the top of the stairs and saw that the sun had set quite a while ago. Sally opened her mouth and let out a wide yawn. This day had been a nightmare for her and she felt exhausted. She looked around her and saw several doors. She opened the nearest one and saw that there was a guest bedroom inside with an ornate king sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll worry about getting out of this place tomorrow, after I get some sleep.\" Sally muttered to herself as she collapsed on the bed. She was asleep in only a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Sally woke up. She glanced out a nearby window and saw that it was still nighttime. She began to wonder why she had woken up before morning when she heard something. It sounded like something was moving beneath the bed.</span></div></div>",

When she reached the end of the bed, the cow girl slowly lowered her head towards the floor, her hair falling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the covers, Sally was met with nothing under the bed except darkness.

Her hooves clomped on the floor as she walked back over to the bed with her cow-like tail flowing behind her. She grumbled to herself in irritation at having been woken up as she climbed back into bed. A few minutes later she was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally woke up the next day and to her surprise she discovered that she was tied to the bed! As she struggled feebly against the bonds she realized that there was something wedged in her mouth that was keeping it from closing. Sally looked at the strange object and saw that it was a large clear tube with a thick and yellow liquid oozing through. The liquid was oozing into her mouth and she was swallowing it instinctively to avoid choking. She looked at the other end of the tube and saw that it was connected to the bottom of a large tank with the words \"Pure Lard\" on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did that come from?! Sally wondered to herself silently as the feeding tube kept her from saying it aloud. She was sure that the tank wasn't there before she went to sleep. How could someone get it into the room without waking her up? Just how long had this tank been filling her tummy with lard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked down and what she saw would have made her scream if she wasn't gagged by the feeding tube. The feeding tube must have been filling her with lard all night, because her body was now a bloated blob of jiggling fat. She was so big that the restraints keeping her tied to the bed weren't really necessary anymore, because she was now completely immobile with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" Sally gasped as she sat up in bed. She looked around in confusion for a moment until she realized that it was just a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness it was just a nightmare.\" Sally sighed with relief. She was still in the bed in the castle, but she wasn't tied down or immobile with fat, but she still had all the fat she had gained in this place before she went to sleep. She looked out the window and saw that it was now morning.</span></div></div>",

She never was a morning person, but since she still wasn't used to all the weight her body had gained yesterday she felt even more tired than she usually did in the morning. Her fur was wild and ruffled from her night in bed. Her eyes were crusty with dark bags under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee...\" Sally groaned as she unlocked the bedroom door and stepped out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally always had trouble remembering anything that happens to her in the morning before she has any coffee, but luckily she was very good at finding it. She raised her nose in the air and sniffed a few times until she caught the tantalizing scent of coffee. She began to follow the smell like a bloodhound. She followed the aroma back down the stairs that she had gone up last night. Then she started to follow the smell down one of the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee...\" She groaned again sounding like a zombie moaning for fresh brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living feedbag came into view as it skittered around the corner at the end of the hallway she was walking down. It immediately started moving towards her with the obvious intent of making her eat more grain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally glared at it with her bloodshot eyes and growled, \"Not... now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feedbag stopped in its tracks so fast it almost left skid marks on the floor with its leather straps. It seemed to shake with fear as it hesitated for a few moments. Evidently it decided that it should come back later, because it skittered back in the direction that it came from and disappeared around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coffee...\" Sally continued to moan until she reached the source of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow girl entered the room that the aroma was coming from and discovered that it was the castle's kitchen. There was a cat girl standing in front of a counter chopping vegetables. Her back was to the door so she didn't see Sally enter. The cat girl was the first person that Sally had seen since she had entered this castle. The cat girl was very obese which wasn't very surprising considering everything that this castle had been doing to Sally. What was more surprising was that the cat girl was completely naked except for a chefs hat on her head. The cat girl's belly, thighs, and butt were so big that she waddled around ridiculously as she walked. The woman looked like she was only 70 or so pounds away from complete immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked around the kitchen until she spotted two coffee pots on a counter. One coffee pot had the letter R on the side that must have stood for regular. The other coffee pot had the letter E on the side. E must mean espresso, Sally reasoned. That was just what she needed to wake up!</span></div></div>",

Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her face to regain her senses (and cover up her blush), Sarah shook her head, \"It's fine, I know some people like that, so uh, what now then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Nora went to one of the kitchen counters and pulled open a draw, then closing it after pulling out a tiny object, she walked back to Sally, opening her pudgy paw to reveal a golden ring, \"Just put this ring on, and you'll be magically connected to the castle, meaning that it will look after you and make sure you're all good and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow, the cow-girl took the ring, examining it, aside from the odd markings around the outside, it just looked like an ordinary gold ring, then again considering the nature of this place, she knew looks could be very deceiving. Shrugging, she slipped the ring onto one of her fingers, finding it fit surprisingly well. \"Huh, is that all? That isn't so ba-UUUURRRPP!!\" eyes widening in surprise, sally's hands went to her belly, which was gurgling and growling like mad and realising a ton of gas, and they widened even wider when she felt the damn thing growing again! Straining against her already tight clothing. \"What's URP happening to URP, me!?\" She cried, looking at Nora as she felt her butt straining against the backside of her overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat-girl looked at her apologetically, \"I'm sorry, but pretty much everyone who works and lives here has to be obese, masters orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could retort, Sally let out another loud belch, taking a step back as her body swelled bigger and bigger, while she would have been somewhat glad to know that her clothes seemed to be growing with her, at the moment she was too panicked to care, belching more and more as she got bigger and bigger. After what felt like ages to the cow-girl (but was only a couple minutes in reality), the swelling stopped, leaving her far larger than before. Letting out one last belch, she began to moan, rubbing the massive glob of fat that was her belly. \"I'm, I'm huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora walked up to her and started rubbing too, causing Sally to coo, \"I know, probably a quarter ton by the looks of things, fitting for your species I must say,\" The annoyed glance sent her way did nothing to change her opinion, \"What? It's true, cows tend to be pretty huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Sally sighed, appreciating the rubs too much to really complain, even though she wasn't really full, the feeling was still amazing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora looked at her new fellow resident, looking as though in thought, \"You know, I think there might be someone who could help you escape,\" at the half inquisitive look she received, the cat-girl continued, \"The rings protect and nurture us, but they also keep us here, keep us from running away or resisting, and always keeping us fat, but I've heard a rumour about how a co-creator of the rings, an elven enchanter who also lives here has found a way to make the rings loyal to the wearer and the wearer alone. But as I said, it's just a rumour really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the cat-girl, Sally spoke up, \"This is probably the ring talking a bit, but let's get something to eat and a place to sit down, then...\"</span></div></div>",

Everything else she had encountered in this castle wanted nothing more than to fatten her up. She wouldn't be surprised if this cat girl would try to do the same thing. So it was best for her to stay hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow girl sneaked over to the counter with the two coffee pots on it. The cat girl's back was still turned so it was easy for Sally to reach the coffee pots unnoticed. She carefully lifted up the coffee pot with the letter E on it, then tip toed back to the door. She went back into the hallway with the coffee pot in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, some coffee.\" Sally muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a sip straight from the pot. The coffee was at the perfect temperature and tasted wonderful. She took another sip and then another until before she knew it the coffee pot was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" Sally sighed as her drowsiness faded away, \"Now to keep looking for a way out of this castle. Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally went to take a step her balance was thrown off by a strange weight in her belly. She stumbled and fell to the floor of the hallway. She looked down at her belly and was surprised to see that her belly was bulging out ridiculously. The strange thing was that her belly didn't look like it had gotten fatter so Sally wasn't quite sure what was happening. But then she heard the loud sloshing sounds coming from inside her tummy and she finally realized what was going ton. Her stomach was bloated with coffee and had to have been holding several gallons of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Sally exclaimed, \"I didn't drink that much! There wasn't even that much in the coffee pot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach suddenly began to swell up even more as the amount of coffee in her belly continued to increase at a steady rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No!\" Sally wailed as she struggled to stand up. Unfortunately her swelling belly was constantly messing up her sense of balance so each time she got to her feet she ended up falling to the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Sally looked like she had a large beach ball under her shirt and it was still getting larger. The coffee in her continued to make loud sloshing noises every time she moved. She kept swelling larger and larger and her clothes started to rip. In only a few minutes her clothes were in shreds. She was completely naked with a belly that had enough coffee in it to fill a bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to swell up she kept standing up and falling to the ground. But after several more minutes she could no longer stand up... because her feet couldn't reach the ground. Her belly had grown so big that it reached the floor and had pushed the rest of her body up enough that her feet couldn't reach the floor. She was now completely helpless, but her ordeal wasn't over yet because her belly was still getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, Sally's whole body was practically spherical. Her hands, feet, head, and breasts were the only things that were visible on her huge round body. Her belly continued to swell until Sally was sure that she was about to pop like an overfilled water balloon, then the swelling stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the cat girl was in the kitchen filling her coffee cup. She took a sip, then frowned and said, \"Needs sugar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe emptied her cup of coffee into the kitchen sink. She returned then shoved several spoons full of sugar into Sally's mouth, forcing her to swallow each one. The cat girl grabbed one of Sally's breasts and tugged on one of the tits. Fresh hot coffee poured from the nipple, refilling the coffee cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally let out a faint whimper. Whimpering was all that she could do now, because her body was too bloated to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now!\" The cat girl scolds her, \"The Lipomancer declared that you are to be the castle's only source of coffee. I know it's not fair, but if I defy the Lipomancer I could end up becoming the castle's second source of coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally whimpered again as the cat girl left. She wondered how things could possibly get any worse for her. The question was soon answered when the living feedbag entered the room then latched onto her face.</span></div></div>",

Looking at it from the bed, her reflection looks like one of those women that try to make themselves look thinner by wearing clothes two sizes too small. Unfortunately for her, this didn't help hide her figure in the slightest. She wasn't exactly wearing a corset or girdle or anything, and her clothes were now so tight that you could see that her now bigger boobs were straining her shirt, even beneath her overalls. Said overalls were pretty stretched as well, so much so that the \"V\" shape in the back partially exposed the tight panties on her fleshy rear. Looking in the nearby cabinets, she found only clothes that would fit much larger women. Looking at her tight-fitting clothes, Sally decided to keep them on, holding onto the hope that she can become the way she used to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen sally opened the heavy wooden door, she saw that there was nothing in the hall while stepping outside with her chubby legs. Sally walked down the hall, seeing many types of art featuring all kinds of fat women and a few men as she did so. Sighing Sally stares at one of the paintings of a woman so obese that you could not even see her arms or legs in the picture frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I get out of here before I end up like <i>her!</i>\" She whimpered, looking over the morbidly obese woman's painted face while she rubbed her dome of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Sally rubs her stomach, she noticed that her belly button is starting to peek out, enough so that she could feel it beneath the fabric of her overalls. Moving her paws to her sides, she also realized, with no small amount of shame, that she had acquired a prominent set of love handles over the course of her stay at the castle. In fact, they had grown so big that they pushed up her shirt and sagged out the side of her overalls, forming clearly visible fleshy roll like a muffin top. Trying to save some of her dignity she pulled the shirt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later Sally found an old staircase made of clearly rotting wood that lead up to another floor in the keep. As Sally was climbing the staircase she could hear the wooden planks creaking under her considerable weight. Sally then heard the familiar sound of the feedbag and, looking behind her, she saw that the feedbag had brought along another feedbag! But this feedbag seemed to be filled with some kind of yellowish liquid that oozed out as it came toward Sally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that dream was a vision of what was coming,\" Said Sally as she realized that the new feedbag was filled with liquid lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the feedbags were a bit away so Sally tried to climb up the staircase at a faster pace when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cowgirl was just starting up the treacherously creaking steps when she was suddenly struck with an idea. Sally stopped climbing the stairs and turned back to look at the pursuing feedbags and, when she had determined that they were far enough away, she put her plan into motion. She lifted her bare, rock-hard hoof up into the air, grasping the banister for balance, before bringing it straight down into the dead center of the first wooden step of the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>CRACK!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe step gave way with barely any resistance beneath the combined might of her bovine hoof and the weight of her tubby body. Even though she nearly lost her balance, saved only by the presence of the hand railing from a messy tumble, a triumphant grin spread across the blonde farmgirl's lip while her eyes sparkled with gleeful hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess being a big girl has <i>some</i> advantages! Now I just need to get the rest of these...\" She murmured as she moved up to the next step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to do the same for the next several steps up the staircase, making certain that the planks were completely cleared away. By the time the feedbag carrying the oats had reached the bottom of the stairs, they were completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>CRASH!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wooden splinters of yet another step fell to the floor below and clattered loudly, echoing throughout the silent hall of the castle. The feedbag tilted back, as if to look at the cowgirl with the front of its body. Oats spilling off the top of the overstuffed foodsack while it shook in what Sally could only interpret as anger, low grumbling noises voicing the animated accessory's frustration. It was a little disturbing, but it only served to bring another smile to Sally's face as she caught her breath from her improvised renovations. She was finally rid of this damn thing, at least until it found another flight of stairs, but she had finally denied the damnable menace its purpose, her first victory against the feedbag! That alone was enough to give Sally a great deal of smug satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh haha!\" She screamed in elation, leaning back against the wall next to her and giggling almost uncontrollably, \"You don't like <i>that</i>, do ya, you miserable little sack! I'll give you this though: You're sure as hell are determined, aint ya? You just want to fucking stuff me, and force those bloody damn <i>oats</i> down my face, well I'm sick of 'em! I've eaten them for the last time, you hear?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cowgirl turned about, sticking her nose in the air like a prude before shaking her pudgy rump at the twitching feedbag teasingly and continuing to climb up the steps, \"So you take that abominable shit and get out of here, cause I'm done stomaching tha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Creeeeeeeaaaaak... <b>CRACK!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she had any hope of reacting, the step in front of her gave way under her weight! The bovine lass clung desperately to the banister as her chubby leg hung over open air. The feedbag, which had gone from throes of anger to drooping forlornly, now shot up to attention as if ecstatic, lurching and hopping to the floor directly beneath the hanging cowgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meep...\" Sally whimpered as she looked below her at the anxious bag of oats, now hopping into the air towards her, straps mere inches from brushing her hoof, \"Seems my noble knight is here to catch his precious damsel...\" She grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to let herself fall into the waiting grip of the cursed feedbag once more, Sally tried to free her leg from the collapsed stairs, but as she was pulling it loose from the hole she had made, she heard yet another dreadful creak as the railing she was depending on started to bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, please don't...\" She gasped, breathless as she squeezed her eyes shut, \"Please no, please no, pleeeeeaaase....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Snap!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight cowgirl came crashing down, her hefty hips and bulky body smashing through a couple more stairs before she was falling through air and, shortly after, landing with a rumbling thud against the floor of the hallway. A forced grunt escaped Sally's lips as the wind was knocked out of her lungs, and as she lay on the cold, stone ground, gasping for air, she heard the familiar sound of the feedbag's metal buckles clacking against the tiles, right next to her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I know I said... huff... a lot of rude... mean things... but if you could just\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young bovine didn't have the chance to finish as the straps of the feedbag whipped through the air and wrapped around her head, screwing itself yet again onto her snout and cramming its bland, filling contents into her chomping maw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit longer than previous feedings, several minutes in fact. Sally was sure the damn bag was filling itself tighter and tighter each time. All she knew for sure was that she was glad it was over for now, and that she hoped next time the infernal piece of equipment would fill itself to bursting... Literally. As the bag unfastened itself from her face, she grabbed it and slung it against a nearby wall, where it shrieked upon impact before landing and scurrying out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that thing...\" She grunted, bringing a paw to her rounded, oat-packed belly and grimacing at its tenderness. Yes there was definitely more this time: She almost felt stuffed, \"I need to get out of here... before that pain in the ass comes back... again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet all Sally really felt like doing was lying there on the floor. Her belly still felt too full of crappy filler to move too much, and she still felt achy from the fall earlier. Thus it took her a couple more minutes before she attempted to sit up, doing so with a bit more effort than normal thanks to her gut and the soreness she felt from her impact with the ground. While she was thinking of standing up however, a rather unsettling sloshing sound caught her attention. As she was getting to her feet (Or hooves rather), she slowly turned around towards the source of the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had feared, it was the second feedbag she had glimpsed down the hallway before, the one stuffed with lard instead of oats. In fact the thing was so full it seemed to be weighed down considerably, its movement slow and sluggish as it sloshed and dragged its greasy cargo down the hall, leaving a disgusting trail of yellow ooze behind it as bits of lard dripped and dribbled loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" Sally said, gaping at the monstrous satchel in horror while slowly backing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she felt something suddenly wrapping tightly about her left leg, causing her to scream out in absolute fright. She looked down to see the empty feedbag clinging to her pudgy leg with one strap, the other thrashing freely through the air. Sally tried to pull the thing off of her leg, but as she did so the other strap lashed around her arms, effectively binding the three limbs together and causing her to fall once more to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dammit! LET ME GO!\" She cried out in vain as she struggled on the ground against the empty feedbag while the lard-packed one dragged itself towards the helpless farm girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was unable to stop the lardbag as it carefully gripped her head in its tendrils, pulling its body and its repulsive contents towards the bovine's scrunched snout. The cowgirl's mind reeled with disgust as her muzzle slid into the lard filling the bag, and while she wanted to keep her mouth shut and tried her best to achieve as much, like with the other bags she hardly had a choice. She immediately found herself mindlessly noshing at the greasy mess her face was now jammed into, and while it didn't taste quite as bad as it looked, she <i>really</i> did not enjoy having to devour something so purely unhealthy and harmful to her body. Sally groaned as more and more of the nasty substance oozed down her throat, filling her already stuffed belly for what felt like hours. It was only a few minutes before the contents of the lardbag had been completely emptied into her however, and she found herself chewing on thin air instead and smacking her lips messily. The empty feedbag binding her slowly loosened up before scurrying away down the hall. The bag around her mouth soon did the same, though quite a bit more sloppily as goopy blobs of lard dripped from her lips and chin, the cowgirl grunting and gasping as she breathed in fresh air once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuffed, bloated farmgirl lay against the floor on her back now, groaning and moaning from the pain of her distended stomach and the stupor of her greasy, horrible fattening \"meal\". She brought a trembling paw gingerly to her stomach, finding that even though her overalls still remained amazingly clasped, her shirt had now ridden up her belly almost to her breasts. She whined and grunted groggily, shaking her head as her paw moved across the giant swollen curve of her gut, not liking that she was finding quite a bit more than she had expected. Finally after feeling her gurgling, sloshing stomach over for the third time, she laid back against the stone tile floor, staring dully at the ceiling before her heavy eyelids fell across her vision and she drifted into a glut-induced slumber...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cowgirl ran up the staircase as fast as she could, but stopped halfway up as she heard it creak loudly, threateningly under her weight. She gasped and stopped, holding onto the banister as she looked down at the seemingly weak step while pressing down with her hoof, tentatively giving it more pressure than usually. The step bent, but surprisingly still held firm, most likely thanks solely to the support of the surround structure, and so she took one quick glance back at the pursuing feedbags and continued to run to the top of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as she reached the top of the flight, she barreled through the door, stumbled to stop her momentum, and then pulled the door shut behind her, flipping a small latch on the wall next to it to keep it locked. She leaned against the wooden barrier, panting lightly and trying not to notice how her rounded potbelly almost sagged against the surface of the door. Feeling a cool breeze brought her out of her rested state momentarily however, and as she turned around and examined her surroundings, she realized that not only was she now outside, she was in the same exact courtyard when she first entered the castle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s impossible!?\u201d She gasped, completely dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt had to have been, Sally did not remember seeing a side door into the courtyard at all, but here it was, right across from the stable! And then there was the matter of having climbed two sets of stairs, and yet now she was back at ground level. Just what the hell was going on with this place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnfortunately she didn\u2019t have time to think this through before she was brought back to reality by the sounds of the feedbag\u2019s straps clattering against the other side of the door. It was soon joined by the hammering of the leathery appendages of the other bag she had seen before, but thankfully it seemed as though they were once again trapped on the other side and had to find a way around to reach her. It was over for now: She was safe once again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u2026Until the heavy feedbags started hammering against the door with their bodies. Sally\u2019s eyes widened as she felt the door budge considerably, despite the lock, and she backed away from the besieged portal. The cowgirl watched, terrified, as the feedbags rammed against the flimsy door once more, forcing it to bend against the lock so much that the one containing the oats was able to wedge itself between its edge and the wall. The monstrous satchel squirmed and writhed frantically, the single leather strap that had made it through to the other side flailing through the air while oats spilled across the cobblestones. Sally rushed up the steps to the keep, pulling open the doors and slamming them shut once more behind her, mirroring the first time she had ever entered this foreboding foyer. In fact, Sally felt overwhelmed by a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as she once more looked around at the disturbing paintings and sculptures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she looked around, she caught sight of the empty painting once again, the one she had been trapped in\u2026 Or maybe dreamed she had been trapped in last night. But as she looked at it from the door, afraid to get any closer, she saw the messy state of the feast in the art piece, and knew immediately that is was no dream. She stared at the painting nervously, woken from her troubled daydreams by the all-too-familiar sound of the feedbags scratching at the wooden door behind her. Wary to get any nearer to the side of the room and anxious to find some way out of this place still, Sally plodded over to the left side of the entrance hall to examine the ways out of here. There were only two exits on this side, one was a short but wide hallway directly in front of her with more doors leading out of that, and another was a door smaller than the others before in the side of the staircase. Sally pondered for a moment before making her choice of path.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was really more like an antechamber to the much larger grand hall, but was a bit darker, being more recessed, only a few lit candlesticks adorning the walls of the room. Sally slowly stepped inside, looking about the area not just to take in the sights, but to make certain that whichever direction she went, it wouldn\u2019t lead her back to where she began in one giant circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe room, like the adjacent one, was decorated with paintings, though fewer in number and most of them quite a bit smaller, most of them simple portraits. She still knew better, however, and put good distance between herself and the unsettling artwork. There were also a few tables, two small ones to her left and right and one in the middle, which held bowls, candelabras, and even a couple busts (Of course depicting obscenely heavyset subjects. Besides that, there wasn\u2019t much else to note besides the musty rugs and decaying wallpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere were the doors, of course, two on each side, left and right, and one directly across from Sally. The young lass stopped momentarily to think about her choices. If she chose the doors on the left side, she would likely just end up back in the courtyard eventually\u2026 But if she chose the doors on the right, then she would just be heading deeper into the castle, and more than likely into more tricks and traps. All of this, of course, was assuming that the basic logic of navigating a house was still in effect here, and she was just imagining things or more lost than she thought when she wound up back in the courtyard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo of course, the best choice would be for her to go through the door at the opposite side of the hall! Sally nodded, assuming that it would hopefully lead outside of the dreaded castle, and walked over to it, gripping the doorknob and taking a deep breath. She then opened the door and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe found herself not looking into another room or hallway, as she had expected, but instead looking out over the castle courtyard from what seemed like a few stories above it! She trembled slightly, not really a fan of great heights, and stuck her head out through the doorway, gripping its frames as she looked around. It seemed as though she was high up in one of the watchtowers lying at the corners of the courtyard, and although there was a small balcony directly on the other side of the door, she felt more comfortable on the near side. In fact she felt much more comfortable with the door closed, and so she slammed it shut, breathing heavily and sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2026 I must be hallucinating\u2026 Maybe I\u2019m just tired or something, but\u2026 but that wasn\u2019t real!\u201d She said, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStill, however, she moved onto another door, this time on of the ones on the left side (Now on her right as she faced the entrance hall), figuring that heading away from the center of the keep was still better than heading further into it. She tried the left door and found it to be locked. It shouldn\u2019t have felt odd to Sally to find a locked door in a place like this, but when it was the first one she encountered after all this time wandering around, it kind of stuck out. She frowned, grumbling as she tried it again just to make sure, before moving on to the door next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt first, the space the door led to seemed to be quite ordinary, if pointless. The room was completely furnished in stone bricks, not very wide across, but about three times its width in depth. It was quite dark, but Sally could still see what appeared to be puddles of\u2026 something\u2026 dripping down the walls\u2026 No, wait\u2026 not dripping down, but flowing towards her? There was also a heavy, overwhelmingly sweet aroma that filled the room, strong enough for the cowgirl to smell clearly even as she stood outside of it. Her curiosity, in the end, got the better of her, and she stepped through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe immediately let out a startled scream as she lost her balance completely and tumbled to the ground, \u201cBwuhgh..?!\u201d She gasped, completely confused and all but a little rattled from the unexplained fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn\u2019t clear to her what had occurred at first; in fact Sally almost became hysterical. As she looked around the room, she had realized that the door had disappeared entirely, and began to panic as she assumed she was trapped. A few moments later, however, and she soon realized that the door wasn\u2019t gone, but had just moved\u2026 to the floor. Then, as she looked around once more, seeing how small the room was, but how tall it had become, she came to the correct, if insane, conclusion: Somehow gravity had shifted as soon as she walked over the door\u2019s threshold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSally twirled around, still confused, her hooves clattering against the stone while her tail swung through the air. How the hell was this even <i>possible?!</i> It simply wasn\u2019t\u2026 not normally. Yet Sally started to calm down much more easily now, especially after all of the crazy things she\u2019s seen the past couple of days. Sure, bending physics is crazy, but compared with cursed paintings, vicious vines, and living feedbags? It all had to be some kind of maniacal sorcery at work, and despite it all starting to seem less and less spectacular, it still made the farmgirl\u2019s skin crawl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStill, it wasn\u2019t long before Sally regained her composure, and her initial curiosity returned. She pushed her chubby bulk up and looked at the walls, realizing that the strange liquid substance was, in fact, dripping\u2026 though now in the \u201ccorrect\u201d direction. There were also large pools of the black stuff on the ground, and although most of it had long since dried, she found a spot that was still wet and stuck her finger in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my mother warned me not to do this\u2026\u201d She frowned, examining the glob of slime at the end of her finger, \u201cBut she sure as hell didn\u2019t prepare me for all this other kooky shit, so, here we go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuck her finger into her mouth and winced. The goop tasted even sweeter than it smelled, however it was deliciously so, and not overwhelming in the slightest. Sally felt comfortable enough to open her eyes by this time and, to her amazement, she didn\u2019t look even the least bit fatter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell thank the gods for small favors, I guess\u2026\u201d She giggled as she looked around the room, up towards the ceiling, \u201cBut I wonder what happened to the rest of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShaking her head dismissively, Sally got onto her hands and knees and crawled back out the doorway, carefully this time. She felt a bit queasy as the natural gravity on the other side of the portal pulled her to the floor of the side hall, and she clumsily got back up on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that was fun\u2026\u201d She said, closing the door behind her and frowning, realizing how much time she was wasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnly two doors left now though\u2026 well two unlocked ones. Both of them seemed to lead deeper into this bizarre abode, but after the other ones, Sally couldn\u2019t even be certain of that. Still she was optimistic that one of them <i>had</i> to lead <i>somewhere</i>. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAs much as Sally thought over her choices in her head, there was really no way to tell which door led where without opening one up. Still, she wasn\u2019t too eager to do even that\u2026 Sure, the other two doors hadn\u2019t exactly harmed her, but they were pretty strange, and what if something worse was still waiting for her? What if on the other side of one of these doors was another of those feedbags, or some other monster wanting to feed her or\u2026 well, actually <i>eat</i> her? She really wasn\u2019t so sure she was better off waiting out here though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs fate would have it, that last thought was proven true as a series of clattering echoes filled the foyer. This was followed soon by the feedbag dancing down the grand staircase and heading towards Sally, its fiber-rich contents spilling out the top and eager to fill the woman\u2019s mouth. Not wanting to give the infernal object any more opportunities to fulfill those desires, Sally swung open the left door and slammed it closed behind her. Once safe on the other side, she let out a sigh of relief, but her brief moment of rest did not last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbout a minute after she had shut the door, she heard the expected sounds of the feedbag clawing at the other side. What she didn\u2019t expect, however, was the doorknob to rattle. She soon realized that she wasn\u2019t even sure if the feedbag could open doors like these: The other ones she recalled didn\u2019t even open by doorknob! She held the bulb of the handle tightly, teeth gritting as she glanced about the door for a lock but couldn\u2019t find one. Damn it though, she was <i>not</i> going to wait around this place all day! She looked around her surroundings, finding herself in a thankfully normal looking, if gloomy, hallway. But it wasn\u2019t the d\u00e9cor she was looking for, it was a barricade, and fortunately she found it in a nearby grandfather clock. She ran behind the large, aging machine and leaned against it, pushing at the thing with all her weight behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs such, the clock unsurprisingly came crashing down almost immediately, the bulky wooden object now lying on its side but completely blocking the door from opening. Sally smiled, though her joy was cut short by her coughs from the rather copious amount of dust her moment of improvisation had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAck\u2026 I really hope nothing heard that\u2026\u201d She gasped between coughs \u201cThough this place looks even less lived-in than the other places I\u2019ve been to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIndeed the corridor she had discovered looked like it hadn\u2019t been inhabited in decades at least. Cobwebs hung from nearly every place they could, the dark wallpaper was torn and peeling, and dust covered literally every surface. It was dark as well, the only light source being a nearby lit candlestick, which the cowgirl took to light her way. Sally stepped forward into the hallway, the weight of her body causing the floorboards to creak ominously beneath the musty rug, looking at the various doorways along the walls and trying to determine which of the many would lead her to freedom. She walked for quite a while, wanting to at least reach the end of the corridor before she made her choice of exit, and yet it seemed as though the hallways were endless. What made it even more confusing was the fact that while there were many, many doors, not once did Sally see a window. When she thought she saw an end in sight, it turned out to simply be a corner, leading into another corridor, sometimes branching into two. She soon realized that she was in a maze of hallways and that she was exhausted and had no clue where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess that wasn\u2019t a normal door after all, now was it? Or maybe it was and this damn place is just that big,\u201d She sighed, plopping down on a couch she had found in a small sitting area that rested at a four-way intersection of corridors, \u201cAnd so many doors... how do I know which one is the right one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe frowned as she gazed forlornly at the candlestick, watching as it flickered and burned, the light it gave off shimmering against the surface of the small table she set it on. For now it gave her a small bubble in the darkness, but it wouldn\u2019t be much longer until it burnt out completely, leaving her all but blindly fumbling through this labyrinth. Sally knew she had to decide fast whether she wanted to keep trying to find an end to this maze or if she was simply going to go through one of the doors instead. What was the poor, lost cowgirl supposed to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally nearly leapt from the couch and swept the candlestick into her paw. Lounging about in a murky hallway wasn\u2019t going to get her any closer to home, so she decided that she might as well keep looking around, at least for a little while longer. If she didn\u2019t find an obvious exit, then she could simply pick any other door she wished and see where that leads. And so, hooves clopping against the groaning wooden floor, she set off down the twisting corridors once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDespite the fact that there were no signs of change in the hallways, nor anything pointing to any one door being more significant than the others, Sally continued to explore them for quite a while. She had to admit it at this point: It was more out of curiosity than anything. Sometimes the cowgirl would find something interesting that kept her intrigued: A painting, for example, or a nook in the wall that held a couple of chairs. One time she even found a rather large hole in the wooden planks of the floor, more than big enough to swallow her up if she stumbled in and far too deep for her to see its bottom by candlelight. It was nearly as frustrating as it was exciting though, as she had to find her way back to the last intersection of corridors. In a way, the wallpaper, the exquisite d\u00c3\u00a9cor, and the constant presence of finely crafted (If disturbing) artwork reminded her of her old home, her other life, before she abandoned them both. Her desire to investigate the musty halls was beginning to run out though, and by the time she heard the recognizable sounds of metal clicking against hard floor, it was all but extinguished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDammit! How the hell did it find me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl looked around her, but she couldn\u2019t see the diminutive, but dreaded feedbag anywhere. Yet, even though it was out of her sight, the thing must have sensed her somehow as the clattering of its buckles grew louder, its pace quickening. Sally nearly tripped over herself as she began to run down the hallway, still unsure of where she was headed. She found herself tiring quite quickly, not used to running so fast and so far with her newly acquired weight. The cowgirl did not slow however, only having to realize how much her breasts bounced and her ass and thighs jiggled to remember what would happen if she were caught. Amazingly, it seemed to work, and soon Sally couldn\u2019t even hear the sound of the feedbag over her panting. She couldn\u2019t see it over her shoulder yet either, so that was good as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u2026 I think I los-AUGH!\u201d She exclaimed, having run straight into a suit of armor. She knocked it over, but fortunately for her, kept her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately though, she dropped her candlestick, the holder clacking against the floor as the candle itself breaking free and rolling along the ground before being extinguished. Sally cursed to herself, knowing better than to stop now, but also knowing all too well how dangerous it\u2019d be to keep fumbling about this place in the dark. Fearing capture by the feedbag or finding another pit and falling into it, she ran into the nearest door, slamming her bulk into it while turning the knob open The door was heavy, opening slowly, but as soon as she was through, she slammed it back shut, fairly used to doing this by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Stupid feedbag\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl leaned against the door panting, looking about the room she now found herself in as the feedbag finally crashed against the door, scratching and clawing at the other side. It was a bedroom, bigger than the one from before it seemed, and rather exquisitely furnished as well. The most notable thing about the room though was the absolutely gigantic bed in the middle of it. The window was also open, the cowgirl noticed, odd but not really that important. What was important was that the noise from the feedbag was now absent\u2026 was it a trick like last time? Or was the feedbag really gone now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally knew she really shouldn\u2019t check, but her sense of curiosity usually didn\u2019t listen to reason. She finally decided that she would\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It couldn't possible think that she would fall for the same trick twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally rubbed her swollen belly nervously with one hand as she slowly reached for the doorknob with the other. She gripped the knob tightly and took a deep breath to steady her shaking hand before she turned it. The door creaked a little as it slowly opened and Sally stuck her head out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feedbag immediately latched on to her face. The poor cowgirl sighed in frustration before her mouth began mindlessly chomping and slurping down the oats in the feedbag. Her belly groaned a little as more oats were stuffed into it. Her shirt began to ride up her chest as her belly expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn't even bother to resist this time. She knew from experience that once the feedbag attached itself, it was impossible to remove it until it was empty. Honestly, she was more angry at herself for falling for the same trick again, than she was angry at the feedbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the feedbag was empty and it detached from her face. It quickly crawled out of the room, doubtlessly going off somewhere to refill itself. Sally closed the door behind it without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked down at her body to survey the damage and choked back a sob. Her shirt could no longer cover her bloated belly, leaving it completely visible as it pushed her overalls out into the shape of a small pudgy dome. There was no denying it anymore. Sally was fat. If the feedbag catches her just a few more times, her clothes would probably rip apart. She took a small amount of comfort from the fact that she was still several times smaller than the obese people in the paintings she had seen all over this castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Sally had finally calmed down enough to take a closer look at the large bedroom she was in. Now that she had a chance to get a good look at it, Sally realized that the bed was just as big as she first thought. The bed was enormous and the legs were clearly reinforced to support a great amount of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Sally noticed a small bronze plaque with words on it attached to the middle of the bed's headboard.

Yes, the plaque definitely has the words \"Sally's Bed\" written on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of fear mixed with panic began to creep into the poor cowgirl's mind. She had never been to this strange castle before, so why would her name be written on this gigantic bed? Sally swallowed nervously as the implications sunk in. She thought that she had found this strange castle by accident, but what if it wasn't an accident? What if some force had lured her here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is absurd! I'm just being paranoid! This bed probably belongs to someone else named Sally. It is a very common name.\" Sally said aloud in an attempt to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Sally noticed a large painting on the bedroom wall that caught her attention. Like almost all the other paintings in this castle, this one showed an obese person. But there was something different about this painting. The person in the painting was a morbidly obese cowgirl with a small smile on a face that was puffy with fat. A beautiful necklace hung from her neck, the strap straining against the enormous double chin that covered most of her thick neck. White fur with black splotches covered most of her blubbery body and tiny cow horns were visible through the hair on her head. A cow tail extended out of the back of a dress that would have looked elegant, if it wasn't for the fact that it was large enough to be used as a small tent. The cowgirl in the painting almost looked like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally let out a gasp as she finally realized what it was about the painting that caught her attention. It wasn't just a painting of a cowgirl... it was a painting of her! It had taken a moment for her to realize it, because the figure in the painting had to be a least 500 pounds heavier than she is now, but it was definitely her! It was like looking into her future and seeing what would happen if she never escaped from this castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Sally shouted as she looked away from the painting in denial. She refused to accept it! This was not going to be her future! She would not become such a big fat blob!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally looked back at the painting again and gasped. The painting had changed! A feedbag was attached to the face of the cowgirl in the painting! It looked just like the feedbag that had been chasing her around this castle. Sally looked away from the painting again and when she looked back the feedbag was gone and the painting was back to the way it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was trying to send her an ominous message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?!\" Sally shouts, not even knowing if anyone can hear her.</span></div></div>",

Each slab of meat added a little more beef to Sally herself. Pronounced love handles began to grow on her sides as her belly pushed out again, and her hips began to pull her overalls apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally moved on to a plate of bacon piled nearly impossibly as high as her head, wasting no time in beginning to stuff the crunchy, greasy strips down her throat, moaning softly and happily. A rather large bucket of orange juice sat nearby, and she wasted no time in tipping it greedily into her mouth, sucking down every last citric drip from the bucket as she swelled out further. Her arms and legs thickened and softened, stuffed into her clothes like the sausages she crammed into her maw next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer overalls creaked audibly under the strain of holding the cowgirl's increasingly weighty body back as her belly came to rest slightly on the table, pushing aside plates as Sally shuffled down towards the head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sign of the ruggedness of Sally's overalls that they lasted for another half-dozen plates of omelets, buttered toast smeared thick with jams and jellies, doughnuts of all varieties, multifarious muffins, and some things she couldn't be bothered to identify before eating them anyway. Hip flesh peeked out from gaps torn up the sides, her thighs began to burst through every hole they could make or find, her bust grew large and heavy, squishing out the top and sides of her overalls, and her belly came to rest almost fully on the table, a welcome relief, for it had grown to be quite a burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, even the resilient fabric of the overalls could take no more, and simply tore to shreds, perhaps helped along by some timely magic. Sally's flesh poured forth from every direction, bouncing and jiggling. Her bust slammed onto her belly, and her belly, round and weighty, jutted out onto the table with a meaty thump, pushing aside a number of now-empty plates as it expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the table, Sally's wide hips were finally free, movement no longer restricted by fabric. Her round rump bounced in rhythm, panties riding up in an unnoticed wedgie. Her tail flicked about idly, and her thick thighs rubbed against one another, wiggling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\u2026!\" Sally gasped.</span></div></div>",

Her huge thighs rubbed together with each step and the weight of her flabby body was a tiring burden upon her.  Her breasts rested atop her belly, hanging off to the side slightly, the heavy tits swinging slightly with each loud, heavy step. She found her way down a hallway into a new room where she saw another collection of art work and what seemed to be a large bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Interesting, I am getting a bit tired,\"</i> Sally thought to herself, stopping to take a breather.  She was feeling the fat she had accumulated from the previous binge, the fat girl both somehow horrified and satisfied by the gain at the same time, the weight of her newfound girth was even starting to turn her on.  She looked at the art on the right hand side of the room, noticing many erotic art pieces. She stood far away though: She was far too afraid of getting sucked into some weird place again.

The bed was insanely comfortably as she just lay there, in fact it was so soft and warm and cozy that she hardly even thought about crawling under the covers. It seemed like she had completely forgotten about everything besides getting some nice, inviting sleep now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her eyes began to droop shut, she found herself looking across the room from her at a painting hanging upon the wall. It depicted a rather large, naked, and extremely muscular bull laying in quite a revealing pose. She didn't really remember that picture being there before, but she giggled a little at the ridiculously masculine image before closing her eyes and smiling, drifting away into slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the now sleeping Sally, she also completely forgot that she never escaped the painting she was in, and it was at this helpless moment of hers that the burly bull in the oil painting began to stir and pull himself out of the confines of his portrait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally yawned and licked her lips as she woke up some time later. Yet as she tried to pull her hand close to her face to rub the sleep out of her eyes, she realized that her right arm was tied to the headboard by the bedsheets, as well as her left arm! She whimpered as she tugged at her restraints, \"Moo...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooo.....\" Came the deep, masculine response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped and looked up to see the brown, beefy bull from the painting, only more... well, real. He stood at the foot of the bed, grinning as he looked over the bound and naked cowgirl. Sally merely blushed, too startled and completely weirded out to think of anything to say at this bizarre scenario.

It was just another trap in this crazy castle that would try to fatten her up. Her arms were tied to the headboard of the bead, but luckily the bull man had forgotten to tie down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally kicked her right leg upwards and her large hoof collided with the underside of the bull man's jaw. The bull man's eyes rolled back into his head as he collapsed to the floor. A second later, the bull vanished. Confused, Sally looked around trying to figure out where he went. That was when she saw him. The bull man was back in his painting. The bull was on the floor of the room in the painting, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally sighed in relief, then she started struggling against the sheets that bound her arms to the headboard. After a few minutes of struggling she managed to get her right arm loose. After that it was easy for her to use her free hand to untie her other hand. She cast a nervous look at the unconscious bull man in the painting. She better leave before he comes to. She rolled her pudgy body and got up off the bed. Sally left the bedroom then wondered what she should do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally realized that she was still inside the painting that she had gotten sucked into. If she remember correctly, there was another painting on the wall of the room where the food was. That painting had shown the room of the castle that she was in before she got sucked into this painting. Maybe if she touched that painting it would transport her back into the real castle? True, she would still be stuck inside the castle, but if she ever wanted to find a way out she would have to get back to the real castle first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any other plan in mind. Sally set off in search of the room with the food in it.</span></div></div>",

Tongue writhed with tongue, the long, almost prehensile appendages toying with each other as the bull delved deep into his conquests mouth. Furry palms explored the vastness that was Sally's body, one massaging one of her massive mammaries as the other gripped her backside. Sally moaned enthusiastically . His hands played her like a well tuned instrument, as they magically seemed to know of of her right places. Her gut pulsed with the warmth of the massive manhood that pressed against it, throbbing, tempting her to play with it. Her previous fear of rejection by Roland having denied her the touch of a man, this was a glorious new experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the kiss, the bull pulled back, gazing deep into Sally's eyes with a look that could melt her soul. Sally blushed deep red, her breathing short and labored. The bull only paused for a moment however, and he quickly closed the gap between their bodies again, his mouth playing over her large bosom. The targets of his efforts were a pair of hefty erect nipple, swollen from years of milking and excitement. Massaging the vast orbs that were her breasts, Sally let of a small cry as he bit down playfully on one of the two cherry nubs. Her womanhood throbbed, begging for attention, dripping a small stream of lubricant that matted the fur of both partners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating once more, the bull locked eyes again with the horny cow girl. Seeing not a gleam of resistance in her eyes, he knew his mission had been accomplished. Reaching up, he undid the restraints that had attached her to the bed frame. Almost instantly Sally launched herself forward, pressing her bulk into the massive hunk of muscle that was her lover. The bull let of a deep chortle, apparently happy with her eagerness. One of the cowgirl's hands grasped his shaft, and she let out a soft, throaty moo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her back to the bed, the bull watched happily as all of Sally's corpulence jiggled massively on impact. Mounting his partner, his manhood pressed gently against her nether lips. Sally's rapid breathing only accelerated as the tip of his shaft danced against her pussy. Then, with a throaty roar, he plunged inside. Sally's body went stiff as he thrust inside. Her arms wrapped around her lover, as their two bodies mashed together in a rush of pleasure. Breasts against pecs, gut against abs, two opposite bodies merging as one in the throws of delight. The bull withdrew and thrust again, quickly accelerating to a steady pace. Sally's entire body jiggled, her mass bouncing in time to his movement. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth and her eyes rolled back into her head as she was overcome by the hot pleasure emanating from her pussy. The bell still around her neck clanged noisily, a crude reminder of her physical body as she was transported to a sea of pleasure. Letting out a loud cry, she came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOOOOOOOOO!\"</span></div></div>",

Sally was enjoying every single moment of her sexual bliss, and delighting in the full sensation that emanated from her nethers. As the bull continued to release into her, she could feel that \"fullness\" starting to spread out to her hips- growing thicker and wider, billowing out from underneath her dream lover as they began to dominate her already large frame. The sensations then spread both down and out, passing into her thighs and rear. Her thighs blimping, pressing forcefully into each other, and burying the bull's cock into even more thick fleshy fat as he maintained his legendary orgasm. Finally her ass followed suit, becoming massive as it grew out from underneath her- so quickly that the her new lover was shoved right off her billowing, jiggling frame as the increasingly cushioned globes of her ass pushed her higher on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the musclebound bull hit the floor, he disappeared in a poof of smoke and magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally basked in her afterglow, completely unaware that her partner in size had vanished. The bed creaked and groaned under her newfound bulk as she began to sit up to investigate, her fat spare tire of a paunch squishing into her lap. It wasn't until she tried to stand up that she finally got a gauge of how much bigger she had gotten as her new center of gravity pulled her back down to the bed with enough force to shatter it under her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally leaned forward as far as she could, letting her hefty breasts and chunky belly get her the leverage she now required to haul her comparatively massive lower body off the ground. With an effort, and still in a daze, she got herself to her hooves to further inspect her surroundings. At first her sex-addled mind had her searching for her prime mate- but as she came to Sally realized the true \"gravity\" of her situation. A body mirror at the foot of the bed revealed the extent she had been altered by her unorthodox encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\", remarked Sally, taking in her new form as she jiggled and quaked waddling up to the mirror: A beautifully rounded face with a chubby snout sporting slight triple chins- enormously plump and still fairly perky mammaries that put the entirety of her hometown to shame. Her belly consisted of a roll descending upon a massive spare tire of a gut that somewhat helped in conserving her newfound undecency. Her hips were now completely engorged with fat- she had to take a couple steps back to see herself fully.<br>\r\n\"I'm so huge...\". Sally gave her side a light slap, sending ripples through into her massive thighs and colossal backside. Dragging her paw over what she could reach of her rear, Sally pressed into the yielding softness of her butt, feeling the new sensation of fat spilling through her fingers. She was now looked completely the opposite of her fit and trim self when she left her home that fatefully boring afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning fully around, Sally's body was always half a step behind her as her fat came to rest just after she did- her presence constantly announced as her thighs scraped together during each step. She inspected the damage she had dealt to the bed that previously supported her plus one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did that?\", pondered Sally as she wondered her actual weight. \"I must be easily pushing a quarter-ton!\" The realization finally sinking of how big she had become, Sally began to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The now hefty cowgirl sat up in the plush and ornate bed, looking about the room in confusion. This place, while still having the same layout as the room she had fallen asleep in, seemed different in almost every other way. The original room had been quite nice, but this place looked ritzy with soft, comfortable lighting from golden sconces, oak floors covered in exotic rugs, and rich red silk sheets covering the bed and her lower half. The perplexed girl pulled the sheets up over her bare, plump breasts as she glanced about uncomfortably until she realized what might be going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling the series of events she had been through, she found that at no point had she ever left the painting the feast was in, just went through to another room that must be deeper within this other world. It reminded her vaguely of stories she had read when she was a child telling of naive characters stumbling through portals and finding themselves in bizarre and fantastic realms, but this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was still in the painting, she concluded, then perhaps she had just been transported to another one? There wasn't much evidence to prove as such, but it was the only explanation she could think of right now. But if the room had changed, then what had become of the bull, a painting within a painting...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! The bull? Her cheeks burned red as her thoughts returned to him and the night they had spent together. Did she really just let a stranger from a painted world, a literal fantasy male, take her virginity? Did she, just a silly farm girl, let that weird beefcake mate with her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods...!\" She gulped nervously as her hand moved down to her belly, feeling its tightness and recognizing that it wasn't just stuffed with food. Yes, yes she did mate with another cow, several times if what she felt was any indication...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed even deeper as she pulled back the blankets to look down at her heavy tummy, feeling a bit of regret after what he did to her... and what she did to him! Could she really get over the fact that she had spent her first time with a boy who wasn't even real, in some crazy bedroom that didn't even exist? And more importantly, could he still have... Well, if his touch could feel as real as it did, and if painted food could add this much weight to her, it wasn't much of a stretch to worry if the bull's seed could effect her too in very real ways...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sally could begin to get over what she had been through last night however, she heard a soft moo next to her in the bed. Her body froze and heart leapt as she realized that the bull must still be in bed with her. Yet as she felt the bed shake in response to her partner's movements, she realized that there was something different about the voice she'd just heard. As Sally turned to look in her partner's direction, she was stunned by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the room had changed appearances, so too had the bull, though a bit more drastically. For instead of a beefy, muscled male cow laying next to Sally, there was instead a soft, fat female one. As Sally looked the naked woman over more, she was disturbed by just how much she looked like her, almost identical except for the fact that her fur was a darker shade of brown and her hair was almost black. The cowgirl smiled at Sally as their eyes met, pursing her pleasantly luscious lips together as she let out another soft, seductive moo as the strange bovine rubbed a paw over her own voluptuous breasts and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...\" Sally gasped, scooting away from the cow a little bit, \"Are... Are you...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sally could finish or escape, the woman leapt upon her, the two fat cows rolling in bed until Sally was pinned under the painting girl's tubby gut. The cowgirl on top of her licked her lips before pressing them to Sally's, forcing her into a deep though not unpleasant kiss as her paws fondled the farm girl's sizable belly rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Sally's mind was divided as she considered going another round with the now female bovine. On the one hand, she was already feeling regret at what she had done. While Sally wasn't a prude, she didn't consider herself somebody who took sex lightly either. Then again, it wasn't like she hadn't enjoyed her night with the bull, and she had always been curious to know how comfortable she might feel with a female partner instead of a boy...</span></div></div>",

An increasing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrought the orgasm this cow had been growing. Her dark furred skin stretched as gut jiggled further forward to rest on more and more of Sally. She was too concentrated on the face to notice anything else. The other cow's breasts also grew and the cow wrapped her arms around them, cradled them, eyes closed in rapture. The breasts came to rest on her heavy belly. No rolls, one perfect, yet sloshy and squishy orb, topped off by heavy and plump breasts of mythical proportions.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally had been afraid when she first woke up bound to the bed, but that fear had left her once she had seen the bull who had tied her up in the first place. Even as she let him touch her, let him do things to her that no other had done before, she felt no fear. Now however as she looked around a room that seemed to have changed completely, he anxieties returned to her. The room seemed the same, all the furnishings laid out in the same way, and yet the furnishings themselves seemed more elaborate and more expensive, as though she had gone from the room of a servant to that of a noble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine sighed a little as she tried to collect her thoughts, trying to remain calm despite the fact she seemed to be in an entirely new room and didn't know how she had gotten there. She remembered the bull, and what they had done the night before, and yet not how she might have ended up here. Likewise, try as she might, she couldn't recall much of anything between the last day she had been at her farm and waking up in the last room. There was something about a castle, some feedbags, and a feast... maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reflexively grabbed at her huge pillowy stomach, rubbing it as it gurgled. She frowned, and then grimaced as her fingertips sunk into her belly flab, and for some reason began to recall the feast again, and eating more than enough to fill her gut. There wasn't anything too strange about that though, right? As far as Sally could recall she had always had a bit of an appetite... and had she always been a little chubby growing up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe furrowed her brow a bit as she continued to rub her belly, trying hard to recall what her body had been like before, when her thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a groggy but tender moo from behind her. Carefully, the obese cowgirl rolled over to find her bull once more, though things seemed strangely different about him too. His fur was no longer brown, instead a creamy blond color like that of Sally's own hair, his mane matching as well, though just a bit darker and dirtier... and longer as well? As she examined the bull more closely, she began to notice other details that were off as well... his fur seemed fluffier, his hooves shinier and dark and he even seemed beefier than before, which to Sally seemed almost impossible considering the male's huge body had already been statuesque in its musculature before. The bull mooed softly at her again, this time more inquisitive though, yet still lovingly as he gazed deeply into his new mate's eyes. He was the same, those blue eyes of his were the same, yet he was so different now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you changed... didn't you...?\" Sally gulped, blushing as she looked over the bovine's naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull looked confused at first, and only shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did though! You were brown before! And umm... k-kinda smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull's eyes widened a bit as he was caught in his lie and his ears drooped as he sighed dejectedly. He let out a dull, defeated moo as he nodded his head and looked away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... thought so...\" Sally said, helpless to stop a smirk from spreading over her lips. Despite his poor attempt at deception, the cowgirl had to admit that she found the transformative properties of the environment, and her lover, to be rather interesting. At the same time though, she had a strong feeling that it wasn't a very good idea to stick around in this weird place for much longer, even suspecting that being here was what was affecting her memories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the bull, sighing herself as she reluctantly said, \"Look...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All she knew was that before coming into the painting she wasn\u2019t morbidly obese, and that she had to get out before she became even heavier or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe waddled past the bed to the far wall of the room, examining all of the pictures that hung there. There were four in total, most of them containing nude subjects or sexually explicit situations.

The painting itself was an oil painting of what appeared to be fine, masterful quality, however, though Sally was nowhere near qualified to be an expert on these sorts of artworks. The piece depicted a group of fox men, all nearly naked besides the rough, almost tribal looking loincloths that they wore, all rather muscular or in good physical shape, and all bearing red fur with various markings stained upon their faces and bodies in a very rich, vibrant blue paint. Something seemed odd about that paint, as though it were a custom from a bygone age, a tradition no longer practiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one among the males who stood out, however. He was a grey-furred fox, not old looking exactly, but he certainly seemed to be the leader, slightly larger than the others and standing calmly in the background as he watched the vulpines in the middle and foreground lounge about on rocks and silks in reverie, surrounding a huge barrel of wine from which they filled heavy goblets of gold and drank heavily from. It was clear these guys knew how to enjoy themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally considered this for a moment, smiling just a bit at the idea and blushing and giggling as she thought it through further.. She figured that even if this painting didn't offer an escape, she wouldn't mind ending up in a party full of such fine, handsome men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small plaque beneath the painting read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">Foxes at Rest</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wasn't exactly sure she'd call that resting, nor if it was safe for her to enter such a gathering of wild and rowdy men in such a vulnerable state...

All of those boys, so realistically rendered... but even so, wasn't it a little bit weird to be so excited by a painting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's not just a painting though...\"</i> She thought to herself, licking her lips eagerly at the prospect, <i>\"You know this...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell alright, she didn't know for certain, but she would soon enough! Going against her better judgement, the blubbery bovine took a deep breath and leaned her hefty body forwards, pressing the tips of her fingers into the painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the world around Sally spun about, swirling and twirling in a whirlpool of colors both vibrant and dull. The cowgirl groaned thickly as she closed her eyes, almost feeling sick to her stomach by the time her massively fattened belly slammed flat against the grassy ground, knocking the wind right out of the farm girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooofff!\" Sally wheezed, eyes now wide from the impact, then wincing in pain as she recovered, clumsily attempting to push her much larger than normal mass away from the earth below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine suddenly heard a murmur of startled voices and then felt a hand firmly, but helpfully grab her own, and then more paws of similar size all about the sagging rolls of her girthy body as they attempted to lift her to her hoofy feet. Sally groaned, letting out a shaken but grateful moo as she finally regained her composure, her eyes widening once more as she saw all of the vulpines around her, their own eyes fixated entirely on the woman before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible, tingling feeling of shame and dread suddenly filled the entirety of the obese cow lass as she remembered that she was almost entirely naked, her fat, bloated tits bared for all of the males to see, her panties all but swallowed by her meaty ass, so much so that she might as well not be wearing any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxes that had helped her to her feet let go of the cowgirl, stepping back both to give her some space and to gaze at her as well, all of them looking at her as if expecting her to say something, only eliciting an even deeper blush from the embarrassed woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Hi...\" She finally blurted out, bringing her heavy arms up over her chest to cover her exposed nipples, \"T-Thank... you? I'm... ugghh... Sally...\" She winced, realizing that this had quickly become the most awkward moment of her entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gathered tods didn't seem to notice however, their faces all brightening as they smiled and collectively shouted out \"Hi, Sally!\" with great excitement, all except for the gray-furred male, who stepped closer to the heavyset cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very wonderful to meet you Sally,\" The man purred deeply, bowing before her, \"My name is Kervos, and I must say, it is quite the pleasant surprise to be greeted by such a lovely bovine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally only blushed more, managing to barely string together a response as she continued to cling her paws over her fat breasts, \"Lovely..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course!\" Kervos smiled, a warm smile that filled Sally with an overwhelming sense of relief, so much so that she even let go of one of her breasts to take the foxboy's paw in her own as soon as he offered it to her, \"You are so strikingly beautiful, the most astounding woman we have had pass through here in quite a long while, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Haha, I think you must be confused!\" Sally protested, unable to resist a giggle at the charming fox's words, \"I mean I'm so... so much fatter than I was before! So engorged, you couldn't say... I mean... Not that I couldn't be beautiful... I'm just so ordinary... Surely there has to be some...! O-Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine stammered, blushing madly as Kervos lifted her plump paw to his lips, giving it such a tender and loving kiss, filling Sally with such wondrous warmth, \"There is no mistake Sally! Beyond the fact that we could not have met sooner of course... mmm, please, won't you stay a while with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally giggled giddily again, pulling her paw gently away from Kervos and looking away from all the smiling tods, unable to stop herself from noticing how all their tails wagged so adorably in excitement at their new guest. She smiled as she looked down at the ground, bashfully shifting her hooves against the ground as she thought the fox's proposal over, \"I... I can't, sadly... I need to find a way back home, away from this place...\" She said, looking around uncertainly, \"Wherever it is... Back towards Little Silverhorne... back to my family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine glanced warily around the forest she now found herself in with the alluring tods. The woods were unfamiliar to her, the bows of the trees above thick enough to block out most sunlight, casting a cool shade over the grove the foxes had set up in. As time passed it also seemed as though it was growing darker, a point Kervos was all too eager to point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stay a while with us? The sun is setting soon and we would love if you would spend the night...\" The silver-furred fox said, smiling as he moved around sally, pacing behind her and drawing close to place a paw upon her flabby shoulder, leaning in to growl seductively into her ear, \"You could help yourself to all the wine you want, and maybe later indulge yourself in even more intoxicating pleasures...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of home quickly melted away as she felt Kervos's tender paws rub down along the rolls of her sides, her ears perking as she felt his breath on her neck, \"It has been so long since we've had a woman's company...\" He growled, the husky cowgirl's breath quickening as she felt a growing warmth between her legs, her mind racing with lust as the lass looked over the tods who surrounded her, \"And we are all eager to please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally moaned to herself, closed her eyes as she thought, then finally replied.</span></div></div>",

As she took it in, she let out a stifled snicker, covering her mouth with her paw and blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painting in question caught her by surprise with just how unapologetically explicit its subject matter was. The piece depicting a rather extravagant bedroom, even more luxuriously furnished than the one she was in now. The painting was dominated not by the decor however, but by the massively muscular bull that lay across the bed, so large that he took up the majority of the canvas space, his body completely nude, exposing the bulging curves of his tremendously large muscles and the rather proportionally bulging manhood he sported. The Bull seemed quite unashamed of his indecent appearance, and in fact sported a lustful look in his eyes that seemed far too welcoming for its own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, how <i>dirty!</i>\" Sally cried out, snickering even more as she inspected the Bull's manly muscles, \"He's way too beefy, even for a bull! I wonder if he's even based on anyone in real life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl grinned as she pondered this, realizing that real or no, she could easily inspect those massive muscles in person. All she had to do was step inside the painting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmgirl leaned in close to inspect the name plaque below the painting, giggling even more at how simple yet appropriate it was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"Beefcake\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, Sally would absolutely love to dive into the painting and get to know that massive bovine stud, but on the other, she was almost certain that the bull couldn't possibly be a real person.

Pressing her hands into it, Sally felt the world around her spin, and she was sucked into the painting. The cowgirl felt herself collide with a shaggy carpet, which sent her rolls rippling. When she tried with enormous effort to lift herself to her hooves, Sally felt two large hands helping her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked, the cowgirl gasped and blushed wildly. The very same bull she saw in the painting was standing right next to her, looking ever so handsome as he was depicted, if not better in real life. He was grinning at her, smelling heavily of hormones, his member pulsating between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shot him a grin as well, saying in a seductive way: \"Hello there, handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo,\" was the bull's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his beefy body against her soft one, Sally feeling the warmth radiating from his fur, and he led her firmly to the large bed, wanting, just as she, to get laid. The bed was huge, taking both the bovines with room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rolled together until Sally was on the bottom and the bull was on the top.

As if responding to her wish, the bull straightened, gripped his thick cock, pushed her belly out if the way, and proceeded to push it into her wet cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally moaned loudly as the bull went to work, thrusting his hips rapidly, and the noise of skin slapping against skin filled the air. The cowgirl's whole body shook as the bull pounded her sex roughly.

For one thing it was more of a landscape than anything lewd, seemingly having nothing erotic about its subject matter; For another it seemed quite a bit more overtly menacing. The landscape seemed to be of a humongous, swampy lake, the water a thick muddy brown that dully reflected the sky. Said sky seemed to be dominated by some rather imposing storm clouds which bore an eerie green tint to them that made them even more frightening to the cowgirl somehow. Beyond the lake lay a distant shore that shifted into a dense forest, one that bore foliage unfamiliar to the cowgirl. Beyond even that was a very tall and very impenetrable looking wall, one larger than Sally had ever seen before, or ever would since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire landscape somehow unsettled Sally, as though it were a mix of both what should be mundane and what should be unnatural, and yet there was nothing too alarming... that is, beyond the slick, slimy shapes that rose from the otherwise still surface of the lake. Sally couldn't quite make out what they were, the shapes obscured by the dirty water, but that only served to bother her more. The more she looked at the whole thing, the more it disturbed her, and yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally thought about it. It was the only painting that wasn't erotic in its nature, uninhabited, and most importantly, led to a place that seemed as far away from this awful castle as possible. If there was a portal here amongst the paintings then surely it had to be the only one that didn't fit, right? It was worth a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose strange, slimy shapes caught the cowgirl's eye again, and she couldn't ignore them. Then again, maybe it wasn't?

Finally, she brushed a lock of her long, blond hair from her eyes and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may look weird, even a little creepy...\" She sighed, groaning a bit as she stepped closer to the painting, \"But it looks like it definitely leads outside, so at least it's worth a shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, she was sure that at least there ought to be another way out if it was simply another painting, either back the way she came, or even more enchanted art pieces. Sally gulped, taking a deep breath before she pressed her fingers against the canvas and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the room spun before her, her vision suddenly a confusing maelstrom of light and dark,  a nauseating blend of colors that twisted grotesquely. Sally squeezed her eyes shut, lest she lose her lunch, and opened them to a whole new world, an entirely new atmosphere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said world was dozens of feet below her, the atmosphere completely surrounding her body, was enough to send Sally screaming for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's protracted and panicked exclamations only ended once her fat, bloated belly collided with solid ground. Much too solid for the cowgirl's liking, in fact, forcing the air right out of her lungs and sending her entire morbidly obese body wobbling and jiggling violently, but thankfully not enough to seriously hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaws and hooves scraped against the stone beneath her as the fat woman lifted her considerable weight back onto said hooves before she dusted her bare breasts and belly off. After regaining her composure, or at least as much a nude, fat cowgirl could regain, Sally looked around the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked quite a bit like the painting, of course, though now there were all sorts of unpleasant sensations beyond sight that could fill the young woman with fear and disgust. The first to come to mind was the unbearable heat, the air muggy with humidity as well to make the temperature nearly suffocating for the cowgirl. Adding to this miserable sensation was her own body temperature, her mounds of body fat doing her little favors in that matter. Then there were the sounds: The waves of the lake against the ground beneath her and the shore, the distant roar of thunder, the calls and sounds of many different animals and insects, none of which Sally could recognize. There was something else too, coming from the shore... voices? Chanting? Singing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally began to cough and gag as she was assaulted by another sensation that the panting was unable to convey, the damn stench of the place! Saying it was revolting was an understatement, and the cowgirl was almost sure it was coming from that filthy, murky water. Retching a bit more, the bovine covered her nose as she did her best to adjust to the stink, looking out across the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing stuck in the middle of the lake was something that the cowgirl didn't quite expect when she entered into the painting, but it seemed so obvious now in hindsight. At the least she didn't land in that foul excuse for water, and there seemed to be a clear, if rather tricky, path towards the shore. Looking over the muck, she could see more areas of stone rising out of the lake just like the one she stood upon now, each smooth surface more or less square shaped. She wasn't sure if they were pillars of simply blocks, but there were enough of them, and they were close enough together that she was able to leap from one to the next with relative safety, apparently all the way to the edge of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, should be easy enough...\" Sally grunted, taking a couple of steps back on her current perch before rushing towards the edge and launching her bulk into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer landing wasn't nearly as graceful as she had hoped, the heavyset cow grunting heavily as her hooves clopped against the smooth, hard stone. She winced and gasped a bit as she stumbled forwards, nearly tumbling off the edge before she regained her balance and managed to steady herself. Laughing with relief, the female bovine gather her resolve for a moment before she leapt onto the next platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few leaps later, and the fat cow woman was heaving and gasping for breath. Sally bent over, hands placed firmly on her thick thighs as she drew in the hot, humid air. All this heat. All this damn fat. It was too much for the poor girl. Looking up ahead of her, it seemed at least she had picked a convenient place to rest. There was a sort of fork in the road now, not just one stone platform close enough to hop to but two, both of them leading to paths of platforms heading towards the shore. The right path, however, seemed to end a bit of a ways from the shoreline however, though there were some rather large and uneven looking boulders rising from the surface of the muck that Sally could risk climbing over. The left path on the other hand seemed to meander more, and was much longer overall. It would ultimately be safer for the obese cowgirl but also much more exhausting vaulting over so many gaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she had rested long enough, Sally decided to take the...</span></div></div>",

All that pressure's gone!\" Sally sighed happily, caressing her stomach softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her bust was still covered by an orange and increasingly strained shirt, that was nearly the only thing covered on the cowgirl, her once-sensible panties turned into a mere thong by her increased mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally resumed her work on the feast, nearly having reached the head of the table now, where she could see a chair sitting, as if waiting for her. Her ever-expanding belly smashed through a number of discarded dishes, sending them crashing to the floor as she dragged it along the table, eating everything in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally reached the chair and plumped into it, feeling her tubby tummy slap against her meaty thighs as she sat, oozing out over her lap. Sally closed her eyes for a minute and breathed deeply, taking in the scents of the feast, just as strong now as they had been before. It was such a good feast, picture-perfect\u2026 and she was ever so hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sally opened her eyes again, she found a surprise waiting for her. Either she or the table had moved, for there was quite suddenly food right under her nose again. Never one to question rain in a drought, Sally shrugged and dug in happily. Her shirt creaked audibly over her bust as she bulked up, breasts nearing ridiculous proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she cleaned the plate in front of her of its delicious contents, another one slid forward and waited to sate her. She squealed joyfully and dug in once more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn't stop eating even as her shirt tore asunder, didn't even notice as it disappeared without a trace. Her titanic tummy flowed outwards, a sea of flab, and her butt overfilled the chair. Hips as wide as the table itself grew even wider, supporting thighs thicker than tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn't notice when her weight became too much for the chair and she crashed softly to the floor, setting off waves that traveled through her burgeoning body. The feast didn't stop coming even then, an endless, self-serving buffet the bloated bovine beauty was only too happy keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon and very pleasantly, she reached the point of immobility, cowed by a curse of the castle, one of many. She had become a loyal subject of the Lipomancer, now and forevermore\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the castle's keep, a bony, desiccated hand reached out and adjusted the painting ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My newest masterpiece\u2026\" a voice as dry as desert sands said, chuckling like sheets of ancient parchment rubbed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill today, if you are brave or unlucky enough to find yourself in that castle keep, you might see upon the wall a portrait, exquisitely rendered, of an immobile cowgirl at an endless feast, a mammoth turkey and a goblet of wine sitting on the table before her, and see the sign below reading \"Do Not Touch\".

The vixen was sitting on her rear in the center of the pedestal. The vixen was morbidly obese with a fat gut that completely filled her lap and extended almost all of the way to the edge of the pedestal. The vixen looked so fat that if she wasn't a statue she would have been immobile. The statue had a turkey leg gripped tightly in her fat fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I had no idea that statues could let themselves go.\" Sally giggled at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling curious, Sally raised her hand up and placed it on the statue's huge belly. She gasped as the room was filled with a bright flash of light. She heard the loud sound of clothes tearing to shreds before she suddenly lost her balance and fell to the ground. A few seconds later the bright light finally faded. Once the spots before her eyes faded away Sally tried to stand back up only to discover that she couldn't. That was when Sally noticed the huge mound of flesh that filled a large part of her field of view. It took her a moment to realize that it was her massively fat belly that was sticking out four feet in front of her! Her entire body was now overflowing with fat! She was so massive that no matter how hard she tried she couldn't get up off the ground! Shreds of fabric scattered around her naked blubbery body was all that was left of the clothes that she had been wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh? What?\" Sally stammered in a state of shock before she looked up at the statue and gasped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue had completely changed! Instead of a statue of a morbidly obese vixen it was now a statue of a slim and trim vixen. Sally immediately put two and two together and figured out what happened. The statue was enchanted and touching it had caused the obese statue to become thin while Sally instantly became just as fat as the statue use to be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe touching the statue again will switch the fat back into the statue? Sally thought as she reached up towards the statue and touched it. Seconds passed and a feeling of fear began to fill Sally when nothing happened. The cowgirl began to frantically touch the statue again and again, but nothing ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally eventually gave up and sighed hopelessly. She was so fat that she couldn't even move. It was clear to her that it was now impossible for her to escape this castle. She had a strange feeling that whoever owned this castle now owned her as well.</span></div></div>",

Her hooves clomped loudly on the courtyard's cobblestone path as she got closer and closer to the door. She spared a second to cast a quick glance over her shoulder and saw that the living feedbag was chasing her. Despite the bag's small size and strange method of moving it was slowly gaining on her! For a moment, Sally wasn't sure if she would reach the door in time, but an extra burst of speed caused by adrenaline helped her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl reached the door and after quickly reaching down and grabbing the handle she yanked the door open. The doors were set in the ground at a slight angle and opened upwards like the doors of a storm cellar. There was a downward staircase on the other side of the door. Sally went five steps down the stairs before she turned around and pulled the door shut above her. She made it just in time, because a moment later she heard the feedbag hit the door. She could hear the sound of the feedbag's leather straps scratching at the other side of the door like an animal trying to get in. Sally sat down on the cold stone of the stair steps as she struggled to catch her breath. A minute or so later she realized that she couldn't hear the sound of the feedbag scratching at the other side of the door anymore. She put one ear against the door and still didn't hear anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be gone.\" Sally said aloud to reassure herself and calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped the door latch and opened the door a little, then stuck her head outside to take a peek. It didn't take her long to realize the stupidity of her mistake, because the second her head peeked out the feedbag lunged at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shi... MRRFF!\" Sally was interrupted as the feedbag latched itself onto her face with its leather straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor cowgirl once again lost control of her mouth as it started chewing and slurping down the grain and oats inside the feedbag. The horse food tasted no better than it did the first time. Pulling on the straps holding the feedbag to her face still proved useless. After a few minutes, the feedbag was empty and it released her just like before. The feedbag then skittered away back towards the stable. It was doubtlessly going back to refilling itself with more oats and grain. Sally obviously didn't want to wait for it to return so she pulled her head back inside the castle's dungeon and closed the door. She had gained a few more pounds just like last time. Her clothes were starting to feel tight around her chest and butt. She knew she couldn't let herself dwell on it, because she could start panicking so she put it out of her mind and focused on her surroundings instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went down the staircase until she reached the bottom. At the bottom of the stairs a hallway lined with torches stretched out in front of her. Sally calmed her nerves as she walked off down the hallway. She followed the hallway until she arrived at a fork where it split in two directions. One hallway went off to the left and the other went to the right. On the wall was an old sign with two arrows on it. One arrow pointed to the right hallway and had the words \"Fenra's Lair\" written above it. The other arrow pointed to the left and also had some words above it, but the letters were so faded from age that it was unreadable.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps she didn't know what a lair was, or perhaps she'd decided that, having given her own common sense the past few hours off when she'd decided to enter the castle, she might as well just give it the rest of the day off, as well.  In any case, she set off down the right-hand hallway, to Fenra's lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noted that this hallway was fairly similar to the previous hallway:  It was lined with torches, and...  Nothing else to note, really.  The hallways weren't that interesting.  What <i>was</i> interesting, though, was the large stone archway at the end.  She couldn't quite make out what lay beyond the arch, but she was sure that it would be something...  Interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found she was at least somewhat correct as she approached, though, as she was greeted by an enormous pile of golden coins, gemstones and various regalia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" she exclaimed.  Perhaps it <i>wasn't</i> such a bad idea to come this way; she'd found more gold than she could ever spend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  Except, of course, that this room was Fenra's lair.  We mustn't forget that.  As Sally scrambled among the golden pile, picking up golden coins and sparkling gemstones, a steel gate silently descended from the arch, sealing her inside; she didn't know that yet, though.  She also didn't notice a rather small dragon dozing beneath a sparse layer of gold and gems, that was beginning to awaken at that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" muttered the dragon.  \"Ah, an intruder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon erupted from the pile of treasure, sending golden coins and silver goblets flying in all directions.  As unobservant as Sally could be, she noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!\" she screamed as she tumbled down the pile to the stone floor below, landing on her considerably padded ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who dares to enter the lair of Fenra the Dragoness?\" she roared.  She was expecting an adventurer, but instead found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  A cow?\"  Fenra sighed.  \"I <i>never</i> get any <i>real</i> adventurers to fatten...  No matter.\"  Fenra let loose a plume of fire from her mouth into the air, which horrified the terror-stricken Sally even further.  \"Cow!  You face Fenra, Mighty Dragoness of the Lipomancer!\"  Even though Fenra was small by dragon standards, her 20 feet in height still intimidated the cowgirl quite effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you submit, becoming a servant of the Lipomancer, or do you <i>die</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some would find the dragoness' monologue somewhat cheesy, Sally didn't.  She'd gotten herself into a real jam, here, and it didn't appear there'd be any way out...</span></div></div>",

She swept aside the pile of bones Sally had left, taking care to separate the skull from the rest of them (Fenra figured she should \"collect\" skulls, just as any good monster should), and stretched herself over the side of her mountain of treasure, dozing off once more as she awaited more foolish adventurers...

A low growl came from the giant feedbag, and Sally took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...I should have know it wouldn't have been that easy...*sigh*...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mega feedbag reared and hopped up and turned the waterfall of feed upon Sally. She let out a scream that was quickly muffled by the wave of feed that she was forced to eat from the mega feedbag. All was quiet for a moment, but then, a very faint chewing noise could be heard from within the mound of feed. It grew louder, as the pile of feed shrunk. The mound shrunk more and more, until Sally was revealed with a mammoth belly, stuffed with feed. She lay on her back moaning in pain, as her belly gurgled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally rubbed her huge stomach as best she could, trying to take away the ache of mistake. At last, her belly began shrinking and deflating, only to gain layers upon layers of fat on it. The same can be said for Sally's breasts, growing steadily and filling her top out until it finally snapped. Next came Sally's backside, filling up with flab and causing her body to raise up. Her thighs were not spared, growing wide enough to be a makeshift baby bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally had been made another of the Lipomancer's countless slaves, unable to rise from her massive weight. A dark, loud voice came from the pit somewhere. It startled Sally and she listened in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were foolish to enter the Feed Pit my dear, look what its done to you!\" The voice let out an evil laugh, and continued speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Sally, you can either become a slave of mine and do my bidding within this fortress! Or...I can have the other feed bags stuff you until you explode! Which will it be...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wanted nothing more then to be able to get out, but she couldn't of course in her current state. She had no plans of dieing at such a young age, so she regretfully told the Lipomancer she would be his slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent....Mwaahahaha! Mwaaahahahahah!!!!!\" The evil laugh of the Lipomancer echoed throughout his castle, as another poor soul was forced into slavery...</span></div></div>",

The cowgirl felt a pang of jealousy, reaching up to touch the copper bell hung around her own neck. Forged with but the purpose of work in mind, the bell had seen better days.  It was scuffed, the sheen had long since worn off, and the metal at the bottom was even beginning to shear. Compared to the ornate piece of craftsmanship before her, with it's beautiful runes and golden composition, her bell was practically worthless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl glanced around the stable once more. There was no one here, no one to see her. Surely the owner would be mad but....it was their fault for leaving it out in the first place! How could they expect her to resist taking such a glorious creation? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally removed her own bell from her neck, jamming it somehow into one of the pockets of her newly tight outfit. Tentatively, she reached out, grasping the golden bell delicately, as if she were afraid it would break. Slowly, she looped the bell's cord around her neck, and the golden object sat flat against her neck as if it was meant to be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaintly, the odd rune inscribed on its surface began to glow.<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the highest tower of castle soaring above the stable, a orb suddenly changed color from green to blue. The Lipomancer's eyes flickered over it, noting that one of his detection wards had been tripped. Red robes rustled as he activated his scrying orb. There, in the stable. The magister watched as a cowgirl wandered almost aimlessly into his lair. His fascination grew as she donned one of the cowbells he'd personally enchanted. Silently waving his hand, the Lipomancer zoomed in, examining the rune before breaking into an evil cackle. This was going to be fun to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInscribed on the cowbell was a rune simply marked......</span></div></div>",

She decided to ignore it as she was still quite captivated by the cowbell, but soon however the feeling couldn't be ignored any longer as her once small chest began to surge outward in size, her breasts rising straight towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the-!? What kind of horrible curse is this!\" She cried, letting go of the cowbell and letting it sink in between her generous cleavage, gripping her swelling breasts in both paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whined loudly with worry, stomping her hooves up and down in confusion and aggravation as her chest began to push harder against her clothing, the straps of her overalls starting to bite into her brown-furred flesh. She gripped her breasts tightly as they outgrew them, the buttons of the straps snapping off loudly, her hands the only things keeping her decent at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet her chest wasn't the only thing expanding, a loud rip beginning to sound through the empty barn as her hips started to widen, her belly began to rise, and the distinct outline of her udder began to form against her tightening overalls. She began to pant as the udder pushed at the large flap on her clothing, originally intended to allow easy access to the organ, the flap soon gave way quickly as her udder expanded and bloated along with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whined as her body continued to swell and bloat with milk, grunting and panting as she was forced to spread her legs, her stomach and udders growing wider and heavier between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuuuuhh-OOOOOOOOO!

A hot blush spread across her cheeks as she moaned from the mixed rush of agony and pleasure as her sensitive tits pushed against her hands, the terrified cowgirl still trying to hold her now massive mammaries aloft. She panted harshly, closing her eyes tight as she tried to think of what to do, a difficult task in such a state as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods, what am I going to doooo.... \" She had remembered how this had started, how when the rune on her new cowbell began to glow so too had begun the transformation, \"N-No! I can't take it off.... something so beautiful couldn't have caused a terrible mess like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed as her hooves slipped out from beneath her, her increasing girth from the milk building up within finally bringing her crashing to the ground. She groaned as her now mammoth udder slammed against the hay-covered floor, the milk-producing organ wobbling and shaking as heavily pressurized milk shot from its teats, pushed free from the force of the impact. Her blush only grew deeper as an intense feeling of relief overcame her, but it was soon replaced by the now almost continuous pain from her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's milk...\" She panted, groping and squeezing at her oversensitive nipples tentatively, \"What kind of twisted magic could be causing my entire body to be filling with milk!? I... have to... stop it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to squeeze her nipples more firmly between her fingers, continuing to manipulate them until short but thick streams of milk shot out of them. She gasped and then mooed loudly in pleasure, her eyes rolling back as she panted heavily. Yet still she continued to expand, her breasts, stomach, and udder still leading the way as far as size was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnnngh... Okay... huff.. I just have to keep doing this...\" She gulped now, \"Faster than I can grow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't quite believe in this insane logic, but she couldn't force herself to believe that her wonderful new prize could be the cause of this bizarre affliction, and so she once more started to squeeze her nipple, grunting and blushing as yet another blast of milk shot from her body. Soon another shot forth, and another, causing the cowgirl to moan and scream in pure ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as she continued to milk herself, it was quickly apparent that her efforts were futile. Not only was she quite clearly growing faster than she could milk, but now she had to deal with both the pain and pressure from her milk filled mammary glands and from the arousal blazing from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muuuuuuuu.... this... isn't... working....!\" She moaned. Tears began to well up in her eyes as she finally gave in and reached for the cursed cowbell that had done this to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe easily unfastened the belt that held it to her neck, but unfortunately for her the bell dropped between her expanding jugs and she found her paws impeded by her massive bust. As she reached for the bell, all she found was her immense, sweat-soaked cleavage. She groaned in dismay as she searched her disgustingly bloated breasts fruitlessly, the growth continuing in the presence of the cursed object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whined in terror, gagging up milk as she protested \"No... Noooooo.... <i>Moooooooooooooooooooo!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pointed at a timid, small, and somewhat pudgy elf girl as soon as he caught sight of her and paused to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there slave...!\" He panted desperately, \"What are you doing standing around?! We have a personal order from the master himself! Grab me two buckets of milk, quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep! F-From the lower stables sir...?\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time shrimp! Grab them from the one in the courtyard,\" He squealed in frustration as he ran back to work, \"And get a move on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby elf nodded and ran to fetch two wooden pails, placing them on a wooden rod which she balanced on her back as she moved towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf scurried out of a service entrance and across the cobblestones of the entrance courtyard. She stopped at the entrance to the stable, pushing the large wooden doors out of her way as she entered. The inside of the stable seemed completely silent, no signs of life seemed to be present, but this wasn't the slave's first trip to this part of the castle: She knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the row of doors that led to the stalls further inside, trying to remember which contained what she wanted, and then chose the one furthest towards the end. As soon as she opened the door, a foul odor assaulted her nose, a smell that was more than just that which was associated with livestock, but the elf simply plugged her nose and closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lay before her was a enormous cowgirl, pinned to her ass by her immense girth and weight. Yet the distribution of the fat was clearly abnormal, most of it appearing to have accumulated in the girl's breasts and belly. The girl looked up groggily at the elf, mooing softly and pathetically as she looked at the new arrival past sweat soaked locks of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh....\" Said the elf, \"It's okay, it's okay! It's your turn today hun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... is...?\" Sally groaned, smiling lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf girl nodded as she brought a bucket to her chest using one hand and gripped the cowgirl's bloated nipple with the other, \"Uh huh... Don't you worry, it'll be over before you know it and you'll feel a lot better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elf squeezed Sally's nipple, the cow grunted and groaned. When the first stream of milk was released from her that familiar wave of pleasure hit her once more and she soon forgot all about the pressure, as well as all about trying to escape...</span></div></div>",

It took even longer for her mind to make the connection through the flog blanketing her thoughts: she started growing just after the rune on the cowbell started glowing, so it stood to reason that the cowbell might be related to her expansion. Finally, she decided to get rid of the thing. Reaching up, she struggled to undo the clasp as her body continued to add pressure to the strap. The bell is eventually released and tossed to the side, the metal ringing loudly as it bounces across the floor. The rune continued to glow and her growth didn\u2019t stop right away, much to Sally\u2019s annoyance. Already her breasts had swollen well beyond her coveralls, an intense painful pressure within. Her udder had followed right along, tearing the hole in her coveralls far larger as it grew. The rest of her body hadn\u2019t escaped either, adding even more weight after what that flower had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the growth slowed to a stop, Sally moaned and panted, \u201cOh thank heavens, I don\u2019t know how much more I can take of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands rubbed the firm surface of her breasts to try and sooth the pain, and she was surprised when her massaging caused her breasts to start leaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that\u2026am I lactating!?\u201d examining the wetness that had spilled on one of her hands, \u201cWhy would that thing make me start making milk?\u201d trying to wrap her still foggy head around what had been happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepeating her rubbing on her bulging udder revealed that she was lactating there as well. Another noise coming from the stalls again caused Sally to look up and around again. Seeing nothing did little to help her fears, especially after everything else that happened.</span></div></div>",

The aches and pains from her rough-handling at the vines as well as the sensations from her overfilled breasts and udder slowed the cow girl down, but her fear drove her on and she didn\u2019t stop her hurried dash till she reached the castle wall next to the still closed drawbridge. Sally was forced to lean against the cold and worn stone, bent nearly double as she gasped for breath. The young woman was normally able to handle running for far longer, but the extra weight on her body seemed to be taking its toll. As she stood there, her eyes shut, she heard a soft pattering noise. A cold knot formed in her stomach as she imagined all sorts of things that might be coming. Gulping loudly, she cracked her eyes open to face whatever it might be. Wherever she looked however, revealed nothing and yet the sound continued. It wasn\u2019t till Sally felt something splattering on her legs that the young woman thought to look down. The extra curves on her body made the formerly simple task a bit more challenging, but she eventually managed to see that the excessive pressure built up in her breasts and udders had slowly started to take care of itself; a small trickle of milk leaking forth and forming a growing puddle on the ground. It wasn\u2019t quite going fast enough though, as her overflowing milk bags continued to feel uncomfortable. The icy fist in her gut unclenched, but not completely as the bovine considered that maybe she shouldn\u2019t be so relieved that her seemingly magically induced lactation was beyond her capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally realized that she would have to deal with it herself, so she gave another look around \u2013 though some part of her wondered what good that did \u2013 before reaching around and grasping the engorged nipples atop her breasts. It took her a while before she could get a good rhythm going, but soon enough the young bovine was drawing forth a copious bounty of milk, the splattering of which on the flagstones below could not cover the lowing that Sally was unconsciously making. The pressure on top lessened, she shifted her attention lower, though the milk continued to dribble from her breasts even without her aid. As she was working on the last set of teats, Sally heard a clatter from behind her; she spun around, nearly losing her footing on the milk puddle that continued to spread across the ground. There, in the shadows within the stable, the young woman could almost make out something just inside the door. Far easier to make out was the glimmer of what seemed to be eyes staring at her unblinkingly. Cold dread settled in her stomach again and her breath caught in her chest, though her watcher made no move towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing what else might happen, she spun around again and ran. Behind her, she heard whatever it was clattering after her, spurred into motion by her flight it seemed. Sally had no idea where she was going, just wanting to get away from whatever was now following her, but her random escape provided an opportunity in the form of the main door of the keep. Whatever was behind her was closing the gap, and Sally wasn\u2019t about to look behind to see how close it really was, her focus only on the door before her. She slammed into the reinforced wood, the doors opening agonizingly slowly, but once she had made a large enough gap, she squeezed through \u2013 tearing what remained of her overalls a bit more in the process \u2013 before slamming the door shut behind her. The noise outside stopped as whatever it was reached the door, making no attempt to try to get through, only giving some light scratching at the door before moving away. Sally slumped against the inside of the door, clutching her chest and gasping for breath again. A few moments later, she realized that her milk still hadn\u2019t stopped flowing, her manic fleeing flinging milk every which way and soaking what remained of her clothing. Grumbling about this, she opened her eyes to take in the castle she had fled into and gasped at what she saw.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally gasped mostly in awe, but with a bit of fear mixed in as well. Still leaning against the door she just fled through, the young woman was shocked at the sheer size of the chamber she found herself in; it looked like the room could swallow her entire family\u2019s home with space to spare. Slack jawed, Sally pushed off the door, her still dribbling milk, state of undress, and whatever was chasing her outside momentarily forgotten as she explored the vast entryway. Huge twin staircases swept up from the ground floor up to a landing above, and tapestries of obviously incredible skill and mastery \u2013 even to Sally\u2019s untrained eyes \u2013 hung everywhere. Dotted along the walls as well were a number of paintings, just as skilled if not more so than the tapestries; some depicted landscapes both near and far, including the peaks of snowcapped mountains, a broiling desert, and a windswept coast. The large majority were of people of any number of species, though Sally noted that almost every one featured a black dragon or dragoness near or at the center of each image\u2014black dragons being an exceedingly rare species that hailed from the often frozen North. As she continued to look at them, she now saw how most of the paintings involving people also involved food and drink. Some of these paintings seemed to depict a party or some such, while most showed debauchery ranging from the comparatively benign to some that were so depraved that Sally felt impossibly dirty for just viewing the vulgar acts on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her back on the paintings \u2013 and wishing that she could scrub her mind clean of what she had seen \u2013 she now focused on the massive statue in the center of the room between the stairs. Unlike everything else she had seen so far, the stone carving was crude and very basic in its design. Despite the rough appearance, there was something extremely unsettling about the effigy, a sense of dread seemingly flowing from the inanimate stone, and that sent a chill racing down Sally\u2019s spine. Despite her unease, she also felt strangely drawn to it, though she didn\u2019t fully realize just how much it was affecting her till she bumped into the pedestal the statue rested on. Startled out of her stupor, she brought her eyes up and got a better view of the statue than she wanted. Up close, Sally could finally tell that the nearly shapeless form was actually a long flowing cloak, completely covering whatever lay beneath. Where the face should have been under the edge of the hood was totally lost in shadows so deep and dark they seemed unnatural, but it still gave the young woman the vague sense of being watched. A shudder ran through her entire body as she backed away from the statue and cast her attention away from the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more that Sally saw of the castle, the more unnerved she felt. There was no thick layers of dust, no massive spider webs, and any metal she saw gleamed as if freshly polished, hinting at people maintaining the castle, and yet there was little else to say that anyone else was present. Despite the size the castle, the entire location was quiet, inside especially. While the courtyard at least had birdsong and the rustle of breeze blown leaves from the surrounding forest, Sally heard nothing except her own footsteps and breathing now that she was inside; there no one moving around from what she could hear, and no one speaking anywhere nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally continued to strain her hearing to see if there was anything, she heard a soft tapping noise. At first she thought it may have been her breasts and udders again, but much to her surprise her milk flow had actually seemingly slowed down enough so that it wasn\u2019t the cause of the noise. It took her a while before she realized that the noise was in fact someone slowly walking along. At first, she almost went in search of the person, but then she remembered what had been happening to her, so she decided a little discretion might be in order. She moved underneath one of the stairs after figuring out the footsteps were coming closer from the upper landing, and just in time too, as whoever or whatever soon slowly plodded into the hall. It was hard to see from her chosen vantage point, but Sally managed a brief glimpse of a small figure dressed in a drab brown monk-like robe carrying a lantern, and oddly enough she also saw what appeared to be a green fish tail sticking out from under the back of the robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange little creature either didn\u2019t see her or didn\u2019t pay any attention if it did see Sally and continued slowly to the other side of the landing and into the passage beyond. She considered going after it, especially since it was the only living thing she had seen that hadn\u2019t been apparently trying to attack her. As she stood there however, her ears also picked up another noise that hadn\u2019t been there before: it was hard to make out, but it sounded like someone speaking and it seemed to be coming from the door right next to her. Pressing her head against the wooden portal conformed that the noise did seem to be louder from behind it, though she still couldn\u2019t make out who was speaking or what was being spoken. She now wondered whether she should check out wherever that voice was coming from \u2013 and maybe overhear something that might provide a clue on what was happening here \u2013 or to follow the little fish-person thing that was continuing to slowly march ever further away, while another part of her mind said that maybe she should avoid both and see if she could just find a way out of this creepy place while trying to avoid whatever was chasing her out in the courtyard.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her mind made up, she opened the door and slipped through, and found a tight closed-in staircase descending on the other side. The voice was definitely coming from down the staircase, so down it Sally went. As she continued her downward trek, she felt a vague sense of strangeness: it seemed to take her only a few revolutions to reach the bottom, but it also felt like it took quite a long time. She also noticed that the air turned considerably cooler as she reached the bottom, a shiver passing through her body because of this. At the bottom was a long corridor with doors spaced irregularly along the length and lit only by scattered flickering torches that did little to dispel the darkness, leaving small pools of pale light surrounded by deep shadows. One door partway down the length had a flicker of bluish light leaking out from underneath, and this happened to be the one that the voice seemed to be coming from. With her head against this door, Sally could make out random little snatches of words, but nothing much, though she could also now tell there was another noise: an intermittent deep rumble, almost like thunder, mixed with what sounded like a hiss from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite a portion of her brain shouting at her for her to leave and find some way out of this crazy place, Sally tried the door and found that it opened completely silently. She slipped inside once the gap was just wide enough. Inside, she saw that the blue glow came from crystals suspended from the ceiling; their light filled the room with harsh bands of light broken by deep shadows. The room was long and wide with a number of stone tables along the length. Atop the tables and against the walls pieces of glassware \u2013 some that Sally recognized from the local healer, but others that she had no idea about \u2013 and machines that she didn\u2019t have a hope of understanding. The sound of the voice again snapped the young woman back to what she was doing. Ducking behind one of the tables, it took a bit for her to realize that the speaker was at the far end of the room and apparently hadn\u2019t spotted her coming in. Peaking over the top, Sally was able to make out a figure moving around and interacting with some of the equipment there. From time to time, the person spoke as if conversing with someone and that odd rumbling and hissing would sound off almost as if in response. There didn\u2019t appear to be anyone down there though, only a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking back under the table, she scooted along, just wanting to get a bit closer while also keeping out of sight. Now peaking over her new hiding spot, she saw that the statue was similar to the giant one back above, but while the other one was rough and crudely carven stone, this one was much smaller and seemed to be masterfully carved out a black smoky crystal. She also saw how the statue was lit from within by a pulsing reddish glow, and this pulse coincided with the noise she had been hearing. With a shock, Sally realized that the person was talking to the statue, and the statue actually seemed to be responding with that noise. Sally also saw that the figure was a woman, a black dragoness to be exact. The woman turned around to grab something off of a nearby table, and Sally caught a better glimpse: a long dark robe flowed across her body and a thick mane of blue hair was tied into a braid and flowed from her head. The hair almost seemed to glow in the light from the crystals above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness spoke again, and Sally was now close enough to hear it, \u201cOf course, master, I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the statue made its noises, the bovine thought about the accent the dragoness spoke in. She had heard it only once before, on a traveler who passed through her village a few years ago, a fox knight hailing from the mountainous and snowy north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness spoke again, \u201cI said \u2018I understand,\u2019 master,\u201d annoyance tingeing her speech. \u201cI will improve the enchantment on the cowbell so that it can\u2019t be removed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat icy fist clamped around Sally\u2019s stomach again and her mouth went dry as she realized that the dragoness and her \u201cmaster\u201d seemed to be responsible for the cowbell that had put her through the latest changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thank you for the present in any case; I will be able to make good use of her. Do enjoy yourself with that\u2026wolfess, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d The statue \u201csaid\u201d something in response, before the dragoness spoke again, \u201cYes, I am quite aware that she is here; I did call her down here after all\u201d looking straight at the table where Sally had been supposedly hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue gave one last lingering noise and glow before it went completely dark and silent, but Sally barely noticed as fear clouded her mind. She had been drawn down here!? What else was going to happen to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if reading her mind, the dragoness called out, \u201cWell, are you going to come out now, little farm girl?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sally decided to stay put, maybe the dragoness didn\u2019t really know where she was, so she might be able to get a chance to get away if she just waited for the right moment. However, few moments after making her decision, Sally realized that it might not have been the best choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing to do this the hard way, are we? Very well, I actually prefer that,\u201d the dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally\u2019s breath caught in her throat, and she screwed her eyes shut. They quickly snapped open though as the dragoness snapped her fingers and the young bovine found herself being dragged up into the air by her hands and feet. Glowing rings had appeared around her wrists and ankles \u2013 magic no doubt \u2013 and now dragged her rather roughly over the table she had been hiding behind, knocking over anything that was in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness huffed a bit before muttering to herself, \u201cDamn spell, can\u2019t ever get that thing to work quite right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being unceremoniously dragged along for the second time today, Sally was carried by the magic rings so that she was floating spread-eagle in the air over a clear space beside the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is about me entering your castle without being invited, I\u2019m sorry\u2026so so sorry. I got attacked by a plant out in the forest, got lost, and stumbled across\u2026\u201d Sally\u2019s explanation was cut off as the dragoness pressed her fingers to the cow\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe quiet now, or I will make you be quiet,\u201d the tone in the dragoness\u2019s voice left no room for discussion, and Sally did exactly as she asked. Satisfied that the bovine was indeed going to be quiet, the robed woman started examining Sally, \u201cHmm\u2026yes, I see, you do seem to have been caught by one of the plant traps, and you managed to escape that one and the cowbell as well, most impressive.\u201d Sally squirmed and whimpered as the woman poked and prodded around Sally\u2019s fatted body, but the dragoness didn\u2019t stop for even a moment; she even roughly grabbed Sally\u2019s breasts causing a spurt of milk to spring forth, and muttered to herself, \u201cMilk production has indeed been stimulated, but not enough to incapacity the subject. That will require some work for the next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then spun around and marched back over to the table where she had been working before. Now that she was positioned differently, Sally could see that the focus of the work seemed to be a large mixing bowl, filled with a viscous brownish goo. As she watch, she saw that whatever was in the bowl was actually moving around without anything interacting with it, slowly shimmering and rippling around in the bowl. Something about it sent a shiver down Sally\u2019s spine, and she tried edging away from whatever it was, but her magical restraints made that an impossibility. The dragoness resumed work with the bowl of ooze, muttering to herself from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Sally built her nerve up, and she decided to try speaking again, \u201cWho are you? What are you going to do to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the dragoness set aside a piece of glassware, before answering, \u201cI suppose I can go ahead and tell you, it might make things easier. My name is Natasha Drakinal, perhaps you have heard of my family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded, though she knew little: a quiet but powerful noble family from the north as she had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026As for what I\u2019m going to do with you, I can\u2019t say for sure, there are so many possibilities that I can think of. I\u2019m sure that I will find it rather enjoyable though, and you may in time as well,\u201d Natasha said with a grin that sent another shiver down Sally\u2019s spine, fearing what it might mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice was becoming ever tighter because of her mounting fear, \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness let out a laugh that did little to ease Sally\u2019s worries, before she answered, \u201cThat would be much too bad, as it is going to happen anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Natasha picked up a knife that lay nearby, held it to her other hand over the bowl, and steadied herself for several seconds before slicing into the flesh of her palm. She winced and hissed slightly, but held her composure otherwise, and squeezed her wounded hand to dribble some of her blood into the bowl. She then bandaged her hand and set the blade aside again before picking up the bowl and walking back to Sally. As she approached, a complex circular symbol started glowing on the floor beneath Sally, with a matching glow appearing in the bowl\u2019s contents, which had taken on a black hue now and was moving around more vigorously. Sally again tried to escape her bonds, straining with all of her might, but there was absolutely no give from the circles holding her fast in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, are you going to be a good girl, and drink this up, or are we going to have to do this the hard way again?\u201d Natasha asked rather menacingly, which was made even worse as the goo in the bowl actually started to flow of its own accord up into a rippling tentacle, posed and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally snapped her jaw shut, not wanting whatever that was anywhere near her, let alone in her. Natasha gave a little sigh, though corners of her mouth turned up in a little grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, the hard way again, though I was trying to help you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand over the bowl, and the ooze streamed up further and started to separate into several smaller steams that edged ever closer to Sally. Her breathing was quick and thready as she saw the goo flowing through the air towards her. Then like a flash, two of the steams lashed out and clamped around her throat, and pain lanced out through her body from the contact. It felt incredibly cold, and it felt like her blood was freezing beneath her skin where it was touching her. She was so distracted with the first two that she completely forgot about the remaining two till they slowly weaved closer and closer till they rapidly plunged into her nostrils. This hurt even worse, like cold fire searing the whole way down from her nose into her lungs. She wanted to scream, but the pain was too much for even that. It was a blessed relief when she blacked out, though not before she saw an excited smile plastered all across Natasha\u2019s face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Consciousness did not return easily to Sally; it came in bursts that didn\u2019t quite make it, dropping her back into the velvet embrace of nothingness. Eventually, she did break through, though her body and mind resisted the whole way. As she came to, the first thing she became aware of was all of the rather painful feelings, whether it was her sore throat, her throbbing head, or the ache in the pit of her stomach. Once she had felt those for a while, she next became aware that while those parts hurt, the rest of her felt fine, better than fine in fact, better than they had in years she thought. The pain only made her want to pass out again, and the bed was so soft that it might have been possible. Wait\u2026bed? Her mind finally pieced together what had happened to her: the plant, castle, cowbell, dragoness, and that ooze. With a groan, she realized that none of that was a dream. Opening her eyes was a chore, and even after she did so, she couldn\u2019t see much; a combination of bright sunlight steaming through a window right into her face bleaching everything out, and how her eyes didn\u2019t seem to want to focus. Her arms felt sluggish and heavy, but she finally managed to move them and rub her eyes and that seemed to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her vision cleared, Sally realized that she was completely naked \u2013 no sign of her tattered and torn overalls at all \u2013 and her fur was completely clean. She also saw that she had been fattened up even further again, and that was the reason why her arms didn\u2019t feel quite right. Her breasts and udders seemed to have filled up with milk again as well, though it wasn\u2019t painful this time, only a vague sense of fullness without any of the leaking either it seemed. Sitting up was difficult, as she was still very unused to everything that had been done to her and her body, but she managed it. The feeling of her body shifting and settling so much was a strange one to Sally, and she had to fight down her disgust as well as\u2026arousal!? No, there was no way that she was getting aroused with her body and what had been forced on her, whatever the dragoness Natasha had done to her had to be twisting her mind and body to make her get that familiar warm and damp feeling when she thought about this softness wrapping about her body, her body getting harder and harder to move as the weight continued to pile on, and people feeding her to make her grow ever larger\u2026 She shook her head vigorously, and even resorted to slapping herself in the face to try and dispel whatever was coming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman jumped \u2013 and groaned inwardly as this sent a wave through her fattened frame \u2013 when the door suddenly opened. In stepped the dragoness, though Sally noticed a quick flash of someone else waiting outside the door, but she couldn\u2019t get any details before the door was shut again. The thinner woman wasn\u2019t wearing her robe now; instead she was clad in a loose flowing dress that revealed a buxom frame with large firm breasts and wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good, you are awake; I was starting to wonder if it may have proved too much for you. That would have been a terrible shame, but all is well,\u201d Natasha said as she walked up to Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, everything is going just swimmingly,\u201d Sally muttered under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm mm, very well,\u201d Natasha replied with doubt plainly visible on her face, but she waved it off. \u201cPlease, stand up and let me take a look at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Sally thought about ignoring the \u201crequest\u201d she found herself obeying and standing up. She tried to sit back down but that didn\u2019t work either. She felt like such a piece of meat, standing there as Natasha poked and prodded, but even without being affected by those magical rings this time, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything that she could do to stop it now; her muscles just wouldn\u2019t obey her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn around for me, slowly,\u201d Natasha said, wiggling a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she commanded, so Sally\u2019s body responded: taking slow ponderous steps to revolve in place. It had to be another piece of magic; it just had to be, maybe something related to that goo that Natasha hit her with. As her rear end wobbled around towards the dragoness, Natasha reached out and slapped it, sending ripples across Sally\u2019s body, and still Sally could do nothing in response. Coming back around to face Natasha she motioned for Sally to stop, a smile splitting her muzzle the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m certain you are trying to do something like getting away or punching me or any number of other things, yet you can\u2019t, and you want to know why. Well, I\u2019m going to go ahead and spoil the surprise: a portion of the spell that I cast on you last night was a binding spell,\u201d as she spoke, she waved her hand in a circle in front of Sally\u2019s face, and after a few rotations, globs of silver started to swirl around in the wake. These floating bits of silver pooled together in midair till a perfect mirror had formed out of nothingness. The mirror reflected Sally\u2019s face to her, chubby cheeks, scowl, and something completely new: a band of runes or symbols wrapped around her neck; they were pitch black but with a slight bluish glow from within and shown even through her fur. \u201cYou see them, right? Those symbols around your lovely neck are a sign of the ritual, making it so that you have to do what I say when I say it. Like I said last night, what I want is going to happen, whether you like it or not. I do hope that you will start to enjoy it eventually though; it\u2019s ever so much more fun when you give in. A little struggle at the beginning is somewhat enjoyable too though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha let out a laugh before pushing Sally in the shoulder, knocking the young woman off her feet so that she landed in a heap on the bed, her flesh wobbling around from the dual impacts. The dragoness then marched off, her leathery wings and long tail shifting slightly as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally didn\u2019t get up in time to see anything except the door swinging almost all the way shut, but she did hear a bit of Natasha speaking: \u201cPrepare her for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer footsteps then strode off, leaving whoever it was outside the door. Sally found that her body once again responded to her, for what good that did for her. Crushing despair threatened to overwhelm her, what hope did she have if this witch or whatever could control her so completely? Her anguish had to be shoved aside though as whoever was supposed to \u201cprepare\u201d quietly opened the door and stepped inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sally saw who was coming through the door, she shrunk back with more than a little shock and fear again. The woman who entered was a veritable giant, both in stature and weight. Even though the door stood about seven feet tall \u2013 according to Sally\u2019s estimations \u2013 the larger woman stood tall enough that she had to stoop to get under the door frame, and even then her pointed ears brushed the frame. Her width didn\u2019t make her entrance any easier either; she was so wide that her hips had to be squashed past the frame on either side despite it being a double door. Turning sideways likely wouldn\u2019t have helped much either, judging from the massive bulk of her breasts and stomach; the former were huge and elongated somewhat under their weight, and rested atop the mountain of her gut, which drooped down past her knees and out even further forcing her fleshy legs far to the sides to even allow her slow shambling. Only slightly less notable than her sheer size was the fact that he giant woman was very obviously a dragon-wolf hybrid, a drawolf. Her enormous body was almost entirely covered in thick black shiny fur, except for a patch of very deep red starting below her chins and extending down across her stomach; small patches of red scales were visible, especially around her golden eyes, and a pair of undersize wings peeked over her shoulders. An extremely ill-fitting dress barely wrapped around her frame, looking ready to explode off of her at the drop of a hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Sally saw it: almost completely hidden under the folds and rolls where her jowls and chin fat tried to merge with her shoulders was the same band of symbols that circled the cow\u2019s neck as well. As the woman finished the slow journey through the door, the next thing Sally noticed was a curious scar that cut across the drawolf\u2019s face, starting above a eyebrow and expending down across the matching eye to the cheek below. A drawolf with her coloring and that particular scar, could it be? There was no way, was there? Sally had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSamantha, is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drawolf\u2019s eyes were dim and clouded, but as the question reached her mind, Sally saw a glint of recognition deep within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA much deeper but still recognizable voice cinched it for Sally, and the answer was just icing on the cake, \u201cWho\u2026Sally!? Yes, it\u2019s me, but what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mirthless chuckle, Sally responded, \u201cI could ask the same thing of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had been a childhood friend of Sally\u2019s who had disappeared more than a year before. She had changed so much in that time though, the Sam Sally had last seen was a short twig, standing under five feet tall and weighing just a hair over eighty pounds, nothing like the huge figure she now possessed. The young woman had just mysteriously vanished one day while running an errand for her mother. No trace had been found of Samantha, but some said that the girl had just run away, maybe to find her absent father or something. Samantha\u2019s mother never accepted that story, thinking that something had to have happened to her daughter, and apparently something had. Sally motioned for Sam towards the bed, thinking that her friend might like to take some weight off of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had sat down with Sally beside her, she recounted her story, \u201cProbably much like what happened to you. You know I was heading to the city for my mom, right?\u201d After seeing the nod from Sally, \u201cSomething grabbed me off the road, I never have found out what. I was taken down into a cave deep in the forest where <i>horrible</i> things were done to me,\u201d an involuntary shudder pass through her body, shaking the whole bed with the intensity. \u201cSometime after that, I was passed off to Mistress, but you might know her as Natasha,\u201d and again a nod from Sally. \u201cThings have been much better here than down in that cave. She still regularly feeds me with massive amounts of food, enough that I think I\u2019m going to burst. She also fattens me up sometimes, making me into a big immobile blob of flesh, but she seems to prefer me with <i>some</i> mobility, like this,\u201d motioning towards her body to illustrate the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever tried to escape?\u201d Sally asked, though she dreaded the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, a number of times early on, but obviously none have succeeded. Mistress doesn\u2019t really seem to mind me attempting to escape, but that also doesn\u2019t mean that doesn\u2019t punish me when I\u2019m caught.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespair gripped Sally yet again upon hearing that, but she still mumbled, \u201cMaybe with the two of us though\u2026\u201d leaving that hanging in the air between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crossed Sam\u2019s face after hearing that, but it was cheerless at best, and quickly faded away, \u201cYou were always the persistent one, never taking \u2018a\u2019 for an answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments pause, Sam then asked Sally about how she had come to be here, and Sally told her story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sally had finished, Sam spoke up again, \u201cHmm\u2026at least you weren\u2019t an immobile slab of meat when you showed up, I could barely breathe before Mistress did her first spell on me,\u201d a hand reaching up to touch at the markings around her neck. \u201cI\u2019m so glad she did so though, all the better to serve her and her wishes,\u201d shock seeping into Sally again, \u201cI do wish she would let me enjoy immobility for longer though, it\u2019s much more pleasant when I don\u2019t have to worry about my own weight crushing the life out of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally tried as hard as she could to not let the shock show on her face; the Samantha she knew had never been like this. It stood to reason though, Sam had been under Natasha\u2019s spell for much longer. Sally could only hope that she could break through to Sam and get her help with escaping, otherwise she might be stuck here as \u201cmistress\u2019\u201d plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then slapped her thighs, or to be more exact the vast expanse of her stomach that pooled over her thighs, and started the slow process of standing up while saying, \u201cI think we\u2019ve wasted enough time, we have to get you ready, don\u2019t want to be late after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally thought better than to resist just yet, so she went along with Sam, who picked out a dress similar to her own \u2013 but far smaller \u2013 and helped Sally into it. Checking it out in a mirror, Sally saw how it hugged her wider hips, larger bust, and even fit nicely around her udder. Sam too gave Sally a once over, and gave a little nod before motioning for Sally to follow. As they left the bedroom and moved through the halls, Sally tried to keep an eye out for anything she might make use of if they were going to escape, but it was proving hard. Her eyes kept getting drawn to the enormous rolling hills of Sam\u2019s butt, bobbing in time and rippling like a choppy sea. Each time, Sally would shake her head and try to focus on her surroundings again, telling herself that she Sam was just a friend who had some really bad things happen to her, like being enslaved by a magic user that was using the drawolf as a food balloon, and fattening her up with all of that luscious weight that did wonders for her shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gave herself another slap as she realized where her mind was being taken again. The noise seemed to have been louder than she thought because Sam slowed somewhat and looked back over her shoulder. Sally gave a little sheepish grin, before Sam turned back and continued leading them. Trying her best to keep her mind focused, Sally again noticed how quiet and empty the castle seemed, even with the life that she knew of. Sam soon led them down a flight of stairs \u2013 though Sally thought for sure Sam would topple over at any moment \u2013 and through a large door into\u2026</span></div></div>",

There were several suction cups attached to tubes that connected to the machine. This must be a machine used for milking cows, she realized. Sally was too poor to afford one of these on her own farm, but she had heard of these devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's thoughts were interrupted by the aching pain in her breasts and udder as milk sloshed around in them.

She blushed with embarrassment as she realized that she could use the milking machine to relieve the pressure. She almost dismissed the idea of using the machine on herself. She's a cowgirl, but she's not a mindless beast like a regular cow! But in the end, she knew that it was her only option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow girl took her clothes off and began to attach the suction cups to her breasts and udder. For the first time since this nightmare began, Sally felt grateful that she was alone. If anyone saw her milking herself like she was just a dumb barn animal, she never would have been able to live with the shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished attaching the suction cups to her body, Sally say down on the stall floor then she pressed the large button on the milking machine to start it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sigh escaped Sally's lips as she began to cross the drawbridge and enter the courtyard beyond. Yet as she was making her way over the bridge, her hooves clopping against the wood as it creaked beneath her feet slightly, she couldn't help but glance down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl paused on the middle of the drawbridge as she looked over the moat beneath her, something about it drawing her attention. The surface still looked... odd to her, something that tugged at her mind. She leaned over the edge of the drawbridge, but still couldn't get quite a good look at it as the surface of the water was at least a few meters below the bridge. The bovine looked around for a moment, finding a narrow incline on the forest side of the bridge that led down to the moat, and debated whether or not she should investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well why not? It's not like the castle's going anywhere. I'll just be checking it out for a minute before heading back up inside...\"</i> She thought as she went back over the bridge and began to walk down the incline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she descended the slope and the dirt gave way to mossy stone steps, Sally began to see what had bothered her so much about the moat. Sally hadn't even seen an actual moat before, but even just hearing about them she had figured they were basically comprised of water. Instead what she saw looked like thick, dark sludge that flowed sluggishly under the drawbridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's another thing... aren't moats usually stagnant or something...?\"</i> Sally wondered as she stepped off the stairs and onto a stone walkway that skirted the edge of the trench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally drew her attention away from the moat itself to take in her surroundings. She spotted a few holes in the stone brick that lined the walls of the trench on the castle side of the moat, the holes seeming to feed into it as the repulsive looking sludge oozed lazily from them and into the river. Besides these there was little else to note beyond a steel door on the other side of the trench that likely led into the castle, or at least its foundations if not the fortress proper. Thankfully there were a few long planks laid across the moat near the door because the moat was much too wide for Sally to leap across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl looked back to the moat as she noticed it bubbling in places like a murky bog, the bubbles rising and popping just as torpidly as it was flowing. Sally was overcome by curiosity once more as she watched the liquid. It probably wouldn't hurt to take a closer look at the stuff, though it did look pretty nasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand the goop might be poisonous and it probably wouldn't be best to get close to it, while the door might present another good way of getting inside of the castle... if it wasn't locked that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shook her head, starting to get a feeling of foreboding about all this. She began to wonder if maybe she should just go back up the stairs and take the drawbridge inside, but just as she was about to go back she heard the rattle of chains overhead. She looked up to see the drawbridge slowly beginning to ascend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Crap! It's lifting!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cowgirl began to run up the steps, but before she could make it further than a few feet the bridge was already closing and out of reach. Her options now considerably narrowed, Sally looked back down to the moat and the door that lay across from it. Of course she could always just try to find her way back to the village, but with night approaching soon she doubted that would have been a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugghh... looks like I don't have much of a choice then...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wondered if she should take a closer look for a second before deciding against it. She didn't need to be wasting any more time: If the door on the other side of the moat was locked she'd need it to find another way in before nightfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she could see enough of the moat from where she was at, Sally went over to the planks that spanned it. They were covered in moss a mildew and were quite thin, but seemed sturdy enough. Yet as the cowgirl took a cautious step onto the boards, they let out an audible creak and seemed to bend downwards slightly from the weight of her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Quit your groaning!\" She mumbled as her paws reflexively rose to pat at her slightly curved gut, \"I haven't put on THAT much godsdamned weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why am I so worried anyways?\"</i> She thought to herself as she took another step onto the planks, <i>\"Worst thing that could happen is I fall into this shitty moat. It'd be pretty gross, but probably not much worse than the mud I gotta put up with back at the farm... And that's even IF I fall into it haha, what are the chances of THAT!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if hearing her thoughts, the area of the moat directly beneath Sally began to bubble and churn more than usual. Sally stopped as soon as she realized this, exactly halfway across the planks as the liquid beneath them started to go from lazy and languid to frothing and foaming, \"What... W-What the hell is going on..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the moat seemed to answer Sally as strange, bulbous growths began to form from the bubbles, soon turning into dark, oozing tendrils that rose from beneath the churning tar-like waters. Sally let out a tiny shocked shriek as the tentacles began to rise all around her, surrounding the cowgirl on the middle of the plank bridge and whipping and undulating in the air like trees caught in a turbulent storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally could only stand still for a moment, too terrified to move lest she provoke the slimy tendrils into further action. Yet as she stood there she realized she could not wait for the eerie tentacles to leave as one of the tendrils whipped back and then came whirling through the air towards her!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Eep!\" Sally cried as the tendril hurtled through the air towards her. Almost instinctively the cowgirl ducked, causing the it to miss by inches, splashing a fine mist of the moat's \u201cwater\u201d against her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blecch...\" She groaned, trying to shake the mucky liquid off at first but gave up on that task as more tentacles rose from the moat around her. Acting fast, Sally made a dash for the other side, her hooves clomping against the planks and bouncing them, causing her to slip as she reached the stone brick walkway on the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Screamed as she fell, but was quickly relieved as her paws grasped the handle of the iron door leading into the castle. She scrambled upright, her hooves scraping against stone as she heard the moat splashing and sloshing behind her. She was almost overcome with joy as she stood and found that the door wasn't locked at all, opening with only a slightly forceful tug. Sally gasped in glee as she saw the corridor beyond the threshold, even if it looked to be dreary stone walls lined sparsely with dim torches tha-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally let out a howl as she felt one of the tendrils lash around her ankle. Her breathing quickened, her heart pounding like that of an animal's caught in a snare as she desperately tried to pull the tentacle off of her. Before she could even reach however, the creature had already tugged against her leg, tripping the panicked cowgirl and bringing her crashing against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" She screamed as her paws grasped at the stone brick, hyperventilating as she was dragged quickly towards the moat, another tendril wrapping about her other leg and a third joining the first, curling up her thigh. Try as she might though her frantic fingers found no purchase, slipping and sliding across the mossy stone as she drew closer to whatever horrible monster had her in its clutches, \"<i>Please no!</i>\" She pleaded with the unseen creature, \"D-DON'T EAT ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacles ignored Sally's pleas, the girl kicking her hooves as she felt them being pulled below the surface of the moat. The ensnared cowgirl's cries were cut short soon though as she felt the rising surface of the liquid halt suddenly just below her knees, her perilous slide cut short as her crotch and rump slammed down against the plank bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... Ahahaha!\" Sally laughed, filled with elation as she realized she had been grabbed in just the right way for her legs to be pulled down on each side of the boards. The bridge still creaked and bent under her weight, even more so with the tentacles still trying to drag her into the sludge, but it held firmly, \"You dumb bastard! You can't even figure out how to grab me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally laughed again, catching her breath as she placed her paws against the boards she was sitting on. She tried to push, but barely managed to pull her legs free from the thick moat. Before she could try to push harder the remaining tentacles that were thrashing around began to draw closer before whipping towards the helpless cowgirl as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" She screamed as they lashed through the air. Instead of striking at the boards as she'd feared though, the tentacles instead continued to bind her, wrapping about her legs further, and her arms as well, \"F-Fuck!!! STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tendrils curled around the cowgirl's arms, tightening their grip on her as they pulled her paws away from the boards and to her sides before trying to tug her into the moat by them as well. Sally grunted as the boards creaked even louder, gritting her teeth as she tried to pull her arms free but found it impossible as the tentacles weaved tighter and tighter around them. Soon enough her attention was brought elsewhere as yet another tentacle lashed at her, choosing to ignore her limbs completely as it swung around her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tendril tightened as well as it oozed up Sally's waist, causing her to shriek in shock as it suddenly slipped through the side of her overalls. She shivered at first, expecting the muck coating the tentacle to be cold, but instead finding it oddly warm and... soothing? Sally couldn't really find comfort in that for long though, not when the tendril was now snaking its way between her breasts and slipping through her cleavage, its tip hovering before her mouth, \"Aaaaghh! What t-the FUCK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she glared at the tendril however, she was suddenly reminded of the vines she had just struggled with in an eerily similar situation, \"Oh gods NO!\" She hollered before the tendril shot right past her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had expected the vile-looking sludge from the moat to taste horrible, but instead was surprised to find it to have a strangely sweet flavor, not unlike the sap from the plant. After what she had been through earlier though, Sally was prepared this time. As soon as the tentacle began to slide down her throat she bit down hard on it and was thankful to find there was very little resistance as she chomped right through it. Her triumph was sadly short lived as she felt the muck that coated the thing oozing past her teeth, and then spread them open once again as the appendage resumed its entrance, apparently unhindered by being bit clean in two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh no...\"</i> Sally thought, <i>\"That nasty crap isn't coating the creature, it IS the creature!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this, Sally desperately tried to pull free once more as she gagged against the slime going down her throat, but nothing she did worked. In fact, the cow girl's attempts to resist the tendril only made it double its efforts, the gooey slime starting to thicken even more as it pushed her lips apart. Sally let out a moan as the sweet flavor was, oddly enough, replaced by something savory, reminding her of a chicken dinner she had eaten only a few nights ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's eyes drooped, her muscles loosening as a cascade of flavors assaulted her taste buds, each one different, each vaguely familiar and yet distinctly decadent. It wasn't long before the cowgirl had forgotten completely about her dire predicament, instead giving in to the primal joy of sustenance and the warm comfort of the slime as it filled her gut tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the cowgirl's surroundings grew fuzzy and distant, only the occasional bubble popping on the moat or the splashing of the tentacles reaching her in her growing fugue, as a restless voice might reach a dreamer. The only thoughts that arose in her mind were simple and indulgent: <i>\"Eat... Relax... Swell... Bloat...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally moaned, only distantly aware of the pain growing in her gut as it distended into her lap, slowly drooping towards the boards between her legs. The rest of the chubby cowgirl's body was slowly filling out as well, though at an even faster rate than when she was being fed by the plant. Not only was her belly becoming softer with blubber as it stretched, but so too were her breasts, steadily growing into and out of new cup sizes as the tendril that rested between them was squeezed by their swelling girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine lass could only moan louder as she felt the flowing tendril pressing harder between her bloating cleavage, her breasts rising and falling with heavy breaths as the slime dripped from the tendril and oozed over her exposed brown chestfur. Her cheeks blushed deeply with red, as they slowly plumped as well to compliment her growing double chin, that too dripping with excess slime. Her overalls, already stained with the muck wherever the tendrils touched it were also starting to grow tight, not only at Sally's chest and belly but her sides as well, rolls of fat pushing out of the gaps in her overalls like rising dough. Even Sally's limbs were filling out as she continued to consume the vile slime, gradually pillowing out with soft blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all of this the planks the cowgirl was sitting on began to bend even further under her increasing weight, as well as the continual pressure from the tentacles' efforts. They creaked louder and louder as Sally's ass swelled fatter, pushing firmly against her clothes and causing her overalls to ride up as her thickening rump cheeks began to sag over the edges of the small bridge. As the slimy tentacles tugged and pulled at her, it sent the fattening cowgirl bouncing against the boards, causing her to moan and grunt as her crotch and rump slammed against the planks, as well as making her increasingly heftier body jiggle and bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her ass was almost touching the surface of the moat the planks gave out, snapping in half and sending the helpless bovine splashing into the thick, fattening muck. Fortunately for Sally, not only was the shock enough to snap her out of her gluttonous daze, but her tumble also seemed to have an adverse effect on the slime creature itself. The disturbance caused by Sally's newly swollen bulk crashing into the surface seemed to send shock waves through the moat monster, disrupting it enough to momentarily collapse the tentacles that held and fed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gagged as she sunk chest-deep into the sludge, retching as she spat out the goop that hadn't found its way down her throat. She looked frantically about herself, kicking her hooves sluggishly through the thick river of slime to keep afloat. She had almost no time to realize what happened to her, her instincts kicking in as she tried to find some way out of this awful mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes instantly darted towards the walkway and the door beyond, still wide open, her most obvious and possibly best hope for escape. Sally also realized that, slow as it was, she was being pulled by a current down the river, her eyes following the direction she was pulled as she saw what looked to be a lever further down the walkway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer choices were clear, and Sally knew she needed to act fast before the slimy monstrosity surrounding her had a chance to recover. She could either risk losing time swimming against the current and try to reach the door, or let it take her downstream so she could gamble on the lever, in the hopes it could do <i>something </i>to save her.</span></div></div>",

The sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and all the plants looked alive and vibrant. This all seemed to make the cold, dark cave in which Fenra made her home look rather out of place amongst the cheerful hillside. These hills didn't seem like an ordinary place for a dragon to make its home, but Fenra was no ordinary dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only about ten feet tall, quite tiny compared to others of her kind, who are known for being towering behemoths able to devour entire villages when they weren't sleeping on their hoards of gold. If one looked past her size, she could still seem intimidating with her dark purple and black scales and sharp pointed horns, yet none of these aspects comforted her too much. Sure she might be able to take on a knight or two if she had to, but size was everything when you were a dragon, and as such, she didn't have much of anything. Hell, if Fenra wasn't such a runt, she probably wouldn't be living in this pitiful hole to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave in which Fenra lived was sparse and barren. There were the basics, a fire pit, a nice pile of furs she liked to sleep on.... and that was essentially it. When it came to treasure, the only bright and shiny thing she had was meager copper coin, something she had simply found laying on the ground when she went hunting once. Hardly a pile fit to curl upon. Again, if she wasn't so tiny, she'd probably be out raiding and pillaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead she was here, cooking a rabbit with her fiery breath, each one seeming more like a depressed sigh...</span></div></div>",

And then there was the human standing directly in front of her, a redheaded woman armored in thick mail and holding a rather large axe, most likely a warrior and the leader of this group. Even as she stood back up, the human seemed almost as tall as her, something that greatly intimidated the outnumbered dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer companions remained wary, but the human only smirked and slowly walked closer to Fenra, \"I did not expect much from what the villagers had told me, but this? By the gods, you must be the most pathetic monster I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Fenra just wanted to back away, to go back to hiding inside her cave and pray for them to leave, she knew she couldn't do that, and so instead she snorted defiantly. The crimson haired girl only laughed and poked the head of her axe against Fenra's stomach teasingly, causing the startled dragon to bat the axe out of the warrior's grip as she simultaneously slid her tail across the ground, knocking the human's legs out from under her as she fell over caught off guard. The elf lowered her bow as she tried to stifle a laugh and the wolf grinned in amusement as they watched their boss stumble to her feet and brush the dirt off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe besieged dragon took advantage of the distraction and roared as she charge into the group of adventurers, grabbing the warrior in her arms and knocking the elf over, causing her to let go of the bowstring and fire her arrow uselessly into a nearby tree. The sorcerer dived out of the way of the rampaging beast as Fenra slammed the woman against the ground and pinned her to it, snarling as the two stared each other down. While she wasn't looking, the wolf got back on his feet and pointed his staff at the dragoness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the spell hit the dragon, the electricity coursed through her body, causing her to shake and howl in pain until she fell onto her back, panting weakly and unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warrior composed herself as she was released from Fenra's grasp. As she strode over to the defenseless dragon she picked up her axe off of the ground and spat where she lay. Fenra could only growl in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was about time you helped me out Jacob, she could have ripped my throat out with her teeth!\" She barked at the sorcerer, not even turning to look at him as he now stood motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she looked over to her elf companion, who stood there with a shocked expression on her face. The warrior looked down at Fenra and said, \"Will you stop standing there like a frightened child? The monster is incapacitated Serena,\" She said to the blonde elf, kicking Fenra in the side with her boot as if to prove her point, \"Completely helpless, now lets slaughter her and collect our reward from the farmers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her axe over the dragon lying on the ground, but she was interrupted from dealing the final blow by Serena's screaming as loud as she had ever heard her. She looked up at the elf, and then over to Jacob to see him standing there still, blood and froth spilling from his mouth. He slumped over onto the ground with a final gasp, revealing the cloaked figure who had stood behind him, and the bloody knife which had stabbed him in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane...\" Stuttered the Serena as she back against a tree, covering her mouth and whimpering in terror, \"He killed him, he killed Jacob! How could he have gotten so close... none of us...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane held up her hand to silence her quivering teammate and stared directly into the dark abyss which obscured the newcomer beneath his cowl, \"If you want us to kill you quickly interloper, then you better tell us who you are, and why the hell you just murdered one of our own in cold blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the robe wiped the blood from his dagger and sheathed it, then he looked at the woman addressing him and said, \"I have several titles, but the one most often given to me is Lipomancer, one that I find quite appropriate. I killed your friend here because his use of cheap magic in such a manner revolted me. Mere parlor tricks compared to what I am capable of, allow me to show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe distraught ranger looked at him in disbelief, unable to comprehend how he spoke so calmly just stabbed her friend in the back. It was clear that Serena couldn't bear any more of what the man was saying as she unsheathed her sword and ran straight at him. Yet she stopped, not even closing half of the distance between them when she gasped in shock. She looked down as her stomach began to bulge outward from her leather tunic, quickly straining the straps holding it together as each one popped open one by one. Her ballooning stomach and breasts were quickly revealed, the pale soft flesh bare for all to see. Her thickening arms and fattening back tore apart her gauntlets and what was left of her top as rolls former, and her quickly plumpening fingers ripped apart her gloves as they bloated like sausages, causing her to drop her sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane stared at her comrade, eyes wide with terror as the elf's gut continued to swell, bursting apart her belt and causing her skirt to drop about her thickening legs, revealing her fattening ass as each cheek swelled to incredible size. She fell onto her mammoth rear, sending ripples throughout her soft flesh as her widening thighs could no longer support her immense weight. Fatter and fatter the helpless elf became as she looked at her redheaded companion, tear streaming down her fat filled cheeks as she struggled past her multiplying chins and full lips to beg, \"Help... me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the now half-ton Serena, she had sat down near the edge of the cliff, and the ground quickly cracked and crumbled beneath her. Jane screamed in shock and ran towards elf, but it was too late as the ground beneath her gave way and sent the naked and once lithe elf maiden tumbling towards the river below...</span></div></div>",

Tears began to well up in her eyes as she got to her feet and turned to face the wicked mage who had defeated her group so easily. She looked at him, her face contorted with rage as she held up her axe, yet the Lipomancer could easily sense the tremble of fear in her voice as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to us...? Why have you come to the aid of this horrible, murderous beast!\" She shouted as she pointed at Fenra, who had now sat up, and was watching the two remaining fighters, fearing for her life, but at the same time far too enthralled by what had happened to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had figured by now that there really was no point in either running or fighting against this man, a sorcerer who had greatly altered the body mass of another person with his magics and had not even broken a sweat. Indeed, when it came to a man who could do something like that to you just by looking your way, it would be better just to do what he wanted of you instead of trying to resist. A chill went up the dragon's spine as she thought of this, beginning to feel just as helpless as she had when she was hit by the wolf mage's lightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jane, she didn't seem to share the obedient fear-driven mindset of the puny dragon, for when the Lipomancer simply laughed in return to her query, she charged towards him, raising her axe into the air. He didn't even bother to move out of the way as she brought the blade down onto him vertically, yet he did not slice into two halves as the warrior had expected him to. Instead, his robe was simply pushed to the ground, as if there was no wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped back in shock as the robe fell to the ground, the dark, black fabric pooling on the ground like some sort of malevolent puddle. As Jane frantically looked about her for her foe, she failed to notice that something was still stirring beneath the fallen clothes, and that the pool of cloth looked less like a pool actually, and more like a mound, as if it were covering something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you, you coward!\" She called out, her shouts echoing across the valley as something vile oozed from beneath the robe, slowly creeping towards her, \"Show yourself immediately before I am forced to....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally noticed the oozing, dough-like mass coming towards her, but it was far to late for her to do anything but scream, giving it easy access to her now exposed maw. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane was completely shocked, unable to resist as the liquefied sorcerer forced his mass down her throat and into her stomach. Her once flat, toned belly began to curve outwards, rapidly becoming spherical as she became fuller and fuller. Her belt groaned as her growing stomach strained it until finally the buckle burst apart, each end of it now dropping to hang at her sides, allowing her chain mail tunic to ride up the slope of her paunch. Soon her belly had become quite taut, and as the relentless flow of the slime into her full stomach continued, it began to become horrendously painful for the redheaded warrior to endure as the limits of her gut were tested. Fenra was unable to stop watching as Jane's middle became bigger and rounder, the pain causing the girl to drop her axe to the ground, instead using her hands to uselessly grope and rub at her tense orb of a stomach. She gagged on the seemingly endless amount of edible goop infiltrating her body, her eyes rolling back as she began to go into some sort of daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as Fenra thought the woman's belly was likely to burst at any second, something impossible seemed to happen. Instead of Jane's gut continuing to stretch, the rest of her body appeared to be filling out instead. Straps and buckle were quick to give way to the sudden surge of flab, gauntlets falling apart from her plumping, sausage-like fingers, boots bursting from her thickening thighs, and her chain mail top exploding into a shower of metal rings as her bloated, naked breasts broke loose, exposing her fattening nipples for the dragon to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the last of the Lipomancer was sliding down Jane's esophagus, the young warrior looked to weigh nearly 700 pounds, and was completely naked, her slightly tanned flesh exposed as her broken armor now lay at her feet. The last of the malevolent ooze squeezed between Jane's plump lips with a sickening \"plop\". The obese woman was looking confused for a moment as she gasped for breath and slowly began to snap out of her shock. She immediately realized the immense heaviness, the pounds upon pounds of added weight, as well as the cold of the wind as it blew over her nude form. She slowly looked down as best as she could with her chubby face and multitude of flabby chins, wanting to visually confirm what she already feared and gasped in horror, tears welling up in her eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once toned, muscled, disciplined fighter had now become a massive whale of a woman, barely even able to stand on her own two legs. She had become swollen due to the being filling out her body, looking obese and huge. Her face had become considerably plump, round cheeks, large, triple chins, and full red lips. Her belly stuck out almost four feet before her, yet was now soft with fat, drooping down to cover her thighs and sex like a big fleshy apron. Her breast sat on top of this impressive gut, sagging with fat, yet surprisingly perky and round for their size. Her arms, hands, and fingers had thickened with fat, so much so that she was sure she probably wouldn't be able to wrap her swollen fingers about the grip of her axe, let alone lift the thing now. As for the girl's lower half, her legs and feet were coated with flesh, and her thighs had become thick and gigantic, the flabby things chafing against one another and thick with cellulite. It was probably for the best that she could not turn to look at her bloated rear, her ass cheeks having become incredibly massive now, second in size only to her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took in the damage, she wanted to sob, she wanted to scream... she wanted to do so many things out of terror and despair... but none of them, she knew, would help her. Instead she clenched her chubby hands into fists, holding back the tears and trying to turn her fear into rage. She would need to focus her anger to have a chance against the thing now housed inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra still sat there, wondering what she should do, afraid that this \"Lipomancer\" would turn on her next, yet evenly afraid that this tough bitch could actually still defeat him, and then finish what she came here to do in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Lipomancer didn't seem to worry as he squirmed inside of her, in fact he began to laugh, and as he spoke, the helpless redhead's elephantine buttocks jiggled and bounced from within, \"You make quite a lovely host, in fact, I could consider making you a temporary home... though I don't think you'd like what I'd do with the place.... hehehehh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane tried to stave off her terror and instead grunted in disgust at his words, \"You really seem to think that his battle is over monster... you really believe you have won...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, laughter shook her bloated body, though this time originating from deep within her stomach, \"Oh I have most definitely won... though your defeat isn't nearly over!\" Again there was laughter as he continued, \"But as I've said, you have such a nice, supple form... so I offer you a choice: Either you become my slave and serve me and my whims... or I tear you apart from the inside.... hahahaha!\"</span></div></div>",

But, seeing as you showed such 'kindness' to me, I ought to return the favor by offering you a choice as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either I toss myself off the side of this cliff, and take you with me,\" She stated quite plainly, pointing a chubby finger at the perilous edge, \"I mean if you're going to kill me, I might as well accomplish something with my death. Or you extract yourself from myself immediately, and we fight fairly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what was less of a laugh and more of a chuckle reverberated throughout Jane's body, sending ripples across the surface of her belly fat, \"You seem so mistakenly confident my young, brutish girl. You see, I am the one in control of your body now. Not you. You are completely helpless and unable to do anything I wont allow. Go ahead. See for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane didn't believe it at first, but as she tried to lift her leg, she found that it wouldn't budge. Panicking, she kept trying, attempting to lift her other leg as well, but to no effect other than exerting her more easily than something like this normally would. She began to realize just how helpless she was, shaking her head as she tried to deny it, \"No... this cannot be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but it is!\" Replied the Lipomancer, \"The once proud, always triumphant warrior defeated, completely powerless to resist my will! But... I did give you a choice, didn't I? And now must carry out the execution you've chosen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jane gasped as she felt the ooze within her body shift and churn. She started to grow even larger, but instead of looking fatter, it began to look like the different parts of her were bloating up like a water balloon. She panicked at first, who wouldn't? But fortunately she was able to control her terror once more and focus it into fury and strength. She again clenched her hands into fists as she doubled over, closed her eyes, gritted her teeth, and attempted to focus all of her strength on stopping the fatal process her body was going through. At first it only seemed to slow down the swelling, but then, amazingly, her bloated form began to shrink! Eventually, she had reversed the sorcerer's attempt to kill her completely, and now it was her turn to let out a hearty, belly quaking laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was safe to assume that everyone, lipomancer, warrior, and dragon, were surprised at this. For Fenra, it wasn't necessarily a good thing to see her attacker survive the attempt on her life, but it was a little relieving to see her avoid such a horrible death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer was not amused one bit, and each and every time he struggled to pop his foe like a balloon, he was foiled by her incredible and concentrated strength....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane smiled as she panted, her extremely curvaceous boy covered in sweat from fighting for her life, but she figured that even though she was tiring, she would be able to keep this up for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... still feel like... you're in control...?!\" She grunted, grinning as she held back another surging attack, \"I figure with enough willpower, not only can I get control of my body back.... but I'd also have a good shot at expelling you completely Lipomancer.... how does that feel...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But then he started to laugh again, and the laughter became louder and more powerful, causing her breasts to bounce, her belly to wobble, and her ass to jiggle violently. A chill ran up not only the warrior's spine, but Fenra's as well. It was obvious this was not a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he spoke, \"My, my... I have not had to put up with a struggle this fierce in quite a long time! In fact.... I was almost worried you would beat me back, if only for a moment or two.... It is such a terrible shame that I must dispose of such a fiery spirit in such a way, but at the same time it seems as if I wont be able to break you... ahh well... I hope you are prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then once more, her body began to inflate, and once again Jane struggled to confine the expansion, even managing to taunt him, \"So... this is it...\" She grunted out, \"Your.... big.... huff.... plan...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet even as she focused on containing him, she felt something strange happening within her. As she continued to groan and sweat, she soon realized that the lipomancer was moving some of his mass to other areas of her body.... lower, more sensitive areas. She then let out a sharp gasp as the ooze within began pounding at her nether regions, sending tremendous waves of both pain and pleasure throughout her corpulent body. Yet at the same time, the bloating did not cease, and Jane still tried as hard as she could to concentrate. As she tried harder and harder to focus, she didn't even notice as she fell down onto her massive, flabby rump, simultaneously sending waves through her fat and shaking the ground beneath her. But as the Lipomancer continued to force her sex to throb and pound, it felt like the whole world was shaking anyways. Slowly she was starting to lose her control over her body's swelling, the pressure inside her increasing bit by bit, as she grew inch by inch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Fenra was frightened for her life, her growing concern for what was now happening to Jane overtook her. She got to her feet and slowly crept towards the slowly expanding girl, who was now once more clutching an inflating, spherical belly. It took her a moment to realize what was going on with the redhead, but when a deep red blush spread across Jane's full, round cheeks, and her groans turned to moans, the dragon couldn't help but to blush as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now though, Jane still kept trying to hold him back, desperately attempting to ignore the increasing waves of pleasure emanating from between her thighs. Yet even as she still continued to resist, a tiny, whispering voice seemed to speak to her from the deepest, darkest parts of her, \"Just give in... you know you want to feel it, to let it consume every nerve in your massive body... If you're going to go out... you might as well go out with a bang... heheheh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she began to forget why she was resisting altogether. She opened her eye, stopped groping at her belly, and laid back against a nearby boulder. As the waves of pleasure continued to batter her, she completely let go of herself and fell into complete ecstasy. She began to rock with the throbbing of her sex, blushing hotly, panting heavily, sweating profusely as she moaned, and then screamed in sweet relief as she climaxed, the feeling of the orgasm ten times better than any she had experience before, and yet it still wasn't over! She wobbled and jiggled as she not only continued to come, but continued to swell also, faster and faster now. But now she didn't even care, she just wanted more of this feeling, moaning and mewling, licking her fat lips as she rubbed at her bloating breasts and stretching nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice that her body was painfully stretched to its limits now, she didn't notice that her breasts were now too big to even properly fondle now, and she certainly didn't notice as the dragon she had come to slay was slowly backing away from here. All she could focus on was the fact that there was now something else building up inside of her, something enormous and wonderful, the orgasm of all orgasms. She could feel it getting closer, and closer, and closer until...</span></div></div>",

She began to sob, absolutely horrified at what had just happened, and still hardly managing to piece it all together. Perhaps the only thing that could have gotten her to move out of her shocked, petrified state was the shadow that now crept across her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the newly reformed Lipomancer and screamed, stumbling away from him as she tried to escape.

You see, I own a... fortress you could say, not that far away. I came all the way out here to find a dragon capable of defending it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what makes you think I would agree to do such a thing for... for you!\" She shouted at him, eliciting another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\" he began, a delighted tone in his voice, as if he were telling her a dark, yet brilliant secret, \"I can make you as big and strong as you've always wanted... oh, and not to mention the enormous amount of wealth you will be guarding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis certainly got her attention, her sobs mostly ceasing to sniffles now, \"You really... you mean you can really make me big like all the normal dragons out there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, \"And more so.... oh yes.

Serving him would most likely mean that she would have to do evil things for him. But he was offering her something that she had wanted her entire life. If she agreed to join him she could finally become just as big as the normal dragons and she would have a hoard of treasure to guard. When it came right down to it, the choice was obvious to her greedy mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll join you.\" Fenra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" The Lipomancer exclaimed as he let out an evil chuckle from behind the hood that was covering his face. Fenra still had no idea what his face looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me and I'll lead you to my fortress.\" He stated as he walked off through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra glanced around nervously for a moment then began to hesitantly follow the Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer's fortress was a large castle and it was only a few miles away from Fenra's cave. She was actually surprised by how close it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd.\" Fenra commented, \"I've lived in this forest for a long time, but I didn't know there was a castle here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I move the castle around every once in awhile. When I get bored of a location I use magic to transport the castle somewhere else.\" The Lipomancer explains casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra's large mouth dropped open a little in amazement. She knew that this sorcerer was powerful, but he is apparently even more powerful than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Lipomancer led her into the castle he started to explain her duties to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a large room full of treasure in the dungeon of my castle. Your job will be to guard it from adventurers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra was starting to like the sound of this more and more. Dragons like to live in dark and dank places like caves and dungeons.</span></div></div>",

From what she can see of the castle it is clearly very old, but it also appears to be in good repair. The stones of the castle looked very weathered as if they had been mined from a stone quarry a long time ago. There is a large and well tended garden in the center of the castle courtyard. The Lipomancer must have servants that tend to it, but Fenra couldn't see any around at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm such a powerful magic user that few things can challenge me any more.\" The Lipomancer explained as they walked, \"Unfortunately that lack of challenge has caused me to become very bored. To alleviate that boredom I decide to make this fortress. I've filled it with monsters that are obedient to my commands and I've set magical traps of my own design all over the place. I've also filled this place with treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer led her into the castle's keep and then down a large staircase into the dungeon. The staircase led to a long tunnel that was lit with regularly spaced torches on the walls. Despite the torches the place was still dark and dank. Not that she minded though, dragons prefer dark and dank places. The dungeon was built like a maze with multiple paths leading off in different directions. The Lipomancer clearly knew where he was going as he confidently led her down several different hallways. As they walked down one of the hallways they heard a loud roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Fenra asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's just the Minotaur.\" The Lipomancer answered casually, \"He's just one of the other many monsters in this castle. You'll probably meet them later on. Consider them to be your coworkers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you filling this place with traps and monsters?\" Fenra asks as they walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done it to lure adventurers here.\" The Lipomancer chuckles in an evil way, \"Adventurers can't resist exploring a large ancient castle that is filled with monsters, traps, and treasure. I like to use my crystal ball to watch foolish adventurers wander around my castle getting fattened up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to fatten them up? Why not just kill them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer to make adventurers into my fat and obedient slaves. But if they refuse to become my slaves I'll just fatten or inflate them until they pop. I like to fatten them up because I think it's funny to watch a muscular adventurer become obese. I also do it because... body fat turns me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra blushed a little as she heard that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, like I said before your job will be to guard one of the rooms full of treasure here in the dungeon. If adventurers make it into the treasure room your job is to fatten them up. Once they are too fat to fight you anymore you offer them a choice. They can either pledge their loyalty to me and become my slaves or they can die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I fatten them up?\"</span></div></div>",

On the center of the chamber was a bedding of thick furs, hay and feather  along with a fire pit near by.  the room was lined by gold trimmings and dark purple tapastires hanged from the walls with torches mounted to the wall.  Fenra was feeling at home already.   \"So, if they refuse to serve you, how shall I kill them?\" she stated casually<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I leave that up to you but please do try to fatten some of them till they pop or are completely immoblie arms and all then keep them around for a ahem, snack.

Also I am a man of my word so as promised.\"  He replied, with a flick of his hand Fenra felt a warm bubbling feeling in her body.  She saw the room seeming shrink around her as she grew from 10 feet tall to 25 feet tall and grew a little longer too, she also seemed to get a bit of \"padding\" add to her rear legs and hips.  She  felt a lot stronger and extremly happy she was now right up there with regular dragons. for the first time in her life she felt like she was able to proudly call herself a dragon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lippomancer added,  \"That won't be it, take out some intruders and I shall make sure you get a promotion in your size and stregnth but right now I hope this does do you fine, I've increased your stregnth by 4times.  I won't keep you any longer though I'm sure you want to check out your new den and rest a little,  I've been spying on some traders who have been on their way to the fortress  for the last few days.

A nap certainly wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered over to the bedding pile and flopped down on top of it.  She found it to be <i>very</i> comfortable, the furs most of all; far softer and smoother than any conceivable creature could possibly yield.  She looked down at the furs underneath her, trying to see if she could identify them as coming from any animal she could think of.  The dragon saw, beneath her, a very, very large, wide gray fur, covered in long hairs embedded in what appeared to be a five-inch-thick hide.  Curious, she rolled off the bed to get a better look at it.  It was far wider than she thought, nearly 20 feet, and just about as long.  The hairs lightened in color near the edges, becoming nearly-white four feet in.  Fenra couldn't for the life of her figure out what it could possibly have come from.  Looking it over a bit further, she saw a tail protruding from the hide near the far end, resembling a wolf's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen a wolf get this big...  In fact, I doubt that they even <i>could</i>...\"  She examined the tail and found a tiny silver charm hanging from the tail's base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh...

I'm not getting up.\"  Fenra closed her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unmistakable sound of a gas trap triggering was heard, followed by a surprised yelp...  And then running; a cascade of footfalls, becoming heavier and louder as they drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost out of the hallway, ladies!\" shouted a notably feminine voice.  \"Keep running!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's *pant* getting hard to run...\" another feminine voice responded.  \"What is with all of these fattening traps, Roxy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" the first voice answered; apparently her name was Roxy.  \"But keep going!  It'll only get harder if we slow down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the voices burst into the chamber not a minute later:  Two pudgy vixen mages, a pink-furred one with a red robe and a blue-furred one with a white robe...  Followed by three more pudgy vixens, all mages:  Orange-furred with blue robe, white-furred (an arctic vixen this far down south?) with black robe, and green-furred with purple-robe.  All wielded similarly-sized wooden rods.  Fenra subtly craned her neck to face them, cracking an eye to watch the little tubs (who probably weren't this fat when they'd entered the Lipomancer's lair) jiggle as they clutched their heaving chests.  \"This has got to be the most poorly-balanced party I've ever seen...\" Fenra thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwww...  I'm all sweaty...\" the arctic vixen whined between gasps of air.  \"My robe is soaked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle...\" Roxy said firmly (apparently she was the pink one), fixing her gaze on the arctic vixen.  \"We're <i>adventurers</i>.  We don't complain when we get a bit sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but...  I'm going to get all smelly...\" Belle said, apparently thinking that was a valid counterargument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Then take a bath when we get out of here.</i>  In the meantime...  There's treasure to be found.\"  Roxy turned around, pointing at the door behind Fenra.  \"And I'll bet it's all behind there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there's a dragon!\" the blue-furred one gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy sighed.  \"Sue, it's asleep.  As long as we're quiet, it won't wake up.  And even if it did...\"  Roxy placed her hands on her enlarged hips.  \"We could take that puny thing, easy!\"  Fenra stifled a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, Roxy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then.  Anything you want to complain about, Nichole?\"  The green-furred vixen shook her head.  \"What about you, Vivian?\"  The orange-furred vixen shook her head, as well.  \"Good.  Now, onward to treasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party plodded to the other end of the chamber, past the \"sleeping\" Fenra, and stood before the enormous steel door, backs turned to Fenra.  She couldn't help but grin; they were going to make this quite easy for her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do we open it?\" Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question...\" Roxy whispered.  \"I'll try a spell.  <b>Magic Missile!</b>\"  Roxy pointed her rod at the door and a white burst of energy flew at the door...  Dissipating harmlessly as it impacted.  \"Hmmmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you use that spell?  That's such a useless spell...\" Belle snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting sick of your negativity, Belle...  How about this, then?  <b>Telekinesis!</b>\"  Focusing all of her energy, Roxy applied psychic force to the door...  And it still refused to budge.  \"Ugh...\"  She glared at Belle.  \"Anything you want to say, <i>Belle</i>/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Roxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then...\"  Roxy sighed heavily.  \"Help me push the damn thing open, then.  Girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded, taking position shoulder-to-shoulder in front of the door, and began to push the heavy steel door with all of their might combined...  Which of course, amounted to nothing.   Fenra grinned even wider; not only were they completely oblivious to her, they were clustering themselves together...  A single blast of Fenra's new fattening flame would hit them all!  However, Fenra decided to wait a bit; she enjoyed watching their futile attempts to do anything useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor five minutes, the mages pushed the door, only managing to exhaust themselves.  Fenra shook her head, smiling.  \"One more thing before I roast 'em...\" she thought to herself.  She reached over the vixens and lightly pushed the door, opening it but a crack and retreating back to her bed before they saw her.  As the door creaked open a fraction of an inch, the vixens believed they were actually making headway.  \"Harder, girls!  We're getting there!\"  They all braced their legs, throwing all of their weight into their endeavor...  And promptly fell onto their padded guts after inadvertently pushing <i>themselves</i> away from the door.  Seeing that now was as good as any time to attack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showtime,\" Fenra whispered before inhaling...  And then breathing a cone of white fire onto the unsuspecting party ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey screamed, caught off guard by the plume of flame that had come from absolutely nowhere.  \"I...  I don't feel anything...\" Belle said, confused.  \"It doesn't burn...  It's not doing anything...\"  Belle would eat her words, though, as they all slowly began to rise from the floor, their bellies growing from underneath them with new flesh.  \"Aagh!  Not <i>more</i> fattening traps!\" she squealed, flailing about as she tried to get back on her feet.  \"Where is it coming from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra stilled her breath for a moment to answer her.  \"Why, the \"puny,\" \"sleeping\" dragon, of course.\"  Fenra let another jet of flame loose on the vixens, watching them expand even quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked behind them, turning their necks despite the extra skin and jowls and the growing masses of ass, thighs and hips blocking their view, and saw the same dragon they'd been ignoring this entire time.  Nichole and Vivian began to cry, overwhelmed by what they were sure to be their demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, what's the matter?\" Fenra asked in a mocking voice as she approached Nichole.  \"Are you scared of the dragon?\"  Fenra was loving every moment of this; she never had any power before...  But now, she was in control.  Everything that would happen, from this point on, would be her own machinations.  She flashed a toothy grin at the captive Nichole, sliding a claw right underneath her exposed, white-furred belly, feeling her grow and watching as the seams of her robe burst, flying dramatically to either side of her expanding body...  In unison with the rest of the vixens' robes.  \"My, my; you're all gaining quite a bit of weight, aren't you?  You don't even fit your clothes anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to die...\" Nichole whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little porkers won't...  So long as you do one thing:  Pledge allegiance to the Lipomancer, and serve him for eternity.  The choice is yours, ladies...  Server him, or die...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  Uhhh...

Except that they couldn't; they had to push a cumbersome, white-furred gut across the floor with them, and contend with their massive thighs scraping together.  The best they could manage was a waddle, and a slow one at that.  It was the only chance they had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shuffled along the floor, side-by-side, each of them occasionally reciting their surprisingly-useful spell to make sure that the dragoness could neither see them nor smell them.  The dragoness thrashed about the room, swinging her claws in the hopes of snagging one of the butterballs on her talons and sweeping her tail across the floor to try and knock them back on their asses.  Unfortunately for her, though, every single attempt missed, not even grazing any of the vixens, who were becoming as broad as the proverbial side of a barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra was at a loss for tactics, here.  She was rendered completely blind and unable to smell through the reeking yellow haze; all she had left to rely on was her significantly-weaker sense of hearing.  The only thing she could do was blast the biggest plume of fattening flame she could in the direction that she heard the next \"spell\" come from, hoping to immobilize them fully...  They'd probably still continue \"casting,\" but Fenra figured they'd tire eventually; once they were rendered too fat to move and too exhausted to cast there horrid little spells, it was only a matter of waiting for the mist to clear...  And she'd just stroll on by and pick them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra inhaled as deeply as she could, gagging as she was forced to take in some of the fumes, and held it.  She focused all of her attention on sound, listening for any noise that would give away the position of the fleeing vixens, and zeroing in on the perfect sound...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a *PHRRRRRRT* coming from her right, she turned her head and fired into the mist with all of her might...</span></div></div>",

The dragoness stood up straight and flapped her wings twice, clearing the miasma from the chamber.  It flew down the hallway and surrounded a number of highly unfortunate guards, but...  Fenra didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd triumphed over the vixen mages, and was now free to collect her trophies.  A wicked grin came across her face as she strolled over to her massively-fattened prey.  They sat, helpless and bound by the tons of fat on their frames.  The dragoness looked her trophies over; they were all about the same size.  Fenra picked up pink-furred Roxy and took a good look at her, holding her by her enormous ass in her right claw and jostling the vixen's mammoth gut with her left.  She rotated the vixen in her claws much like one would with a model airplane, examining her from every angle possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!  I'm getting dizzy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my 'pet.'  You don't call the shots here; I do.\"  Fenra continued to admire her handiwork, measuring the pink vixen with her eyes.  With a gut 12 feet wide, tall <i>and</i> deep, breasts measuring past double-Z's, hips as wide as Fenra was with ass-cheeks the size of the dragoness's balled-up claw and thighs colliding 4 feet into each-other, she knew she had made the perfect snack; not only one, but five, all measuring the same.  Fenra licked her lips at the thought of tearing into that succulent gut; however, she wouldn't do such a thing...  Yet.  She wasn't done enjoying her 'trophies,' and not even close to finished playing with her 'toys.'  She'd have to satisfy herself with just a lick of Roxy's flavor.  Fenra turned her around, bringing her ass to her mouth and preparing to \"spelunk\" it with her tongue.  Naturally, Roxy panics, squirming with all her might to break free of the cruel dragon's grasp.  The only thing that had helped her so far comes to mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy opened her mouth.  \"<b>Stinking Cloud</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you don't, you filthy, reeking beast!\"  Fenra picks up Belle and jams her head as far as she can get it to go up Roxy's ass.  Roxy screams at the surprise-penetration while Belle squeals as the pink vixen's \"spell\" is released all over her face and upper-shoulders.  \"Uh, oh!  Belle, you're getting all sweaty and smelly!  I guess you'll have to take a bath later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dragoness is satisfied that Roxy's cast her \"spell,\" she pulls the two apart, leaving both gasping for air.  \"Let that be lesson to all of you...  Not taking away your rods was a <i>huge</i> oversight...  Now, give them to me, or you'll be...  Punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blubbery vixens do as they are told, tossing their only weapons into Fenra's eager claws.  \"Good job.  Now...\"  Fenra picked up each vixen and placed them against the wall, shoulder-to-shoulder.  She calls down the hallway for an enormous washbasin full of water, some soap, and a cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to clean you reeking whales up.  Won't that be nice, Belle?\"  The arctic vixen looks away, saying nothing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fenra panted. Even at ten feet tall and the strength afforded to her kind, moving those five was work. Not unpleasant work, she considered, the feeling of that fat flesh against her, soft hot pillowy mounds, now sweat moistened fur having rubbed against her. After another pleasant shiver rolled down her spine, she stood erect. Time to see about being the big bad monster.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn retrospect, perhaps giving baths wasn't how you treated wayward adventurers in a dungeon? She was never too keen on that sort of thing. And what sort of minions did she have? Doesn't she need a hoard now? Fenra moved over to snatch up the robes that had since burst from the vixen's bloated bodies, using two claws to rummage around in the various pockets. Moving to one corner, leaving her charges for the moment to wiggle their mostly useless bodies in futile attempts at momvement, Fenra made a pile on the floor of gold coins, jewelry, and various odds and ends. Spread out, it would hardly cover enough for her to sit on.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe turned back around, ready to deal with her fifty foot line of vixens, just in time to see miniscule figures clamber in. Their claws scraped against the stone as they carried a huge warm wash basin and various tools into the chamber and set them down. Kobolds. Purple ones, in fact. She had her own minions! Fenra felt warm pride as she stepped up to the mint green vixen. The pride was gone in an instant. Despite being ten feet tall, and towering over most adventurers, her body sleek, shapely, and evenly muscled, the Nichole's fat belly pushed up to her chest. The vixen was packed with fat, having grown so fat in so little time. Her muzzle bobbed amongst fat neckrolls and cheeks. Her arms stuck out to either side over her hips, fat dark green paws resting uselessly on her ass. Nichole seemed to be more hourglass shaped, her huge blimp like tits settling on either side of her stomach.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNichole panted like Fenra imagined a beached whale might. She felt pity, briefly, seeing Jane again in that field, bloating up until... but no, like Jane, they could have left her alone! Instead, they tried to attack her in her sleep. AND those noxious gasses. Fenra poked furiously into the green gut, making Nichole's quivering cheeks ripple with a fart. The green vixen whimpered. \"What are you going to do with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat WAS she going to do. She felt her stomach. She was still hungry... <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she considered, the kobolds went to work. They were not gentle or shy. They were purple, which was a nice touch. \"I haven't decided yet.\" She was a great dragon now. What did you do with adventurers. Eat them, usually. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe kobolds dunked long handled brushes in the water. It seems the castle was equipped for this sort of thing. They went about to each vixen, starting with Nichole first. She blushed furiously as it took a dozen arms to lift up one of her fattened breasts and clean the sweat from underneath it, then the other. She moaned as brushes dug underneath the vast overhang of her belly and into the thick canyon of her asscheeks. Every buried inch of her was scrubbed before the kobolds moved onto the next. Fenra watched in wonder. She'd never SEEN anyone so fat. Even dragons never got this fat! She pinched one of Nichole's fat nipples with a grin, making the green vixen moan. The others were in various states of shame and shock, unable to get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom heavy Roxy was last, the kobolds having to team up again to pry her massive ass apart. Sitting down, the tops of the cheeks were just level with her shoulders, she laughed nastily as another loud fart came out from backside, bowling the kobolds over. \"Puny minions for a puny dragon.\" Roxy scoffed. Fenra glared. That damn pink vixen, she wasn't taking this seriously! Fenra had them all under her control! She had to do something. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nStill... could she be as evil as the Lipomancer? And prove herself the great and powerful dragon she was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That was final. She'd make an example of this blimp. It would prove herself to her other prisoners! She snapped her fingers and pointed, \"Bring that sow out.\" The kobolds struggled to obey. Fenra could have struggled to move the vixen again, but that wasn't the point! The kobolds grabbed at her massive ass, careful to stay on either side, and heaved. Roxy grinned at their misfortune until she saw the gleam in Fenra's eyes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nFenra did her best to look benevolent as she leaned over Roxy. \"Ooh,\" she purred, \"I think you and I are going to be wonderful partners... I don't want any of these other hideous blimps. Just you...\" She flicked her tongue out and down over Roxy's face. Roxy was confused as Fenra dipped her head down. She kissed one flattened breast, then one sweat soaked backroll, then started kissing over one huge rumpcheek. A shiver ran up Fenra's spine. She was enjoying this. She dipped her head low between the vixen's cheeks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Stinking Cl-AAAHHD!\" In a desperate final attempt, Roxy used her final recalled spell. The one Fenra was waiting for. The dragon let go of the water pitcher she had picked up and crammed hard into the vixen's pucker, wedging the belled out bottom well inside. Roxy's face screwed up as there sounded a deep resonant BLORP within her stomach. She looked wildly around, unable to push her head too far to either side, \"H-hey! You big bitch, take it out!\" Her stomach began to swell up and out, the flattened gut filling slowly with the spell. \"Take it out! Take it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are going to be such a gas bag, you should look like one,\" Fenra taunted, stepping back. As big as she was, Roxy wasn't vast enough to easily contain a twenty foot radius spell like that! The kobolds scampered quickly away behind pillars and the other vixens, yipping in fear. Steadily, Roxy's stomach filled, the pink fur spreading out as it filled with the noxious spell. Soft rolls undivided into solid heavy bulk as it lifted further up into her field of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give up, please! I'll be your slut, I'll do anything! Kill one of them instead!\" There was a chorus from the other vixens of gasps. Partially at Roxy's betrayal, partially at the sight of the rest of her soft doughy form swelling. Her vast rump began to swell out behind her, already the largest bottomed of the five, it started to blow up like a twin pair of balloons. Her tits, no slouches themselves, filled out from sagging weights into rounding swells. Her cheeks bulged, pushing her muzzle further and further back, her neck ballooning up. Her arms started to look like marshmellows, fattened paws sinking all the way into them, fingers spreading. Sweat poured from her straining form, weak farts escaping around the pitcher. The vixens flinched back as her huge ass started pressing up against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin started to creak as her muzzle disappeared almost entirely between the valley of her shoulders, belly, and butt. Her arms were comically small between the huge growing blimps. Roxy moaned weakly just before the final creaking groan. Then there was a yellow gassy eruption and a thunderous PHFBBBBT.</span></div></div>",

The kobolds rushed in, scooping them up from all over the dragon's new lair. \"And now.\" The kobolds went to work. Fenra grabbed a gob of fat and tallow. She was starving. And this big blimp laughed at her. It wasn't WRONG. It was right! She was a dragon! She was the pinnacle of magic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit down, gulping down the lard and fat marbled meat, shallowing it whole. The kobolds rushed out with trays, bringing her the thick fat first. She hadn't eaten in days and this wasn't just a meal. It was victory. She swallowed the thick chunk of fat just as a kobold came with more pieces. The smell of roasting meat and fat came from the other side of the room as the kobolds worked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDeciding to completely enjoy her victory, Fenra sprawled herself out on the stone tiles, allowing her kobold servants to drop thick greasy morsels into her mouth. She chewed with obvious relish, a swallow soothing the fire in her belly. She grabbed the rest of the tray, tipping it up into her mouth to greedily gobble. The vixens had to watch, horrified, as Fenra ate greedily and noisily. Five thousand pounds of their companion was a slow process, but Fenra was eager now. This was the first of many great meals!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe grabbed more chunks in either hand, stuffing them into her mouth. Grease rolled down her neck as she ate. Then, the changes began. A line of scales down her back started to change colors. Like a painter slowly mixing in new pigment, the purple scales lightened in hue. From laying on her side, the others could see her butt expanding first. What was once a strong toned posterior started to swell with weight, round thick curves packed on. Her thighs began to thicken, covering muscle with a sensual layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft dome of belly began to appear and grow, the scales stretching as adipose built up behind it. Her breasts received the least attention, though the tight shapely orbs began to fill and sag slightly under new weight. She put a hand to her stomach, feeling it as it when from a bit of chub to a full blown gut, swelling with each bite.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen the last bite of Roxy was gone, Fenra stood up. She stood thirteen feet tall now, her form having gone from a toned starved predator to a comfortably fat bottom heavy glutton, her big butt jiggling as she strutted with pleasure around the room, comparing her new height addition to the vixens. And she felt a tingle deep within her. That was... magic? It seems she inherited the wizard vixen's powers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what to do...</span></div></div>",

But this blimp needed some teaching. \"You! Uhhh...\" She waggled a hand at a kobold, \"Whatever your name is. I assume this place has lots of leftovers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kobold bobbed its purple scaled head. Its voice was high pitched and yipping. Fenra would have to make sure not to ask them too many more questions. \"Oh yes, mistress. Yes, lots of leftovers. Some can't always finish their meals!\" High pitched giggling followed by a couple 'boom's from the crowd of kobolds.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFenra nodded firmly, \"Good. We are going to given this fat blob a job.\" She swatted the side of one big pink furred butt cheek with the back of her hand, making it ripple. \"I will also need some items...\" Roxy turned back in worry, trying to look over one flabby shoulder. But it was too late. The kobolds scampered into the hallways.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt didn't take long for her new minions to return with long pieces of rope, a long chute of metal, and a ladder. Industriously, they set about to flinging the rope around nearby pillars, anchoring it in place with steady claws and a minimum of striking each other. Roxy looked back and forth, then up at the chute that was hoisted into place over her face. \"Hey, what are you doing, you big bitch?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFenra scowled. This was exactly the problem! Roxy couldn't track the kobolds over her huge sides, but she could see the big ladder being put into place at the end of the chute. Kobolds climbed up to the top of the ladder at the chute. Roxy's confusion was short lived as the first bucket was passed up the tall ladder and upended onto the chute. \"Wait a minute!\" she shouted, just sludge of cream thickened with stale cake and pastries slid down the chute onto her face. Unfortunately for Roxy, Fenra's 'fire' made her just fat enough that her head was in a sort of valley of fat. It settled around her muzzle, making her gulp down some to gasp. She tried to move her stained muzzle away as another bucket load came down. This time, she had to gulp steadily to get her muzzle free, sucking in sweet heavy sludge. \"Stop!\" She coughed. But it wouldn't stop. Another bucket load slid down, this time followed quickly by another as the kobolds got into a rhythm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA steady trickle of leftover slop fell into and onto Roxy's muzzle, splattering over her breasts and face. \"You better eat,\" Fenra chided, \"You don't want to drown in food.\" Roxy, wheezing from several failed attempts to avoid getting doused in food, starting to gulp and chomp. Whole pieces of cake came down the chute, bumping icing against her face. She had to chomp it down quickly, fat cheeks jiggling before wine soaked pastries started to fall around her face. She tried to use her arms to herd the food back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other four vixens watched in horror and shock as thir companion was made to eat rapidly. Sweets gave way to thick cold stews laden with spare grease and chunks of meat and bread. Some of the buckets were used lard and tallow, making Roxy gag as she gulped the semi-solid stuff down to keep herself breathing. Fenra patted one huge ass cheek, leaning over to press her ear to the vixen's stomach. She could hear the sounds of digestion inside, thick GLORPS and GURGLES as food was churned. She had a stomach that could fit a family of three comfortably. Fenra wondered with a giggle if she'd EVER stop eating. She tapped a claw against her chin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Set up a chute in the back for when she's asleep.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Whmph?!\" Roxy cried in vain. Her backside erupted with a loud fart as her greasy meal churned within her. Sweat was starting to accumulate despite her recent bath, as she struggled to keep up with the tide of food. Her stomach struggled to take in the meal, but there was plenty of room to store food, and it only started to fill slowly. Like a bladder being filled with a trickle of water.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe turned towards the other vixens just as the Roxy cried out. A second chute was just crammed roughly into her tailhole.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNow, what to do with the four remaining...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd put her all into that last blast.  She didn't have the energy to move, let alone launch another volley of flame.  \"Patience, Fenra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, the haze began to thin; the air seemed a bit more breathable and the dragoness could actually see a bit through all of the yellow.  She scanned the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to her great disappointment realized that she was all alone in the room; her prey had escaped her grasp.  She'd had ample opportunity to fatten them...

Uh...\"  Fenra shook her head.  She didn't know what powers the Lipomancer actually had, but she wouldn't put \"omnipresence\" past him; it probably wouldn't be a good idea to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"  The Lipomancer took a moment to sample the air.  \"And why does it reek in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've...

I didn't pose the question fast enough, I didn't fatten them enough...  I was completely blindsided by a few meager spells...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Stinking Cloud.'  Over and over and over again...  <i>From their asses.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like quite the sight.\"  The Lipomancer chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did it so much that the room became unnavigable; I couldn't smell them through the stink and I couldn't see them through the yellow haze...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I completely botched the last-ditch fire blast...  It doesn't even seem that I came <i>close</i> to hitting them...\"  Fenra sighed.  \"Please forgive my incompetence.\"  The dragoness bowed before her employer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Fenra, from what I've heard, this doesn't really sound like your fault...  I don't think most people would anticipate an ass-borne 'Stinking Cloud' spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big were the mages when they escaped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra held her claws out in front of her, bringing them closer together.  \"About this big,\" Fenra said, describing creatures the size of oxcarts.  \"They could barely waddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Fenra.  From the sound of it, I don't think they'd have gotten very far outside your lair, anyway; I bet they've already been caught by some passing guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose; they still have their magic rods, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they have any strong spells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The strongest I saw was a Telekinesis spell one used to open the steel door...

Why, I bet the others never would have thought to <i>fart</i> their way to freedom without your example.\"  Fenra scowled.  \"What are you doing here?\"  The dragoness circled the vixen, looking her over as the butterball squirmed.  Squirming was all she could do.  She couldn't speak; there was a large, red apple in her mouth.  She couldn't run; her thick, fat legs were tied together.  She couldn't cast a spell; she was silenced and her arms were tied together above her head.  And even if she could, her rod was elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got you good, huh?\" Fenra said as she viciously jabbed the vixen in her enormous white-furred gut, a perpetually-quivering mass draping two feet from either side of her and rising nearly nine feet beyond the massive white globes that were the vixen's breasts.  She smiled as the vixen winced and jiggled like a gelatin mold sitting on molded dough.  The dragoness reached under Nichole's hanging belly-folds and grabbed her soft, pillowy love-handles and sank her talons in.  Fenra craned her neck to put her face right in the vixen's face, licking her lips as she watched the vixen writhe and squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you try to cast a spell?\" Fenra said mockingly.  \"Hmmmm?  How about some more of your Stinking Clouds?  You're so good at those!

I'll spread your ass apart, so you can cast the spell easier!\"  Fenra pulled Nichole's 'cheeks wide apart, making her squeal...  And exposing a bit of rope sticking out from between the pressed white fur of her ass.  \"Hmmm?  What's this?\"  Curious, she pulled on the rope; it stuck fast.  She pulled harder and with an audible popping sound, it came free, tied around the vixen's magic rod.  Apparently, somebody had stuck it up her asshole like a cork; it was almost poetic justice.  Fenra giggled as the vixen let loose a muffled scream through her apple.  \"Hey, tubby!

Simply call if you<br>\r\nneed anything else.<br>\r\n-The Lipomancer</u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice of him,\" Fenra said to herself as she looked around the room.  There was a pile of objects near the entrance that she hadn't noticed before.  She took inventory of what she'd been left:  A spellbook, a magic charm, a dozen spears, a dozen daggers, a jar of red paint and a brush, a bucket of oil, a bucket of milk, thirty feet of rope...  And a plate of steaks, presumably breakfast.  Fenra grinned wickedly at \"her\" vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nichole!  We'll have so much fun!\" she said, hugging the green fox's soft gut, and nibbling just to make her squirm.  The vixen kicked her flabby legs, still bound together, futilely.  \"Hmmm...  I can't hear you having fun...  I'll take that nasty apple out of your mouth...\"  She plucked the apple from her mouth.  \"Better, fatty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\" Nichole said, the first word she could speak in hours.  \"Please, don't hurt me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I <i>have</i> to!  You filthy, reeking beast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNichole whimpered as Fenra walked around her towering and gut and out of her view, uncertain what she'd do next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fenra's claws shot into the vixen's side as she was rolled over onto her gut.  \"Aaaaaaaaaah!\" she shrieked, surprised.  She sank as her belly-fat spread from underneath her, flattening out across the floor.  The flab of her back sprang up, no longer compressed by the weight of her belly, and sagged over her love handles like they were melting.  Her ass and tits bounced from the shock, up and down, until they sank into her leg-flab and belly-blubber, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure do put on a good show, Nichole...\" Fenra said as she kneaded the vixen's doughy gut.  \"And you look so soft!\"  Fenra pounced on top of Nichole's back, spreading herself out like she was on a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooof!\" the vixen cried.  Fenra giggled.  \"You <i>are</i> soft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  And I bet you smell sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"  Nichole stopped mid-sentence as Fenra grabbed the vixen's wide, round hips and thrust her muzzle right between her massive buttocks and drilling right into her asshole.  All Nichole could do was squeal like a pig as she shifted her mammoth hips and thighs left and right to shake the cruel dragoness out.  \"Stop it!\"  Fenra pulled out of the vixen's tail-hole and moved a bit lower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEP!\" Nichole squeaked as Fenra's tongue zipped into the green vixen's flab-covered nether-lips.  \"Nnnnnnngh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness resurfaced after a moment, leaving the fox panting.  \"You do smell sweet!  And you <i>taste</i> sweet, too!\" Fenra mocked.  \"Awwww, is da poor widdle vixen a bit winded?\"  Fenra squeezed Nichole's right asscheek, relishing the \"squish\" between her talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen's backside began to quiver, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pffffft!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weak bit of gas whispered from between her 'cheeks, followed by another one, and another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you try to cast another spell, dearie?\" the dragoness growled.  \"You know, I don't like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Please, I didn't mean to!\"  Fenra grabbed a claw-full of Nichole's well-fatted belly and bit down on it <i>hard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwwwwwwwwwww!  Why!?\" the vixen squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know not to do it...\" the dragoness replied.  She rolled off of the fox's flabby back.  \"Well, now what shall I do?\"</span></div></div>",

Nichole gulped.  \"Do <i>you</i> want it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green vixen shook her head.  \"Suit yourself, girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon circled her cowering prey, looking for a point of attack...

When she exhaled, the white Vixen screamed (who also forgot about the enchantment in a fit of fear). Once the flame cleared, Fenra was confused (but remembered) about the sudden expansion of her victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white fox's already large belly ballooned outwards, like rising dough. Her ass became about the width of a car with her thighs being as thick as tree trunks. Her expanding belly and thickening arms forced them out to their sides. Her breasts became the size of beach balls, nearly obscuring the poor fox's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh... P-Please... No more!\" the now immobile fox sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra felt something inside her that would probably not go well with her current job occupation. Pity. She was just that pathetic. But she also felt something she hadn't felt in awhile... Lust. It was odd to her given the current situation. The feeling of having complete control over another - body and mentally - made her moist. And the Lipomancer was right. Fat is kinda hot. Biting her lip in a combination of sexual pleasure and thought, she rolled the thoughts around in her head - with the vixen's begging in the background. She eyed her soft, jiggiling flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>That could be tasty...</i> she thought <i>In more ways than one...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer crotch's leaking was hard to ignore, but the desicion still remained...</span></div></div>",

For example, you can force feed them, put weight gain curses on them, or enchant your fire breath to cause weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not big or strong enough to force feed experienced adventurers and I don't even know any magic spells.\" Fenra pointed out as she shook her large head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. I give all of the new monsters I recruit the basic tools they need to do their job. I'll show you after we reach the treasure room that you'll be guarding and living in.\" The Lipomancer explained as he kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra nodded and obediently followed along behind him. She kept silent the rest of the way. A few minutes later, the Lipomancer led her into a large stone room that was lined with torches. Fenra's jaw dropped as she took in the size of the room and noticed it's contents. There was a huge pile of treasure in the center of the room. There were gold bars, jewels, pearl necklaces, diamond rings, and thousands of other shiny objects! The treasure pile was so large that she could bury her entire body beneath the treasure and no one would know she was there. Fenra was practically beside herself with glee. Dragons are a lot like Magpies, they love shiny things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fenra? Fenra!\" The Lipomancer shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes?\" Fenra said as she managed to tear her eyes away from the treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you like your new home.\" The Lipomancer chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do, thank you very much!\" Fenra replied excitedly, \"So... when are you going to make me bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to become bigger, you'll have to prove yourself worthy. Your job is to guard this room from adventurers. I'll cast a spell on you that will make you a little bit bigger each time you defeat an adventurer. They can either pledge their loyalty to me and become my slaves or they can die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that sounds fair.\" Fenra agreed, \"But you still haven't explained how I'm going to fatten up adventurers. You mentioned something about tools?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I'm about to give you those tools right now. I have to warn you though, this will hurt, but when you wake up you'll have new knowledge that will allow you to cast basic magic spells. Those spells will allow you to fatten up adventurers.\" The Lipomancer said as he suddenly spun around and placed one of his hands on Fenra's scale covered head. His hand immediately began to glow with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra felt herself fill with fear as she thought that he was about to inflate her with fat like he did to the adventurers. She didn't have to worry however, because instead of her body filling with fat, her mind began to fill with knowledge. The sudden rush of information into her brain felt like someone had hit her in the head with a brick. It was confusing and trying to understand it gave her a blinding headache. After a few moments of pain, she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra moaned a little as she woke up. Her head throbbed a little in pain, but the pain was fading quickly. She lifted herself up off the floor and looked around. The Lipomancer was gone, he must have left when she was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra rubbed her large head as the last of the pain faded away. That was when she realized that she could finally understand the knowledge that the Lipomancer had forced into her brain. She now knew how to cast several different weight gain related magic spells. One of the spells would make her fire breath cause weight gain instead of burns. Another spell would summon a small cursed feast, any adventurer who smelled the food would be unable to resist eating it. There were also several other spells that would work well together. For example, one spell would make an adventurer fall asleep and another would summon a large chair with leather straps on it. She could use the two spells together to put an adventurer to sleep then tie him or her to the chair then force feed the adventurer. There were a large number of other spells too so she would be able to get quite creative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra let an evil smile creep across her face. She would finally be able to get revenge on adventurers for all those times that they had laughed at her and said that she was too weak for them to waste time slaying her. She had a feeling that she was really going to enjoy working for the Lipomancer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fenra whiled away the time by rolling around in her pile of treasure. She had tried swimming in it, but that simply proved to be impossible. After an hour of this, she simply sank back into her precious new hoard, adorning herself with the odd bit of jewelry and ruminating on this new upturn in her life. The sheer terror that she had felt earlier when first encountering her new master had transformed into a healthy mixture of fear and respect. Certainly, he seemed to be a ruthless man, but he did offer people a choice, which was more than any adventurer ever offered her. She'd never done anything to earn their ire Maybe devouring the occasional bit of village livestock in the lean seasons, but Fenra had been careful to take only enough to keep her going, never enough to justify the village pulling together to go form an angry mob or put up a reward for her head. She sighed, realizing only now that it never mattered. Wherever some sellsword heard about a dragon, two thoughts came up. 'Fame' and 'Treasure'. She remembered the times where adventurers saw her copper coin and threw down their swords in disgust, or saw how relatively puny Fenra was and simply laughed and turned away. The painful recollections made her seethe with fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the loud clanking of metal down the hall registered to Fenra's hearing, and she concealed herself in the treasure, lying in wait. Into the room charged an armored knight with sword and shield. Something about his armor was very much off. Namely, it appeared to be fashioned from whatever metal objects the maker could find. Furthermore, the shield the knight was holding was really more like a barrel lid that had a childish coat of arms painted on it. The sword he was holding was very much real, though, glowing with some sort of intrinsic magic, and despite the quality of the warrior's other possessions, the man himself was absolutely huge, and not in the way she would have expected in this place. He was about seven feet tall and dragging around a kitchen's worth of metal like it was nothing. Additionally, if the dragoness was hearing  correctly, there was one other person following this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ho! This is not the room I seek!\", said the ramshackle knight. \"Where are you, fair maiden? Sir Bartholomew has come to rescue you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about ten seconds before the other person came in after the knight, and Fenra knew that the various countermeasures of the fortress weren't broken. Behind him, a female human blundered into the room, huffing and flushed and covered in sweat from the exertion of her pursuit. She was a pretty young thing, but she was dressed more like a servant than an adventurer, wearing clothing that was stylish, but serviceable. They also looked like they were about to tear right off.The castle had taken its toll upon her figure, ballooning it to what seemed about a hundred pounds more than her usual. \"They... Hfff... They don't pay me enough to take care of this madman... Sir, there's no maidens here! I told you already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, lad! It's an old castle with an evil master! He's surely keeping some kind of princess hostage! And by the blade of my forefathers,\" he intoned, holding aloft the shining weapon dramatically, \"I shall retrieve her, as is my noble obligation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Bartholomew, your family is noble, but it's y'know, desk job noble! They gave up their swords ages ago! Please, let's get OUT of this crazy place and back to the estate! Also, while we're at it, I'm a GIRL.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, Ellis! A bit of hearty exercise will burn away that feminine flab like nothing! Still, what strange traps. Clearly to mock us! I won't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ella! My name is ELLA!\" The harried 'squire' finally managed to pick her head up, brushing her short brown hair out of the way. \"Should be in an a... sy... lum...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla's tongue fell flat at the sight of the treasure before them. And while Ella boggled and her slightly mad charge searched around the room for non-existent damsels, Fenra tried to figure out exactly what to do. These weren't really adventurers, in the strictest sense of the word... But they were right here, and it wouldn't do to tempt the Lipomancer's wrath.</span></div></div>",

This knight is just a wannabe adventurer, but he is still an adventurer. The Lipomancer said that her job was to fatten up adventurers and keep them from taking the treasure, so that was exactly what she was going to do. But how should she fatten them up? The Lipomancer gave her the knowledge to cast a wide range of weight gain spells. She was so excited that she was having trouble deciding which one to test first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fenra tried to decide which spell to use, the wannabe knight continued looking around the treasure pile in search of a damsel in distress. He was so focused on finding a princess to rescue that he was completely oblivious to the treasure around him. His ramshackle armor squeaked horrendously as he moved around. The girl named Ella was still staring at the pile of treasure with her mouth hanging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fenra could decide which spell to use, she felt a sharp pain race up her scale covered tail. The knight had accidentally stepped on her tail as he searched around the treasure pile. Gold and jewels scattered across the room as Fenra erupted from her hiding place in the treasure pile and let out a loud roar of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust settled, Fenra spotted the knight standing in front of her. He had his sword out and he was holding it between himself and her. Fenra could tell that he was shaking in fear because his poor suit of armor was squeaking like crazy. Fenra took a moment to glance around the room and she spotted the knight's 'squire' huddled in a corner whimpering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two were definitely not experienced adventurers if they were afraid of a dragon as small as her. Normal dragons are feared, but her small size never scared anyone before. Not even helpless farmers and peasants had been scared of her. In fact she had seen several of them laugh at her small size before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra realized that this was the first time that she had ever seen anyone afraid of her before. Their fear felt... wonderful to her. Now she understood why some dragons like to go around terrorizing villages just for fun. These two weakling would be no match for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-f-foul b-beast!\" The knight stammered, \"R-release the p-princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis knight was so scared that there was no way that he could fight her. Fenra grinned at the scared knight, making sure to show off her sharp teeth. While the knight trembled at the sight of her teeth, she sneaked her tail around and used it to slap the sword out of the knight's hand. Before he could recover, Fenra picked the sword up in her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided that now was a good chance to try out one of the spells the Lipomancer taught her. It wasn't a weight gain related spell, but it fit the situation perfectly. Fenra focused her mind and unleashed the spell. There was a puff of smoke and when it cleared, the sword that she was holding in her claws had transformed into a small wooden toy sword. That... wasn't what she meant to do. She tried to melt the sword with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, the knight's sword was useless now and the knight and his 'squire' were helpless. All that is left for her to do is fatten them up, then offer them a choice. Swear obedience to the Lipomancer or die.</span></div></div>",

The scent of the knight's fear was intoxicating, like a fine red wine. She would enjoy reducing him from a strong, foolish knight to a fat, foolish pile of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the knight was literally of two minds, fighting a war for himself. On one side was Bart, mild-mannered clerk of privileged lineage, unsuited to adventure in any form other than the adventure novels he so often read. On the other was Sir Bartholomew, righter of wrongs, defender of the weak, valorous to the point of stupidity. The crippling fear of actually confronting a real, live dragon of any size had allowed Bart to momentarily seize control, and he would have started running if it wasn't for the stubborn knight. For now, they had compromised on staying rooted to the spot, quaking, but suddenly Sir Bartholomew was back in charge and did what any less-than-sane person would do in such a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIVE ME BACK MY SWORD!\", the mad knight bellowed. As Fenra leaned forward to bathe the half-mad adventurer in fattening flame, Sir Bartholomew decked her in the jaw. It wasn't an injuring blow by any means, but the sheer amount of bravery and stupidity put into it stunned the dragoness, and her head turned with the fist... Thus expelling the entirety of her expanding exhalation onto the unsuspecting Ella. A cacophony of screams followed, Fenra's having the tone of outraged embarrassment and Bartholomew's bearing righteous rage. Ella's were the loudest, however, and understandably terror-tinged as she thought she was going to be reduced to a charbroiled skeleton. It was much to her surprise when the opposite occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the flames washed over the girl's flesh, she felt a pleasurable warmth spreading through her being, as though she had just been lowered into a steaming hot bath after coming in from the rain. Ella's closed her eyes and moaned as her already plump figure began to bloat, her tight servant's attire ripping apart at the seams, forced apart by her creamy, oozing flesh. Soon they were reduced to mere rags clinging strategically on Ella's fatted form. Her face was now almost comically cherubic, with plump red cheeks and a double chin. Her immense breasts rested on the drooping apron of her stomach, which hung down to conceal her bare nethers, and her ass was now large enough to comfortably seat four small children, if they could manage to keep their balance on the obscenely wobbling mass. The knight stared, shocked at the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! At last, I have found you!\", he exclaimed. Even he could no longer ignore how explicitly female the doughy, swollen form in front of him was. \"But alas, my squire! I will avenge him, you foul, scaly fiend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra seethed, smoke rising from her nostrils. One down...</span></div></div>",

She was used to adventurers hurting her and making fun of her small size. The power that the lipomancer gave her had filled her with a new found confidence. She wasn't going to let adventurers push her around again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight had a few screws loose. It was clear that he was completely unsuited for adventuring. He was just trying to live out a childish fantasy to rescue a princess. Fenra knew that she would have to put this human in his place. She's already learned that he is easily scared. She would use that to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra roared at the knight causing him to once more shake in his suit of armor with fear. With him distracted, she whipped her tail around and slammed it into him. The wussy knight screamed like a little girl as he was sent flying through the air. By sheer dumb luck he collided with Ella's fat gut. Her big belly provided enough padding to cushion the impact. The impact knocked Ella off her feet. She feel to the ground with Sir Bartholomew on top of her. His head came to rest between her large breasts. A large red blush spread across Ella's plump cheeks. She'd always had a secret crush on the desk job nobleman. That was the only reason why she put up with his strange behavior. She even had the occasional daydream of him sweeping her off her feet, but she had never imagined something like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Princess.\" Sir Bartholomew apologized as he got back on his feet.

Ahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight screamed as Fenra exhaled another gout of enchanted fattening fire breath. She had been preparing to unleash it while the knight was busy getting off of Ella. The mild mannered clerk side of the knight's mind whimpered at the sight of the fire coming towards him.</span></div></div>",

Sir Bartholomew screamed liked a little girl as the flames hit him and his screams of terror filled Fenra with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight's armor provided no protection from the fattening fire. His flesh bloated up inside the armor. The armor tried to contain the ballooning fool's body, but the armor eventually lost the battle and popped off under the pressure. Without the armor to hold it in, his flesh spilled outwards. What pieces of clothing he had been wearing under the armor were torn to shreds in moments. The swelling soon stopped as the magic fire faded away. All in all, the crazy knight was about 300 to 400 pounds fatter than he was only moments before. His gut stuck out almost four feet in front of him and his fat thighs were rubbing together. His cheeks were so puffed out with fat that he looked like a squirrel with two acorns shoved in its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight tried to take a step forward, but his new weight threw him off balance and he fell to the floor. He landed flat on his back. He looked down and stared in shock at his wobbling gut as it protruded up into the air like a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra's four legs padded across the floor as she confidently approached the bloated knight. She had a triumphant smile on her reptilian face. The fight was clearly over. There was no way that this weak wannabe knight would be able to continue fighting in this conditions. Fenra felt herself fill with pride as she realized that she had just defeated her first adventurer. Then suddenly, her body felt strange for a moment as a tingling sensation spread through her. When it stopped she realized that her body had grown a few inches larger. Looks like the Lipomancer was telling her the truth when he said that she would grow a little larger each time she defeated an adventurer. Now all that was left for her to do is offer these two fools a choice. Swear obedience to the Lipomancer or die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't eat me.\" The nobleman whimpered as Fenra approached him. The shock of being fattened up had made his mind snap out of its delusions of grandeur. He wasn't Sir Bartholomew, rescuer of damsels in distress, anymore. He was just Bart, the nobleman desk clerk, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fear was intoxicating to Fenra. She couldn't resist having a little fun with him. Bart and Ella both gasped as Fenra's head lunged towards the helpless nobleman. She snapped her sharp teeth together an inch away from Bart's plump nose. His eyes bugged out in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra let out a loud laugh. Once she stopped she turned her attention back to the two intruders and said, \"You both have two choices. Swear obedience and become the newest slaves of my Master, the Lipomancer, or die!\"</span></div></div>",

He's harmless now! He was always harmless! I'll do whatever you want, just don't hurt him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart looked down at his feet, shame-faced (or at least he would have if he could have seen them through his new blubber). \"Ella... Um. I'm sorry I dragged you into this. I know I'm not quite right in the head sometimes...\" Ella sighed and stroked his new apple-cheeks. \"It's fine, it's fine. We're in this together now. We might as well make the best of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart blushed and nodded, then turned to Fenra. \"...Alright, we swear obedience to, um. The Lipomancer, whoever that is.

I'll call some guards to bring you to your new quarters and get you some clothing for your... New sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart and Ella looked down at each other, then looked down at themselves, both of them suddenly blushing very hotly. In the heat of the struggle, Bart hadn't really considered the consequences of his new girth on his clothing, and yelped as he quickly moved his hands to cover up whatever his considerable stomach apron wasn't. Ella, despite their dire situation, giggled, and Fenra just laid back on her hoard, mentally calling some guards to take away the new acquisitions. She was satisfied with her work this time; true, she was a bit sloppy with the knight, but the girl was right. He was never really a true threat, just an annoyance she toyed with. Hopefully, the next batch of adventurers would prove to be more of a challenge, something that would really let her work out her anger.</span></div></div>",

They were wearing plate armor on their upper body, shoulders, arms, and legs, but wore nothing over their stomachs. This allowed their chubby green guts to hang out. They had small tusks growing from their mouths and large upturned noses typical of all orcs. Their faces and their weight made them look almost pig-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orcs pointed and laughed. For a moment, Fenra thought they were laughing at her. She was used to being laughed at. But then Fenra felt a touch of relief when she realized that the orcs weren't laughing at her. They were laughing at Bart and Ella. After they stopped laughing, two of the orcs lead away the new slaves while the last orc stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orc looked at Fenra for a moment then said, \"You must be the dragon that the Lipomancer recruited recently. He told us about you. My name is Hurgar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Fenra, nice to meet you.\" Fenra replied with a touch of nervousness in her voice.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go catch up with the other guards.\" Hurgar stated as he waved goodbye and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra turned her attention back to her hoard of treasure. She began to count the gold coins for fun as she thought about what Hurgar said. She really should go the Monster Lounge and meet her coworkers. She felt nervous about meeting new monsters, but if she went she could make a few friends. Friends weren't exactly something that she'd had before. On the other hand, she was feeling tired after all the things that she had been through today. She really needed to get some sleep. She could always go to the Monster Lounge after she got some sleep.</span></div></div>",

She could get some sleep when she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra sighed as she reluctantly got off of her pile of treasure and started to walk out of the room. She was about half way out of the room when something occurred to her. The treasure would be unguarded if she went to the lounge! She didn't have to worry about it though, because when she stepped out of the room, the door to the treasure room disappeared. For a moment, Fenra panicked and stepped towards where the door used to be. As soon as she did, the doorway to the treasure room reappeared. Understanding dawned on her as she realized what was happening. The room was enchanted to seal itself when she wasn't there and it would only reveal itself when she returned. That way she wouldn't have to worry about some adventurer stealing her treasure while she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling relieved, Fenra stepped away from her treasure room and watched as the doorway disappeared again. She took a look around and wondered where the Monster Employee Lounge was. She knew that this place was like a maze and she would get lost if she didn't know where she was going. At that moment, a sign appeared on one of the nearby walls. The sign read, Monster Lounge, and it had an arrow pointing towards the hallway on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra had a hunch about where the sign came from. To test her theory, she began to wonder where her treasure room was. As soon as she did, another sign magically appeared on the wall. This one pointed in the direction of her lair. Apparently this dungeon was filled with magic signs that guide the monster employees to where ever they wanted to go, but wouldn't help adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra followed the sign that pointed her in the direction of the monster lounge. The path eventually arrived at a fork and another sign appeared, telling her which path to take. She followed the signs for several minutes and she eventually began to hear music and the sound of people talking in the distance. Then she arrived at a huge door that had the words, Monster Lounge, on it. The music and the sound of people talking was coming from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra started to reach for the doorknob with one of her claws, but then she hesitated. The other monsters will probably just make fun of her small size. Sure she had gotten a little larger when she defeated that knight, but she was still very small compared to other dragons. Fenra pulled her claw away from the doorknob. This was a mistake, she should wait until she defeated more adventurers and got bigger before introducing herself to the other monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra was just about to turn around and go back to her lair when the door to the Monster Lounge opened. The music and the sound of monsters talking and laughing filled the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there! You must be the new dragon I heard about. Come on in!\" A deep voice grumbled on the other side of the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before Fenra could protest, what could only be described as a large slimy green tentacle, reached through the doorway and pulled her into the Monster Lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra looked around nervously as the tentacle released her. She saw that the tentacle that had pulled her into the room belonged to a strange looking monstrosity whose entire body was made up of nothing but green tentacles and a single large eye in the middle of its body above a large mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, name is Ted. I'm the Monster Lounge's bouncer.\" The tentacle creature said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...h-hi. I'm Fenra.\" The dragon stammered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Fenra. Have fun in the Monster Lounge.\" The creature replied as it turned its attention away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra looked around the room. It finally dawned on her how huge the room was. There were large comfortable couches around the room and a bar on one side of the room. This placed was filled with more monsters than she had ever seen in one place before. Some of the monsters were smaller than her, but some monsters were much larger than her. The variety of monsters was amazing in and of itself. There were orcs, goblins, gremlins, a troll, an orge, a cyclopes, a minotaur, a naga, a spider woman and... Fenra had to give up trying to identify all the different types of monsters in the room. She would be here all day if she didn't. The Lipomancer was definitely an equal monster opportunity employer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the monsters had one thing in common though. Most of them were fat. Fenra wondered why, but decided to restrain her curiosity, because it would be rude to ask. Although most of the monster were fat, none of them looked as bloated as the slaves. All of the slaves were former adventurers that had been fattened up and forced to swear obedience to the Lipomancer. Fenra spotted several slaves in the room. They were waddling around the room serving food and drinks to the monsters.</span></div></div>",

She knew that she should just go and introduce herself to the other monsters, but she felt too nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, one of the other monsters in the lounge noticed her and shouted, \"Hey everyone! The new dragon is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other monsters all shouted hello as one monster grabbed her and pulled her towards the others. Fenra smiled at them nervously as she told them all her name. Then they began to introduce themselves to her. In the end there were simply too many names for her to remember. After the introductions were over with, most of the monsters went back to what they were doing before she entered the room. A few of the monsters offered to share a table with her and she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey led her over to the table and began to make small talk as Fenra looked them over. The other monsters at the table consisted of a female troll named Gurtha, a female minotaur named Silene, and the male orc she had met earlier named Hurgar. All three monster were fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell us about yourself, Fenra.\" Gurtha the troll said, \"What was your life like before you came to work for the Lipomancer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I want to talk about that.\" Fenra hesitated but started to talk about it anyway, \"I'm such a small dragon because I'm a runt. I was never able to accumulate a horde of treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to worry about that.\" Silene the minotaur snorted, \"The Lipomancer only hires down-on-their-luck monsters to work for him. All the monsters here had a hard life before they started to work for the Lipomancer. Take me for example, before I came to work here I had no maze to live in. Minotaurs are supposed to live in mazes and I always felt sad without one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a similar story.\" Gurtha the troll said, \"Trolls love to live under bridges, but before I came to work here, I didn't have a bridge to live under. Now I get to live under the castle's drawbridge and fatten up clumsy adventurers that fall off of it. We're all loyal to the Lipomancer, because he gave all of us a better life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other monsters at the table nodded their heads in agreement. Fenra felt relieved that none of them made fun of her small size. Like her, all of them had a difficult life before they came to work for the Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra still felt curious about something though. She knew it might be rude to ask, but she couldn't restrain herself anymore. She blurted out, \"I know that the slaves are all fat because they were adventurers that were fattened up. But why are most of the monsters, like you, also fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being offended, the other monsters at the table just laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because the food here is so unbelievably tasty.\" Hurgar chuckles, \"The Lipomancer also lets us eat as much as we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you're over weight, won't it be more difficult for you to fight off adventurers?\" Fenra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, unlike the adventurers and the slaves, the Lipomancer has all the monsters enchanted with a spell that prevents our body fat from hindering us.\" Silene explains, \"In fact, being fat somehow makes us stronger. The fatter a monster is, the more powerful they are. So if you want to become very powerful, you're going to have to start eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we have one of the slaves bring you some food?\" Gurtha suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra hesitated.

She had done well in taking care of the ragtag duo that came into her room, but she knew that it was only a matter of time until larger parties of more experienced adventurers happened into her lair, and she'd need every edge against them. Besides, wasn't growing wider the same as growing taller? It all made her larger, and besides, if she didn't like it, the growth earned from thwarting sellswords and spellslingers might even the blubber out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness nodded determinedly. \"Yeah. Bring it on, and keep it comin'!\" The resolute reply earned the smiles and hearty cheers from her new companions, who immediately called over for a small cadre of slaves, male and female. Fenra noted the humiliating attire each of them were clothed in; essentially very ornate and inadequate loincloths, a collar around what passed for their necks, and nothing else. Their expressions varied; a few had faces tinged with fear, while less of them had the calculating and desperate glint of scrutiny in their eyes, probably hoping to find some way out of their situation. Most, however, seemed to wear a placid, almost content expression, as though accepting of their situation. One of them hefted a large, well-worn codex above him, and it took Fenra a moment to realize it for what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra turned the pages deftly with her claws. Each set of pages was dedicated to a delicious, mouth-watering meal, an almost pornographic description of it on one side and an equally obscene picture of it on the other. The dragoness felt enraptured, almost tasting the food on her tongue as she savored it with her eyes. She flipped and flipped and there seemed to be no end to the variety of foodstuffs available to her. She was nearly paralyzed with choice. Gurtha, Silene, and Hurgar peeked over, trying to discern in their minds what she'd take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Fenra seemed have made up her mind.</span></div></div>",

That was when she realized that she didn't have to just pick one thing. It was probably best if she did eat more than one dish. She was very small for a dragon, but she was still large enough to eat more food than several humans combined. If she was going to fatten herself up to become more powerful, she would have to eat a ridiculous amount of food. She would also have to start a strict diet of gluttony to follow in the days and weeks ahead. But she was getting ahead of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, I'll take one of everything.\" Fenra declared.

Judging from the looks of amusement on the faces of the other monsters, they enjoyed it to for the same reasons. Fenra was going to make sure that every adventurer she meets would pay for the humiliation that she had endured. She knew it was evil, but she is an evil monster working for a powerful evil magic user so she couldn't care less. These slaves are nothing more than toys for her and the other monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! It won't happen again!\" The slave whimpered, \"We'll get your food as fast as we can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra and the other monsters laughed as the slave ran off to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will teach him.\" Hurgar chuckled to the hearty approval of the other monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I was wondering about something.\" Fenra commented after she and the other monsters finally stopped laughing, \"You said that all of us monsters are enchanted to become stronger as we get fatter. Couldn't we just use the magic spells that the Lipomancer taught us to fatten ourselves up? Using magic to do it would be 1000 times faster than gaining the weight the natural way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Silene, Gurtha, and Hurgar all yelled fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly startled by their outburst, Fenra asked, \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enchantment that makes us stronger as we get fatter and it prevents our body fat from hindering our movement at all. But the enchantment only works if the weight is gained naturally. In other words, by eating huge amounts of food.\" Silene explained, \"If a monster gains fat magically, the enchantment won't work and the fat that was added will hinder the monster just like normal fat would. Basically, the monster would become just as weak as these stupid fat slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilene looked at one of the nearby slaves for emphasis. The unfortunate slave cowered in fear when she saw the Minotaur gaze at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, thanks for letting me know.\" Fenra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Gurtha replied, \"There is something else you should know. You need to be careful to make sure that your own weight gain spells don't backfire on you. The weight gained from any of those spells won't work with the enchantment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Hurgar nodded, \"About a year ago, one of my own spells bounced off of a magician's spellward and hit me. Thankfully, I didn't put much power into the spell so I only gained about 25 pounds, but it was still a pain because the enchantment didn't make me stronger to compensate for the extra weight. I was able to lose those 25 pounds of magically added fat after a few weeks of dieting and exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I'll have to be careful with how I cast my weight gain spells then. Thanks again for the information.\" Fenra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes idle conversation, Gurtha growled, \"What is taking those slaves so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra and the other monsters decide to...</span></div></div>",

Maybe we can get them to hurry up with a little 'encouragement'.\", she snarled. Hurgar clapped her shoulder, grinning. \"Looks like you got a real vicious streak in you! I like that. Let's go check in on the useless little scutpuppies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group stomped their way towards the kitchen, they noticed the slaves screaming and the sound of crashing kitchenware. Silene snorted. \"I think they know we're coming, the way they're panicking.\" She kicked open the door and together, all four of the gluttonous monsters loosed a bellowing roar. \"Slaaaaaaves! Where's our FOOD?!\", they began to cry, but their demanding question died in their throats as they observed the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been remodeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was always large, but it had become massive, to the point where the hordes of slaves seemed like fat little mice, scurrying hurriedly while bearing massive platters that took teams of ten slaves to carry, each of them groaning and straining beneath the sheer weight of food. The quartet seemed to shrink into themselves despite their bulk when they sighted the master of the kitchen, a towering metal construct cast in a mold that could have been fashioned after an powerful giant or an ancient god. Clad in the raiment of a chef de cuisine, his face was frozen in an expression of stern judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon his chest he wore a nametag roughly the size of Fenra, emblazoned thusly; \"HELLO! MY NAME IS LEM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KITCHEN STAFF ONLY.\", came a painfully loud voice, heavy with resonance like the defiant cry of a titan chained beneath the earth echoing through endless caverns. \"PLEASE LEAVE IMMEDIATELY OR BE PUNISHED.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurgar whistled. \"Well... That's... Uh. New. You think this has anything to do with that giant who got so drunk that he barreled into the kitchen and tried to empty the pantry, and disrupted operations for like two whole days in the process?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGurtha closed her eyes to think. \"You mean the girl the boss...\" she shuddered. \"Oh, no, I don't even want to think about it. So terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra just squeaked as her thoughts ran wild. What would she do?</span></div></div>",

The slaves loaded them onto the table with audible effort. When they left back to the kitchen to get going on bringing out the rest of the order, there there wasn't even room for any of the monsters to put their elbows down. The platters contained the one order of every variety of french toast, pancake, and waffle on the menu. The golden towers of delight teetered perilously, held together by only by cascades of syrup, topped with what looked like sticks of butter. Off to the side on the platter, there was also a well-sized pile of sausages and bacon, easily twice the size of Fenra's head. To drink, there were two absolutely enormous jugs, one for milk and one for a strange-looking juice that the dragoness couldn't place. Each monster was presented with a massive fork and knife. Grins were all around the table as they knew this was only the tip of the iceberg as far as their meal was concerned.</span></div></div>",

A stream of servants was easily visible as they came through the door with massive platters in tow, and leaving carrying empty dishes back to the kitchen with nothing but the occasional cleaned bone. \"Those dish washers are gonna have a field day.\" thought Fenra, as she continued to dig into the food with zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra had never been used to this kind of sheer gluttony, only living off of the bare minimum up to this point in her life in her attempt to keep would-be intruders away. However, she enjoyed every second of it as her belly distended with the many morsels that filled her gut. Shortly after, though, her eating began to slow-- she was getting exhausted, with her stomach already stretched out several feet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it happened. Fenra's eyes rolled into the back of her head as she fell backwards, landing square on her back with the contents of her stomach sloshing as she hit the floor. The moment she hit the ground, all the monsters in the lounge let out a guttural cheer. \"Alas, down she goes!\", shouted Hurgar. \"Let's get the growing lady some help, shall we?\" Then, as if on queue, Gurtha shouted, \"SLAVES!\" with a loud retort. Within seconds there were four fattened slaves lined up, ready for orders. \"I called you all here for one simple job, and that's to make sure this dragon is fed, can I trust you all with this basic task?\" The four slaves nodded nervously as they eyed the bloated dragoness lying there. \"I said, CAN I TRUST YOU WITH THIS TASK?\" almost immediately, their response was an affirmative, \"Yes, Ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Gurtha was \"preparing\" the slaves for their intimidating challenge, Hurgar strolled up to Fenra and knelt so she could hear him. \"So...full...\" was all Fenra could muster to say. Hurgar chuckled, \"Here, that is never a problem-- in fact, I'm pretty sure you're forgetting you're own new abilities.\" He was right, the Lipomancer did give her the ability to remove all anguish from overeating, but in her stupor, the spell was just a blur in her foggy mind. \"Here.\" Hurgar reached for the pitcher of the unknown juice. \"Drink this.\" He said, as he lifted her head to meet the lip of the large pitcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fenra drank the strange purple liquid, she began to feel much better as her stomach began to return to normal, well, normal plus a healthy layer of fat. As her bloated belly shrunk, the rest of her body grew and bulked up. Her whole body was affected as she began to put on pounds of fat. In less than a minute, the juice's effects were finished (or so she though) and had deposited the calories throughout her body, with most of it appearing to settle around her hindquarters and tail. And with that, she got up, stumbling a bit as she got used to her new weight. \"There we go, good as new.\" exclaimed Hurgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Fenra got up, Gurtha had finished harassing the slaves enough to \"motivate\" them to move as fast as their fat little bodies could. It was then that the whole process repeated over again, this time with the help of the slaves. All Fenra needed to do was sit there with her maw agape, and the food just kept on coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of binging, Fenra was finally full once again, even more so than last time. It was at this moment that she heartily thanked everyone in the lounge and took her leave, the now wider and heavier Fenra slightly waddling as her belly swayed alongside her thickened limbs. As the labyrinthine hallways pointed her in the right direction back to her new lair, she was startled to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were three of them: two warriors and a ranger, and they were haplessly wandering around the keep's dungeon. Luckily, they were also headed in the direction of her new abode. As they rounded the corner far, far ahead of her, she quickly hastened her pace and took a more direct route so that she might beat them to her lair. Of course, she didn't want to deny them a door to the treasure room, or the encounter with the dragoness that guarded it. She sprinted, following the enchanted signs that guided her along her course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite surprising to Fenra that she experienced no extra fatigue or required any more effort to move with her new, somewhat weightier frame. Immediately she remembered: none of her new weight would hinder her in any way, as long as magic is not directly involved. With that in mind, she thundered down the hallway. As she ran, it was obvious to her, despite her compensated strength, that she had put on quite a few pounds back in the monster lounge. She could feel her heavy tail crash into the wall behind her as she rounded the next corner with her extra momentum, her claws screeching the cobblestone floor as she tried to maintain traction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I keep getting bigger, I'll have to be a bit more careful.\" Fenra noted to herself, as she eyed the dent she had put in the hard stone behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly still weighed down from the meal earlier, she nearly tripped over herself multiple times before finally making it back to her lair. Sure enough, once she arrived back at the entrance of her special room, the blank wall began to shimmer and the enchanted door leading to the riches behind once again reappeared. She opened the heavy metal door with ease, and, before stepping inside, she unleashed a loud roar that bounced and echoed across the many corridors around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're real adventurers, they won't be able to resist a dragon's horde.\" Thought Fenra with a smirk as she trudged inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe splayed herself out on her mound of treasure, trying to get some well-needed rest after her recent gorging, hoping that her outburst would lure them to her. She delighted at another opportunity to become larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for over an hour, she couldn't stay awake any longer as she digested her meal. It was at least another hour after that that she finally woke, hearing her would-be attackers clamoring at her reinforced door. Getting up, Fenra noticed that much of her belly was was gone, and in place another layer of fat had spread its self throughout her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That potion must last longer than I thought.\" She pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell they were having some trouble opening the door considering its immense weight, so she took this opportunity to ready herself. Then, slowly, the door opened halfway before she saw the party setup formation in front of her, warriors in front, with the ranger in tow. It was then obvious why it had taken them so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there.\" \"I see you three were no match for the traps laid before you.\" She snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra inspected the three adventurers with a toothy grin, they had clearly fallen victim to numerous traps set in place by the Lipomancer. The two warriors, male, had apparently been forced to ditch the armor she had seem them wearing earlier. Their bellies alone sagged to their knees, and the clothes they were still wearing were mostly shredded and at this point-- didn't cover much. It was surprise they were still able to get to her. Still though, they were apparently strong enough to manage despite the fact they must have weighed nearly 500 lbs. The Elven ranger had fared a bit better than her two counterparts by comparison. At around 300 lbs. she must have been top heavy from the get-go, because her breasts (resting on her now large, flabby belly) now reached almost all down to her waist, and stuck out as far as her mammoth ass. In fact, she had been forced to move her quiver to her side, being too fat to reach over her shoulder without difficulty. Fenra kept back a few deep chuckles as she saw the elf's now ruined outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo them, Fenra did not look very imposing, they knew that she, at almost 11 feet long and only 7 feet tall was despite her size, small for a dragon. However, it made them wonder as to how she was able to gain so much weight despite her small frame. <i>She must be pretty good at what she does</i>, they thought, almost in tandom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they glared at each other for almost a minute. Fenra knew they weren't in the talking mood. \"I know why you three have come, no need to bore me with the details.\" She said, as she walked off her mountainous pile of treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes then narrowed to sharp slits as she prepared to make the first move.<br>\r\nFenra decided that, this time, she would fatten her victims up by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It groaned loud enough to be easily audible to the three adventurers in front of her, warranting a few steps back from her and her intimidating appetite. Given the nature of the dungeon up to this point they surely must at least have an idea of how their encounter with her would play out. Fenra glared at them, and then took a deep breath. As the two warriors raised their shields, which were now hilariously small compared to their now enormous bodies, Fenra exhaled, letting out a short monologue: \"I'm sure fire was the first thing you fools expected, however, I have a different plan for you all.\" The Elven Archer snapped back immediately, \"Do your worst, dragon!\". Happy to oblige, Fenra closed her eyes and muttered a few unrecognizable phrases- as she spoke, the air began to swirl with magical energy, converging in the center where it materialized into an enormous banquet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intruders looked at Fenra with a confused look, and then at each other, and then Fenra once again. With a smirk on her face, Fenra waved at them with her paw as if to, \"hop to it\". Fenra then curled herself up on her horde and then drifted off into a nap, seeing the magic of the feast draw in her attackers out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up after just a short while, Fenra craned her thick neck groggily over her shoulder, looking at what she had wrought. The three adventurers were all blimped to the point of nigh immobility, each sharing a look of grimace and despair as they yet still stuffed their faces as fast as their bloated limbs could handle. Muttering a few more inaudible sounds, Fenra suspended the enchantment binding her captives, eager to hear of their choice of whether or not they will serve the Lipomancer. As she trudged over to her prey, a twinge of sadism clicked in her head for just a moment, making her hatch a rather diabolical ultimatum with her response. Standing over them, she boomed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you three enjoyed your meal, because it could very well be your last. As powerful as I am I do have a master that I serve eagerly, and now all of your have the opportunity to as well. Here is my ultimatum: you all will be humble slaves preserved in your current forms to serve the various residents of this place, or... perish. There is one catch though, I will only accept one answer from all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two warrior-knights looked at each other with hardened expressions on their faces, and then at Fenra with bitter anger. They vehemently denied any want to ever exist in their current forms accompanied by harsh curses and nasty swears. Meanwhile the ranger alongside them, apparently a bit more comfortable in her current obese state than the two beside her, shook her head and waved her hands, seemingly willing to serve fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra looked at her with a smile and spoke, \"It seems your friends have you beat here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one motion, she lunged her whole body in their direction, snapping up the first knight as the banquest table fizzled out of existence to her touch. She swallowed him whole, all 700lbs of him- the lump of his body visible in her fat neck as her powerful muscles worked him down to her gut. Before the first victim had completely made it down the length of her throat she had already begun eating the smaller, but still huge elf. Then finally, as the first two of her compatriots settled down into a bulge in her stomach, she devoured the last knight, protesting all the way down as he too joined the wriggling ball nestled between her chubby thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering back over to her horde pile, she plopped herself down on the castle's treasure as she squished a paw into her belly, feeling both the squishy fat and the tautness of her stomach. Happy about how well that battle had gone to her particular favor, she began to daydream about just how big she would become. She would gain the title of the largest creature to inhabit the Lipomancer's domain and would become his personal favourite, being the guardian of his riches, gaining preferential treatment above her cohorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she concentrated on her thoughts her body began to expand outward as the power of her mind facilitated in the fulfullment of her wish. Her round taut gut began to shrink as she expanded both outwards and upwards, her body filling out a little more as her limbs begin to thicken somewhat. Her flanks widened as well and her tail even stretched out a little bit, gaining thickness and even a bit of length as well, attributing to a more \"wyvern-like\" appearance. She opened her eyes and marveled at what had just happened, and just as she did the Lipomancer entered through her side door entrance. \"What an excellent display- and my have you grown! I watched the whole thing from my scrying stone in my chambers.\" I urge you to keep up the good work, As I'm sure you've just learned your powers get a little stronger as you continue to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do enjoy this power, it's nice to be the one in control of things for once. Thank you master.\" Fenra replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe marveled at the now 14x8x5 Fenra, now beginning to take on a more formidable stature. Before he got too distracted by her now imposing figure he quickly said, \"As well as you are doing, I do urge you to occasionally let-go the lone-travelers, but of course not without first having your fun with them. if all those who entered here got either eaten or turned over to servitude, no-one would ever know about this place- just a little something to keep in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he turned and left, waving his hand over his cloaked head as he left through the side-passage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went on for awhile, and \"customers\" were plentiful as Fenra heeded the Lipomancer's advice, always letting the few lone-travelers that had the misfortune of finding her chamber go. She had become massive over the previous...</span></div></div>",

Her huge gut jiggling ever so slightly as she as her long plump tail to rub circles over her bloated stomach as she worked her soft billowy flesh.Slight moans of pleasure escaped her lips as the pressure in-which she worked her tail intensified, life was good, as she worked her bulging belly for a while longer working any trapped air within her to be expelled it was inevitable that eventually she would....     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"BURP!!...ahh, that felt good\" A devilish grin soon donned across her face at the memory of all those who fell before her adding to her mighty form, And mighty form it was, the last five months of living in the lipomancer's kingdom had truly done wonders for her no longer the runt people laughed or treated like filth at no her physical form had changed quit dramatically in the past few months no longer the diminutive 10 foot runt Fenra was now a 37 foot long 25 foot tall and 18 foot wide force of fattening terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like she vowed Fenra had become almost obsessed with her size and finding new and fun ways to reach her goal of becoming the largest thing in her masters, the Lipomancers, kingdom not just here in his castle no no no  Fenra wanted to be the largest creature under his command.Ah yes she could see it now; the ground shaking beneath her feet her great weight causing the very earth to yield and bow her mighty size, mountains turning black as the shadow of belly wobbled over them, the puny villagers screaming as her great form came in to view <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH!! LOOK OUT, HERE COMES FENRA THE DEVOURER,THE MIGHTY DRAGONESS TITAN\" Titans where massive beings of immense power, in some cases titans where even known to challenge the gods them selves for dominance over their province a thought that brought smile to her face . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh that sounds good, Titan, yeah Fenra the titan dragoness ooohh i can't wait\" Fenra squealed in excitement as she imagined her future, her body jiggling in excitement along with her. Fenra was so engrossed within her daydream of things to come she didn't even notice the large figure that approached her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well looks like someone couldn't wait for me to be done with my rounds\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra gave a slight start as she was brought out of her daydream back to the real world,a low growl escaped her as she eyed the room looking for the one who dared interrupt her alone time, Fenra was made to chuckle as her eyes fell on the source of the interruption \"Silene\" <br>\r\nSilene smiled as she observed the obese dragoness. Over the few months Fenra had been at the castle she and Silene had become quite close friends spending a lot of their free time together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aw don't tell me you forgot we where supposed to hang out down at the ML after my rounds were complete\" The obese Minotaur looked around Fenra's den she noted all the empty food trays surrounding the chilled out dragon, \"<i>she really is making the most out of this</i>\"Silene thought as she couldn't help but marvel at Fenra's growth remembering back to the diminutive dragon that she met only a few months ago. In all her years under the Lipomancers service never had she met a fellow monster that had such a gift for growth, it brought a smile to face as she wondered just how big Fenra could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra looked at Silene with a sheepish grin \"of course not!, I..er...was just having a light snack to keep me going before you showed up and we headed down to the lounge for dinner\" with a slight grunt, being weighed down with hundreds of pounds of still digesting food made made moving quite the chore, but still Fenra pushed her self up of to her feet and slowly walked towards Silene chuckling to herself as her bloated belly touched the floor ever so slightly tickling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"so everything interesting happen on your rounds?\" Fenra asked As she made her way out the door with Silene by her side, the door dispersing as they made there way towards the Monster's lounge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really, though there was this one elf mage, somehow she managed to avoid all the masters traps thin as a rake she was\"<br>\r\nFenra couldn't help but be surprised by this \"but that's impossible,how she mange it\" ,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"nah its not impossible, especially when you trick your companions to take the lead\" Silene had to stifle a giggle as she thought back on the head strong elf. Fenra couldn't help but give her a curious look as Silene continued \"can you believe she spent the whole battle dodging my attacks\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how she manage that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"same way she avoided the traps, by sacrificing her friends, oh you should have seen the look on the face this antro-wolf girl when the elf used her magic to pull the obese wolf towards her and use her body as a shield, by the end of the battle the poor thing must have weighed something like 3000lbs\" both Fenra and Silene burst in to laughter at the poor girls predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra wiped a tear from her eye \" so what happened next\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well the wolf-girl got so feed up, ha feed up, of the elf using her that she eat her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? your kidding\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no she really eat her, not sure how she managed to get hold of her but she did, manged to swallow her whole boots and all\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow that's impressive guess she got tired of being used and decided to get revenge the only why she could, so what happened to the little wolf\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"who can say, as to where she is\" Silene gave Fenra a wicked smile \"lets just say she's closer than you might think\"  with that she gave her huge gut a quick slap sending it in to a cascade of jiggling wonder. both Fenra and Silene bust in to a fit of laughter as they made it to the Monsters lounge.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nby the time they got to there seat both Fenra and Silene's laughter had died down to a steady chuckle. Once seated Fenra took the chance to look around the room at her fellow monsters and with all the mass that she had accumulated she couldn't but feel like she was normal a feeling that she always wanted when she was small, scared and alone but here she was, no longer alone she great friends like Silene and dear she say the Lipomancer, she was the size of a normal dragon albeit a lot fatter but Fenra didn't want to be normal anymore she wanted to be bigger,special, unique.....a Titan      <br>\r\n <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

And hey she was in the best place you could possibly be to achieve that goal she was surrounded by an endless amount of food readily available twenty four-seven, an enchantment placed upon her were if she is to slay a foe she grows in height and power, the bigger the victory the larger she grew, at least that's what she hopped she hadn't actually had chance to ask her master if this was the case or had the opportunity to truly test it, she quickly made a mental note to find out soon. but all this was thoughts for another day right now she was at Monsters Lounge surrounded by people she could call her friends and she was going to enjoy it, and maybe be able to kill two birds with one stone. Fenra looked over to see what the rotoned minotaur was up to what she saw brought a chuckle from Fenra. Silene was busy having fun with one of the many obese slaves that worked within the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilene was indeed busy amusing herself with one of the slaves that happened to be working their shift and had gotten a little to close. Alice couldn't believe how her life had come to this humiliating, she was a warrior, a barbarian born of the savage lands, a savage breed to kill, her name spoken in hushed  whispers less you bring her wrath, she was...she was...fat, how could have this have happened first she lost her mighty physique turned in to this a wheezing pile of flab reduced to serving these vile creatures as they stuffed their fat faces with food while they make her life a living hell. As if to prove Alice words right she felt a sharp pain across her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think your doing!?\" the roar of Silene voice was enough for Alice to forget the pain she now felt or the giant red hand print that now decorated her pale flesh and was replaced by fear and hatred as she looked up to meet the massive minotaur in the eye. <br>\r\n\"i..i'm s...sorry..i..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilene waved her hand in annoyance \"Enough! i don't care for excuses\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice could feel her heart pounding in her chest she had seen first hand what happens when you displease these glutenous beasts and Alice couldn't afford to gain any more weight, it was getting hard just too get out of bed in the mourning, she shuddered at the thought of being immobile, useless, and being useless was something that no slave wished to be, if there captors saw them as useless, actually Alice didn't know what happened in that situation all she knew was they where never seen again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"y..yes m'lady o..of course i'm sorry\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilene just gave a disgusted grunt in response \"just shut up and massage my belly while i relax with my friend here\" Silene gestured towards Fenra who just seemed to be watching the two of them with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n \"oh,and put some real effort in to it, because if i find this massage lacking, well lets just say your looking quite...delicious\" Alice just nodded nervously as Silene lay back in her chair making herself more comfortable the small action caused her belly to be pushed out even more than it already was,spreading her legs apart allowing more of her huge gut to breath and receive some much deserved attention. Alice let out a heavy sigh as the huge Minotaur's belly filled her vision Alice placed her hands upon the soft jiggling mass and began to rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilene smiled as she turned away from Alice and towards Fenra who was busy rubbing her own belly looking directly at the kitchen and all the food within being prepared for her fellow monsters with hunger in her eyes the small feast she had moments ago completely forgotten. Silene knew the look in Fenra's eyes well its a look that she saw quite a lot from Fenra these past few months a look that seemed to grow more intense everyday. <br>\r\n\"so let me guess you want order some food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra was cheeks went warm with embarrassment before a smile spread across her face<br>\r\n\"what gave me away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilene smiled \"oh i don't know, it could be that your stomach hasn't stopped growling since we sat down, it could be the way your looking at all the food in the kitchen,or it could be that were such good friends that i know what you need\"  Silene response made Fenra chuckle \"maybe its all three\" both girls where made to full out laugh, which seemed to last a good couple of minutes but eventually the laughter died down and Fenra had called over a near by slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera was more than happy to take the Dragons order \"Yes Fenra how can i be of service\" <br>\r\nto say Fenra was surprised that this slave knew who she was or seemed to be happy to meet her. \"y.you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"of course i do Fenra, why wouldn't i now your name? i mean your so big and powerful and so eloquent the way your scales dance as they shine in the light..beautiful\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra blushed as she listened to the compliments given to her by the young cat-girl, she had come along way in the past few months, but to hear such compliments so freely given was new to her and it was gladly accepted. \"thank you!\" Fenra blushed a little as she didn't mean to but that much excitement in her voice  \"..er...*cough*.. i'm sorry i um don't know your name\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera just smiled showing of her white razor sharp teeth and extending her arm for Fenra to shake  \"oh no its quite all right the names Veraira mjhyim but you can just call me Vera,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra smiled taking Vera's hand \"well its nice to meet you Vera\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no the pleasures all mine, let me just go to the kitchen and place your order\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra looked confused \"but we haven't placed our order\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh don't worry i know what a girl like you wants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nraising an eyebrow Fenra lay back in her chair \"and what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera had began to walk back to the kitchen to place her order but stopped to look over her shoulder towards Fenra \"you know 4 of everything or as i like to call it '<i>The Fenra</i>'.\" with that Vera continued on her way back to the kitchen leaving a stunted Fenra behind. Fenra turned to Silene who chose to remain quite as the exchange between Fenra and Vera was going on instead she chose to enjoy her belly massage. <br>\r\n\" well that certainly was interesting, do you have any idea what that was about \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilene shrugged her shoulders \"you've got a fan\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"i.i have a Fan?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"looks like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how can that be i mean we enslaved them, fattened them to near immobility \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it happens though it is rare that one of us actually gets a fan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you mean there are other monsters here who have fans?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah there's about 5 that i can think of well yours makes 6\" Silene couldn't help but chuckle\" i have to say i'm kind of jealous I've been here for a few years and i don't have a fan your here a few months and you already have one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra's eyes opened wide with shock as she listened to Silene before a wide smile took its place on her face \"don't worry Silene maybe one day you can be as eloquent as i am and get a fan of your very own\"  <br>\r\nSilene and Fenra burst out in to laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thjorn had been working as a slave within the castle for many years now and had grown quite complacent with his life of servitude, adventuring was but a found memory to him now .Thjorn my have come to terms with being a slave and even being fat but that's not to say that his mind wasn't as sharp as it ever was, by being observant, working hard, mixing in with the right crowds and being in the right place at the right time he had manged to gain the favor of quite a few monsters within the castle, he even manged to catch the eye of one of the larger monsters in the castle, a large female naga named Arisa. He had been there when the Lipomancer first brought her in and he saw the potential in the small naga and a way to use that potential for his own benefit.It took him years of constant work on his part to become friendly with Arisa, she was not one to trust easily, but he did it managed to become her personal slave, or as it was most commonly referred to as becoming a follower, and enjoyed all the benefits that such a title brings. In fact Thjorn was the first slave to actually become a fan or 'follower' of one of the monsters in the castles history a fact that was not lost on Thjorn neither was it lost on his fellow slaves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news of an actual fan of one of the monsters was a surprise to everyone in the castle. Even the Lipomancer himself was surprised by the news, but that's not to say he was displeased with the news on the contrary he was quite pleased and believed that Arisa was a wonderful example of his power and influence and deserved someone to worship her for the beautiful creature she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Thjorn could see even more potential in the young dragoness Fenra, but-alas he could do nothing, if he did he risked losing Arisa and all the years he had spent wining her trust, in truth Thjorn had grown quite fond of Arisa and the time he spent with her. Even though Thjorn could admire Fenra he was not willing to become a 'fan' of Fenra, so it peaked his interest when he witnessed the exchange between Fenra and Vera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vera was grinning from ear to ear as she walked to the kitchen to place Fenra's order,she had never seen a dragon before and was giddy with excitement. Dragons were one of species that she had always wanted to see ever since she was a young cub reading about them in her free time dreaming of one day leaving her tiny village and seeing what the world had to offer. Mesmerized by there size and power Vera had made it her mission to at least see a dragon before her life meet its end, a mission and a dream she thought lost when she and her team where captured by what appeared to be an obese harpy. For weeks Vera had been in a state of depression her dream gone to the winds just like her once svelte physique. All that changed while working the lounge floor, that's when she saw her, a dragon, and a beautiful one at that, it had taken her freedom but finally she had meet a dragon. \"<i>totally worth it</i>\" Vera thought to herself as she approached the head chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hey fire up the stoves i got a big order coming in. I got a hungry girl out there\" Vera gestured to the table behind her where Fenra was sat talking to Silene \"need you to cook up 4 of everything you got\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what!? you cant be serious?\" to say the chef was surprised was an under statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh but i am. 4 of everything!\" Vera couldn't help the grin that was on her face as she placed the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe chef couldn't help but groan \"god dammit these disgusting gluttonous beasts will be the death of me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera found herself actually annoyed by what he had just said about Fenra. It surprised her how much it actually bothered her. \"look your poor attitude isn't helping anyone so how about you just shut up and make my order\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"what how dare you speak to me like that. sticking up for those..those things\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"those 'things' happen to be amazing diverse creatures full of life...and power\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>what the, was this cat crazy or something why is she sticking up for their captors.</i> \"look here you stupi....\" before he could finish his sentence he felt a hand take hold of his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"easy now chef, just go and fill the order\". Thjorn had been content to watch and see how things played out between Vera and the chef  but it was clear to him that he needed to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh of course you would come to her rescue, hmph, the monster sympathizer, you two disgust me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you need to cool it. right now\" Thjorn's voice was calm but cold carrying with it a chill that made the chef's face go pale \"turn around and get the young lady's order\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just stared in to Thjorns eyes before giving one finale grunt in defeat and headed to the back to begin preparing the order.  Vera just looked down at Thjorn \" hmph, that guy didn't know how close he was to getting a claw to the face\" Vera smiled \"thanks for the help er..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThjorn smiled and shook Vera's hand \"Thjorn\"  this was the first time that he had truly had a chance to look at Vera. She was a tall white Anthro-cat, probably from the south-sands judging by her accent, she had what appeared to be faint grey strips running up and down the length of her body,her eyes a vivid sharp ice blue. But what truly stood out about her was her weight or lack there of, she was by no means thin but she wasn't a beacon of obesity like most slaves where, if anything she was verging on the heavy side of chubby which for a slave of the Lipomancer meant that she was either a very good slave never bringing on the wrath of the monsters or she knew how to keep a low profile but judging from the argument she just had Thjorn knew which one was most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"nice to meet you Thjorn i'm Vera\" Vera continued to look down at Thjorn for a few seconds before speaking again \" so why'd you help me? i know my views on our 'captors' aren't winning me any friends down here\"  Vera's voice had a suspicious tone to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThjorn smiled \"ah but its because of your views that i chose to help you, you see i share those views and there a few others around here who share the same views\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well that would explain why he called you a monster sympathizer\" Vera chuckled \"so you here to recruit me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ha, no nothing like that i'm just letting you know that there are others like you here and that there are people you can talk to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera was relieved to hear that she wasn't alone in her views and to have finally made a friend. \"so you like dragons to\" Vera beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"dragons what oh, no no you misunderstand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera's smile faded a little upon hearing Thjorn \"what do you mean? i thought you said you were like me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i am, we are. but my interest isn't in dragons like yours, but i can see way you like them Fenra certainly is something,but i find myself leaning more towards giant magical multi-armed snake women\" Thjorn smiled as he thought about Arisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh you mean a naga, hmm iv'e never seen one before, ooooh this place is so exciting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hm well maybe i can get her to meet you and Fenra one day\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"really you think s...hey what do you mean me and Fenra?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThjorn found the confused look on Vera's face quite amusing. \" your a fan of Fenra's its not had to see especially the way i saw you gush over her a few minutes ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera's cheeks grew warm as she blushed though it was hidden from Thjorn's view due to her fur coat \"oh y.you saw that, well it was the first time iv'e ever seen a dragon that wasn't in a scroll or a book and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThjorn waved his hand interrupting Vera \"its all right, in fact its a good thing your so enamored with her it means you can work towards becoming her follower\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"her follower. is that some kind of cult you got going?\" Vera was taking on a cautious pose the conversation was starting to make her wary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh no nothing like that, hmm, well maybe a little\" Thjorn wasn't surprised by Vera's reaction. \" but its not as bad as the name sounds, really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh, whats it like then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i think its best to tell what a follower actually dose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that might be best\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well to become a follower of a certain monster is like becoming their squire or personal slave, now that doesn't mean you don't have to work in the lounge or wherever your told to work but it dose make the work you do get a lot easier,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera's ears twitched as her interest was peaked \"go on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"its your job to take care of their every need things like: rubbing their belly, gathering there food, feeding them, making sure they grow in power and size. whatever they need you take care of\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera smiled as she listened to Thjorn, she liked the idea of tending to a creature as majestic as Fenra making grow in size and power,she smiled as she looked back out in to the lounge towards Fenra \"you know i might just join your little cult after all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   \"This scaffolding is hideous- it breaks the whole atmosphere\", thought Fenra as she surveyed her lair. Renovations were currently underway on the castle dungeon as the Lipomancer had to deal with Fenra's rapidly expanding form. With Vera's help pulling additional strings, Fenra had been getting nearly twice the extra portions at the monster lounge over the past few months- this had put Fenra at an imposing 30 feet tall, 50 feet long, and almost 25 feet wide.<br>\r\n\"I miss the lounge..\", sighed Fenra as she waited for her next meal. <br>\r\nFor the past week, Fenra had been confined to her lair after several mishaps during her lounge trips. There was an instance a couple weeks ago: returning to her lair, she \"found\" a structural flaw in the dungeon when her foot went through the floor after returning from one of her gorging sessions- nearly crushing Silene and the adventurers occupying the level below. She caught them mid-battle as her rather large hindpaw dangled 10 feet above them. There was also last weekend where Fenra had gotten her rear stuck at one of the lounge entrances and nearly took down half of the subterranean structure once she wrenched herself free. Indeed, her horde even appeared smaller as a result- her now massive self slowly compressing her mattress of treasure. After all, Fenra had little reason to get up from it at all during the past week, as she eventually found out that taking up most of her chamber made it quite easy to prey upon her victims.<br>\r\n   Suddenly, Fenra's trance of boredom was broken as her chamber door creaked open- it was Vera. Neither of them said a word, Vera simply approached Fenra, taking in the distinct vibrations that verified Fenra's ravenous hunger. Walking up to her, Vera looked up to meet Fenra's gaze, and then embraced what she could of Fenra's expansive stomach.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know you're hungry, It'll be here soon\", spoke Vera.<br>\r\nFenra flicked her tail in response; She loved having a follower to help her on her quest for size- it made her feel truly dominant- completely opposite of her timid, puny self before her transformation.<br>\r\nAfter another moment of silence, Vera interrupted, \"there's going to be something special about this next meal, Fenra\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"The Lipomancer really needs to finish these renovations, he believes it unprofessional to leave the castle in such a state for so long, and he says you stomping around half the day playing with adventurers is placing setbacks on the schedule\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"Well I'm not going anywhere, I'm too big or too heavy for any other place in the castle- and what does this have to do with my dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-\"That's the thing, actually- you aren't going anywhere. This next meal is going to put you in an accelerated hibernative state while the masons finish up their job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra was intrigued, she was definitely looking forward to a little more freedom to be big. \"What do you mean by accelerated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera smiled, \"That's where I convinced him to use the good stuff, anything you eat during this meal will stick to you like glue, all you need to do is eat up and enjoy your nap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra's demeanor perked up, \"Exciting, I think that's a fair compromise, I-\" cut off by the sound of the mechanisms opening her chamber door, an enourmous feast had revealed its self before Fenra. Arranged in front of her, it was several times the size of her already enlargened portions at the lounge. The drool was already spilling out of Fenra's mouth as she dug in without abandon- revelling as her body became engorged with the hexed food.<br>\r\nPassing out right on the remnants of the banquet feast, for the next five days the castle masons toiled alongside the bloated dragoness. The sounds of their hammers and chisels being met with churning of Fenra's stomach as the tampered food aided her digestion. Her limbs became thicker, her haunches wider- the workers gawked as they had to give her wider berths each day to continue their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five days eventually came to pass, and Fenra arose as fast as her massive body would let her, eager to inspect herself after her \"little\" nap, only to find...</span></div></div>",

If they weren't stuffing their idols with tons of food they were luring unlucky adventurers to their doom or massaging their respective idol's stomach. In turn Ferna had gained roughly 300 more pounds and grew a few inches taller. She even got to know Arisa due to the collaboration of her fan and Arisa's fan. Everything was going smoothly until he showed up. It was just out of the blue that a new monster showed up with his posy of admirers and started devouring any stupid towns person who even dared step near the Lipomancer's castle when he was patrolling. Rumor has it that he even rivals Ferna in size. Now Ferna wasn't taking all of this too lightly. She had even tried to double her efforts to meet or surpass her daily quota.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vera, can you fetch me my favorite treasure? I need to see if it had managed to lure in any more intruders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish Ferna.\" Vera said in an optimistic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerna drummed her claws patiently waiting for her number one fan to return.

If I may allow me to retrieve it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll handle this myself. I want to know who this new monster is. I'll put that egotistic jerk in his place.\" Ferna said as fumes escaped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? No one knows what species this guy is or even his name. For all we know this could be a prank.\" Vera said with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Vera wasn't wrong for many monsters were known to one up each other, even if it meant sabotage. One would think the Lipomancer would be against this, but in reality he would often be found laughing seeing this as a form of entertainment. The other thing is that another monster stole another's property it could only mean one of two things. One a challenge or two an excuse for a quick romance if the other monster was of the opposite sex but close to the other species. Yet somehow Ferna had a hunch that this new guy was probably a dragon of some kind and dragons tend to do whatever they wish to ensure that they get the attention of a potential mate even if it is something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have an idea on what species he is. This is probably some stunt to help boost his ego by claiming that he caught the eye of one of the best female monsters.\" Ferna said as she snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your plan Ferna?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fenra opened her mouth and unleashed her fattening fire breath. All three adventurers screamed when they saw the molten torrent heading straight for them. As fat as they were, none of them had a chance of dodging the assault. The blast hit all three adventurers full on, and Fenra watched with satisfaction as the trio quickly got fatter and fatter. Fenra ceased the molten stream, and let out a roar of triumph as she grew a whole foot in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra looked down at the obese adventurers in front of her. The two knights now weighed about 850lbs each. Their swords lay uselessly on the ground. The female archer now weighed around 750lbs. Her leather armor had also burst, along with her other garments, although she was too stunned to care about her increased nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three have been utterly defeated,\" Fenra gloated. \"Your only hope lies in swearing allegiance to the master of this castle, the Lipomancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would rather die than serve whatever twisted being rules this place,\" shouted the knights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier done than said,\" growled Fenra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the archer mouthed something that looked like\"you morons,\" Fenra's tail lashed out smashing into both of the knights, breaking their necks, and propelling them into Fenra's waiting maw. Fenra quickly devoured both of them, savoring her first taste of sentient flesh. The knights would soon further her own weight gain by a large quantity. Fenra then turned to the archer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which do you choose, death or servitude?\" asked Fenra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe archer didn't answer, and instead fell back onto her large rump and began to grope at her new breasts. Fenra took this as a sign of submission. Fenra cast a spell to teleport the woman to the golem in charge of the slaves. Fenra then rose to her feet, and walked towards the lounge, ready to further gorge herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the spells that prevented her fat from hindering her, Fenra still had trouble getting to the lounge. Gulping down 1700lbs of fat when she had only just eaten her first meal of over 100lbs that same day was proving to be a very bad choice. Every step made her feel queasy, and she barely made it into the lounge without spewing her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potion, now,\" gasped Fenra as she collapsed onto one of the largest sofas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A very fat, blue-skinned lamia rushed to her side and tipped one of the quick digestion potions into her mouth. Fenra moaned in relief as the horrible bloated feeling in her stomach was replaced by a pleasantly full sensation. She watched happily as her body swelled with the flab from the knights bodies. Small rolls appeared on her torso, and her rump doubled its already large size, the massive cheecks spreading out to fill the whole sofa. Her belly shrunk a little, but was now a lovely orb of soft fat, instead of a taut boulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Fenra felt a curious sensation in her chest. She looked down at it and saw that large bulges were forming under the scales. The bulges kept swelling with fat, and it became obvious what they were. Fenra was growing breasts from her excessive stores of fat. Soon they had reached what appeared to be H-cup size, and large perky nipples had appeared on them. Strangely, there were no other changes to Fenra's anatomy, suggesting that she wasn't becoming an anthro dragon. Fenra didn't really care how it had happened, she liked her new acquisitions, as they seemed to be the most alluring part of the female humanoid. The lamia next to her poked Fenra's new breasts, causing a small burst of sexual pleasure. Fenra poked the lamia right back, sending the snake girl's own massive chest jiggling. This elicited a loud moan from the lamia, who started jiggling her beach ball sized tummy, and shaking her wide tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well played Fenra,\" said the lamia, \"very well played.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you?\" asked Fenra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've forgotten my manners,\" replied the lamia, \"my name is Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice coiled up onto a chair next to Fenra's sofa. She then told Fenra of how she met the Lipomancer after losing a battle for the kingdom that had been stolen from her. He had taken her to the castle, and she had lived there ever since, ballooning up as her love of food, especially gourmet food, was indulged without restriction. She was a higher level obstacle in the dungeons nearby Fenra's own lair. Not many adventurers could escape her, and with her own arsenal of fattening spells, she would incapacitate  her victims, and if they didn't surrender, she could have her way with them, and then devour or strangle them depending on how much trouble they had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alice ordered some slaves to bring them food, Fenra looked her over. Alice was decidedly top heavy, with breasts exceeding K-cup size, and a large belly, and a chubby rump that turned into a wide, fat filled tail. She was quite attractive, which was good for her since she apparently enjoyed sex to a high degree. Her face was pretty, even with the triple chin and large cheeks caused by her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra was torn away from her assessment of Alice by the arrival of food. Both dragon and lamia were soon glutting themselves on fattening delights. They didn't even bother to taste the food, as they were singularly interested in gaining, and the extra power it would bring. Half an hour later, the pair finished, and wiped the food residues from their faces. Using a spell this time, they digested the food and marveled at the new fat settling in their bodies. Both had gained about 100lbs. The gain was barely noticeable on Fenra, but showed well on Alice. She had gotten bigger all over, going to L-cup breasts, and her belly stuck out about an inch more. Her tail had also thickened a little bit, and was making a deeper impression on her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra wanted to stay and talk more, but she felt she should get back to her lair soon. She left the lounge, and once again navigated the maze to the treasure room. When she opened the door and stepped in, she found that...</span></div></div>",

PleaseDon'tSwellMeUpANdPopMe.\"  With that last statement she quickly covered her head with her hands and began to cower, immediately wishing she'd just got the courage to say yes.  Though oddly enough, the Lipomancer took it very well.<br>\r\n\"I see, I was hoping you would say yes but in reality I knew you would very likely say no.  I can understand that\" he said slowly walking around the black and purple dragoness, \"I mean, if I was confronted by someone in control of powerful magic much greater than mine... not that there is, but if I did and he asked me to grant all my wishes,giving me everything I wanted, I would be very cautious too.\"  <br>\r\n\"Really?\" Fenra asked, wiping a few scared tears from her cheeks, her head lifting up partially.<br>\r\n\"Of course, your a very cautious dragon, you had to be to still be alive at your size... though jumping into a group of heavily armed adventurers was a bit of a low point but until then and right now you are cautious.\"  The hooded figure began to sound like a traveling tonic salesman, but even if he sounded like a court jester his ghastly figure prevented her from smiling.  \"I'll prove to you that I am nothing if not am a man of my word,\" he said, tapping his bony finger against Fenra's muzzle, \"Winter is quickly approaching and hunting will be more scarce, and from the looks of your poorly nourished body, this might be your last winter.  So, I will return to this cave when the first bear gluts on the first meal after hibernation in around four months, and offer you to join me once again.  During that time, I will bestow upon you the gifts of fullness and satisfaction, and even if you decline my offer after winter I will still bestow upon you those gifts for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds... nice\" Fenra said slightly confused, \"but what 'are' the gifts of of fullness and satisfaction?\"<br>\r\n\"You will see my dear\" the Lipomancer said with a light cackle, quickly vanishing into the thick woods, the leaves on the trees already starting to change color.<br>\r\nFenra took a quick gulp of air before rushing over to her cave and curling up on her pile of furs in a tight scaled ball as she tried to quickly recover from the panic attack she was accumulating through the horrifying events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor dragon had already gone through a bit of emotional drama as the morning sun rose to greet her tired face.

His mountainous girth was sprawled over a huge horde that was almost engulfed by his fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like my lord was right. You are a tiny dragoness. You're even smaller than I imagined. There's no way I can mate with you at that size.\" The dragon said as he lifted himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get in here and what did you mean by mate?\" Ferna asked as the dragon made his way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just widened the back entrance and raised the ceiling. The reason I said I would have liked to mate with you is simple. Whenever a dragon brings their horde and takes over the opposite gender's dwelling it is usually a proposal to mate. Since the proposal didn't fall through either you need to leave my new home or accept my proposal. Since your too small or may reject my proposal I'll make you a deal. If you stick by me I'll make you into one plump and beautiful dragoness worthy of bearing my children. You see I am a leading commander in His Excellency's army as you can tell by my handsome girth. I am not a cruel dragon and will offer my love and affection, even if you refuse his offer to join him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFerna didn't know how to respond. The dragon could easily eat for dinner if he so chose, but he's offered to mate with her if she gets bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You offer is mighty generous, but what is your name?\" Ferna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name is Ferna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a beautiful name.

He'd blast her away with one good spell, and he'd never let his two companions forget how they had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating, he didn't even hear the musket shot that came from their left. He did, however, feel a small sting on his neck. He clapped his hand to his neck to squish whatever had bitten him, surprised when it came away sticky with blood, no small amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" he tried, only to cough, a great spurt of blood bursting forth from his mouth and neck. The world faded to black, and the wolf slumped over as his lifeblood ran from the holes in his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the elf ranger was back on her feet. Stunned by the loss of the mage, she used her craft to locate the shooter, just over the top of a nearby ridge, struggling to reload his clumsy weapon.

The warrior could handle herself against the pathetic wyrm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra, grateful for the apparently divine intervention, noticed the elf sneaking off.

You aren't going to, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFenra gave him a good, long sniff. Unlike the rabbit back in her cave, this one was a meal fit for her.

She knew that laughter; she had 'programmed' it into her personal retinue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyehehehe! Mistress Malicia! Sir Mortimer! We've returned! Bearing MEAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyihihihi! We are good minions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia sat up, surprised. She hadn't expected results so soon. It either meant that her minions were smarter than she gave them credit for, or that they'd messed up. She decided to gamble on hope, and stuck her head out of the palanquin, only to be sorely disappointed. The skeleton crew had indeed returned with meat; a rabid opossum, twitching and foaming in their bony grasp. The skeletons looked up at their mistress's face, trying to gauge her expression, something they had long ago forgotten how to do properly due to lack of a proper face. Malicia hopped out of the caravan, palming her staff in irritation. They may have mistaken the gesture for gratitude until the skull began to glow with horrible purple fire and she launched an enervating bolt of dark energy at the hapless rodent, reducing it to an ashen husk that disintegrated and scattered in a passing breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Abyss, I don't know why I thought you boneheads were up to this task! You haven't eaten in so long, you've forgotten what's edible! I can only pray the other team doesn't do something dim fall into a lake or off a cliff or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortimer perked up and looked off in the direction the second team had wandered off in, his glowing eyes squinting. \"Actually, Your Balefulness, I believe I can see them coming this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, goody.\" The statement was dripping with sarcasm and preemptive disappointment as her minions scrambled out of the brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyohohohoho! Mistress Malicia! We found a CASTLE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyuhuhuhu! A BIG castle! With a CRYPT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia's face twisted into astonishment. \"What? Really?! Take up the palanquin minions, at once! Bring me to this castle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bonemistress practically leaped into her seat as the skeletons took up their places and took their procession off the beaten path. After a bumpy ride that lasted a half-hour, they came to their destination. Malicia gazed at the sight of the castle, a towering structure of iron-grey stone standing starkly against the clear blue sky. The entrance to the castle was carved to resemble the maw of a ravenous beast, with the drawbridge now across the moat playing the part of a tongue. She climbed out of her conveyance, walked up to the drawbridge, put her hands on her hips, leaned her head back, and let out a loud laugh. \"Ohohohohoho! You've done well, minions! Forget the back-up crypt! Set the palanquin down just inside the wall, and we'll go 'introduce' ourselves to any inhabitants! Ohohohohoho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortimer grinned beneath his helmet. \"Nyahahaha! Yes, Your Vileness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohohohoho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyehehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyihihihi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyohohoho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyuhuhuhu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they made their way onto the castle grounds, unaware of what fate the castle's current tenant already had planned for them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malicia located the cemetery shortly, a field of crosses and statuary with a large grey mausoleum complex in the center. \"Let's go straight to the tomb, that's where they keep all the really good bodies.\" Without any further ado, she blasted the door off its hinges with a gesture of her staff and crept into the crypt with her cackling cohorts. The interior was as black as midnight, forcing her to relegate her staff to use as a mere torch for the moment. The space inside was wide and filled with all manner of skeletons, but the thing that grabbed her attention immediately upon entering was a massive sarcophagus in the center. Malicia scurried over to it for further inspection. The carving on the stone coffin was that of a young, beautiful woman atop a pile of foodstuffs. The look on her face was of contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, JACKPOT. There must be a whole FAMILY in this one. Minions! Get the lead out and get that lid off! I want those bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortimer worked to fulfill the order immediately, his considerable strength pushed to the limit by the weighty stone covering, the skeleton crew putting their non-existent muscles to the test in aiding him. Malicia, meanwhile, kicked a skeleton off of a small bier and sat her dainty rear upon it, filing her nails. This was what minions were for, after all, and she hated physical labor anyway. In her old mausoleum, if there was a task unfit for her unswervingly loyal undead army, it was left to a group of terrified living servants. In her mind, she would have to conserve all of her strength for the actual raising of the corpses. After a few minutes of grunting and strained maniacal laughter, the lid fell to the ground with a mighty crash, the tremor knocking the lazy lapine off of her ass and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be more careful, you clumsy buffons! I nearly broke a nail there!\" She climbed to her feet and moved over to see just what her minions had unearthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not pleased with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One skeleton? One measly skeleton? Not even a GIANT skeleton? What kind of nonsense is this! Why would someone put one tiny skeleton in such a huge sarcophagus?! It's... It's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was about to get into the real swing of her rant, she was interrupted by a sharp drop in temperature that caused her breath to fog up and her words to freeze in her mouth. From her meddling in the realm of the dead, she knew what the chill presaged; the manifestation of a spectral entity! Bringing it under her control would prove tricky, as she preferred to work with the corporeal dead, but it would be quite the feather in her cap. She turned to address the spirit, and found her tongue stilled in her mouth again. But at least she knew why the coffin was so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost resembled the female depicted on the coffin lid, a young and beautiful human. But whereas the stone representation of the deceased was thin, the actual spook put Malicia in mind of a huge, pale blue balloon. The ghostly figure looked mournfully at the smashed statuary of fruits and meats that adorned her coffin lid, and let out a low moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia had also heard of this, the phenomenon of hungry ghosts... When a particularly greedy, gluttonous, or otherwise materially-obsessed person died, they would carry that obsession over into death, seeking eternally to fulfill it in vain. Typically, they would possess living people to use as proxies, attempting to satiate themselves vicariously to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Malicia was the only living person in the area. The ghost homed in on her immediately, and the necromancer felt herself engulfed in folds of spectral fat before the figure vanished into her body. She could feel the dead thing's maddening hunger taking her over, the invading mind warring with her own for control of her body. And to better facilitate control, the ghost began to alter the morphic field of Malicia's body to better suit her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortimer watched helplessly as his mistress slowly began to bloat up. Malicia's figure burgeoned, stretching her slinky black dress thin, but not yet tearing it. Her flat stomach transformed to a considerable paunch, the divot of her belly button visible in the fabric. Her breasts became larger and fuller, slightly overflowing from their restraining cloth. Her formerly tiny ass grew to resemble a peach the size of a small child, the cleft of her cheeks also visible against the prison of her clothing. In all of the confusion, Malicia put every ounce of strength into regaining full control of her body and mind and expelling the intruding spirit...</span></div></div>",

Through sheer mental willpower, she expelled the ghost from her body. As soon as the ghost was out of her she used her magic to form phantasmal chains around it. The chains were invisible to the naked eye, but Malicia's magic senses aloud her to see them. They were the same kind of chains that she uses on all of her undead minions to bind them to her will. The ghost was now hers to command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will teach you not to mess with the great Malicia.\" She huffed as she started to turn around... and nearly lost her balance because of all the extra weight the ghost had added to her body. That was when Malicia saw what the ghost had done to her beautiful girlish figure during the few seconds that it was in her body. She had been too preoccupied with removing the ghost to notice what it was doing to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my... Gawd!\" Malicia shrieked. She now had a small pot belly, with expanded butt cheeks. Her thighs and calves were a little chunkier and breasts were slightly larger. Her silky black dress used to be loose on her, but now it felt snug. She must have gained about 30 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undo this at once!\" Malicia yelled at the fat ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost looked at her with a look of confusion on its slightly transparent face, \"Foooooooooood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just great! You clearly have no idea how to undo this and you're so dumb that the only word you know how to say is, food! Why are my undead minions always such idiots?!\" Malicia ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww...\" Her skeletal minions sighed sadly at the insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't aware of it, but the intelligence of undead minions depends on the intelligence of the necromancer that controls them. In other words, her minions are idiots because she isn't very smart either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I make this castle into my new lair, I'll just have to go on a diet. I'll have my slim figure back in no time.\" Malicia stated confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, she should start making some more skeleton minions. After a few minutes of work, mostly done by her minions, she had three new skeleton minions under her command. The other nearby skeletons were too damaged for her to reanimate them. The crypt looked quite large though. She might be able to find more usable skeletons if she explored deeper into the crypt.</span></div></div>",

Stop gawking and find a door that leads deeper into this place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeletons went forth to a large set of doors in the back, and after a lot of grunting and cackling, pried the heavy stone portal open, revealing a large spiral staircase covered in cobwebs. \"Alright! All you bony goons form a ring around me! Mortimer, take point! Fatty, you float above me, and... Uh, moan if you see anything I guess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foooooooood,\" came the phantom's forlorn reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghoulish group journeyed deeper into the crypts, Mortimer brushing aside webbing with his sword constantly. \"Nnf. What a horrid mess,\" Malicia grumbled. \"After we take this place over, I'm going to designate like half my minions to janitor duty. Huff...\" The walk seemed to the necromancer that it was taking hours, when it really was taking only minutes. \"Damn this pudge! I wish I'd brought the palanquin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached the next floor. It was no better than the staircase as far as cleanliness went; in fact, it seemed worse. Malicia couldn't even see the end of the room because of the gigantic webs everywhere, accompanied by the odd cocoon, some of them still wriggling. Malicia frowned as a husky voice issued forth from the darkness of the room's upper reaches. \"Oohh... Visitors...? It's been so long... I've been so... HUNGRY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia, sensing danger, ducked behind Mortimer just in time to have him take a strand of webbing to the chest. The black knight just looked down at it and chuckled, raising his sword up high to cut it off. However, just as he was about to bring his sword down upon it, the webbing jerked upwards fiercely, dragging Mortimer's body into the blackness above, his sword clattering onto the ground and his head upturned in its helmet. \"Wretch! Coward! Come down and fight me like a man, woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bloated, female figure lowered itself from the concealing dark, the webbing in her hands making her look resemble a very round puppet. She appeared to be some kind of monstrously fat spider-woman; she had six arms with long, sharp chitinous claws in addition to her legs, and her skin was smooth and pure black. Long white hair cascaded down her back, the same color as her form-fitting silken dress. Her ass was especially pronounced, jutting behind her like a shelf and jiggling with the slightest provocation. Eight blood-red eyes sized up the plump lapine as innumerable smaller spiders scuttled over her flesh. Malicia felt her skin crawl as the spider-woman licked her fanged lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The meat on that one is bad... But you look much tastier... Though a bit scrawny for my like... I'll fix that after I dispose of your entourage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia pinched herself in disbelief to see what the spider-woman was on about, displeased when she found she was as fat as ever. \"You look like a spider, but you must be a pig! Why don't you EAT THIS INSTEAD?\" Malicia whipped her staff forward, lobbing a ball of negative energy at her enemy. The spider-woman hissed and drew herself back up into the darkness, the projectile leaving only a smoldering hole in the web where she was. \"How can something so fat move so quick?!\" The necromancer thought quick about how to fight this jiggling menace.</span></div></div>",

Even the hunger ghost joins the search. They can't see the spider woman in her web high up on the ceiling so they follow Malicia's order and run off to search the other rooms in the crypt. In a matter of seconds, they've all run out of the room through different doorways. Malicia had made her skeletons carry the torches so she didn't have to, but the skeletons took the torches with them. Leaving Malicia alone in the room with the fat spider woman... in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back you idiots!\" Malicia screamed for her minions to return, \"She's in this room on the ceiling somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately her minions were now too far away to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! I thought that was going to have to pick off those pesky skeletons one at a time. Thank you for sending them away. They would have only gotten in the way of the fun I plan to have with you anyway.\" The spider woman chuckled somewhere in the pitch black room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out and face me!\" Malicia shouted, trying to hide her nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you see me? I'm really very close...\" The spider woman said in the darkness as she suddenly groped one of Malicia's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia gasped in surprise and wildly swung her staff in front of her, hoping to hit the spider woman. Something grabbed the other end of the staff and pulled it out of her hands. Now Malicia was really starting to become afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a feisty one. I think I'm really going to enjoy you.\" The spider woman chuckles... right in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt something large and round press up against her back. Judging by it's shape, it must be the spider woman's fat gut pressing against her back. Malicia barely kept herself from screaming as she felt two plump hands lightly, but firmly grip her shoulders. Two of the spider woman's other hands reached around her front and began to fondle her breasts while the last pair of hands began to remove the helpless Lupine's black dress. Malicia struggled and squirmed helplessly in the spider woman's grip as her dress was removed. The spider woman was fat, but she was also deceptively strong. In no time at all her dress had been completely removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you! Unhand me at once! I am the great Necromancer Malicia and I demand that you... MRRF!\" Malicia's words get cut off as the spider woman gags her with a piece of webbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush now.\" The spider woman chides her, \"No one is more powerful than my master, the Lipomancer. It doesn't matter who you are. The only thing that you are now... is my newest toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Malicia felt the spider woman begin to wrap something around her body. She was being wrapped up into a silk spider cocoon, just like normal spiders do to their prey that gets caught in their web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirmed and struggled, but soon she was firmly wrapped up in a cocoon. Her entire body was wrapped up except for her eyes. The spider woman chuckled to herself as she used some webbing to lift the cocoon up to the ceiling. Then she applied some extra webbing and secured the new cocoon to her web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia was starting to panic now as she squirmed helplessly inside of the cocoon. She stops squirming for a moment when she realizes that the spider woman is directly over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for some fun.\" The spider woman chuckles, \"Remember when you said that I look like a spider, but I must be a pig? Well, when I'm done with you, you'll be even fatter than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia eyes bulge out in fear as she renews her hopeless struggling.</span></div></div>",

The spider-woman breathed hotly and bared her fangs, dripping with a dark purple substance, before biting down. The necromancer gasped as the venom was injected into her skin, and a burning pain spread through her being. She could feel her muscles going weak, numbed nearly to uselessness by the toxin. But that wasn't the only thing the potent poison was doing. Malicia could feel her padded frame swelling out even more as Aachne's venom coursed through her veins. \"My lord and master has been very kind to me, to open my eyes up to the beauty of fat, and to grant me my many gifts that I may serve him better. Perhaps I may open your eyes as well... But before we get down to business... Let's have a bit of pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helpless lapine's bloating flesh soon filled her web casing to the point of straining. Small breaks appeared in the cocoon where the necromancer's white-furred blubber oozed out, like cotton from an overstuffed couch. \"Nnngh! It's crushing me! It hurts! It hurtssss!\" Her captor giggled, stroking one of the escaping folds. \"No, dear, I build my webs a bit better than that. If it breaks... It's because it was supposed to.\" In less than a minute, Malicia's fattened form had burst from the cocoon. She looked down and tried to assess the damage done to her figure. She was shocked to see that her weight had ballooned to what looked like a little under double what she weighed when she first came in her. She could hardly see past her plump breasts from her captive position; the cocoon may have burst, the the spider-woman was careful to restrain her anew as soon as the cocoon fell to the floor, globs of webbing on her hands and feet forcing her into an embarrassing spread-eagle position, showing off everything. Malicia felt herself blushing and tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! I love it when they cry after they're too fat to fit in the cocoon anymore, too. Babies, mommy needs her private time. Go see if you can't find another friend for us.\" Arachne looked down at her fat body, and began to disrobe, casting her tent-like raiment to the web. The spiders massed upon her voluptuous flesh soon scattered as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Let me go, dammit! I'm not your plaything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider-woman grinned. \"Mm. You're right. Ultimately, you're the Lipomancer's plaything... But I don't think he'll mind if I borrow you for a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the spider-woman began to move in, one thing on her mind.</span></div></div>",

Malicia was sent to heaven by that kiss, and started to become participant in it. Meanwhile, Arachnea started to massage Malicia's breasts, belly and thighs at the same time.

Instead, she could order her minions to capture the spider woman, then she could use that hypnosis spell that she learned recently and try to brainwash the spider woman into becoming her loyal minion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia thought over her choices for a moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Malicia grinned evilly, her buck teeth only somewhat marring the effect. \"Well, well, Spider-Pig! It looks like you don't get to play Miss Tuffet with with me anymore. Now, submit, and maybe I'll let you live as my mindslave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider-woman drew herself up to her full bulk, and Malicia backed up a bit without thinking. \"Foolish, foolish, foolish! I don't need my web to defeat you! When I capture you, my master will make you too big to even fit in this room!\" Even without her web, she was huge. Taking her alive might be difficult... And she certainly doubted how useful any of her minions might be. Mortimer was the only really useful one, as far as fighting went... She had to think fast, but it was difficult with the spider woman lumbering towards her, and that whistling sound wasn't making it any easier and oh god she was right up to her face and -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the whistling was cut off with a reverberating CLONK, as Mortimer's body fell from the ceiling, impacting with the fat arachnoid's head before toppling to the side, disoriented and feeling for the head that wasn't there. It walked unsteadily towards the helmeted skull, hands probing the ground. Malicia, for her part, was stock still in terror that quickly melted away into arrogant triumph. \"Ohohohoho! Good work, Mortimer!\" She picked up the skull and hugged it to her ample chest, causing the skeletal warrior's sockets to fill with a pink, heart-shaped light. \"M... My pleasure, Your Squishiness! I mean, Wrathfulness!\" She popped the skull onto its rightful body, adjusting it until it was just-so. \"For this, I shall grant you my favor. But first... First! We shall deal with her.\" She gripped her staff tightly and walked over to her enemy, blearily awakening from the unforeseen blow from above. \"So, you thought you could do as you pleased with me? Wretched peon! It is <b>I</b> who shall do as I please with <b>you!</b> I am your new master!\" She thrust her staff into the surprised monster woman's face, the glowing eye sockets of its skull transformed into green spirals. \"Give in! Your mind is putty in my hands! Your will is wilting before my gaze! Your soul will be mine, and you will LOVE IT! Give in, wretch, and take your natural place in the order of things; <b>at my feet, fulfilling my every whim!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia found that she had a natural talent for hypnosis, almost as much as she did for the raising of undead, for although she wasn't the most intelligent of spellcasters, often bratty and reactionary, those very same qualities served to give her a force of will that made her minions, living and undead, absolutely obedient to her, almost as an earthly goddess. However, breaking the arachnoid's mind was still an arduous task, nearly impossible. She suspected that it was not so much because of the spider woman's own strength of will, but rather it seemed there was a force behind her, trying to safeguard her from being swayed by others. Eventually, the presence ceded, but in a way that left Malicia unsure for a moment as to why. It seemed like much to easy a victory in a mental battle that seemed to be at a standstill. Even so, she quickly dismissed the thought, drowning it in a sea of smugness as she dominated her new minion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't have known of the Lipomancer's insidious, subtle intrusion into her mind; a breach that lasted not even for a fraction of a second, but was more than enough time for him to plant a mental seed that took root quickly in the fertile ground of arrogance and vanity of Malicia's mind. Soon after, the arachnoid rose, bowing deeply to Malicia. \"I live to serve, mistress. What do you wish of me?\" Her voice was husky and no less dripping with lust and poison than it was at the beginning of their encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want... A new dress. This one is uncomfortably tight; much to insufficient to contain my beautiful body. And new undergarments as well, mindslave... Mindslave... What's your name?\" The arachnoid bowed as she walked over, taking her measurements, and being generous with them. \"Spinarra, mistress.\" Malicia drew her head back in a haughty smile. \"Mindslave Spinarra, then. And then, I think you shall make me some kind of hammock. I'll have the skeletons carry it, I'm tired of walking. I am a terrifying and imposing figure! I shouldn't have to WALK anywhere! People should carry me, and feel damn lucky to do it! And some pillows, too! I'm a very delicate creature, I can't just not have pillows. That would be absolutely unthinkable. Minions! You help her with whatever she needs! I'm going raising!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did, going amongst the bones of Spinarra's past meals. They were little better than the ones in the crypt above; but at the very least they were more numerous, the leftovers yielding a total of seven skeletons. \"Better! Much better! More than enough minions to carry me around... Now then...\" As she was about to finish her sentence, her stomach gurgled ferociously, the sound of it filling the vaulted crypt. \"...Well... I guess I have to plan my next move...\"</span></div></div>",

The ghost was ravenous and greedy, not only for food, but for a physical body to eat food with. Greed can be a powerful emotion and the ghost's greed was overwhelming her mind. Not only was the ghost's emotion overwhelming her, but it's hunger was literally devouring Malicia's own mental strength. After weakening her, the ghost forced Malicia's consciousness into a far corner of her own mind and locked her away. The ghost was now in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia's minions couldn't see the mental battle so they had no idea what was going on. She had collapsed to her rear on the floor of the crypt when the ghost had entered her body. The skeletons stood around their Mistress aimlessly. Malicia spent most of her time yelling at them, but now she was unusually quite. It wasn't that they weren't grateful for the fact that she wasn't yelling at them, but they couldn't help but wonder what was wrong with their Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was she quiet, but her body was still swelling with fat. Her paunch was now a big fat gut that was at least two feet around and growing larger. There was a loud ripping noise and her black slinky dress fell off of her in tatters, leaving the lapine woman naked. Her breasts sagged with fat as they plumped up and came to rest on top of her huge gut. Malicia's butt swelled beneath her like two balloons slowly filling with water. Her thighs expanded until they started to rub together. Fat began to accumulate around her neck as she grew a double, then a triple chin, until finally it looked like her neck had completely disappeared beneath the fat. Her arms thickened and sagged as she continued to fatten up. When her body finally stopped swelling with fat, she must have weighed around 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Malicia? Is everything all right?\" Mortimer asked. If skulls were capable of showing expressions his would be one of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost that was controlling Malicia's body made her turn her head to look at the skeleton. Then her mouth opened and she said, \"FOOOOOOOD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress! We'll get you some food!\" The skeletons replied as they left the crypt to find some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeletons searched until they stumbled upon the kitchen in the nearby castle. They discovered that it was packed with food. The skeletons started hauling as much food as they could carry back to their Mistress in the crypt. The ghost controling Malicia's body forced her to start eating the food. She started eating like a starving animal. She would barely chew her food before swallowing it down. Soon all the food that the skeletons had brought was gone. Unfortunately the ghost's hunger wasn't physical, it was spiritual, so it was impossible for its hunger to be satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOOOOOD!\" The word came from Malicia mouth once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeletons nodded. It wasn't their place to question their Mistress's odd behavior. All they were supposed to do is obey. Malicia had made that abundantly clear all those times that she had yelled at them. So the skeletons left the crypt again to get more food from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia body had swelled up ridiculous in the two years that she had spent gorging herself. Her body had reached a whopping 800 pounds. She looked more like a fur covered blob than a lapine now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a loud belch as she gulped down the last of the food that the skeletons had brought her in their most recent trip to the kitchen. Oddly enough, the kitchen never seemed to run out of food. It was like something was magically refilling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalicia was just about to moan for more food when a sudden pain went through her chest. She put her hands over her heart as the pain got worse. Two years of constant eating had caught up with her. She was having a heart attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeletons watched helplessly as their Mistress moaned in pain for a few minutes until her body suddenly went limp. The moment that she died, the magic chains that bound her skeleton minions to her will were broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... she's dead.\" One of the skeletons stated as if barely believing that it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's dead! We're free!\" One of the skeletons shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're free! We're free!\" The other skeletons shouted joyfully as the same thing occurred to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can't be forced to do evil things anymore! I want to go hug a puppy!\" One of the skeletons shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" The other skeletons shouted as they all left the dark crypt in search of a puppy to hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the skeletons left, silence filled the crypt once more. The silence lasted for a few minutes until the sound of moaning filled the dusty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOOOOOD.\" A ghostly voice moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOOOOOOOOD.\" A different ghostly voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were now two hunger ghosts haunting the crypt, the original ghost... and Malicia's ghost.</span></div></div>",

Her frame would be average, even desirable on a lady of any other species.  But not on a pig-girl.  A concave stomach, toned thighs, tight buttocks and a hyperactive metabolism are not things a pig is supposed to have.  While nobody gives her any grief for being so underweight, Bella herself feels no end of shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella is listening to a story about a mysterious castle...  People who go in, sometimes never come back out.

Yes.  I just told you that.  I knew this one wolf, who went into that castle, looking for some treasure or something...  This guy, he just appeared in front of her, waved his hand, and she started gaining weight like, well, magic or somethin'...  Anyway, she managed to escape, somehow (she didn't tell me <i>how</i>, though), and when I saw her, she looked like she was over 600 pounds!   ...  She doesn't like to talk about it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella squealed, in only the way a pig can, in delight.  This <i>was</i> the answer to her problem!  \"Tell me where it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, jeez...  Just go to the top of the hill over there...\" the traveler gestured vaguely at a green hill behind him, \"And you'll see it.  I doubt you could miss a big, scary castle like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"  Bella ran.  This was the best day ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe traveler smirked.  \"'Nother one for the Lipomancer...  He shall be pleased.\" he said, as he vanished into thin air.</span></div></div>",

It even started to look like a pastry, the more she examined it!  It seemed like it would be delicious; but does that mean she should eat it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella's concave stomach growled; it wanted a say in this debate, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look good enough to eat, anyway, soooooo...  Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the mushroom's cap in her left hand, and its stalk in her right, she pulled them apart.  They separated quite neatly, to Bella's surprise, and she was left with two distinct parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to start on the cap, leaving the stalk on the stone that she was sitting on.  The pig-girl gripped the cream-colored cap in both hands like a sandwich (as competently as someone could hold a two-foot-wide sandwich, anyway), and began to eat it as such, taking a large bite out of a side covered in red, green, and purple spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella moaned in ecstasy as she chewed; the mushroom <i>was</i> delicious.  It tasted much like a piece of angel-food cake, drowned in thick cream and drizzled with a bit of caramel syrup, and its texture was very smooth and rich, like a spoonful of flan.  She swallowed her bite, and inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, mushroom!  I was right about you!\" she squealed, right before taking another bite of cap, which would be just as delicious as the first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the slender, pink pig-girl became a bit less slender as her concave stomach became just the slightest bit less concave, and her hips and breasts filled a bit.  She was still fairly slim, of course, but less so, now.  Indeed, these changes were so small that she didn't even notice them happening.  However, there was one who <i>did</i> notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy-set gray wolf crouched in the bushes a few feet from Bella, watching the pig intently, but quietly.  At full height, he'd stand over seven feet tall, but there in the bushes, he managed to compress himself to less than four.  He could do no such thing for his waistline, though, which, whether standing or sitting, was always four-and-a-half feet around, his belly jutting out from under an ill-fitting leather tunic and over the waistband of a far-too-small pair of leggings.  Despite his size, which would leave one to believe he was clumsy and bumbling, he was fairly able, sitting motionless and silent as his golden eyes were fixed upon Bella.  Bella, of course, didn't notice this, oblivious to her surroundings as she, er, \"pigged out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Bella had finished the cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was <i>good.</i>  And I still have a stalk to eat!\"  She turned to the stone, away from the wolf, and bent down to pick up the next course of her meal, treating the wolf to a look up her loose-fitting skirt at her buttocks; they were small, but that didn't stop the wolf from imagining them several times larger.  He'd have pounced on her at that very moment had he less control, but managed to contain himself admirably.  He watched the pig-girl sway a bit as she took a few bites from the stalk (it wasn't nearly as large as the cap), which was just as delicious as the cap.  Finishing that, she turned around to return her slightly-thicker rump to the flat stone, contentedly sighing as she decided to rest a bit longer.  She still didn't notice the changes to her body, and still didn't notice the stealthy gray wolf that watched her from the bushes.  She closed her eyes, for a moment, and laid back, but was startled by a strange feeling building inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my!  I feel...\"</span></div></div>",

In the other was a worn slip of paper she heavily scrutinized as she continued blindly down the path. It had been several nights since she had received the old page from a frail old man, speaking of his master and the challenge to all adventurers he had made. The entire meeting that night seemed strange, almost a dreamlike quality to it, like it had never even happened. Still she followed the directions on it, the promises of treasure it contained were too tempting for her to disregard.<br>\r\n\u201cIt has to be here\u2026\u201d She grumbled, her attention consumed by the map. \u201cCome on Midea you can't be lost that's jus-\u201d She continued her monologue but was cut off when she struck something during her walk. Looking up from the sheet she saw a large group of women of every race, and body type, garbed in clothing and armour either outlandish or ordinary. It did not seem to matter from where they hailed or what they were; they were all here for the same reason.<br>\r\n\u201cWatch where you're going!\u201d A voice broke through her fascination of seeing so many people in such a desolate place.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I'm sorry I just\u2026\u201d Midea stammered. Her vision snapped to the source of the voice who she saw to be a cat, wearing a robe as black and radiant as her glossy fur in the afternoon sun.<br>\r\n\u201cYou just...? Out with it lady.\u201d The anthropomorphic cat glared at the cleric.<br>\r\n\u201cStop right there, necromancer.\u201d A burly voice interrupted, followed by a loud clinking as a large suit of plate mail, like a pillar of white stepped in.<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but if you're that desperate for a reason to kill there's better thing to focus your dull wi- sword on... paladin.\u201d The cat hissed, turning her attention to the hawk that had been watching her since their arrival. <br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 thanks?\u201d Midea said, turning to face the armoured beast.<br>\r\n\"Everyone shut it, it's coming.\" The ironclad bird turned, along with the many other women, toward a great raised platform before a slab of vertical smooth stone, blocking a door.<br>\r\nGreat flashes of light filled the sky and soon after a column of light struck the platform, leaving behind a great cloud of smoke. \"Ladies and... ladies! Welcome, to my dungeon. Not all of you will make it, that I promise you but-\" A figure in the smoke announced.<br>\r\n\"Just get on with it!\" A voice shouted from the crowd.<br>\r\n\"So that's how it's going to be then... fine. Begin!\" The shrouded man grumbled, before numerous other bolts of light struck the ground and at the stone slab, blasting open an entranceway.<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" Midea asked, looking around frantically, briefly glimpsing many treasure seekers charging the opened door. However along with the stone that had blocked the entrance the ground of the surrounding area had also begun crumbling away under the magical assault. Midea watched as many fell into the new abyss. However during this she noted a curious sight, the necromancer she had just encountered was being chased to the door by the paladin, her gleaming sword ready to slash open the unholy mage before the ground fell away beneath her as well.<br>\r\nRealizing she had not much time remaining Midea chose to...</span></div></div>",

Leaping desperately across and around the holes that seemed to grow more numerous every moment she had almost reached it. It was in that moment though she felt something grab at her leg, turning around she saw what had grabbed hold: the cat. A wide grin on her face as they both were dragged away into the darkness of the pit.<br>\r\nShadows swirled through Midea's head, the void of unconsciousness keeping a firm grip upon her for a time. Soon enough however it did finally release <br>\r\n\"Uhn... my head.\" She groaned, reaching to place her hand to her forehead. Opening her eye yielded no difference from when they had been shut. Worriedly she began running her hands along the cold floor she found herself on, searching for her staff. \"Come on... come on... there you are!\" She exclaimed in triumph when her hand felt a hunk of dead wood. Near instantly a magical orb of pale light formed at the tip, however this did not accommodate for the darkness, nor size of the room she quickly realized. Even with the dull light she could see a wall in any direction, only her own body and the cold stones of the floor directly beneath her escaped the blackness.<br>\r\n\"Good, you have a light. We'll need that.\" A voice broke through Midea's focus on observing her options in the dark chamber. The voice was familiar though, a voice she had heard recently. Indeed it was the voice of the necromancer she had met on the surface earlier.<br>\r\n\"W-What do you want?\" Midea stammered, looking around in the darkness for the lavishly garbed witch.<br>\r\n\"Well firstly to leave this place alive, and that's something I think we both want to do.\" <br>\r\n\"But you forced me down here!\" Midea shouted at the room, throwing her hands into the air.<br>\r\n\"I saved your life, I guess you didn't realize just what was on the other side of that door, did you?\"<br>\r\n\"No... why? What was there?\"<br>\r\n\"A fa- actually, it's probably best that you don't know. So are you going to help me or are we going to starve to death in this room?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have much other choice do I?\" Midea asked, frowning as she sat on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" The black cat said, even though Midea couldn't see it she knew the sorceress was grinning after saying that. With that the feline stepped into Midea's light. \"My name is Faydra, just so you know.\"<br>\r\n\"H-Hi Faydra, I'm Midea.\" She replied with a soft smie, putting out her hand to offer a handshake.<br>\r\n\"Well come on I need your light over here.\" Faydra said, ignoring the gesture entirely as she walked back into the dark recesses of the room.<br>\r\nWith a small frown once again on her face Midea followed the direction her new companion had walked off in. The room proved larger than she had expected, and as she walked her thoughts turned to the necromancer, \"She seemed a bit wider... didn't she?\" She thought on the cat's appearance, \"Maybe it was just her robe, it did look a bit too big for her earlier but...\" But with that final thought she had bumped into the cat once again, who was leaned against a wall awaiting the cleric.<br>\r\n\"I hope you bumping into me doesn't become a theme... but that doesn't matter, now I can see this.\" Faydra said, turning to face the wall. \"Ah, there's an inscription here...\"<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" Midea asked, looking at the remainder of the wall. It was painfully ordinary, merely a soulless face of grey stone bricks. The only features to break this pattern was the inscription Faydra had already pressed her face against but aside from that there lay two buttons that jutted out form the wall on either side of where the kitty was stood. One was decorated with the symbol of a crescent moon, the other featured the image of a man carrying a sack.<br>\r\n\"It's a riddle... a terrible one.\" The unholy mage grumbled, \"I am a traveller, passed over the greatest roads of all, and seen all the world has offered, yet I have never left my home.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that's disappointingly simple.\" Midea chuckled, and with that Midea approached the wall and without a second thought she pressed the button bearing the sign of the...</span></div></div>",

Nothing seemed to happen initially, simply that a brick had been pushed deeper into the wall.<br>\r\n\"I guess that wasn't how you were supposed to answer.\" Midea shrugged, looking up to her forced companion for the moment. \"So what should we do no-\" She began to ask, but was cut off when the sounds of turning gears and shifting stone filled the room. Dust and small pieces of stone fell away from the ceiling as the room began to shake violently, throwing both women to the floor. The wall they had just interacted with began to fall away, a blinding light instantly shining through the new aperture.<br>\r\n\"No, I think you did it right.\" Faydra said, slowly raising herself from the ground, being careful should more quakes commence.<br>\r\n\"Well what are we waiting for?\" Midea asked, not wasting any time in standing and moving to the light to be rid of the dreary cell.<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait!\" The feline exclaimed, reaching out to stop her new friend. \"Wait... why am I putting myself in danger to protect her?\" Her thoughts interrupted her actions.<br>\r\n\"Wait for what?\" Midea asked, looking back at the necromancer with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, you go right ahead.\" She replied. Giving a reassuring smile, she hoped desperately that the human wouldn't realize how fake it was.<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Midea said, turning to step into the overpowering light. Just as she was about to be consumed by it stopped, \"Whoa!\" She shouted, stopping immediately. \"Hey Faydra... you might want to see this.\" She said, not bothering to avert her eyes from the sight.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Faydra said, thinking that there could be nothing so impressive beyond the new aperture. Stepping forward to be at the cleric's side she too was soon awestruck by what she had seen: a great spiraling pit, countless holes dotting the walls no different from the one they themselves had just emerged from. Overhead was a great skylight of stained glass, the design the moon brazen upon it,  causing a dim stream of white light to delicately flow into this antechamber. Deep below sounds, not unlike moans of pure agony eminated. Looking down over the edge both heroines could vaguely make out the bottom floor, the ground itself there was coarsely grained, like a sea of loose sand. Strewn along the walls spiraling downward toward the base of this tower, entering and exiting from countless black doors that lined the walls below.<br>\r\n\"Was I right?\" Midea asked, not averting her gaze from the astounding sight.<br>\r\nFaydra simply nodded, looking for how they should proceed next through this twisted spire. \"Wait, do you see that over there?\" She asked, looking over to her partner.<br>\r\n\"There's a lot of things... over there.\" Midea said, pointing vaguely in the direction that the cat was staring into.<br>\r\n\"No, I mean that door... that we have a direct path to. I think that'd be a fine way to start.\" Faydra noted, \"Or we could just bypass all of this entirely and just try to climb down, but something tells me that might not be my best idea...\" She noted, placing a hand to her stomach, her robe baely pressing in at all before reaching the flesh of her stomach.<br>\r\nMidea grinned at one of the necromancer's ideas and without a word proceeded to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silently Midea strolled down the walkway, her eyes turned skyward to gaze into the elaborate glass work overhead. Faydra, faced with no choice but to follow the woman let out a brief sigh, running her hand along her forehead after the cleric had made the decision to go the way that the cat could as well. Silently they re-entered the darkness that they had left moments ago, the only difference being the location from which they entered it.<br>\r\nThe duo cantered down the hall, finding it to be eerily similar to the room they had escaped from, design-wise at the very least. Between the walls, ceiling and floor of the corridor they looked during their walk, searching for anything that would break the unending stream of worked stone halls that had comprised everything they had encountered thus far beyond, and before the tower.<br>\r\n\"For how bit this dungeon is you would think it would be populated by... something.\" Faydra grumbled, slowing her pace before giving a brief yawn.<br>\r\n\"Maybe everyone else got through here before us.\" Midea suggested, who had for a time walked with her staff readied for combat, but now simply used it as a walking stick once more.<br>\r\n\"For some reason I doubt that...\" Faydra retorted, her thoughts turning to the dense paladin she had gotten much better than she would have preferred before this had begun.<br>\r\nSo onward they marched, with their footsteps being the only sound accompanying them. This ended abruptly however when a great wait echoed down the irritatingly long corridor. Upon hearing it Midea let out a gasp, grabbing her acquaintance's hand before sprinting off in hopes of finding the source. After a full minute of dashing the hall still stretched on, the blackness of it keeping the two from seeing anything beyond what lay immediately before them.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Slow down a bit... I... I can't breathe.\" Faydra pleaded between gasps for breath as she was forced to keep pace with the lithe cleric.<br>\r\n\"Not until we find who screamed, they need our help.\" Midea told her unwilling company, not noticing how the necromancer's rob pressed against its own's body as she ran, revealing the shape of a rotund belly, too small to support yet still giving a slight shake and jiggle with every step the feline took. Below that lay somewhat thick thighs that pressed together, competing for dominance over who shall cover more of her groin as she ran. Despite this chubby body however the kitty's face showed no signs of this fat that had lined the remainder of her body... yet.<br>\r\n\"I'm... gonna pass out.\" She choked out, but just then they stopped.<br>\r\n\"What in the blue blazes is that?\" Midea shouted, readying her staff which glowed soon after with a red, pulsating light. Before her lay what she would have once called a woman, but was now overflowing with layers of pure lard all over her body. The poor grey furred lady had been rendered barely capable of movement to move due to the incredible weight that had been added across her entire frame. The ruins of what were most likely once form fitting leathers were strewn across the floor around her, leaving the woman covered by her surprisingly elastic undergarments, but they too were now forming tears, unable to hold their ever expanding owner. With a belly like a fleshy orb, and numerous rolls and crevices formed by the fat across the wolfess's back, arms, and thighs. The source of this weight, a strange globule of golden gel, wrapped around the once nimble lady's neck forcing itself down her forced jaw. With every pump of its own mass its victim expanded further, however when Midea let out a shriek it tore itself from its fattened prey and immediately landed before the still thin lady, its new goal set.<br>\r\nThe slime had already spent the majority of its mass but still it moved with determination, slicking across the floor attempting to get a decent angle from which to strike. It leapt into the air, the red light of Midea's staff shining off of it as it flew, Midea struck it away, or so she thought. It clung to her staff and before she could react properly it had slid its way down the stick, and along her arm making a direct course for her mouth. Forcing its way into the cleric's mouth she was overcome with a flavour not unlike honey, just as quickly as it had entered it had begun forcing itself down her throat into the stomach. Her stomach pooched out, the remainder of her body becoming delicately enhanced with a new thin sheet of adipose.<br>\r\n\"Mmmph!\" Midea shrieked, shaking her head violently to throw away her sweet attacker but then she saw something: Faydra had shoved her hand into the gooey monster. The feline's hand glowed with a black aura, causing the slimy creature to toss itself away from the cleric. It scampered in various directions, slowly evaporating under whatever magical energy it had been charged with before fading away entirely. Midea moved her hands to her barely expanded midsection, \"I'm... I'm fat.\" She said, eyes wide and jaw agape, she gently poked her new belly that could barely been considered a belly if even that. \"Oh gods I'm so fat... my life is over!\" She screamed, looking up at her friend.<br>\r\nFaydra simply rolled her eyes, \"Oh quit your whining, you're still skinny.\"<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you mean 'skinny!?' I'm a damn whale!\"<br>\r\n\"I mean the situation isn't nearly as bad as you think it is, or as it could be.\" Faydra sighed.<br>\r\n\"You don't know what it's like! I'm fat! F-A-T!\"<br>\r\n\"You think you're that fat do you? I'll show you fat.\" The cat shouted, clearly angry at the woman's despair. In one swift movement she raised her robe, revealing her ultimately doughy body. \"Look at it.\" She demanded, gaining Midea's full attention.<br>\r\nMidea's eyes fixed upon the necromancers body, \"I-I guess you're right...\" She squeaked out. Putting her hand to her mouth she made a vain attempt to hide a slight blush that had quickly formed as her eyes took in every detail of her portly friend.<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd hate to interrupt your moment there could I get a hand standing up?\" The wolf they had just accidentally rescued asked, attempting to come to a stand herself before falling back to her plush rump.<br>\r\n\"Depends, what's in it for us?\" Faydra asked, dropping her robe back down and turning to face the obese canine, bringing a small frown to Midea's face.<br>\r\n\"I could help you with... things. I promise I won't be any trouble.\" The wolf pleaded, still trying to make progress on returning to her feet.<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Faydra asked, looking back to her friend, given that the encounter was the cleric's doing.<br>\r\n\"Can I see that again?\" Midea dumbly asked, nervously smiling at the cat.<br>\r\n\"Well I guess it's up to me then.\" The feline grumbled, \"I guess you can...</span></div></div>",

Exhausted from the experience she retreated to a nearby monastery, hoping to remove herself as much as possible from such things by becoming a priestess.<br>\r\nYears would pass and no word ever came of the countless young women who had entered that wicked dungeon, and stories more recently had told of people throughout the region becoming somewhat weightier than they had been in the years before.

Lucille looked perfectly at home as she took aim, with eyes as green as the pine needles around her, the vixen's fur as pale brown bark, with a creamy white front stretching from her cheeks downward.

Lucille's poise sank to a disappointed slump when she saw where her arrow struck.  To her credit, the steel head punched through the target and into the tree it was propped against... but it was woefully off target.  Not the yellow bulls-eye, or the red circle for nice try, but the blue outer ring, which could mean all the difference in a real battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't get it, Rose.  I've been practicing all week, and I can't make shots like normal.\"  Lowering her bow and drawing the locks of her hair away from her eyes, the vulpine turned to her friend, the wolfess, who was still going through her motions for Tai Chi, a simple warm-up to the heavy hitting the warrior monk was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Balance of the body and spirit.  You will practice your form all you like, and until you realize the true problem, your archery shall suffer,\"  The wolfess calmly replied, moving through the sweeping motions and calculated, fluid steps of her technique.  Rose's fur as as black as the night sky, the same true of her hair; behind her tall ears was a braid that reached down to her tail, while a small fringe framed the left side of her muzzle.  Her dress was in sharp contrast with the ranger next to her, distinctly the style of a Far Eastern martial artist rather than a Western warrior.  A crimson top with no sleeves, folded one side over another, exposing a small bit of her cleavage.  Her pants were deeper red, embroidered with a gold dragon design that stretched from her slipper-clad feet up to the silken black sash around her waist.  The wolfess opened her yellow eyes when he finished her exercise, to find the vixen looking none-too-pleased and tapping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's all very beautiful and poetic, but I'm concerned with results, Rose.  I'm worried I'm gonna under perform in the next assignment, and I don't want you getting hurt,\"  Lucille crossed her arms, and narrowed her eyes at Rose.  \"What's wrong with me?  You're in tune with this stuff, so what am I doing wrong?\"  The lupine just smiled, walking to her friend and meeting her eye to eye, reaching for the vulpine's arms and bringing them to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Calm yourself, and think of what I've said, Lucille.  Body and mind.  Which is it that troubles you these days?\"  The fox rolled her eyes and sighed, but her friend squeezed her arms a little, gathering back her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What?  I don't know what's wrong, that's why I'm asking you!\"  Rose let her tail wag calmly, while her friend's bushy tail lashed back and forth in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It is simple.  It is your...\"</span></div></div>",

You have been gaining weight.\"  The wolfess said bluntly, smiling to her friend who just stood there blushing furiously through her white-furred cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You... I should smack you silly, Rose.  I have not been gaining weight!\"  The ranger huffed, attempting to twist her wrists out of the wolfess' grip, but failing, looking away from the black-furred canine with contempt for those words contorting her brow.  The monk simply sighed, gently releasing Lucille's wrists to reach further into her cloak, pushing on the leather waist cincher.  Gritting her teeth, the vulpine looked back to her friend, her fists balling up.  \"Rose, I swear to God and heaven above...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You know I'm right.  Just let me help,\"  Rose looked to the fox with a smile, stepping closer to get at the drawstrings on the fox's back.  With a few deft pulls, the wolfess began to loosen the thick, slimming belt, as Lucille stood still, her eyes closing as a sigh escaped from her.  The garment was painfully tight around the vulpine's waist, and it quickly became more apparent that she had indeed added a few pounds to her frame.  Her belly filled out the leather that she'd squeezed around her midsection, revealing that her tummy had gotten quite doughy, sagging outward three inches, as compared to inward one inch just moments ago.  The wolfess quirked a brow; even she thought her friend hadn't packed on that much, but it was well worth seeing Lucy smiling again, even with her little dome of a gut bulging out her loosened waist cincher.  \"Feeling better, are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tons better.  I'm sorry, Rose.\"  The vixen dipped her head, only to have her chin caught by the Rose's paw, and her nose licked by a nice, broad wolf tongue.  Lucille acked and giggled, turning away from her friend with a big grin.  The monk just smiled back, eyes lingering a bit too long on the fox's backside, wondering how much bigger the fox's butt had gotten... damn that cloak!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You've nothing to feel sorry for.  I can bet your aim will be much steadier without the pain of squeezing into that silly thing.\"  Wagging her tail, the lupine padded over to Lucille, who had just pulled her arrow free of the target with a sharp tug, placing the arrow in the quiver on her back and draping her bow over her body, careful not to let the string dig into that ample, fuzzy cleavage her tunic allowed.  The vixen turned around with a worried glance at her friend, stepping along the forest's understory, the dried pine needles crunching under her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's so weird.  I've never had a weight problem before now.  I'm not losing my metabolism or anything, right?  I mean, I'm only in my twenties.\"  As the vixen walked back towards the path, the wolfess jogged to join her companion's side, her brow furrowing with thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I believe it is tied to our assignment.  Every day we draw closer to Greenshire, the fatter your kills are.\"  Rose tapped her chin as she spoke, with Lucille flushing scarlet yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Birds and boars are fatter cause they're living off the farmland.  Makes sense.  They're delicious, too, is the problem.\"  The fox giggled as she looked down at her stomach.  She filled herself to the brim each night on the way there, while Rose subsisted on various edible plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That is true.  The nature of this assignment has troubled me for days.  I do not trust our employer.  A bounty like the one he promised does not warrant fetching two amateur thieves from the breadbasket of the country.\"  To that, the vulpine rolled her eyes, giving Rose a little nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Come on, the guy was obviously filthy rich.  A creep, but a rich creep!  He wants results, wants 'em fast.  We'll make away with a killing no problem.  But, if it makes you feel any better...\"  The vixen looked to the horizon through the trees, then off in the distance to the faint light from Greenshire.  It was nearly dusk, time to begin thinking about shelter.  \"We can rough it for another night and stay outta town.  Or we could go to an inn, your call.\"  The vixen nodded to the wolfess, who stepped forth and began to speak.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"To Greenshire.  We've been in the wilderness enough,\"  Rose smiled to the vixen, drawing ever closer to the farming community turned boom town.  Greenshire had experienced a massive growth in recent years; the fields were vast and fertile, the land for grazing equally so, and the quality of the town's products was so good it nearly took on a brand name even in times of antiquity.  What was once scratching and surviving in a dusty little town had grown into a center for agriculture, with merchants and homeowners from all around flocking to make a living.  Indeed, it was out of the wilderness, and into the fields, and eventually the stone city walls.  The wolfess stopped walking about halfway through a cornfield, watching the sun begin to set, the city's guards beginning to light lanterns to help see in the coming darkness.  \"I still do not like it, Lucille.  This is hardly the ideal place for thieves to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that was their angle.  Go to the last place someone would expect.  I mean, sure, the city's safe, but it's also one of the biggest around.  Not to mention there's farms all around out here.  They could be hiding anywhere.\"  Lucille frowned, then patted the monk on the back, smiling.  \"Come on.  At the very least let's get a nice warm bed and a good meal.  We can settle in and worry about investigation later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, looking forward to the good meals now, are you?\"  Rose mused, watching with girlish glee as Lucille flushed and pulled her robes around her more tightly, concealing her belly.  \"You know, I can show you a few things about sumo wrestling if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I knew you wouldn't be able to dodge it, I would punch you so hard.\"  The vixen growled, right as the pair passed through the gate in the city, the armored guards stationed outside peering at the furred beauties walking past, eyes drawn down to tail level, with grins behind the grills of their helmets.  Even at dusk, the wolfess and vixen could see the bustle of the town wrapping up.  Clothing merchants, blacksmiths, confectioners, a tavern or two, inns, and not to mention many townsfolk looking quite large as the ranger and monk passed by.  The vixen and wolf alike brushed hips with other men and women whose berth had become very wide, apparently not used to their own weight they had to throw around.  Leaning to her black-furred friend, the vixen muttered, \"See?  Not just the pigs are fat around here,\"  Rose giggled, leaning right back in to Lucille's tall ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. The vixens dwarf the pigs any day.\"  The vixen growled at Rose, who stuck her tongue out at her friend as they came to Greenshire Inn, a three-level structure with stone foundation and bright, clean lumber for the structure.  As they stepped in, they were greeted by a plump dragoness with white scales and a violet dress, waving to them and offering a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ladies.  Would you happen to be Rose and Lucille?\"  The monk and ranger stopped for a moment, turning to face each other with brows furrowed.  The dragoness took note, raising a finger.  \"Um, I have been reserving a room for you.  Courtesy of your employer.  I've kept the matter confidential, but you two matched my description.  My name is Gwen... please forgive me for distressing you.\"  The vixen gave a sigh of relief, and the wolfess smiled, bowing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Gwen.  We were unaware of this.\"  Stepping to the counter, the two adventurers were given a key from the dragoness, who smiled and dropped the shimmering gold key in the wolfess' black palm.  Rose and Lucille were left dazzled by the key; just how rich was this town when a room key was shimmering gold, with its bow bearing a sapphire gem?  \"Are you sure this is ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, ladies.  I was given specific instructions to give you our best room and service.  You've access to everything my inn has to offer.  Food, drink, um... personal attention from the servants?\"  Gwen giggled at the two across the counter, and nodded.  \"Does any of that interest you?\"  Lucille and Rose looked at each other.  They were both grinning, quite ready to take advantage of the hospitality.  It was the vixen who spoke, though, swishing her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes it does!  We'd like...\"</span></div></div>",

Too round to fix a bath yourself now, are we?\" The wolfess once again playfully snickered at her friends expense. Lucille responded by actually attempting to jab Rose in the arm, which she merely danced around while throwing in a taunt or two about the vixen's added weight slowing her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, heh,\" The innkeeper at the counter giggled at the comical display put on by the adventuring duo. \"Yes, well, I will see what we can do. Your room is on the second floor, first door on the left from the staircase. You'll here a knock when your... request is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! No! Stop! Please!\" A young catgirl in a dancer's outfit cried out as a shadowy figure flew above her, before dropping down and blocking the only escape from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Color Spray,\" The figure muttered, and instantly, the victim was overwhelmed by a vivid assortment of colors, to the point where her mind had to shutdown to block out the painfully bright images. As the feline's body fell, a clawed hand reached out and stood it back upright, before a set of long fangs bit down at the base of the neck, and began draining the dancer of about a quarter of precious bodily fluids. After about a minute of draining the victim, the predator casted the body to the floor, before letting out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, i really need to cut back,\" The figure said as it lit a candle, revealing that the young dancer was just one of about a half-dozen entertainers who had fallen before the assassin Hemia. She was a dark gray furred vampirebat with black-tipped ears and eyes as red as her favorite drink. She was reknowned throughout the countryside as a deadly hunter who specialized in illusions to distract her targets before she went in for the kill; though honestly, if you were to look at her now, you wouldn't be able to guess that contract killing was her profession of choice. Ever since that man had made her an offer she couldn't refuse, Hemia had been camping out in Greenshire waiting for her targets to pass by in the area. What she hadn't expected to find was that almost all of the inhabitants of the prospering city were overweight and that their blood was filled with enough sugar and fat to keep a bakery running. Consequently, in the month or so she'd been waiting for her targets to arrive, she had put on a good 40 pounds, the majority of it going straight to her belly, causing a sizable muffin top to replace the bat's once rock-hard midsection. At the very least, finding new clothes that fit was never a problem here, as she found out that the dancer outfit her latest meal had been wearing conviently happened to be a perfect fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemia removed a letter from between her generously sized cleavage and quickly skimmed through it again. The targets were a vixen and wolfess adventuring pair that were traveling in the area. Likely to have some sort of combat skills and be wary of a potential attack. Once apprehended or slain, they were to be taken back immediately to Castle Darkcloud, where the agreed upon price would be paid in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lucille and Rose, I don't know who you are or what you did, but if he's willing to pay this much for you guys, how can I say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusionist assassin let out a chuckle as she dragged all of the unconcious and blood-starved servants under a tarp she had brought along for the occasion, before stepping out and collecting a truely enormous serving dish from the front counter and began lugging the thing up the rather long flight of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Rose, what are you gonna do with your share of the reward money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One should not consider the prize before it has been won,\" the wolfess monk said stoically- before dropping the act and resuming her usual smile. \"But I have afeeling that I already know what you'll be buying when this is all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now, is my recent...weight...problem all you can talk about?\" The vixen let out an exasperated sigh as she collapsed onto her rather large and plush bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose let out another chuckle as the two picked up the sound of panting coming from behind their door. Followed by a few seconds later by the sound of knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The help's here!\" Lucille said as she lept out of her seating position to her feet in a single movement. \"About time too, I haven't had a good bath in over a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door began to slide open, revealing a chubby female figure clothed in an Arabic style dance garb which managed to both look revealing and conceal her identity at the same time- well, it hid her facial features anyway, the pair of hairless wings sticking out of her back made it glaringly obvious to the adventuring pair that their entertainer for tonight was a bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The vixen said, sounding rather underwhelmed. \"We only get one? Gwen seemed to imply that there would be atleast a few of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I assure you my lady,\" The bat said in an alluring voice. \"I'm all that you'll be requiring tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last syllabel exited the dancer's mouth, the lighting in the room seemed to all pinpoint on her; and with a snap of her fingures, a dozen lovely copies of herself materialized in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, my ladies, please enjoy this lovely feast that has been prepared for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat pulled the top off the platter, revealing an assortment of meat so vast neither woman could truely comprehend it. There were boar ribs, cow flanks, chicken breasts, bear steaks, and veal; it was like a little platter from carnivore heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal was placed on top of the table set aside in the back of the room, and the vixen and wolfess began digging into the meal with great vigor; clearly rather pekish after the long trek into town. As the two adventurers ate, wonderous music seemed to fill the room from nowhere as the dozen bat girls began to sensuously dance in key to the ebb and flow of the sounds. After about twenty minutes, the feasting duo managed to lick every single of the many bones now scattered about the place clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhh!\" Lucille let out a slight moan as she rubbed her swollen middle. \"That...that was good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dozen bat girls all chuckled in unison, before they all took a few steps closer to the now bloated adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my ladies. Before either of you ask anything else of me this evening, I ask but one small request from the two of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what would that be?\" The vixen turned herself towards the bats with no small ammount of effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still for a moment, would you?\"</span></div></div>",

At first Hemia only struggled, pushing against Rose\u2019s grip on her head and Lucille\u2019s hold on her pudgy sides, \u201cYou let go of me you filthy hogs! I\u2019m not going to eat! I told you I was <i>full</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work Rose!\u201d Lucille cried out to her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold her still!\u201d The wolf barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemia\u2019s eyes widened as her large, sensitive ears twitched, picking up the subtle, but distinct sound of Gwen\u2019s blood pulsing through her veins. Her mouth hung open as she stared at the dragoness\u2019s neck, the bat, despite being stuffed full, drooling ever so slightly. Gwen looked about nervously for a moment, having second thoughts,<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to hurt much\u2026 is i-EEP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by Hemia\u2019s piercing bite, the bat ravenously lapping at the blood that leaked from the dragoness\u2019 neck. Gwen whimpered, but held still, closing her eyes and trying to think of other things than the blood being drained from her. Meanwhile Hemia seemed to be enjoying herself, even as her stomach stretched wider and wider, trying to accommodate the influx of blood. The bat continued for a long while, even as she grew painfully full, now looking as if she were in a stupor as she leaned fang-first against the dragoness, her eyelids drooped while she indulged herself fully in her literal bloodlust. She did not stop until Rose and Lucille forced her to, pulling her roughly away from her meal and tossing the bat back onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen swooned woozily, Lucille catching the dragoness before she hit the floor, \u201cAre you okay? I think we might have gone a little overboard\u2026\u201d The fox said, wincing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d The dragon girl groaned softly, looking a bit weary, but not in any danger, \u201cJust need to rest a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille nodded and helped the hefty innkeeper to her feet, guiding her over to a nearby chair while Rose strutted along the bed to look their would-be assassin over. Hemia laid on her back, sinking into the plush bed quite a bit as she groaned and whined in pain. Her belly was now grotesquely bloated, not so much sticking out of her dancer\u2019s outfit as exploding forth from it, wobbling with each breath she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, looks like somebody\u2019s had too much to drink!\u201d She teased, grinning as she looked down at the helpless vampire bat, \u201cWhat did she call us earlier babe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille looked over at her partner as she helped settle the woozy dragoness into her chair, the seat creaking audibly, \u201cUhhh\u2026 Porkers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, we addressed that one\u2026 The one she just called us\u2026\u201d The wolf said, chuckling as she looked back at the groaning bat who squirmed and whined in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Lucille gasped as her ears shot up and she turned around to look at them, \u201cFilthy hogs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose snickered as she placed her paw on the bat\u2019s distended, blood-packed gut as pushed down firmly, \u201cAh yes, that\u2019s right, filthy\u2026!\u201d She pushed down harder, making the bat girl gasp in discomfort, \u201cHogs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026!\u201d She squealed, moaning as she lolled her head about and panted feverishly, \u201cStop this you sick freaks!

Too much damn blood\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I will hun\u2026 As soon as you tell us why you were trying to murder us!\u201d She sneered down at Hemia as she pressed her paw more firmly into the bat\u2019s stomach, laughing in surprised glee as she forced a loud, wet belch from the assassin, \u201cHeh, and she called <i>us</i> filthy Lucille!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe would know it seems\u2026\u201d The vixen smiled as she walked over to the other side of the bed, poking and prodding at the bat\u2019s exposed, bulging belly, making her whine and wobble, \u201cMaybe we could feed her some of our blood too Rose, doubt she could take a drop more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaaaahh\u2026\u201d Rose looked up at her partner, grinning eagerly, a wicked gleam in her eyes, \u201cI bet she could take a whole cup at least, maybe a gallon of blood!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemia let out a strained wheezing gasp of utter terror, her lip quivering as she squeezed her eyes shut, \u201cYou barbarians! You merciless bitches! FINE DAMMIT! I\u2019ll tell you who hired me!\u201d She groaned suddenly, her belly sloshing painfully, \u201cJust leave me and my fucking tummy alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two partners looked at each other and grinned. \"Fair enough! So then, who was it?\" Rose asked.<br>\r\nHemia pouted before reluctantly telling the duo the truth... Or was it?</span></div></div>",

The name at the bottom was too illegible to read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" Lucille began pulling her sleeve up to expose the veins in her arms. \"Okay, this is crap. I hope you don't mind some more stretch marks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Rose said, placing a hand in front of her companion as she began to think back to the start of their adventure. \"Lucille, do you remember how we got in contact with our current employer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Lucille tried to think back that far, she normally left the more boring parts of their job to Rose. \"We got a letter, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct. We got a letter with no return address signed off at the bottom in a language I wasn't familiar with.\" Rose reached into a small bag in a pile with the rest of their adventuring gear, pulled out the letter in question, and began to read it out loud. \"'When the targets have been aprehended, deliver them to the castle up high on the Gray Cliffs.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Hemia blurted out, before the pain from her midsection reminded her that she didn't have the luxary of yelling. \"That's where Castle Darkcloud is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that has to be a coincidence.\" Lucille said. Wishing she could sound more certain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't! Castle Darkcloud is the only place around on the Gray Cliffs. Everyone else ran away apparently because it was 'haunted'..Oh, this is some conspiracy bullshit, isn't it?!\" Hemia winced again in pain as she let out another beltch, her body doing it's best to digest the massive amount of blood before her lack of an indoor voice proved to be the death of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what you said is true,\" Lucille responded, still not keen on accepting the posibillity that this whole figure destroying trip was a setup. \"Do you have anything to prove to us that your story checks out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, I have the letter stored in my boobs, if you'd just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need,\" Rose said as she reached down into the bat's cleavage and swiped the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Hemia shouted, unable to come up with a good insult at this point, she settled on mumbling something under her breath. \"pervert...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her, Rose unfolded the letter and read through it. Sure enough, it was scribbled by the same hand that had writen the request that they had recieved a month ago; down to the alien signature at the bottom. Rose passed the two letters off to Lucille, who saw the weird signature as proof enough that the assassin wasn't lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! We've been had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems,\" Rose said in agreement, before smiling. \"Well, it appears as though our employer very much wanted us to meet you, Miss Bat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose, how can you be joking at a time like this?\" Lucille said indignantly. \"Whoever this Darkcloud guy is tried to have us assassinated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but why? We're hardly what one might call big time adventurers, and we've done nothing to offend Lord or Lady Darkcloud. There has to be another reason behind this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we aren't going to find out just hanging around here! C'mon, let's pay the Gray Cliffs a visit.\" Lucille said as she began repacking the things she had taken out mere hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What about me?\" Hemia complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you? You're probably going to hang.\" Lucille said dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemia began to panic. \"B-but you'll never be able to get there without me! There's this stupid mist all around the place, I've been in the area before, and the only reason I know up from down there is because I can fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well I'm afraid you won't be doing that much anytime soon.\" Rose teased as she pressed down on the bat's exposed middle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that! and I can too still fly! And I can do illusions, and judging by our fight earlier, neither of you have ever even cast Ghost Sound!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but if we were to let you go, what's to stop you from attacking us again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHemia sighed, knowing that this was her chance to avoid being sent to prison and possibly executed, did her best to sound reasonable. \"Look, I've been through this conspiracy thing before. I was never meant to kill you two and I sure as shit wasn't going to be paid if I did. I want to find the asshole who set this up and make him pay for ruining my figure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose chuckled, before turning to Lucille. \"Well, she seems trustworthy enough to me, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille frowned. She wasn't comfortable having a bloodsucker as a party member, and she really wasn't looking forward to having to deal with Hemia yelling all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright, fine.\" Lucille agreed, if only because having a guide meant they'd get there quicker. \"But if I think that for any reason that you're going to betray us, I will rip off your wings and make you drink them dry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, fine, whatever! Now for the love of gods untie me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done,\" Rose undid the knot in almost an instant, and the vampire bat spread her limbs and wings across the incredibly soft bed as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhh... much better.\" Hemia moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille looked up from her packing work. \"Okay, Rose.

Several dozen more precious little treasures were clustered around her ankles, tugging on her skirt, punching each other, wailing, and picking their noses.  \"If it wasn't for the Sisters caring for him, little Squirmathy might not have made it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did no more than do our duty in the name of cheeses,\" High Priestess Sniffletwip said solemnly, making the Sign of the Hole-y Wheel on her chest as she invoked the holiest of foodstuffs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-I know it's not much, but I baked you a little something,\" the beaming mother said, removing a package from the folds of her robes.  \"They're cheddar crumpets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Priestess' heart sank--not that it could go very far before encountering her stomach.   A stomach which had already been treated today to brie and crackers for giving the morning blessings, and bread slathered in mozzarella courtesy of a lonely old woman, and gorgonzola biscuits, and camembert cookies, and six slices of good old fashioned cheesecake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I couldn't possibly,\" she said feebly, even as the woman pushed the bundle into her hands.  <i>With such generous parishoners</i>, the priestess reflected,<i> it's lucky we don't regard gluttony as a sin...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was such a thing as far too much of a good thing, and the Sisters of the Wheel hadn't been immune to the recent...thickening around the town.   In fact, most of them had grown nearly round as balls of late under the constant avalanche of baked goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sniffletwip took an enormous bite and favored the young woman with a grateful smile.  As soon as she and her brood were out of sight, the priestess groaned and dropped the half-eaten biscuit back in the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish these, would you?\" she said to a pudgy young acolyte.  The girl squeaked in dismay.  \"B-but I just got back from the orphanage bake sale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high priestess shot her a look and the acolyte gulped.  \"Right away, High Priestess.  D-down the hatch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that bit of business polished off, Sniffletwip turned to the next matter on her plate (she really needed some new metaphors...):  the Sisters had received an inquiry into the possibility of hiring an adventure-worthy companion.  The cause--preserving life--was just, and the fee for such an endeavor could be put to good use helping the needy.  The only problem, Sniffletwip had to admit, was that quite frankly, hardly any of the Sisters were in any shape for adventuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffletwip found her in the courtyard, a whirl of silver mail and platinum-blonde hair, her great ears shiny with sweat as she danced around the practice dummies.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiffnick?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buff young acolyte spun and bowed without missing a step or losing her balance.  \"Yes, High Priestess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a special mission for you,\" Sniffletwip said solemnly.   \"Thanks to your, er--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at numerous perforated, ventilated, and generally decapitated training dummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--exuberant lifestyle, you're the only member of the Swiss Guard who's kept herself fit enough to adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adventure?\"  Fiffnick said, frowning.  \"That is hardly a holy pastime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps not, my child, but it can be a noble one.\"  Sniffletwip smiled sadly.  \"Besides, it may be a good idea for you to leave for a while, before whatever immunity you carry to this recent, er... largening...fails you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing more than exercise, discipline and a healthy diet,\" Fiffnick protested, but she examined the job description she'd been handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.

Sliding her longsword into it's sheeth as she walked, the paladin couldn't help but to think about the... peculiar condition that had befallen her home. While she knew better than to expect everyone to have the strength of will and divine discipline that she possessed, the speed at which the town had... grown, to put it nicely, had to be unnatural. At first her mind had immediately jumped to suspecting the Maloricans and the other heretical cults that the town had foolishly allowed to set root. However even after numerous raids into the holes they whispered dark words in, she was unable to find any evidence that the cults had any link to the town's current dilemma. The source, she mused, must lie elsewhere in the surrounding countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would have to wait. For now she had to see to her duties as a Paladin of the Sisters of the Wheel. The Foyer was only a short walk away from the field, and by the time she had finished her thoughts on the matter at hand she was already opening the door to a very... unorthodox scene. There were three women waiting for her.  A slightly plump Vixen with a bow watching with frustration as a still foot wolfess danced around with glee as a gray bat tried in vain to land a hit on her with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Goddammit hold still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is this too much for you? Perhaps I should close my eyes and stuff my ears as well? I think you may stand a chance of striking me yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" The mouse barked, causing the quarrel to stop, but not before the wolf jabbed the bat in the side, causing her exposed midriff to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm assuming that you three are the ones who requested my assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes,\" Rose said, with more than a hint of smugness leftover from tormenting the bloodsucker. \"My name is Rose, and this is my companion Lucille.\" Rose made a quick gesture to the Vixen behind her. \"And this is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A vampire bat,\" Fiffnick said with disdain as the mouse got a better look at Hemia's fangs. \"You keep strange company, miss Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, she's not our friend or anything.\" Lucille spoke up. \"We just need her to show us where Castle Darkcloud is so we can kick whoever's living there in the ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kick them in the ass?\" The Paladin's mood lowered. \"So you hired my services to get revenge on a noble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, said noble tried to have us killed.\" Rose added, lifting the mouse's hopes slightly. \"And we're not even sure that the person is a noble. The land around the castle has been abandoned for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\"Fiffnick nodded, before turning to face Hemia. \"I'm warning you, bat. If I catch you trying to feast on anyone, I will cut you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If I catch you feasting on anyone!</i>\" Hemia spat in a poor imitation of the mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough. You're on thin ice as it is, do not make things worse for yourself.\" Rose glared at Hemia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever. I'll just starve to death. Stupid racist paladins. Always jumping to conclusions and thinking they know best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Hemia stormed out of the monastery, unfurled her wings, and took off. \"This way, assholes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille bit her lip and put her hand on her bow. \"Can I please just shoot her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we may need her help yet. Now come, she's moving quite fast for one her size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiffnick watched as the two canines took off after the bat. It took quite a bit of effort to not sigh in frustration at the whole spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, is going to be a long journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please, tell me what troubles your thoughts.\"  The wolfess looked to Lucille with a soft smile, in that all-understanding way the monk had about her.  Rose had known the vixen all her life, though there was the obvious divide between where they learned their techniques, and how they viewed their health.  The ranger took a deep breath and sighed, nodding to the lupine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  You have to promise me you're not going to give me any weird looks or anything, cause... I've been having these weird dreams lately.  Recurring nightmares, I guess you could say.  Can I sit down?\"  The vixen asked, with Rose immediately releasing her friend's wrists before backing away.  Sweeping her cloak off the ground, Lucille came to sit upon a tree trunk that had been felled, but not collected.  The wolfess calmly sat next to her troubled comrade and placed a hand on her shoulder, leaning in with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell me anything, Lucille.  I believe it's in your best interest to get this load off your chest.  You'll feel better, trust me.\"  Those last two words were wasted.  There was no one Lucille trusted more than Rose, though the vixen was still nervous about telling her exactly what was on her mind.  The fox hunched forward, clasping her slender paws in one another, before she finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always some sort of variation, but... I'll tell you about the one I had last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night?  Forgive me for saying, but I could um...\"  The wolfess grinned a little, \"I could smell that you were quite pleased with whatever dream you had.\"  Lucille's cheeks flushed pink, and she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the scary part, Rose.  I'm terrified of what happens, but I always get...\"  She squeezed her thighs tight, obviously ashamed.  \"I'm sorry, but here goes nothing...\"<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nThe vixen seemed to wake in the world of her own dream, gasping and looking about to find that she was in a cell.  Cool stone walls surrounded her, with heavy iron bars to her frontside.  Distant groans came down the torchlit hall, the voices mostly female ones, muffled in one way or another.  Accompanying those ominous tones was the sound of belching, which served to revolt the vixen a bit as she attempted to move forward, but was stopped by the iron shackles around her wrists, effectively keeping her against the wall with her hands above her head.  As if being in bondage wasn't demeaning enough, she soon discovered she was stark naked, her ample breasts freely wobbling as she struggled, and her fuzzy crotch wide open to any of her captors.  At the very least, her ankles weren't spread with bars, though she was getting a bit uncomfortable with the hard, moist stone against her pert rump.  A soft chuckle came down the hall, a male voice unlike any she'd heard before ringing in her ears before a hooded and cloaked figure appeared, lifting a key to the iron door and unlocking it, throwing it open.  She couldn't be able to make out what he looked like under the hood, but she did see a pair of gnarled hands raising up, making an arcane gesture that seemed to start something rolling down the hall, squealing the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Lucille.  I do so love a new arrival who hasn't fallen to many of my traps.  I daresay I may enjoy treating you to my hospitality better than the others.\"  He chuckled again, approaching the nude vixen as she snarled and tugged on her binds, the squealing getting louder as a metal cart approached the door and slipped inside the cell, right next to the cloaked man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out of this stuff and I'll kill you quickly.\"  The vixen balled her fists, the futility of her resistance bringing forth a full-on laugh from the mass of dark robes before her.  He seemed to be shaking his head as he turned his attention to the cart, lifting a silver lid from a tray, revealing a large stack of warm cinnamon rolls, drenched in icing.  Reaching inward, he grabbed one of the large treats and raised it to Lucille's maw, waving it in front of her face teasingly as his spare hand settled on her hip, working inward towards the white fur on her trim tummy, pressing inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere.  Your new job is to sit back, relax, and get hungry.\"  Those bony fingertips pressed firmly inward at the vixen's stomach, causing her to wince and open her mouth just slightly enough for the hooded man to stuff that sweet roll into her mouth.  Lucille's cheeks bulged with the stuff, her tongue taking in the taste of that fresh dough, the spice of cinnamon and sugar mingling with the rich creamy frosting.  Though she was rather indignant with a bit of the icing dripping from her lips, she began to chew and start swallowing the delicious pastry, narrowing her eyes at the seeming void in the hood.  \"Not so bad, is it?  Have another.\"  Quickly grabbing for another roll, the man in the hood saw that Lucille was going to be difficult, swallowing the first treat and turning her face sharply away, cheeks flushed with embarrassment.  \"What's the matter, my dear?  Don't you want more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not hungry, you bastard.\"  The vixen tried focusing on a brick in the wall, preparing for the bony fingers to press into her white stomach again.  But instead of pressure, the vixen nearly doubled over, an immense hunger pang hitting her as her knees buckled slightly, groaning loudly.  She suddenly felt like she hadn't eaten for days, and at the risk of looking stupid, she lunged for the roll in the man's hand, snatching it up greedily, her cheeks bulging once more as icing dripped down her lips, the treat disappearing with a big gulp, sending that fattening food right down into her belly as it gurgled and growled for more.  \"Gimme another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear.\"  The hooded man lifted his palms, the remainder of the pastries rising into the air before the vixen's maw, jamming themselves inside while Lucille held her mouth open, salivating as she messily started to bite through each and every one.  Every mouthful became a lump in her throat, traveling downward to settle in that tummy that was proving to be not so very thin anymore.  Whatever magics the man had worked on the ranger, whatever potions brewed into those gooey treats, she was starting to fill out instantly while she ate.  A deep belch made her belly jiggle, the stomach having curved outward into a doughy dome of flesh, with pudge all over making her breasts fuller and heavy, not to mention making her thighs and butt nice and soft to the touch.  That touch was first experienced by that hooded man, leaning in close to the vixen as she gorged, taking big handfuls of an ever-expanding ass as Lucille's belly wobbled more and more, brushing into the man's robes as two hefty rolls of fox gut began to form, dimpling in along the line of the fox's navel.  \"Such a good girl.  You show much promise, my dear.\"  Another teasing chuckle came from that hood as Lucille snarfed down the last of the pastries, panting after swallowing it down.  The poor girl had to be at least three hundred pounds, sporting chubby cheeks and a double chin smattered with warm icing, and a bloated body with breasts approaching the size of her head.  Those gnarled hands trailed upward along the vixen's form, taking a squeeze of her love handles, jiggling her tummy, and taking a few firm gropes of sensitive breastflesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aah... stop... please...\"  The vixen pleaded, her hunger having subsided, replaced by the shame of being reduced to such gluttony, not to mention being aroused by the freak in the robes handling her tits.  It was simply pointless, fighting that urge when her body was so warm, soft, laden with fat and skin stretched to being sensitive about just any touch.  Her nethers became moist as the gnarled hands tweaked her pink nipples slightly, a moan escaping her messy maw as she looked into the hood, finding a long tongue snaking towards her lips from the void, licking at the icing upon her lips, the hooded figure obviously taking pleasure in feeling the vixen's shaky, warm breath upon his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall stop if you can honestly tell me you want me to.\"  When the figure's reply was only a blushing, chubby vixen looking bashfully back at him, that long tongue surged forward along with the rest of him, tightly pinning the flabby foxy against the wall.  That slimy muscle wrapped around Lucille's tongue, filling her maw and snaking down her throat, her eyes half-lidding at the overwhelming lust radiating from the man, the darkness of his hood taking over her vision before she eventually woke.<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nAs the vulpine finished recounting her tale, she rubbed at her arm underneath her cloak, while her friend the wolfess sat with wide eyes, still digesting that tale of rapid digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am not sure of this dream's meaning, but... perhaps it is best you come to terms with the fact that you enjoyed it.\"  Rose said, sliding closer to the ranger and putting a comforting hand upon her thigh.  \"Perhaps you need a holiday.  Time to clear your head and perhaps indulge a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's very kind, but you know we can't afford any lost time.  I'd rather find this book and make a clean profit, not have some creepy old man stuff my face.\"  Lucille smirked, and Rose laughed softly, rising to her feet and helping the vixen to hers.  They began walking to their next destination, an old stone fortress in the distance, worn with time and apparently abandoned.  Along the way, Lucille couldn't help but dwell on her dream.  She couldn't seem to decide if she liked it or not.  Being so fat and helpless... she didn't even know if the feeling of gaining that much weight would be as good in the dream as reality.  Then again, the pleasure -was- convincing.  She eventually decided that...</span></div></div>",

She is sultry, sarcastic and can easily become bored by down time. Sleep is her favorite pastime. Some describe her as carefree. Veradelia has a natural pear-shaped body toned with no visible fat. Most of the time her dark, thick hair hangs at a medium length just above her shoulders. Veradelia stands at a modest height of five feet even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Laeryn</u>: Laeryn is an elven female ranger, and specializes in survival tactics. Her weapon of choice is her longbow, which she wields with deadly accuracy. She is reserved and almost always serious. Her comrades see her as a stick in the mud, but they know she is the most logical and will usually follow her advice. This elf has a naturally slender hourglass body with slight bust and hips. She keeps her blonde hair tied up in a high ponytail, and she has pale skin. Laeryn stands at an average height of five and a half feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Gwendi</u>: Gwendi is a halfling rogue who specializes in pickpocketing, lockpicking, and general sneakiness. Most of the time she is skittish and shy, but has a certain curiosity toward most things around her. One might confuse her stature and size with innocence, but as a thief she is hardly so. This little halfling has tanned, freckled skin and she likes to keep her scarlet hair in two short, low pigtails. Although quite thin, Gwendi has somewhat of an apple-shaped body, with no obvious disparity between her waistline and hips. She is obviously the shortest member of the party standing at barely above three feet. Speaking of feet, hers are NOT hairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Thrakka</u>: The team's orcish barbarian lass lives to fight and never backs down. Hotheaded, the others often have to ease her down during arguments. Drinking is her favorite pastime after fighting. Grakka is heavily muscled, looking much like a statuesque amazonian woman. Her skin is dark green, and her head is shaved. She stands at six and a half feet, making her the tallest member of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSETTING:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first scene begins with the quartet of adventuring ladies all meeting up in a tavern, the most original of fantasy beginnings. Each has heard bits and pieces regarding a valuable treasure trove within the craggy canyons to the east, and each has their own reason for pursuing the treasure. However, their interest has not gone unnoticed. The Lipomancer has sent his own forces against these women to prevent them from stealing his treasure and perhaps capturing them as the newest members of his collection...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun rose over a small tavern at the edge of civilization. Wit's End, a tavern whose name could only chosen by a man who laughed at his own jokes, was the last place a would be adventurer could get a warm meal and a warm bed for the evening before they entered into the uncharted territory of the Eastern Scars, a series of bleak canyons that seemed to go on endlessly. You might think such a barren land would be as uninviting as it was hostile; but you'd be completely wrong, for the Eastern Scars were shrouded in so much myth and lore that any adventurer worth their salt would have to go there before they died. Rumors of lost civilizations, caves of diamond and sapphire, and the gold of a thousand kings, all were rumored to be waiting for the first person to find them; so long as they were willing to explore farther into the scars than any man or woman before. It was for these rumors and more that Wit's End had recently become the main base of operations for adventurers from all across the land. During a busy day, parties a dozen strong would be formed of absolute strangers and they'd be marching on the Scars by nightfall. Today, however, only four people of interest sat at the meeting table, and it is with these four heroines that our story begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meticulous elf Laeryn studied the adventuring contract she had drawn up, reading off the terms of agreement that the four of them had just negotiated for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...On today, the 13th day of the summer season, the following stipulations have been agreed upon by the present company: 1. Treasure, in the form of gold, silver, and copper coins, precious and semi-precious stones, and other treasures valuable but otherwise mundane, shall be split by the present company evenly. 2. Artifacts of the arcane that are non-Eleven in nature shall be awarded to the present sorceress. 3. Artifacts that are discovered to be of Eleven craft, particularly those of the long deceased native elf Kingdom that once was based in the Scars, shall be awarded to I, the original writer of this contract. All small-sized weapons, equipment, and other tools, as well as any item that is decided on as being a \"Collector's\" item that is non-Eleven in nature shall be awarded to the present rogue. Lastly, any weapons of considerable strength and other battle gear fit for one who might be considered \"The strongest in the lands\", shall be awarded to the present barbarian. Are there any objections to the agreed upon terms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf looked up from the long scroll to see that the rest of the company had long since found other things to pass their time. Veradelia the sorceress had fallen asleep where she sat, head resting on top of an open tome of considerable size, Gwendi the rogue had busied herself inspecting her \"lucky\" dice to ensure that they matched the exact weight and shape of the tavern's set, and Thrakka the barbarian was currently ordering yet another tankard of the strongest ale the tavern had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And make it a big one this time! Or I think I might just help myself to the tap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-yes your hugeness... (Don't squish me!) \"The serving imp stuttered before hurriedly flying off on its red bat wings. Laeryn glared at the imp. It was odd enough to see one working in a respectable establishment; but what was even more peculiar was that the little winged creature was so tubby that she was astonished it could still fly. Clad in strips of cloth that were barely enough to cover its naughty bits, the imp's stomach was so swollen with fat that it jiggled with every push of its wings. Coupled with its considerable cleavage, Laeryn wondered if the infernal creature was even aware it had feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to the matter at hand, the ranger calmly banged her glass against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halfling tensed up momentarily at the sudden sound before placing her dice back in her equipment bag and snapped to attention, while the sorceress merely turned her head slightly so that one of her eyes could lazily look at the elf through several strands of her dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we ready to go yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly, I was just reading off the terms of our agreement again and was asking if there were any objections before we began?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" Veradelia muttered as she forced herself back into a seating position, an imprint of the page's incantations dug slightly into her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Sounds good!\" Gwendi nodded in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, the three of you look like your up to the challenge!\" Thrakka said with a wide toothy grin, downing her latest drink in mere moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, it seems as though we are in agreement. I look forward to our time working together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Laeryn rolled up the parchment she had drawn the contract out on and slid it into a special pocket in her adventuring pack that she had selected to hold such important documents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, lets go crack some heads!\" The orc roared and sprinted out of the tavern, taking the imp waitress by surprise and causing her to drop a serving platter filled with drinks all over the tavern floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh! Er, sorry!\" The halfling quickly apologized to the imp and followed the orc out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She's going to be a handful, isn't she?\" The lone human of the group muttered to the elf as she closed her spell book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's too early to judge people on such matters.\" The Laeryn responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. So long as she directs that energy at the monsters and not at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so our heroines were united and their adventure began. With the sun at high noon and spirits high, it seemed as though these four might just have what it takes to conquer the challenges of the Scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Unfortunately someone else had plans for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imp watched as the last of the four adventurers left the inn, a wide, scheming grin growing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehe! I think those four might just be what the boss is lookin' for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quickness quite odd for her mass, the imp quickly placed a  \"closed, fuck off ya poor sods!\" sign in the window, locked the front door, and extinguished all of the lights, before flying over to a secret hatch in the back of the kitchen and throwing it open, before flying down the stairs to a secret basement containing a dark altar. The imp then took out a paintbrush and drew a seven pointed star on her stomach will all of the lines running through her navel, and then squeezed her fat stomach so that the symbol protruded further forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, a brazier on the alter became lit, and a low and commanding voice flowed into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Hectica. I trust you have great news for me?\" While powerful, the voice was also rather seductive in nature, and the imp couldn't help but turn a brighter shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You betcha! Four wannabe heroes comin' your way. There's a human, an elf, a halfling, and an orc! All thin as a bone- well, the orc's big, but its the wrong kind of big, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a momentary pause.\"Quite the selection to choose from... you've done well in bringing these four to my attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shucks...\" Hectica looked at the ground and ran a finger through her black-as-soot hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall be rewarded in the usual manner, for now stand by and await further instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" The imp saluted as the brazier went dark.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what felt too brief to be even an hour, the adventurers arrived at the first of the crags. Laeryn paused at the top of a cliff, raising one hand to veil her eyes from the afternoon sun. Below lay a scar etched into the side of the land by time and weathering, and though the drop was steep, it was not impassable. \"This looks like as good a place as any. We shall begin our descent--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To victory!\" Without warning, the orc barbarian leapt over the ledge and skidded down the steep surface like a skiing master. At the bottom of the slope she pounded her chest and beamed a fanged smile up to her companions. Laeryn could not help but palm her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's eager.\" Veradelia leaned lazily on her staff, one hand cupping a soft yawn. \"Any other ideas, elf?\" She gazed at Laeryn through half-closed eyes. Clearly, staying awake was its own struggle for the human woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We shall climb.\" Delaying no further, Laeryn dropped to a knee and reached into her highly organized traveling pack to procure a length of rope. She unwound the thick climbing equipment and fastened it to a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, nifty!\" Gwendi unbuckled her small belt, but her pants remained in place. She looped it over the rope and held fast as she zipped down after Thrakka, landing gracefully at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only the elf and the human remaining, they gave each other a slight shrug, and Laeyrn mimicked the rogue's hasty entrance. However, she underestimated her own weight and acceleration and landed at the bottom in a heap, much to the enjoyment of her comrades. Veradelia blinked listlessly at the humiliated elf, and shook her head lightly. \"I don't think so...\" Scarcely lifting her arm, she tapped the tip of her staff to the cliff, surging forth a small burst of magic. In a succession of loud thuds, the cliff face shot out in blocks, forming a crude, but navigable staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowzers!\" Gwendi commended her sorceress friend with a round of applause, but Thrakka and Laeryn simply scoffed at the woman's idle abuse of her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us continue.\" The elf had finished dusting herself off and once again slung her pack over her shoulder, marching into the shadow of the craggy Scar. The others followed suit, and since they were entering unknown territory, none dared speak up. Once inside, they each drew their appropriate weapons: Laeryn nocked an arrow into her longbow, Gwendi drew her miniscule daggers, and Thrakka unslung her club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slipped by  without count in the dim light of the Scar, but before long they could see torchlight ahead. Laeryn nodded to the rogue, and Gwendi scouted ahead. She reached a small hut and peeped in through the window. \"What the...\" Blinking hard, she even rubbed her eyes before scampering back to the party. \"It's a house! And someone's home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he can provide us with directions.\" Laeryn muttered and tapped a slender finger to her chin. Nodding her approval of her own plan, she shot a glance back to the others. \"Be wary, they may not be trustworthy to live out in such secret.\" Thrakka snorted and strode past the elf, bumping shoulders with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't wet your loincloth, elfy. Let me handle this.\" Before the others could stop her, the orc had already pounded on the ramshackle wooden door. Again, Laeryn facepalmed, but took this opportunity to duck behind a nearby stalagmite. Gwendi mimicked the action, but found a nice, small rock to peek around while Veradelia sighed and sauntered up beside the barbarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Who is it?\" A man's muffled voice came through the door, though it was awfully high-pitched. Thrakka pounded another fist against the wooden barrier and snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up! We have questions for you!\" Her nostrils flared wildly and the veins in her neck were beginning to pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes, at once!\" With a click the lock came undone and the door swung wide into the slightly less dim hut. \"Good day, strangers. How can I help such lovely young women?\" He was most certainly a man, but he was dressed in the most stereotypical witch's garb imaginable. A big, black pointed hat sat atop his head, and he wore a long, flowing black robe that showed off the top of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew...\" Veradelia rolled her eyes and strode into the hut past the homeowner, taking in the sights. At the far end of the hut sat a cauldron and the tables were each lined with beakers and jars full of eyeballs and toads and bat wings, everything you would imagine in a witch's home. Seeing their friends unharmed, Laeryn and Gwendi both followed, and were greeted by the manwitch. They sheathed their weapons and looked about the house with curiosity and caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Manfred. Welcome to my humble abode!\" Before his welcome was even finished, the four women had already begun snooping about, picking up jars and sniffing beakers. Laeryn placed jar of spiders back onto the shelf before looking to the manwitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salutations, Manfred. We come in search of treasure. Know you of any such troves within this Scar?\" Her arms folded across her chest, and she gazed into the man's dull, tired eyes. He wasn't old, per say, but he must have been at least middle-aged. Manfred stroked his beard before offering a single nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You must be looking for the Golden Hoard! It is said to be a mountain of wealth and cultural artifacts numbered beyond imagining.\" His wide smile was equally eerie and calming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snap! That sounds great!\" Gwendi was hopping up and down with excitement, and Veradelia simply rested a hand on her head to steady the little rogue. Thrakka had found a coat rack and was now taking practice swings as if it were a battleaxe. Even Laeryn's eyes lit up at the description, and she nodded eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us, do you know where we can find this Golden Hoard? Rather, can you point us in the direction to begin?\" The elf closed the distance between herself and the manwitch, and Manfred nodded, though his face shrank into a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though there are many monsters and evil creatures who guard the treasure. It is their duty to protect it from outsiders.\" Laeryn took a step back, concern furrowing her brow. Gwendi hid behind the sorceress and her knees shook. Thrakka grinned with ferocity and tossed the coat rack over her shoulder. \"Yes, they are most terrifying horrors who serve an even more <i>terrifying</i> master!\" Manfred nodded fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure know a lot about these beasties for some old coot living in a shack.\" Thrakka frowned and her nostrils flared again, sniffing the air like a hound. It was then that the expression on Manfred's face shifted from concern to madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course! I am Manfred the Manwitch, servant of the master!\" With that, he shot forth his arm, launching a bolt of purple energy toward Thrakka. The orc barbarian had anticipated treachery, and easily dove out of the way. Lazy Veradelia, however, was not prepared and took the blast in a direct hit. She fell back, tripping over Gwendi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaeryn, who no longer had her bow at the ready, rushed forward and slugged the manwitch with a right hook, knocking him back into his workbench. Gwendi rushed to Veradelia's side and shook the sorceress from her unconsciousness. \"Hey! You okay?!\" The sorceress pushed her aside and rubbed her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a little dizzy.\" Meanwhile, Thrakka let out a bellowing roar as she once more hefted up the coat rack to assail the manwitch. Laeryn widened the gap and unslung her bow, nocking an arrow in an instant. She took aim and pulled back the string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha! You're doomed! You're all doomed!\" The manwitch seized a nearby jar filled with yellow liquid and crashed it to his feet. As soon as it touched air, the liquid ignited, setting Manfred and half of the house ablaze. Thrakka threw Gwendi and Veradelia over her shoulders and barreled out the door. Laeryn watched in horror as the man collapsed into a burning heap, still cackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ELF!\" Thrakka's shout shook Laeryn from her horror, and the ranger fled the hut just as the roof caved in. The roaring flames illuminated deeper into the Scar, revealing a small altar some distance away. With everyone back on their feet, Laeryn cautiously approached the ritualistic platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veradelia, what do you make of this?\" The sorceress sluggishly sauntered up beside the elf and peered over the altar. She knelt over it, examining the wooden bowls of food and one filled with paint and a paintbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a ritual, but I don't know this magic.\" The sorceress rose to her feet and offered a slight shrug. This was immediately followed up by a long growl from her stomach. Her eyes widened beyond half-closed, and she rubbed a hand over her flat tummy. \"Huh, guess I'm hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had thought you ate something when we set out on our quest.\" Laeryn raised a curious brow, but was only met with a nod and another shrug from the sorceress. As the human waltzed by, Laeryn could have sworn the sorceress' backside looked a little rounder than usual. Perhaps it was just a trick of the firelight. She turned back to the party and nodded once. \"We know our prize. Let us set out on this grand quest for the Golden Hoard.\" Gwendi and Thrakka cheered at this, and Veradelia simply rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more our heroines set forth toward the canyon to pursue the next chapter in their adventure!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No sooner than the quartet had ventured back into the daylight, Veradelia's stomach resounded its hunger once again. Thrakka halted her marching and turned to the trailing sorceress, offering the human a chuckle. \"Your stomach has a better battle roar than most orc warriors!\" She snorted heartily and continued onward. Laeryn just shook her head and followed, but Gwendi tugged on the sorceress' robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Veevee?\" Gwendi furrowed her little brows and folded her arms across her chest. Veradelia sighed and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm real hungry.\" Her gaze lifted and settled on the two backs to her. \"Can we stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop? We just got started!\" Thrakka growled. Laeryn raised a hand and approached the sorceress with a nod. \"I didn't even get to kill anything yet!\" The orc grumbled but complied, joining the others to set up a temporary rest station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but if we are not at full strength then we cannot defeat the monsters of which Manfred spoke.\" Laeryn turned to Veradelia and gestured for her and Gwendi to sit. Thrakka only gnashed her teeth again, planting her strong hands on her chiseled hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>always</i> at full strength!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet our party is not. We must be cautious in the Scars to come.\" Laeryn opened her pack and procured a loaf of elven spice bread and an apple. She offered both to the sorceress, and Veradelia took them with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Besides, it's lunch time.\" Indeed, the sun hung high at noon, and the entire group agreed this would be the best time for all of them to eat. Veradelia ate the bread and apple, Laeryn gnawed on a carrot, Gwendi ate a handful of berries which was more than enough to fill her small stomach, and Thrakka chewed on a large hunk of dried meat. After all had been finished, they began to pack their belongings, but something odd happened. \"Ouch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Gwendi tilted her head and approached the human woman, and Veradelia clamped both hands to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like my robe shrunk. Might be the heat.\" However, her eyes went wide when her hands met her flanks. There was certainly a bit of padding there that she did not recognize. In fact, as her fingers coursed around the curve of her already generous hips, the usual toned muscle seemed to be masked by a thin layer of softness. It was subtle, but the human woman could definitely feel some flab that hadn't been there before. It felt like she must have put on only a few pounds, but when? How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrunk? I doubt it. This is what happens when you're so lazy, witch! You get fat!\" Thrakka cackled and slapped a hand to her wall of abs. Laeryn shot the orc a scowl and inched closer to the sorceress, still sitting on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm lazy, but I don't eat that much! I take care of myself!\" Veradelia pouted, pinching at her somewhat-less-toned rump. Laeryn eyed the woman up and down and stroked her chin in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps this is the work of the manwitch. Were you not struck with some manner of spell during our conflict?\" The elf continued her pondering posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You don't think...\" Veradelia gulped and gnawed at her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cannot say just yet, but we must be wary. If you are in fact cursed, we may encounter a cure during our journeys.\" Laeryn offered the sorceress a reassuring smile, but deep down she really didn't want to turn back. If one mere human had to gain a little weight in order for Laeryn to reclaim her family's treasure, it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get moving now? My swinging arm is getting flabby.\" Thrakka glanced at Veradelia, but the sorceress replied with a dagger stare. \"Erm... sorry.\" The orc chuckled quietly and rose to her feet. She was followed by Gwendi and Laeryn. The elf nodded and looked east.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm ready!\" Gwendi threw some air jabs, hopping from one foot to the other in a boxing stance. Veradelia sighed and pushed herself to her feet with a tiny bit more effort than she would <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the noble quest continued until the party arrived at another crag, but this Scar was not deep. The only thing in this pocket of a crag was an old stone ring etched with runes. The four adventurers approached cautiously, and Veradelia sauntered to the front. \"These runes are the same as the altar.\" She lazily brushed a strand of hair from her face and stared blankly at the stone sculpture, eyeing the moss and lichen growing along its edges. \"Looks pretty old to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, eagle eyes.\" Thrakka cleared her throat and spit on the ground. \"Looks like a door.\" She wrinkled her nose with a sniff. \"A magic door.\" Veradelia smirked at this and ran her fingers along the runes before looking back to the orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a clever one.\" However, her sarcasm was lost on the orc as Thrakka only puffed up her chest with pride at this subversive insult. The sorceress frowned as she continued to trace her lithe fingers within the runes, but there was no effect nor any sign of latent magic. \"I don't think we'll get anything out of this.\" She dropped her hand and turned to the group. They all shrugged to one another and continued along the winding cliffside path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the investigation of the circle was fruitless, the runes did in fact begin to glow after they had marched out of sight. A pale purple light coalesced at the ring's center, and soon the portal shimmered brilliantly. In a flash the light faded as quickly as it came, but at the center of the tall ring hunched a female goblin. Much like Hectica, this short creature sported a bloated belly and heaving bust balanced out by her thick thighs and shelf of an ass. Though her belly bulged out to her knees, she leapt off the platform with all the grace and skill of one a third her weight. \"I won't fail you again, master!\" She hissed and slipped around the corner, pursuing the party of adventurers further into the canyon of Scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is this mysterious interloper? What are her motives? And just what the hell is in store for Veradelia's badonkadonk? Stay tuned for the next expansive episode of \"Curse of the Lipomancer!\"</span></div></div>",

She curled her lips to the side and gave an exaggerated shrug. \"No one's home. Buuuut--\" She twirled a set of keys around her finger, winking to her comrades. \"I found a way inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work, pipsqueak.\" Thrakka petted the rogue's scarlet head, to which she flailed away. The orc just laughed in response. Her toothy grin flashed wide as she again glanced back to the Scar. Two massive doors were carved into the rock itself, leading into what the orc presumed must be some sort of dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how ever did you find those so quickly?\" Laeryn knelt down to inspect the old, metal keys, but Gwendi snatched them into her tiny fist before the elf could touch them. Laeryn huffed and stood tall again, folding her arms across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, found them under a doormat.\" Gwendi giggled lightly and gave another shrug, digging the toe of her boot into the dust. Veradelia sighed and rolled her eyes, leaning on her staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we <i>please</i> get out of this hot sun? I'm starting to sweat.\" The sorceress sighed again, leisurely fanning herself with her free hand. Laeryn nodded at this, and signaled to the door. \"Goody.\" Veradelia tapped her staff twice on the ground and marched at the rear. Speaking of, she now noticed she had to occasionally pull her robes down around her own rear as it caused them to gradually bunch up. \"The elf better be right about that cure...\" she muttered beneath her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the door, Gwendi unlocked the door with a boost up from Thrakka, but when the door wouldn't budge, the group stepped back while Thrakka barged it open with her shoulder. \"Looks like you <i>are</i> good for more than just diving out of the way.\" Veradelia smirked at her remark, pulled her hair behind an ear and sauntered past the winded orc. Thrakka stifled a growl, and at last the group was inside. Unlike Manfred's cave, however, there was little to no light within the dark corridors. Veradelia tapped her staff twice and uttered a word of power, illuminating the head of her magical walking stick. It was bright enough to light their path without blinding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carved, stone stairwell inside was another matter, and although Gwendi was light on her feet, her pace was slow. One missed step could be the death of them. As they proceeded further and further down the seemingly endless stairs, Veradelia yawned one time too many. \"Will you stop that?!\" Thrakka growled, gripping her club tightly in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help it, darkness makes me sleepy.\" The sorceress again cupped her mouth to yawn, almost missing the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything makes you sleepy!\" The orc bounced the shaft of her club up and down on her shoulder to help calm her nerves, but she still hissed and grumbled with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two wish to attract whatever may be lurking in the darkness, then by all means continue,\" Laeryn interrupted. Both arguing women sighed and fell into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Gwendi gasped and pointed ahead. \"The stairs end! We're at the bottom!\" She beamed a pearly smile and hopped down the last step onto the platform. The others glanced about as the magelight spell lit up the circular platform. A deep, almost bottomless pit stretched down around the walkway, and it looked like the path split into four directions from the center circle. One going north, one south, one east, and one west. Each direction faded into darkness. \"Drats! How are we supposed to see where we're going? Only Veevee has any light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not, for I was wise enough to bring torches.\" Laeryn reached into her tidy pack and procured four torches. She lit each and handed them off to the group. Upon offering one to Veradelia, the sorceress just stared blankly at the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm set.\" She wiggled the staff in her hands for emphasis, but Laeryn shook her head, again holding out the lit torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be wise to conserve your energy in the even we encounter any foes.\" The elf nodded again, and finally Veradelia double tapped her staff followed by another word of power. The light dwindled, and she accepted the torch. Their faces shone orange in the torchlight, and each looked in an opposite direction: Laeryn east, Thrakka west, Gwendi north, and Veradelia south. \"Our torches should last us several hours time. We should meet back here before they run out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are we supposed to tell time underground?\" Thrakka snorted and lowered her torch, staring at the elf. However, it was the human woman who then rummaged through her own pouch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can help with that. Hold out your torches.\" Each woman held their torches together like the three musketeers, and Veradelia sprinkled powder over each. The flames sparked and fizzled before changing hue to a bright blue. \"There. When the fire is orange again, turn back.\" The other members smiled with approval, and Thrakka even landed a meaty palm on the sorceress' shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got skill, rump roast.\" She flashed a green-lidded wink to the human as Veradelia clenched her teeth. Although she wanted to smack the orc, she knew it was intended to lighten the fear now sinking into each of their stomachs. \"Let's do this.\" Each woman nodded in unison and strode toward their respective direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a low creaking echoed from above, and a pillar of stone fell from the ceiling, smashing the central platform to smithereens. All four women stared in shock at the now vacant chasm between them. They could still see one another, but there was no way to bridge the distance between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are all of you unharmed?\" Laeryn coughed as the dust began to settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" \"Yep!\" \"Mhm.\" Thrakka, Gwendi, and Veradelia responded respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must press onward, we will meet up deeper in the tunnels.\" Laeryn gripped the strap of her backpack tightly and chewed her lip. She may not have had any deep connection to any of the others, but she did care about them and knew she couldn't succeed without teamwork. All she could do now was hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the adventurers continued forth, deep into the unknown darkness. But what they had not realized was that their choice in direction was their own undoing! For each direction determined how they were to be horrifically transformed!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no way to turn back, Gwendi swallowed hard and scuttled onward, her scarlet pigtails bouncing with each step. The path curved side to side before coming to a small set of doors. Strange, she thought, they looked almost built for a halfling. As she approached, the rogue padded lightly to avoid making any unnecessary sounds. With an ear to the door, she could hear the whir of machinery within. Machinery? In an abandoned dungeon? Gwendi paused and chewed her lip while mulling over her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't go back...\" She gave herself a terse nod and pushed the door open with a quiet grunt. Immediately she was bathed in the pale, purple light of the room. Her eyes darted to the torch in hand, and she decided to rest it in one of the sconces outside the door. \"Still blue!\" She squeaked with a small smile and slipped into the dim, violet room. The inside of the room, however, left her slack-jawed. The chamber was <i>huge</i>! The ceiling rose at least twenty feet, and the far wall was easily another fifty away. Gwendi glanced about the room, examining the contents. She could see a table at the center with leather straps and several hinges and joints across the tabletop. Very strange. Her eyes floated upward, and she caught sight of a strange metal machine with tubes and pumps all leading back to a wall-mounted container. Gwendi rose from her crouched, stealthy stance and padded over to the massive barrel. The twin tube lines ended inside the transparent container, and from what she could see, it appeared to be some sort of thick, inky serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creepy.\" She shuddered at the thought of what vile purposes the device held. Turning about, Gwendi noticed another table against the opposite wall. Unable to see the top, she zipped around the thrumming room in search of a stepstool. Upon finding a small, wooden chair, the halfling grunted and pushed it along the floor, stopping just in front of the table. \"What the...\" Atop the table were dozens of needles and vials of various potions and elixirs. No two elixirs shared the same color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door on the far end of the room gave a thud as its lock opened, and in a dash the tiny rogue flew behind one of the many cabinets littering the room. Peeping out, she watched as an absurdly fat gnoll waddled into the chamber. Although most gnolls' gender is ambiguous, Gwendi had no difficulty determining the sex of this particular beast. The hyena woman stood at a solid five feet, but her flabby gut poofed out at least half a foot in front of her. Yet this was still not the most disturbing abnormality to her. Two huge, sagging teats hung from her chest, swaying down around her knees like a pair of empty leather bags. It looked like she must have been drained dry of whatever milk she carried, and Gwendi could see thick, black veins weaving across the surface of her breasts. They were disgusting, obscene bags of flesh, and the halfling couldn't help but shudder at the thought of carrying those around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet the trouble was only beginning, for the hyena began sniffing about, scowling toward the vile black liquid barrel. Gwendi's scent! This gnoll was going to find her if she didn't make a move quick. Hands on her daggers, Gwendi scampered around the perimeter of the room, trying to stay out of sight, and hopefully out of smell. But the poor rogue was not always the luckiest of lassies, and her boot knocked into a small, discarded gear, scraping it aside and into the wall with a thud. She clenched her teeth and cursed beneath her breath. \"Phooey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gnoll yelped and thundered towards her direction, flopping her pendulous breasts side to side, her gut wobbling like a bowl of jelly. One furry paw held aloft a wooden club, and Gwendi dove backwards as the hyena girl crashed into the pile of boxes. \"Where are you, little one? Where are you hiding?\" The gnoll sniffed again and tossed another crate out of the way, revealing the armed and battle-ready halfling. Although she was only half the hyena's size, Gwendi furrowed her brow and held up her daggers. \"Misha will take good care of you, little one. Misha obeys the master! Little one will obey too!\" The gnoll howled and lunged at the halfling, and although Gwendi dodged the club, one of Misha's udders smacked into her face, bludgeoning the poor girl off her feet. Towering over her, the gnoll grinned wickedly and pointed the club at the rogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Gwendi saw her opportunity: she could stay and fight the gnoll, risking her life, or she could run for the far door and hope it locked behind her. Although a direct conflict would be risky, the crazed hyena woman could possibly provide information leading to Gwendi's escape from this nightmarish dungeon. No time to think!</span></div></div>",

She leapt at the hyena woman's back, daggers pointed toward her foe, but Misha was a clever fighter, and whirled about, bludgeoning the brunt of the club into Gwendi's middle, knocking her out of the air. The halfling crashed into a pile of empty boxes, losing her daggers mid-flight. Cackling madly, the gnoll charged after her, snatching Gwendi by the foot before she could react. Unarmed and suspended upside, the little rogue was running out of options fast. Maybe running away would have been a better idea after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little one fiesty! Little one jumpy jump! Mama Misha will calm you down good!\" Gwendi went wide-eyed as the brutish, buxom gnoll bashed the pommel of the club across the rogue's head, knocking her out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey, wakey, little one!\" The screeching cackle roused Gwendi from her slumber, and her current predicament set her fully awake. She was strapped to the strange hinged table, and suspended at a steep incline, leaning back only slightly. \"Master has good plans for you, little one! Misha take care of you now! Make you better! Make you pretty!\" Pretty? Coming from a gnoll, that didn't sound good. The halfling's eyes darted toward a rack of sharp, torture devices and back to the gnoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme go, you big furry meanie!\" Gwendi thrashed at her bindings, but her petite frame hardly budged the thick leather binding her wrists, ankles, and waist. The hyena cackled again and reached out, wriggling her claws in front of the rogue's leather vest. \"H-Hey... what are you doing?\" Without a word, the gnoll gripped the material at her chest and tore it away with her sharp claws. Gwendi flushed a deep red as her flat chest was now completely exposed to the warm, damp air of the chamber. \"S-Stop that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You will be pretty! Misha will shape you for the master!\" The hyena tossed the scrap leather aside and turned to organize her tools. Gwendi shut her eyes tightly as the sound of clinking metal tools were organized into a small dish, and she made no move to open them when the gnoll returned. \"You will watch!\" The halfling shook her head defiantly. \"You will watch or Misha cut off eyelids!\" Gwendi whimpered and opened her eyes, now more curious than anything. Odd, instead of knives and hooks the platter only contained two small, metal needles. \"Good little one!\" Resting the platter to the side, Misha took hold of one of the needles and pointed it up. She flicked the glass with her claws and squirted out a spritz of purple serum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you gonna do to me? What is that stuff?!\" Gwendi knitted her brows nervously, and the hyena flashed a wicked fanged grin in response. One clawed paw pressed to the halfling's chest, stabilizing the base of where her breast would be, if she had any. The other paw pressed the needle's tip to the underside of Gwendi's bright, pink areola. \"Ouch!\" Yet Misha made no sign of stopping, and pierced the halfling's flesh, slowly pushing down the plunger on the needle, injecting the dark, purple fluid into her nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy did it hurt! The fluid rushed through the surrounding skin, sending a spark of unnatural heat across the whole nipple. Gwendi could feel the nipple pulse and throb with the inflammation, but before she could even grow accustomed to it, Misha injected her potion into the other nipple, again underneath the base of her areola. Combined, the sensation was unbearably painful. Gwendi's eyes filled with tears, but finally the pain subsided, descending into a constant, dull ache, throbbing with the beat of her quick little heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halfling finally opened her eyes after the wall of pain and looked at her inflamed nipples. What the?! They were purple! A moment ago she had adorable, flat pink nipples, and now she was staring at twin, puffy purple gumdrops sticking out of her flat chest. \"Change them back!\" The tears now streamed down her cheek, and Misha only cackled as she reached overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just warming up! Little one still need prettying!\" The gnoll grabbed the twin tubes from the ceiling and brought them down to eye level. At this range it was obvious that each had a suction cup with some sort of rubber tip at its center. Not giving another moment of protest, the hyena woman pressed the cups against Gwendi's flat chest. The poor halfling could feel those strange rubber tips touching her nips, and with another push they started parting her puffed up purple nipples. Oh no, the gnoll intended to nipplefuck her with these things! Gwendi thrashed again and clenched her teeth, but the larger bosomed furry woman won out. Both tips slipped inside Gwendi's nipples, eliciting a small shriek from the bound halfling. \"Good! Machine ready for pretty time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The halfling followed the tubes upward and to the side, gasping as she realized what they were attached to. The black ichor. That vile serum was now connected to the machine that was connected to Gwendi's nipples! \"No, wait--\" But it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boom boom!\" The gnoll flipped a lever on the machine, and it whirred to life. Metallic whining signaled the halfling of the increasing suction, and she stared in horror as the black sludge slowly climbed up into the tubes, inching its way along the ceiling. Each pump made it crawl forward another inch, and the waiting alone was enough to send  the halfling into a fit of stifled whimpers. Directly overhead, the sludge now crawled inch by inch down the tubes, closer and closer to the pair of suckers attached to Gwend's nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Don't do this!\" The halfling pleaded at the last moment, but it was all futile. The gnoll cackled and danced in place as the black ichor passed into the rubber tips, bulging inside Gwendi's poor, puffy nipples before erupting their contents into her underdeveloped milk ducts. She could have compared the pain to the initial nipple penetration, but different. While not as sharp, the displacement of the ichor inside her left her feeling woozy. Each pump poured another few spurts inside, and within moments the change became visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwendi's flat chest began to alter, gaining a slight curve as her breasts incrimentally developed. Due to the slow pace of the pump, each surge only showed meager growth, even on her whip-thin frame. And still, she had already reached a pair of AA cup breasts, comparative to her size, of course. Through clenched teeth, she could only watch in horror as her chest continued to swell, throbbing with each spurt as it seemed to speed up proportional to her size, always making a barely visible change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working, working! Little one will be pretty soon!\" The gnoll wrung her hands and leaned in, watching as the halflings breasts reached a B cup and showed no sign of slowing. Sweat drenched Gwendi's entire body as the wicked ichor pumped more and more into her body, sending waves of heat down her nerves. In a struggle to turn her head, the rogue whimpered as she beheld the canister of the vile serum, the process had barely put a dent in it. \"Bah! Too slow! Pretty faster!\" Misha turned a dial, and the pumps doubled in speed, clamping around Gwendi's sensitive nips as they forced vaster quantities of the foul liquid into her body. Her B cups became C's, and she wailed in agony at the building pressure. She watched her formerly flat chest wobble and jostle under the assault of the pumps, and as she surpassed the equivalent of a DD sized breast, a new change took hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwendi ceased her whimpering as small, dark lines began forming across the surface of her breasts. What could possibly be happening now?! Misha noticed this too, and leaned in to prod one of the jiggling tits with her furry paw. Another wide grin spread across her face, and the villainous hyena stood upright and raced to the dial again. \"Now you feel good! Best part! Best part! Boom boom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the turn of the dial, the speed doubled again, and Gwendi groaned as the pressure reached an all-time high. Her tear-filled eyes gazed in horror at the newest transformation. With a pair of G cup breasts jiggling and oscillating beneath the invading inflation, strange lumps formed around the edges of the suction cups. And then the realization struck her. Gwendi turned her gaze from her own bloating bosom to the sagging teats of her captor, particularly the thick, risen black veins that coursed along their surface. The halfling darted her vision back down to her own chest and watched in sheer disgust as the same effect began to befall her own distorted breasts. Her HH tits swung back and forth in rhythm with the suckers, and those lumps darkened to a faint black beneath her tanned skin, inching their way outward from the nipple penetration, marring lines in fractal veins along her udders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation was bizarre to say the least, but this stretching and corrupting of her breasts' blood vessels sent a warmth into the pit of her stomach. It was a relaxing sensation, almost one of pleasure... and it only continued sinking deeper before it finally nestled into the folds of her nethers, instantly slicking them with her juices. By all that was holy, the pleasure was out of this world! Gwendi had never been with a male before, but even her alone time never satisfied her womanly urges as this twisted macabre transformation had. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth and her eyes rolled back in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ecstasy passed, the very sweaty rogue gazed down over her body and sobered instantly. The machine had finally finished emptying its contents into her body, and the damage was unbelievable. Her pair of marbled, veiny tits hung like overfilled wineskins and reached down to her knees. They must have equaled half her weight together, and she only whimpered as the gnoll clapped with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So pretty! Master will be happy!\" Gwendi did not share the sentiments, letitng out a defeated wail into the dark...</span></div></div>",

The longer this long, empty walk went on, the more agitated the orc felt. Of course, she had no fear that she could strike down any monster that might call this wretched place home. However, to fall victim to some two-bit trap- or worse, some sort of <i>illusion</i>, would be too much for her pride to bear. She needed to find the others again so she could leave dealing with such things to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high pitched screech of pain echoed throughout the ancient halls. With her battle-honed ears, she instantly identified the cry as belonging to her shortest companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little one is in trouble!\" Thrakka bellowed out a war cry and began sprinting down the tunnel. Not even bothering to use the torch to light her path anymore, the orc ran through the darkness overcome with pure anger, crushing any refuse that lay scattered on the cold floor. Despite sprinting for far longer than any human man could manage however, the barbarian still seemed no closer to finding her companion. As the weight of her body finally stopped her momentum, the orc cried out in anger, slamming her club against the nearest wall repeatedly. After the third or fourth swing, Thrakka regained her focus enough to realize that small streams of light were beginning to flow through the cracks in the wall she had formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Smashing really does solve everything!\" The orc smiled widely as she continued demolishing the wall. \"Hang on, little one. I'm coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the old tunnel wall was reduced to dust, Thrakka stepped into the source of the incoming light and found herself in what appeared to be a huge vaulted room with old nordic style runes carved into the walls. In the center of the room was a table that was hundreds of feet long, covered in all matter of meats, breads, cheeses, and most importantly-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ale!\" Thrakka wasted no time in running over to the nearest section of table and downing two tankards at once, before casually tossing the metal cups behind her and letting out a belch of air loud enough to shake some of the lighter morsels of food and drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... jus' what I needed! Why can't more dungeons have free drinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, this isn't a dungeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thrakka tensed up at the unfamiliar voice, and turned her head to face the eastern end of the table. There sat the corpulent figure of a platinum blonde valkyrie consuming what looked to be the cooked remains of an entire caribou. Her plate armor was completely exposed at the waist, with a prominent two-rolled stomach extending a few inches on top of her lap. All along her sides and thighs there were parts of her armor that seemed to be straining to contain her pale flesh, as if her expanding form was threatening to push the armor off of her body entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Then what is it?\" The barbarian asked as she walked along the table towards the barely armored figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My home, and soon to be your's as well.\" The figure tore off half of the beasts rib cage and began consuming the cooked meat between the bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I don't want to live underground in some dingy tunnel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this the valkyrie paused her feast and stood up from her seat to face the orc woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that you have no choice in the matter. Destiny has brought you into the hold of the Master, your place was always meant to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Load of shit, that is!\" Thrakka brought her club to bear and bounced it against her metal boot. \"How about this one: Its your destiny to show me where my friends are and how to get out of this damn place or I'll dent that armor far more than what your fat ass is doing to it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you challenging me to a fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm challenging you to move your fat hands for something more than stuffin' your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" The valkyrie said as she retrieved a round metal shield with a seven point star painted on it and a dark metal mace. \"I am Shield Maiden Tjanare. You will come to bend to the Master's will before long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrakka roared in response and charged head on for the Shield Maiden, who sidestepped the charge and bashed the orc from the side with the front of her shield, sending her crashing into a wooden chair which broke on impact. The orc picked herself back up and charged again- only to be met with the same end result of her being bashed into some poor helpless furniture. From the ground, Thrakka grabbed a nearby chair and threw it at Tjanare, who merely braced herself and blocked it with her shield. Growling in frustration, the orc leapt to her feet and swung diagonally at her foe, only to have the blow intercepted by the solid mace and her torso receiving another full hit from the shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why!?\" The barbarian yelled as she began to swing wildly, \"Why. Can't. I. Hit. You?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is because you are weak.\" Tjanare responded as her mace expertly smashed into Thrakka's club, sending it flying out of her grip and followed it up with yet another shield bash, causing the orc to fall on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-weak?! I've slain dozens in battle- hundreds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they were also weak. Your physical form is leagues below mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Are you really saying your butterball body is doing anything for you in battle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Master's gift is powerful, and I bare it with honor.\" Tjanare moved her shield away from its defensive position, revealing a seven pointed star had been tattooed on the center of her stomach. The lines glowed with an unearthly purple tint, signifying that great magic had been used in inscribing that sigil.\"...And so shall you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To hell with that! I'm not letting some stupid warlock write all over my body and I'm sure as shit not letting my figure go for one either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Tjanare touched to fingers to her belly symbol and traced them over the identical star on her shield. \"Then it seems that this will get quite painful for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden both stars began to glow brighter, and streaks of a lightning like energy fired from the shield at Thrakka's kneeling form, causing her to fall over on her back in agony. She could feel herself getting weaker, as if the shield was stealing her very strength itself. After a minute it was over, and the orc was so fatigued she couldn't move an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now do you see your own weakness? Muscle is meaningless, only by accepting the Master's gift will you be able to know what true strength is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTjanare sheathed her mace and walked over to the caribou carcass and dropped what was left of the still warm meat on top of the orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat, your friends need you to save them.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thrakka lay in a heap, drained of all her strength. She knew that if she did not regain her might, her friends would perish. None of them were strong enough to survive this place. The savory scent of the caribou floated into her nostrils, and the floodgates released in her mouth. Pangs of hunger jolted across her chiseled middle like electric shocks. Thrakka could not remember the last time she was so hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it, fatass. I'll eat, if only to help my friends. Your master can keep his damned, dirty 'gifts' and shove it,\" the barbarian growled, snapping off one of the caribou's ribs before holding it in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much to hold back any longer, and the orc tore into the thick meat, smearing the seasoned sauce across her lips and cheeks. Her fangs ripped away at the perfectly cooked meat and it seemed to melt in her mouth. She licked her chops and each bite rekindled the fire in her body, allowing Thrakka to sit upright. Now with the roasted beast in her lap, she tore off hunks of flesh with both hands, shoveling the meat into her gnashing maw. Tjanare said nothing as she watched the ravenous orcess dismember the cooked caribou. A slight smirk played on the shield-maiden's lips, and she folded one leg over the other, leaning back into the lavishly ornamented chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, eat your fill. Let the food grant you a boon of strength,\" the Valkyrie bared her teeth in a wicked smile, plucking up a chocolate truffle from her bowl of assorted sweets. She continued, whispering beneath her breath. \"The master will be pleased with your... enthusiasm,\" Tjanare hissed a quiet, breathy laugh and popped the truffle between her crimson lips, suckling any lingering flavor from her fingers. Her free hand drummed its slender fingers atop the round mass of her twin-rolled abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrakka was lost in the bliss of the moment. She had already picked clean the caribou carcass and now hunched over the long table, devouring as much of the decadent spread as was within arm's reach. Candied fruits, salted pork, a variety of pies, and an entire loaf of buttery garlic bread had vanished within the increasing expanse of her stomach. However, the results of the indulgent escapade escaped the barbarian's awareness. She had no idea what effects the binge eating were doing to her body. Clearly enchanted with some malevolent magic, the food immediately digested into body fat, settling primarily across the orc's prided abs. No evidence of her once buff midriff remained, and a thick tire of blubber wreathed her waistline. Although the transformation was hardly an impairment to her mobility, her perfect physique was obviously ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thish ish shooooo good!\" Thrakka moaned as she all but sucked the meat off of a turkey leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo extra inches clung to her ribs and belly, masking her rock hard abdominal muscles in a layer of soft flab. The barbarian's eyes rolled back in her head as she fruitlessly attempted to sate her unending appetite. A quarter of the table had been cleared in her ravenous rampage, and every bite added more and more softness to her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yessss. Keep going, pet...\" Tjanare muttered as one of her hands slid beneath her breastplate. The other traced small circles along the inside of her thigh. Gnawing at her crimson lips, the shield-maiden sunk down into her seat, letting her hand slide farther between her thick, dimpled legs. Her womanhood was already moist at the sight of the orcess succumbing to her indulgences, and Tjanare felt it was time she succumb to her own base desires. There was no greater pleasure than witnessing the fall of a willing victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Valkyrie began to pleasure herself, Thrakka groaned in frustration. All of the food within arm's reach was gone, and she now had to lean across the table. It was then that her reach fell short, interrupted by her belly bumping up against the table edge. The impact came much sooner than the orcess had expected, and she placed a hand to her middle. Her eyes went wide, and she finally broke free from her food-induced trance. Thrakka shot her gaze downward and let out a horrified howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT?! How did I become so-- so FAT?!\" Her strong fingers gripped her potbelly, shaking it lightly. A sizable paunch squished between her grasp, jutting out five inches in every direction, leaving her with an exaggerated muffin top. The soft flesh already began to sag slightly, creasing against her leather belt. \"What did you do to me, you blubbered bitch?!\" Thrakka snarled, grabbing hold of her club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven ready for battle as she was, the barbarian continued to assess her transformed physique. Strangely enough, all of the gained weight had settled around her middle, leaving her arms and legs still as strong and toned as before. Narrowing her eyes to slits, the orc woman shot a blast of hot air from her nostrils and stamped her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? It would seem you've come to your senses,\" Tjanare smirked, rising from her seat. \"Pity, I would have loved to see you eat yourself into immobility,\" she laughed heartily and grasped her mace and shield, readying for battle. \"I'll tell you what, orc. Why don't we make a wager?\" the shield-maiden tapped the head of her mace against the face of her shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wager? Out with it, witch. I'm ready to bash your brains in,\" Thrakka growled, gripping the club tightly in both hands. Her restraint hung by a thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. If you can best me in combat, I will show you the way out of this banquet hall,\" the Valkyrie strode forward, her rolls jiggling with each ponderous step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I win, then you will swear yourself to the master and endure the full...\" Tjanare paused, allowing her eyes to appraise Thrakka's new form, \"blessings of the Lipomancer. So the question remains, do you still believe you can defeat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't stand a chance!\" Thrakka roared fiercely and charged at the shield-maiden, her middle wobbling with each lunging footfall.</span></div></div>",

Her clothes chaffed a little against her slightly larger body as she walked. The sensation made her frown at the constant reminder of what happened, but she forced herself to put it out of her mind for now. There were more important things to worry about at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out another yawn as she fought against her drowsiness. Finding a place to take a quick nap was obviously far more important. Sure, her companions were expecting her to explore, but they didn't say she couldn't get a little beauty sleep either. There has to be a bed somewhere in this dank dungeon. After all, even monsters need a place to sleep at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick! Thwap! A strange noise interrupted her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Veradelia yelped as something stung her butt through her clothes. She looked down and saw a dart sticking out of her left butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced a little as she pulled it out and took a closer look. The dart was about as long as her thumb and had small red feathers on one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I must have stepped on a trap.\" Veradelia muttered, \"Oh well, at least it didn't hurt very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped the dart with a loud gasp as her left butt cheek, where the dart hit her, suddenly expanded with several pound of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" She whimpered as she struggled to keep her balance. Her left butt cheek was now bigger than her right, making her a little lopsided. She staggers to the side before she can regain her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick! Thwap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeowch!\" Veradelia squeaks in pain as another dart hits her, this time on her right butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis entire hallway must be booby trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of being hit with dozens of fattening darts makes Veradelia panic. She sprints further down the hallway in a desperate attempt to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick! Thwap! Click! Thwap! Click! Thwap! The mechanical sound repeats dozens and dozens of times as she runs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeradelia runs as fast as she can, but her endurance begins to falter. After what feels like an eternity, she spots a door in the distance. She manages to put one last desperate rush of speed as she dashes through the door and slams it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunk! Thunk! Thunk! Thunk! The sound of countless darts hitting the thick wooden door can be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Missed me!\" Veradelia gloats, before she takes a look at her butt, \"Oh, I guess not all of them missed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were over three dozen darts sticking out of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeradelia could do nothing but sob as her butt began to expand at a ridiculous rate. Her pants were slowly ripped in two as her butt cheeks filled with pound after pound of jiggling flab. By the time the expansion stopped, each cheek was over two feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor woman starred at her enlarged behind for the next ten minutes. She was too shocked to do anything else. She finally snapped out of it as she returned to her senses. She knew that if she didn't force herself to think about something else, she would probably go insane. So she forced herself to deliberately ignore the jiggling sensation her massive ass made every time she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeradelia pulled all the darts out of her rear then took a look at the room she had run into. It was definitely a bedroom judging from the gigantic king sized bed in the middle of the room. It was odd though, the bed was several times bigger than any normal person would need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother yawn escaped Veradelia's mouth as she looked at the bed. The ordeal she just went through was so stressful and she had exerted herself a lot. A little nap on this huge bed would do wonders for her. But then again... the owner of the bed could return while she was sleeping. Was it really worth the risk?</span></div></div>",

One would think that a city called Brightham would be rich, vibrant, and rarely dreary, a place of cheer and joy. Yet almost the opposite was the case, as the skies always seemed to be overcast, if not outright pouring rain, and crime, poverty and filth were daily realities. Even the occasional attack from undead bands originating in the neighboring wilds wasn't unheard of in this dismal town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a town like this, there is nothing extraordinary about a row of thin, dilapidated houses, crammed side to side and looming over a narrow, grimy cobblestone street. Even less surprising are signs of recent use of one of these homes, as even in their current, almost uninhabited states, the poor still live here, clinging to the pathetic shelters that they claim ownership over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the fact that somebody was using this home was hardly surprising. What was, however, was the grotesque stench wafting up from its cellar. If one were to follow this odorous trail down the stone steps, one would soon find its astonishing source: A spectacularly obese German Shepherd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine was massively fat, now wider than he was tall and completely and utterly immobilized by his own tremendous girth. He had greatly outgrown any clothes he had been wearing before this incident, the relatively clean looking garments lying about him on the floor as a testament to how recent and abnormally fast his weight gain had been. The blubbery dog was so big, his flabby body spread across so much of the floor, he nearly took up all space in the room, a room that seemed to have been a dining hall before even the table and remaining floor had been crushed under his ocean of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutt simply sat there on his wide, lard-filled ass, it was really all he could do besides groan, pant, sweat, and digest at this point. Even wagging his tail wasn't an available option for him anymore, like the rest of his body the base of his tail was surrounded by his own blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the beastman's pointed ears perked and his brown and tan fur bristled as the sound of clattering footfalls came down the stairwell. A curvaceous figure slowly emerged from around the corner, and there stood his captor and tormentor. He whined as he caught sight of the bat woman, even that simple whimper being distorted and deepened thanks to his cascade of chins and thick rolls he used to call a neck. She wasn't too tall and was quite slim, her black dress clinging to her body as she strode through the room. Like all bats, she had wings hanging below her arms, the membranes attached to spines that jutted from just below her wrists and her elbows. The bat moved closer to him, holding a basket of treats as she grinned and feigned concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You poor little doggy!\" She gasped sarcastically, clutching the basket to her dark, tight dress as she fondled his disgustingly doughy gut with the other hand, \"Is my poor baby hungry? You look absolutely <i>famished!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog tried to protest, but before he could force the words past the constricting weight of his body, the bat had trotted along to his bloated, thick rear and gave it a sharp and firm smack, sending his buttocks quaking and eliciting a pained grunt and another whine from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled as she made her way back to his front once more, \"Well it certainly looks like my pathetic little... well not-so-little mongrel doesn't need any more sweets, but if he does insist...\" She cooed as she dug her knee into his sagging, monstrous paunch and grabbed a nice pawful of its flab as she began to climb the mountain of a canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutt yelped in agony, screwing his eyes shut as the batgirl climbed, her legs sinking into his flab far more than they should have, \"Ohhh, wassat matter my sweet baby boy? Is your lady too heavy for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes again, tears watering in them as he stared at the basket of baked confections in terror. The girl merely smiled as she brought ought a cupcake and set the rest of the goodies down upon his fatty chest, bringing the cupcake to his plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tried to pull his head away, only managing to make it sink about an inch or so into the rings of fat surrounding it. This brought out a grin from to the bat's face, \"Oh no, I don't think so my dear... You came here to find me, no? You wanted to track down Voxiche' Lecard, the dreadful sorceress of legend to make yourself a legend, isn't that true? Well now look at you...\" She chuckled, gripping his fat neck viciously and unsparingly and squeezing as she choked the helpless dog, \"Well now you have found me puppy, and now I will make you a legend in my own way. You are going to be the fattest, most disgustingly obese creature this city has seen in centuries! And you are going to hate it... Now, open up!\" She chimed brightly as she stopped choking the life from him and he gasped for breath. She used this moment to shove the cupcake down his throat and clamped his muzzle shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whined as the fattening sweet slid down his throat and she offered another, \"I must say though, Leonard, you have put up quite the fight, even now that there is no hope of you ever, <i>ever</i> coming even close back to physical fitness. Even if you could move, you would need a thousand years to burn off... oh how much by now? Eleven thousand pounds? Nine thousand? Something around there I believe...\" She sighed, pointing her clawed finger at his nose, sending a tiny bolt of electricity from it to his snout and making him scream once more so she could once more ram another calorie-packed treat in, \"Too bad you don't have magic as I do...Yes, you really are doomed, aren't you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... huff... I huv...\" He groaned and wheezed weakly, trying to gather the strength to even speak out of his fat-covered pie-hole was taxing for him, and he grunted and panted heavily, \"I... will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teehee! What's that you swine?\" She grinned, holding her hand to her long, sensitive ears, a gesture of listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only grunted more, even louder now as his belly gurgled and roared. Sweat dripped from his brow as his guts interrupted him while trying to work through the literal tons of sustenance he had been made to consume over the last day or so. He yelped once more, a red blush spreading across one set of fat cheeks as another shook and jiggled, a massive fart erupting from his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA malicious smile spread across Voxiche's face, baring her sharp fangs as she fondled his chins and cackled, \"Oh my! You really are such a filthy porker, my mutt! What would everyone say? It really is terrible yes, but you should know I dislike being hunted, even less so by fools such as you...\" She said, pursing her lips together in a fake pout before grasping one of his hefty moobs in her paw and squeezing tightly. She smiled wider, as even though Leonard was whining yet again, she could smell his arousal mixed with his fear and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no, I have no time for games now my pet! Not when there are bound to be people looking for you even as we speak. I am enjoying this though, not all adventurers and bounty hunters are as proud and fun to break as you are! But how could I forget! With all this fun I've had feeding you, I've forgot to feed myself...\" She panted lightly, licking her lips, and then licking his chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard whined, once more futilely trying to pull away, but it would not help. Voxiche' flipped her long, black hair past her ears and pressed her lips to the dog's plump one's, pulling him into a deep, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow hold still my darling puppy...\" She pulled back before baring her fangs and sinking them into the fat of his neck. His howl could have been heard a mile away, if it wasn't for all the blubber...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The feasting vampire bat moaned with pleasure, wrapping her arms about the canine's neck rolls as she drank heavily and deeply of his blood. She dug her claws into his flesh, small rivulets of crimson dripping from where they cut him as she gave into the familiar passion of feeding. She enjoyed the act in so many ways, not only as a means of survival, of staving off the hunger. Vampire bats didn't even need to feed off of blood to live, it wasn't as though normal food was poison to them. In fact most chose to eat normally in order to conform to society, wanting to avoid conflict with other species that would come with something so taboo and frightening as their natural methods of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche' wasn't one of those fools, she would never give up blood-drinking, she lived for every bit of it. The taste, the satisfaction, the arousal... she could never give it up, not when it felt so right. Even then she wasn't like the other so-called \"degenerates\" who refused to give up blood... she was worse. Voxiche' preferred her blood to be a little different, a little thicker than what one could normally find from your average person. She wanted it to be savory, rich, packed with cholesterol, and so it would have to be blood from victims with... a little meat on their bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned more loudly now, rubbing her paws through and between her slave's folds, continuing to gorge herself on him. She could drain gallons from Leonard and yet he'd still have plenty left to survive, such was the benefit of having such a fatass to drink from. The boy merely stayed still as she fed, keeping his eyes closed and whining only a little, having become used to feeding her this way by now. Voxiche' felt a brief flash of amusement as she realized how well he had learned to stay still, it was as though she were training a pup. But amusement was soon replaced by pleasure once more as she kept indulging herself, spreading her legs wide to straddle his massive belly, her paw wandering over his flabby chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did she find the blood of the obese to be a delicacy, but she also found fatties themselves to be scrumptious as well. The sorceress often mused about how deviant her sexual desires were, especially when adipose was involved. She found she loved almost everything about not only fatter bodies on men and women, but also the weight gain process itself. She relished feeding her victims, filling them with unhealthy, colorie-packed food until it hurt, and then she'd push them further, not even slowing her lust fueled pampering when they had become little more than piles of lard. In fact, the bigger her thralls became, the more she desired them, and so she would often treat them like projects, striving to make each one fatter than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard was getting close, but he still had a ways to go before he beat her fattest victim. She was determined to make him break that record however, punishment for interrupting her last slave's feeding. She was a cute one too, an ignorant little vixen living by herself on a small farmstead, one that Voxiche' had been in the process of stuffing when the bounty hunter had tracked her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still mad...\" She murred softly to her captive, pulling away from his neck, blood dripping from her lips and onto his chest, \"You just had to spoil my little fun at the farm didn't you? Scaring me away from that lovely plump foxy... well no matter, now you are going to pay puppy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog only whine more loudly, air puffing out his lips as he attempted desperately to protest. She only giggled, stroking his neck with her paw, \"Mmm yes, I am going to make you my biggest captive yet! Oh you will be so gorgeous... so delicious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in once more, this time towards the canine's face. Leonard tried to pull away, but once more it was futile and he was powerless to stop as she forced another kiss upon him. His mind reeled with disgust as he was forced to taste and swallow his own blood, yet he was also horrified to find himself feeling aroused as well. He shivered as he felt her begin to grope and fondle his many rolls, unable to stop himself from murring softly, unable to stop himself from kissing her back as he felt the warmth of her crotch as she ground it against his vast and naked stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat pulled away, but not before licking the blood she left on his lips, and grinned, \"You enjoyed that, yes? Oh my you did... you sick puppy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard blushed as she lifted his chin on her finger, forcing him to look at her as she growled lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my dear doggy boy, I can tell you are starting to like this... being so helpless, so disgustingly fat and unable to resist me... don't you deny it... I think...\" She said, licking her blood-stained lips as she rubbed his plump cheek, \"You're even starting to fall for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog, closed his eyes tight, trying to shake his head, a weak growl rising from his throat. Voxiche' scoffed and pulled her hand away from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! You act like you do not know what I say, yet my nose tells me otherwise you frisky fat piggie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed back over to his neck, staring intently at the the blood seeping from the bite mark, \"But I am still hungry slave, although if you are still willing after, I <i>might</i> be able to arrange something pleasant for my sexy whale of a pup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in closer, baring her fangs and eliciting another whimper from her captive, \"Now be a good pig-mutt and hold still...\"</span></div></div>",

Her meal wasn't close to finished; no, she wasn't even half-done...  She moaned in ecstasy as she drained the German Shepherd's blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  But in her zeal, she'd drained <i>far</i> too much.  As Leonard's blood supply rapidly approached critical, he slipped into unconsciousness.  The bat didn't notice until the flow had ceased almost entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?  What's wrong with my little piggy?\" she asked, semi-concerned that her meal had finished earlier than she'd have liked.  She placed her paw on her stomach, and was startled to find that it wasn't quite as flat as she'd remembered, and was, in fact, nearly spherical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gasp!\" she said, playfully.  \"Look what you've done to my figure, you fat little piggy!\"  She slapped his belly, hoping to elicit one of the whimpers she so relished, but the dog did not make a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  Piggy?\"  Voxiche glanced upward at the dog's face, and saw that his eyes had closed.  \"Oh?  Is the piggy tired?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointment overtook her face, though, when she'd realized that the dog wasn't merely asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I seem to have overdone it this time...\" she sighed, recalling some of her other \"projects\" this had happened to:  A tubby gray mouse-girl, her first project, 1000 pounds of rodent, but not enough to satisfy Voxiche's ravenous appetite; a big orange fox-boy, who reached 6400 pounds but had the misfortune of feeding Voxiche when she was feeling <i>particularly</i> hungry; and a thick white lady-cat, 7000 pounds, who hadn't been the victim of an \"accident,\" <i>per se</i>, and had been quite intentionally drained due to having pissed off her captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do I do with you..?\"</span></div></div>",

Well, I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't becoming a little attached to you, but...

But I can't have <i>you</i> fouling up the place, you reeking beast!  I must get rid of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was always her least favorite part of her projects:  \"Disposal.\"  It was always an ordeal to get rid of the projects she'd either tired of or rendered unusable, no matter what method was employed.  Moving them was difficult, both due to their tremendous weight and conspicuousness (<i>you</i> try moving a 5-ton blob of furry around town without drawing a few eyes).  Outright slaughter was usually the more viable option, but it was always <i>very</i> messy and time-consuming, and you <i>still</i> had to find something to do with the meat and fat; the fur wasn't a problem, though, as she was usually quite handy with that, having fashioned an entire wardrobe of clothes from the skins of projects she'd opted to slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I could find the Dragon Black Market...\" she mused.  \"They'd pay for these reeking beasts, whole or in parts...

And I don't think <i>anyone</i> in this shit-hole town would wear your greasy, smelly fur...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire bat slapped the dog's belly, admiring it as it quivered and wobbled.  \"Although, I bet I could find <i>someone</i> to take you off my hands...\"  She grinned.  \"I'd bet a hungry dragon would <i>love</i> to take your fat ass off of my hands...  For a few gold, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cackled.  \"Well, it's settled, then!  It's time to go to market, Piggy!\" she said in a sing-song voice.  \"...  But, tomorrow.  I'll need a cart, and the cover of night; I should have those tomorrow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat wandered over to a cupboard behind the dog's colossal ass, nearly tripping on a large white vase she kept beside it.  She clutched its little wooden handles and opened it, revealing a few shelves covered in various objects and tools.  On the top shelf were a few oily, blood-stained knives and cleavers of varying sharpness and length, which she'd used to \"dispose\" of some of her past projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next shelf down held a few empty jars, and a few containing various colored liquids, some of which Voxiche herself couldn't identify; they'd been here long before she'd decided to take residence.  She <i>could</i> identify one to be a Potion of Featherweight, which would greatly lessen the effect of gravity on the person who drank it.  \"It's a good thing I've got this,\" Voxiche mused, \"Otherwise, I'd have a lot more trouble lugging this fat-ass up the stairs.\"  She'd only wished she'd had a potion like this for all of the <i>other</i> projects she'd had to haul away; being a sorceress with a levitation spell made it somewhat easier than it should have been to move such heavy things, but it was still cumbersome to keep her concentration throughout the ordeal...  <i>Especially</i> with less-than-willing subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third shelf held a number of actual tools, each of varying usefulness:  A tape-measure, a rusty hammer, a bent handsaw, a little pile of assorted nails and bolts, and a hand-drill.  \"Ah, yes, the tape-measure; just what I was looking for...\"  Voxiche took out the tape-measure and set it on a table by the cupboard.  She wasn't done looking through the cupboard, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came down to the last shelf, which was covered in a number of odds-and-ends, knick-knacks and doodads, many of which were \"trophies\" she'd kept from previous projects...  Like the necklace she'd taken from the mouse-girl, or the bushy orange tail she'd cut off of the fox, or a little jingle-bell she'd taken from a bracelet that a rabbit-girl wore.  She wasn't really a sentimental creature, but thought it would be interesting to \"collect\" such things.  Among these, though, were a few marginally valuable or useful objects.  Namely, a red coin-pouch.  \"Ah, there you are...\"  She reached in and pulled it from its resting spot next to a necklace that Voxiche had made out of a wolfess' teeth.  \"Now, let's see how mu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted, mid-sentence, by a rather explosive bout of gas erupting from Leonard's ass...  Which she'd had the misfortune to be standing only two feet from.  She was covered in flying droplets of sweat propelled by the dog's fart, which angered her greatly.  \"<i>You fat sack of-!</i>...  Let's see you try to do that with a <i>vase up your ass!</i>\"  True to her word, the bat picked up the large white vase right beside her and proceeded to ram it between the dog's ass-cheeks...  <i>Forcefully.</i>  Even in his unconsciousness, Leonard managed to let out a short yelp of pain, which made Voxiche giggle.  \"<i>There!</i>\" she said, watching the dog continue to pass gas, only now blocked by a vase.  The force wasn't negated, though, but was merely redirected into the dog's blubbery body, which now jiggled immensely with each trumpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche smirked, and after changing out of her sweat-soaked black dress into a fur coat she'd made from the same wolfess she'd made the necklace from, and returned to the coin-pouch.  \"<i>Now...</i>  Let's see how much I have.\"  She pulled the drawstring and dumped the pouch's contents out over the table, next to the tape measure; the pile created was disappointingly small, but hopefully would be enough to purchase a cart of adequate size for the mountain of dog-blubber she'd be hauling out of town.  She counted them.  \"394 gold pieces...  Hmmmph.  <i>Barely</i> enough for a cart...  And doesn't leave me much left.\"  She sighed.  \"Oh, well.\"  It wasn't that hard for her to come by money, usually...  But it still didn't set right with her to let any of it go if it wasn't for something she <i>really</i> wanted.  She didn't <i>want</i> a cart, but definitely <i>needed</i> one, what with her lack of teleport spells.  \"Yes, enough for a cart, but...  Is it enough for a <i>big enough</i> cart?\"  This is what the tape-measure was for, to determine Leonard's \"dimensions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarting about the dog, she expanded the tape-measure along various stretches of the dog's fatted form, and after much checking and <i>re</i>-checking, determined that he was 10 feet deep from the furthest of his belly-flab to the base of his tail, and 6 feet wide from hip to hip.  She also found that he was about 5 feet tall, but that wasn't very important.  She would have tried to get his exact weight, but didn't have the tools available to her at that moment to determine such a thing; she'd have to go with her estimate of 11,000 pounds...  Which was <i>just</i> a thousand pounds shy of the heaviest furry she'd ever \"owned,\" an enormous purple skunk-girl, who she sold to a village of dragonoids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a shame, mutt...  You could've beat her record.\"  She shrugged.  \"...  Oh, well!  This just means you aren't <i>too</i> huge for a cart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog <i>would</i> be a bit large for the cart he'd have to ride in, 8 feet by 4 feet, but she figured she could squish his fat into a more manageable space...  Or at least be able to \"muffin\" it over the sides of the cart without too much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my gassy little Piggy...  We'll be taking a little trip tomorrow...  But tonight, we rest.\"  She yawned.  Instead of adjourning to her sleeping quarters upstairs, though, she pulled a large spread of soft skunk-skin (a different skunk, of course) and threw it over the dog's belly.  \"Good night...\" she said, as she jumped onto the fur she'd laid out, and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, she set off for the town's marketplace...</span></div></div>",

She was annoyed to find that, while it was mid-autumn, the sun was already bright in the sky.  \"Urgh!  Why is it so bright already!?\" she hissed.  She didn't like sunlight very much; most bats didn't, at least.  She could tolerate it, sure; far more than other bats, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...  But she most certainly didn't like it.  She usually kept a \"nocturnal\" schedule, but it was very important that she be out and about today; she had to secure a cart to haul away the 5-ton Leonard.

She knew, of course, that he <i>wouldn't</i> appreciate being hauled away to his probable slaughter.  \"I bet that fat mutt isn't even <i>thankful</i> for all the effort I'm going to turn him into dragon-food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, miss...\" a gravelly voice came from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche ignored it, until it came closer...  And grabbed her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Excuse me,</i> miss...\" it said, although a bit sharper this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" she shouted, as she turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

Voxiche Lecard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat's ears twitched involuntarily and her skin crawled as she heard her name. She glanced about at the townsfolk walking by them, hoping none had been listening, \"I'm sure you're mistaken!\" She hissed softly before turning to walk away, \"Now, if you will excuse me, I have some things t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog grabbed her by her coat, this time with both paws, and dragged her into a small shop selling rugs nearby, slamming her against a wall. The owner of the store, a red-headed dwarf woman, seemed rather mortified, \"H-Hey there! Jus' what do ya think you're doing with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doberman held Voxiche up against the wall as she whimpered, \"I need you to alert the town guard right away, this woman is Voxiche Lecard, a criminal and a proven murderer! They will verify my claims and what I am doing here.\" He looked over at the shopkeeper, only to be met by her slack-jawed expression, \"Go! <i>Now!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche continued to scowl at the dog pinning her as the dwarf rushed from the building, slamming the front door behind her, \"Fine then... It's clear that you are not dumb enough to fall for the innocent routine, but still stupid enough to try and corner me...\" The bat whispered before lifting a hand up towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doberman was two steps ahead however, drawing his pistol and placing its metal barrel to her chin, \"You even think one of your incantations and I'll make sure it'll be the penultimate thing going through that demented mind of yours... Now talk, what have you done to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat woman giggled defiantly, wincing once she felt him press the gun harder against her head \"Who? You'll have to be more specific mongrel, there are a lot of 'him's I've done terrible things to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Leonard!</i>\" The man barked as he pressed the side of his arm painfully against her stomach, \"The bounty hunter! Tell me what you've done to him! Tell me where he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche grunted as she licked her lips, \"Oh my! So pushy... Is the mutt your partner? Is that it, the two of you working together to fuck over people like me?\" She tilted her head and grinned, flashing her fangs at him, their eyes meeting as she cooed, \"Stupid mutt number two! Oh, but there is something else isn't there... I doubt you are brothers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bounty hunter clicked back the hammer on his elaborate firearm, \"You tell me now! I won't get nearly as much dead, but I swear if you don't stop screwing with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me foolish pup, I could have fried you to crisps the moment you touched me... You have no idea how long I've been running from people like you, nor how many there were that have failed before...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to retort, the bat pressed her palm flat against the dog, her paw glowing with a pale blue mist as it met his chest. The canine's mouth went agape, then hung open fixed as his eyes glazed over with the same blue tint as the sorceress's spell. As Voxiche pushed him further, the paralyzed man fell, legs locked and paw still clutching his weapon as he slammed to the ground with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But killing you wouldn't be fun!\" She sneered, walking over to his side and kneeling over him, \"You know who I am already... So you probably already guessed what I've done to your friend... hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doberman remained silent, face frozen in the moment he was caught off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh oui monsieur mutt... But that is not what worries you, oh no, no, no! The question troubling your simple little mind is 'How far has she gone?'!\" She grinned, leaning in closer to whisper to the helpless bounty hunter, \"And the answer is far worse than any you've imagined, I assure you puppy... No, I will not kill you, instead I will show you your 'partner', and then...\" She purred, stroking his chin with her nails,\"I will do to you everything I've ever done to him... And more... I hope you're hungry my little puppy... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche's mind was racing, going from her delicious fantasies of what she'd do with the bounty hunter to more practical thoughts on trying to figure out how to smuggle the stunned Doberman out of the stall. She had decided that it'd be best to try rolling him in one of the rugs and smuggling him out when Voxiche's ears perked. As she listened, she heard the sounds coming closer: The unmistakable stomps of rushing boots and the clank of chain-mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" She muttered under her breath as she looked to the entrance of the stall, then to the Doberman on the ground, and then towards another exit in the back, \"Looks like you caught a break this time dog...\" She said as she tried to decide between...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was looking forward to reuniting you and your companion over dinner puppy, but it seems that I simply do not have the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doberman bounty hunter remained on the ground, paralyzed by Voxiche's spell as she knelt over him once more. She quickly grabbed the pistol out of his petrified grasp, looking over the ornate weapon before pocketing it, \"What a valuable toy you have here bounty hunter... If you can afford something like that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sorceress bat patted her paw over the vest the dog wore under his coat before slipping her fingers into one of its pockets and pulling out a hefty sack of gold, \"Ah, there we go!\" She grinned, shaking the purse before stowing it as well, \"I should probably kill you, but I'd rather they find a living fool when they get here than a dead one... Yes, this is a small price for you to pay after what you've just put me through, but I'm sure we'll meet again... audieu puppy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could could stand to leave however, the front door swung open and a young human with sword brandished charged in, wearing a tabard that bore the city's standard over his leather armor. He caught sight of Voxiche, his eyes widening and the confidence in them turning to fear as they met the those of the sorcerer and he blurted, \"S-Stop right there cr-HURK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man slumped to his knees, a scorching hole burning through his armor and charring his flesh of his chest before he fell face-first to the floor. He clutched at the wound, gasping for breath as Voxiche stepped over him towards the door, flames dancing in her hands as she kicked it shut. She grasped the lock and hinges in her burning clutches, melting the metal like butter against the door frame with the heat of her spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should buy a bit of time...\" She muttered, kicking the gurgling guard out of her way as she made sure to draw closed the drapes of the shop's small front windows. Once that was done, she started to head for the back door, pausing only as she heard further commotion outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sound of it, the rest of the guards were now right outside the shop, a gruff voice shouting from the street, \"Criminal! Surrender yourself at once! I have half a dozen men at my disposal Miss Lecard, with more on the way. If you don't give yourself up we WILL use force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche knew she should probably keep quiet, but she couldn't resist, \"One of you has already tried! Enough of your threats, all that's left for you to do now is come in and die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her men!\" The voice shouted, \"No mercy, ATTACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMixed voices sounded their fury and shouted threats of their own as the front door began to rattle and shake, presumably from the beating of fists and pommels. A part of the vampire bat wanted desperately to make good on what she'd said, but she knew it wouldn't be wise to fight so many at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bat was about to turn for the door though, her heart nearly stopped as she felt a hand clasp about her ankle. Gasping in fright, she looked down to see the young guard grabbing hold of her. Tears rolled over his cheeks as he struggled to keep a hold on to not only her, but his life, \"Please... Please don't...\" He wheezed, almost pleading. Voxiche of course assumed he was speaking to her at first, though catching sight of the boy's eyes it was clear he was looking right through her, as though she weren't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to look down at him, her eyes wide with shock as she tried to tug her leg free, \"What are you doing you wretch? Let go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her now, mouth agape and skin pale as snow as the life slowly drained from it. The boy's tabard lay crushed beneath his body, continuing to smolder and burn from where the bat's spell hit him, the flames slowly spreading and licking up his sides, \"Father... He has to know... plea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche's face quickly contorted into a snarl, the sorceress letting out a shrill scream as her hands were once more engulfed in flames. Without hesitating, she flung the fire down at the dying guard with one hand and then the other, both of her paws soon casting flame upon the helpless boy's body, only stopping once most of what remained was a charred husk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, all Voxiche could do was stand still, gasping for breath as she recovered from the sudden shock, as well as the drain such unchecked use of magic had on her body. The continued pounding upon the shop's door was not enough to pull her out of this daze: It wasn't until one of the guards outside had broken a window with their halberd when the sorceress was pulled her back to her senses. With the guards already breaking down the door, Voxiche pushed what she'd just done to the back of her mind, once more focusing on escape. She pulled her ankle free from what was left of the guard's hand and headed for the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, the guards hadn't surrounded the building yet, but as the bat girl stepped out into the alley, she knew they'd be arriving soon. Looking around the alleyways, Voxiche decided to take the one to the...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He recoiled as she shouted at him, and she noticed a ring around one of his claws as it hovered in the air for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Er...  Pardon me, madam.  I'd just overheard you muttering something about 'dragon-food,' and became a bit curious.  My apologies.\"  He brought the claw with the ring on it to his chin, subtly brandishing the insignia on the ring.  The insignia was one of a dragon's head, encircled by forks, knives, and spoons...  The mark of the Meal-Wyrms, a crime-syndicate notorious for kidnappings and the trafficking of sentient creatures as food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche noted the insignia, and changed her demeanor, accordingly.  \"No, <i>I'm</i> sorry...\" she said, faux-apologetically.  \"That was rude of me.\"  If she played her cards right, not only would she be spared the trouble of procuring a cart and traveling 19 miles to a rogue dragon settlement, but she might make bank as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, er...  Anyway, I'm interested in this 'dragon-food' you were speaking of, Miss...  Hmmm.  I do believe I recognize you...\"  the dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  You- you do..?\" Voxiche stuttered; she wasn't quite prepared for <i>that.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're...  Vox...  Ah!  Voxiche Lecard!  I recognize you from a poster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...  I think we understand each other, Miss Lecard.  I know you saw my ring, ma'am, and <i>I</i> know you're looking to get rid of 'something.'  And trust me, I know what that 'something' is; anyone who's ever read a wanted poster knows what that something is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche was still a bit uncomfortable with where the situation was headed; while she was sure it wasn't going to end in disaster like she'd thought...  She still didn't like the idea of somebody knowing who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al-alright, sir-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Uroer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Uroer...  Would you kindly follow me to the merchandise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly, Miss Lecard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche led Uroer to her abode, and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer ducked down a bit, and entered through the door, followed by the bat, and was assailed by a powerful stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  Oh, my...  Is it dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...  He's alive; he's just a bit gassy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...  Would you follow me downstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs creaked as the pair made their way to the cellar.  As they approached the bottom, Uroer's jaw dropped as he saw the \"merchandise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a German Shepherd that I'd like to sell to you,\" Voxiche said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I see that.  Can you tell me about...  It?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a bounty hunter that was hunting me; he failed, obviously...  So, he became my next victim.  I've been feeding him over the past two days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this over a matter of <i>days</i>!?\" Uroer exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Astounding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, anyway, while I was feeding on him, I got a bit 'over-zealous' and took a bit more blood than I should have.  He went unconscious-  But still alive!- and I decided I was bored with him.  I'd like to get a new project, but first I need to get rid of <i>him</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche glanced over at the dragon, who was dumbstruck by what he was hearing and seeing.  She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...  So, he's got no blood in him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...  How much does he weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but I figure he weighs somewhere around 11,000 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I don't think we've ever purchased anything that heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer approached the comatose German Shepherd.  \"May I...  'Inspect' him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche watched as the dragon proceeded to poke and prod the dog from various angles.  First, Uroer placed his claws on Leonard's enormous belly, kneading it and hefting it.  He then slapped the dog's belly to watch it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes.  Excellent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around the dog until he came to his fleshy backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...  There seems to be...  A vase...  Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard farted tremendously at that moment, but was muffled by the ceramic wedged in his ass.  His body began jiggling and wobbling like gelatin, which seemed to impress Uroer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That</i> would be why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.  It seems...  'Deep.'\"  Uroer placed a claw on the dog's left buttock, and squeezed.  \"Soft.  Meaty...\"  He leaned over and opened his mouth, as if to take a bite out of the dog...  And stopped, once he caught himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer straightened his back, and looked into Voxiche's eyes.  \"I think you have a sale, Miss Lecard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche smiled.  \"Please, call me Voxiche.\"  Uroer extended his claw, and Voxiche shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Voxiche.  I'll be back sometime tonight with a few others to bring this leviathin back to the headquarters.  You'll follow us there, and we'll discuss payment after we weigh him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan, Uroer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us keep in touch, Voxiche...  I'm sure that the Meal-Wyrms would love to partake of your future handiwork.\"  Uroer grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be wonderful.\"  This was perfect; not only had Voxiche (almost) made a sale and got rid of the smelly mutt, but she'd also made connections with a group that would make her future exploits <i>much</i> easier...  \"So...  What time, exactly, do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight would probably be best for all parties involved.  I'll see you then.\"  Uroer made his way back up the stairs without Voxiche; she waited until she heard her front door slam before she gave into a fit of girlish giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  <i>Yes!</i>  Hahahahaahahahahaha!  <i>Yes!</i>\"  She danced about, laughing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be rid of you, you mangy mongrel, and I hardly had to do a thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed.  \"Goodbye, Piggy.  I'm sure you'll make a fine roast...\"  Voxiche patted Leonard's belly before she headed back upstairs to remove her robe and adjourn to her bedroom.  Before tonight came, she figured she should get a little bit of shut-eye.  She sprawled out on her squirrel-fur bedspread and fell asleep, smiling.</span></div></div>",

She knew it was only a dream, but she still clutched the squirrel-fur to her chest tightly, an odd attempt at calming her nerves. She simply sat there for a while before noticing how dark it had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have overslept...\" She said to nobody in particular before sliding off of the bed and strolling over to her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a dark, crimson dress and held it up to her body, attempting to determine if it was suitable. She wanted to appear at least a little bit classy tonight, she was, after all, attending a business meeting of sorts. Yet as she examined the silk dress she realized that it was a bit small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! I almost forgot...\" She said as she held a paw to her somewhat sagging belly. It had been quite a while since she had fed on Leonard, but his blood was still enough to put some weight on her. She frowned as she felt her softer form, then closed her eyes, a cold, green light emanating from her hand. As she moved it across her body her size began to decrease, fat seemingly shrinking away until she was just as svelte as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" She sighed before changing into her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't even made her way to the basement before she heard a rapping knock upon the front door. She made her way to it, cracking it open slightly to see Uroer as well as three other dragonoids waiting outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door fully and motioned for them to come inside, which they did swiftly and silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought a way to move him, I assume?\" Voxiche' asked as she led the reptiles down the creaking steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Said Uroer, \"We have a cart waiting just outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant up the steps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gathered around the German Shepherd, the other dragonmen looking him over in awe, a couple even poking and prodding Leonard as Uroer had. One of them was even drooling quite visibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yes, these men are mages, you see, and I believe that together, they should be able to move the dog man... should...\" He looked over at the dragon mages as they appreciated the meaty mutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright then, I will wait for you outside if you think you can handle it, good luck!\" She said, grinning as she made her way up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited by the cart, her cloak once more draped about her shoulders, the bat hummed to herself while picking at her nails. She could have easily helped the mages, yes, but why do all the work when they could for her? Besides, once they had managed to actually move the five ton mongrel up the stairs, through the doorways, and into the cart, they could be happy that they had accomplished something with their inferior magic, and who was she to take that purpose from them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention was soon drawn to the front door of her temporary abode as it swung open, a mass of furry lard filling its frame. She could make out muffled yells and hissed curses as the flabby dog was slowly forced through the threshold of the doorway until he had finally cleared it, his fleshy body wobbling as soon as it was free of its confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard floated through the air like a grotesque parody of the moon in the sky, followed quickly by the three dragon wizards, all of them holding their trembling claws in the air as they struggled to hold the mutt aloft with their magic. Slowly and shakily they maneuvered him towards the cart until he was straight above it, releasing him from their spells and allowing him to unceremoniously fall into the wagon. Leonard wobbled more as he hit the cart, causing the ground to shake from the force of the impact, much to Voxiche's and Uroer's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You morons! You could have woken the entire block!\" He hissed at them in quiet rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know very well none of us had moved something so big Uroer!\" One of them panted in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer muttered something under his breath before bringing a large, brown sheet over the cart, covering Leonard from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to return to the base before anybody comes to investigate... get a move on!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all began to make their way down the street, Voxiche following right beside Uroer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they all act with such insolence?\" She asked, adding a slight mocking tone to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... the mages sometimes... They get out of line... think their sorcery gives them superiority sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... then why don't they mutiny if they don't like to be bossed around?\" She looked over the dragonoid's body once more, again noting how skinny, how scrawny he looked, \"No offense, but you are quite small for your species...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer's lip quivered, his teeth showing as he started to growl but just managed to stop himself before he did so, \"I may not be... as powerful as them in the arts of magic, nor as strong as some of the others I command... but I am certainly more intelligent, more strategic, more tactful... That is why our leader chose me to act as liaison and informant for our chapter here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not the leader then..?\" The bat inquired, bringing her paw to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... you may understand more fully once we reach the hideout...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche remained silent as they continued their journey. Her mind kept returning to the dragonoid beside her. She couldn't stop thinking about how odd his body was, much too small for his kind, even the mages had more muscle. She started to lose herself in one of her fantasies, imagining him as her next project, imagining how grateful he would be for not being such a scrawny whelp once he had some meat on his bones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also couldn't help but notice that they were now passing through one of the quieter alleyways of the city. Nobody would be able to see if she decided to take Uroer as her own, and she was quite confident that if the pathetic wizards that accompanied them now could hardly move Leonard, then surely she could handle them all in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure it would ruin a <i>very</i> beneficial alliance, but you didn't get to see dragonmen every day...</span></div></div>",

But it would ruin a <i>very</i> beneficial alliance, one she'd been wanting since she began taking on her \"projects\" and had to get rid of the first one.  She would not give in to this impulse to sever this connection before it was even made, no matter how wonderful a specimen Uroer would be...  No!  This was far too important to blow.  Voxiche swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter, Voxiche?\" Uroer asked, as he eyed the vampire bat, whose \"drift\" into Fantasy Land had not gone unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  No, nothing's the matter.  I just had a little something in my throat...\" Voxiche answered, quite aware that her excuse wasn't being bought by the slim dragonoid staring her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>sure</i>?\"  Uroer asked rather pointedly; he still seemed a bit steamed that Voxiche had commented on his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  I suppose I'm just a little bit nervous about this whole affair.  I'm just afraid I'll offend somebody; I want this to work, and I <i>certainly</i> don't want to make any enemies...\" Voxiche said, managing to sound somewhat sincere; she was, at least, being half-truthful.  She'd been a bit shaken since the dream she'd woken up from, and was in a bit of a different state of mind, different from her usual cold, collected wit and manipulations.  She was able to hold her composure, for the most part, but it was still nagging at her, and opening up many feelings she rarely had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sorry that I commented on your size...  I see that it hurt you, and I'm very sorry...\" she said, as saccharine as she could manage, all while tilting her head forward and giving Uroer the \"puppy-dog\" eyes, batting her eyelashes as she did so.  <i>This</i> was classic Voxiche:  She didn't mean what she said, but she certainly sounded like it to all but the most jaded and skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer softened a bit, looking a bit embarrassed.  He stuttered as he tried to find the words that would help him save face as a \"big,\" tough dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...  I-I'm sorry if I seemed to be offended...\" he said.  \"I wasn't, really.  Really.  I was merely exhaling, earlier.  It was by no means a stifled growl...  Nothing of the sort...\"  Voxiche wondered how this dragon could have attained a position such as his when he was <i>such a terrible liar.</i>  Or perhaps he was just nervous, himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In...  In any case, I don't think you have much to worry about.  The Meal-Wyrms are always looking for new 'business opportunities' such as the one you have to offer.  You should be fine, short of trying to assassinate our leader...  Or raising a hand against any of our operatives...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"  The bat winced a bit, albeit very subtly; she wondered how much insight Uroer had into her mind.  Perhaps this is why he had the position he had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, nothing to worry about...  Ah, we're here.\"  The procession stopped at an iron gate outside of a seemingly-abandoned manor; of course, in a town like this, just about <i>every</i> building looked abandoned.  The manor sat at the top of a small hill, in the middle of its estate, which itself looked unkempt.  Overgrown grass, nearly a foot and a half long, covered nearly everything, and everything else was covered in scraggly brush and various shrubs.  \"Home, sweet home...  You know, the plants make <i>marvelous</i> cover for the entrances of burrows and the like...\"  Uroer reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a key, which he promptly slid into the lock.  He turned it sideways and was rewarded with a faint <i>*click*</i>, indicating he'd been successful.  He pushed the gate open with surprising silence.  \"Ladies first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you.\"  Voxiche, indeed, did go first, followed by the three mages pulling the cart, with Uroer bringing up the rear, closing the gate behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let them lead the way...\"  They headed halfway up a cobblestone path before veering off to the right, winding their way around the hill...  And coming to the back, where they were met by a rather large door, ten feet tall and 8 feet wide, beneath an obscuring archway.  \"Allow me.\"  Uroer stepped forward, and knocked on the door.  \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's 'we?'\" a rather gruff voice growled from behind the door.  \"I don't know a 'we.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer sighed.  \"It's <i>Uroer</i>, you dolt!  <i>We</i> come here with fresh meat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why didn't you say so?  Really, that's all you had to say...\" the voice lightened up a bit.  \"Might have been a bit nicer, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OPEN THE DAMN DOOR.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened slowly, revealing a 10-foot-tall blue dragon in traditional \"guard\" armor.  He stepped to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go...\" Uroer said, regaining his composure.  \"<i>Thank you</i>, Iroux.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...  Don't mention it...\" Iroux muttered.  \"Though I do have to say, that's a pretty nice haul you've got there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, it is...  And we have Miss Lecard to thank.\"  Uroer gestured at the bat, who blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIroux bowed, shallowly.  \"Thank you, Miss Lecard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer sighed.  \"Let's head onward.  We need to weigh the beast, and arrange payment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came upon another door, nearly as wide as the previous but only 7 feet tall...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This one was pushed open rather easily, and the cart was wheeled through to a large chamber housing a rather large scale in the center, one that seemed mostly suited to livestock.  \"This, of course, is where we weigh our...  'Goods,'\" Uroer stated.  \"The heaviest we usually get is something around 500 pounds; a ton, at most...  I'm not sure how well it can handle a supposed <i>five-</i>ton fur, but...  Well, we'll just see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer pulled the sheet from the cart, no longer having to hide its cargo, revealing the same unconscious Leonard that had been plopped into the cart earlier, his expansive body seeping over the sides of the cart like a loaf of bread that had risen out of its pan.  The dragon snapped his fingers.  \"Mages!  Levitate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mages did as they were told, lifting the blubbery German Shepherd with nearly as much difficulty as they had earlier, only made easier by the fact that they did not have to wedge the larded brown beast through a 3-foot-wide doorway.  After a couple minutes of struggle, they plopped the dog onto the curved metal plate atop the scale, just as violently as they had with the cart.  Uroer shot them all a <i>very</i> dirty look; despite the fact that there was no longer the danger of attracting unwanted attention, the scale was a rather expensive instrument that needed to be handled carefully.  The mages just shrugged, with the most brash among them shouting, \"Just weigh the damn thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer ignored them, instead focusing on calibrating the scale.  After some tinkering, he stepped back to allow the scale to do its thing.  With much creaking, indicated that it was definitely not used to this much weight, the numbers on its display rolled into place with rapid speed, revealing that the mutt was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  I forgot to take the vase out.  My apologies, everyone,\" Uroer said.  He walked around the scale to the dog's meaty rear-end and gripped the opening of the white ceramic vase, pulling until it popped free- a <i>very</i> audible pop; it was apparently a rather tight fit- and was promptly rewarded with one of Leonard's tremendous bouts of gas.  \"Filthy beast!\" Uroer cried.  \"Ahem...  So, would you like this back?\"  Uroer held the disturbingly warm vase out to Voxiche, who politely received it, wincing as it entered her palms.  \"We can have it cleaned for you...\" Uroer offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds...  Good...\"  Voxiche gingerly placed the large ceramic vase on the floor beside her, holding her hands aloft as she refused to let them come back to rest on her sides, as her mouth hung open in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...  I'll have somebody bring you a washbasin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hand-washings later, Voxiche was once again calm; the deviant bat had even come out of the experience thinking of a way to adapt the vase into an instrument for boiling tea...  Using the body heat of future projects, the same way she'd \"used\" it on Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!  What does the scale say?\" Uroer queried.  The vase weighed relatively little, and had changed the reading by only a pound or so, but it still had to go if an accurate reading was to be had; as decadent as the Meal-Wyrms could be in their \"excursions,\" they still would try to save money where they could, even if it was only a couple gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...  The scale seems to say...  11,345 pounds!  Quite a bit of meat on the mutt.\"  Uroer turned around.  \"Now, the matter of payment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche's ears perked at the beautiful word, \"payment.\"  This is the moment she'd been waiting for:  The finalization of this deal, where she could rid herself of the mangy lard-pile and earn quite a bit at the same time.  \"Yes, payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does...  11 gold pieces a pound sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you make it 20?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, make it a nice, round number...  That'd be...  226,900 gold pieces.  A bit more than we'd have wanted to spend,\" Uroer grimaced, \"...  It's still a fair price to pay for such exotic goods of such...  Quality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche's eyes twinkled wildly.  She didn't actually think they'd have given it to her that easily!  She'd be set for quite a while...  And if all of her projects were disposed of this way, she'd be able to buy...  Just about anything she'd ever wanted...  Especially one of those \"Pocket Realm\" crystals she'd wanted so badly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure doing business with you, Voxiche.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, Uroer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to 'prepare' the beast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I go fetch a roasting pan?\" inquired one of the mages, eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you dolt!  This creature wouldn't fit in any of our ovens!\"  Uroer reached into his pocket and pulled out a knife.  \"It'll have to be slaughtered.  We can roast it bit by bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer sighed.  \"...  Yes, I know you're disappointed; I am a bit, too.  But, we cannot help it.  We'll have to get much larger ovens if we're expecting even larger meals...  But this one can't be roasted with the ones we have.\"  Uroer plunged the knife into Leonard's doughy gut, tearing across it like he was opening a sack of flour.  He drew a bit of blood, but not much.  He cut a bit further, and held the gash open, revealing the mountains of yellow adipose that the German Shepherd's enormous brown belly hid.  Uroer dipped his claw inside, and coated his finger with a bit of the dog's grease, inviting the rest to do the same.  They stood around the unconscious-but-still-alive dog's body, licking their fingers; Voxiche herself couldn't help but wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Delicious</i>.  Well...  Let us save the rest for the appropriate personnel to handle, shall we?\"  Uroer left the knife stuck in Leonard's gut, standing, as he instructed the mages to put the dog back in the cart.  They obliged, this time quite readily, their attitudes softened with the very real prospects of what could be the largest meal they'd ever had.  They wheeled the condemned mutt into another room, beyond another door, where the bat could spot a rather large, low marble slab, covered in a number of red stains, surrounded by a few burly, hungry-looking dragonoids wielding knives and cleavers.  'Well...  This is what the mutt gets for hunting Voxiche Lecard...' she thought to herself, suppressing a small pang of guilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"</span></div></div>",

Meet some people, take a tour..?\" Uroer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..?\" Voxiche replied, still a bit dazed by the prospect of the dog being torn apart.  It wasn't that she'd minded if the dog died, no; she's never had <i>too</i> much concern for the ultimate fate of her projects.  She really couldn't place why, exactly, it felt so wrong to let somebody else slaughter her \"Piggy,\" especially when she'd considered slaughtering him herself to be a rather undesirable choice...  Was that it?  \"Someone else?\"  That was it; it broke the intimacy of the process.  ...  Of course, she knew full-well that this happened to the \"projects\" she sold most of the time (there was <i>one</i> dragon, non-humanoid, who wanted a fat little vixen Voxiche was selling... as a pet), and when she decided she was done with a project, she didn't care if it died, or even <i>how.</i>  It's just that, all of those other times, it felt more \"on her terms.\"  ...  Bah.  Next time, she just wouldn't watch them shove a knife in what she sold them...  Or listen to it scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche was brought back to reality by Uroer.  \"...  Voxiche?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...  Just a little...  Tired, is all.  ...  Maybe a bit hungry, too, but I don't think you can do much about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!  I hereby cordially invite you to dine with the Meal-Wyrms tonight!\"  Uroer realized the folly of his invitation; but rather than take it back, which would have been rude, he merely amended it.  \"...  <i>Or</i> we could swing by the Fattening Chambers, where you can pick something to 'feed' on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Uroer was trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Uroer.  I'll stick around for a tour...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!  Follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her through the Slaughter Chamber; Voxiche was none too thrilled with this, though, as they were still dismembering her old project.  She even saw one of dragons carrying one of Leonard's legs, buttock and all, away from the rest of him, and disappear down a staircase.  Uroer followed the dragon down the stairs to show the vampire bat the Curing and Preservation Chambers, where she got to see the various shanks of anthropomorphic animals hanging from the ceiling, being joined by the half-ton shank of her latest project.  She did have to admit to feeling a sense of pride, though; seeing all of the other shanks, <i>dwarfed</i> by the shank of the mammoth Leonard...  It was like owning the prize-winning pig at the fair.  She was surprised to see, though, that the other shank would not be joining it.  What <i>did</i> join it, though, were eight 60-gallon barrels of his lard, a pile of fatty steaks, and various other cuts of meat, all in enormous proportion to what would be the \"regular\" proportion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took her up the stairs, back through the Slaughter Chamber, where they were still working on the mutt; his other shank was missing, but there was still plenty left of the dog.  They also brought in an obese raccoon girl, over 800 pounds...  She wasn't unconscious, though.  Uroer and Voxiche made their way over to the Kitchens, where Voxiche learned where the other shank had gone to:  It was being prepared for dinner.  It smelled nice enough, though.  They also saw a few fat vixens, all being prepared in various ways.  One was being prepared to be roasted whole, kneeling in a pan with an apple in her mouth and her flabby belly sweeping the sides, cringing while a dragonoid chef stuffed whole cloves of garlic up her ample ass.  Another, considerably heavier one was lying on her back, being filled with some sort of creme through her backside, to the point where her stomach was visibly distended (\"I believe this is 'dessert,'\" Uroer explains) and being drizzle with chocolate sauce.  Still another was simply being crammed into a larger skunk, which was also being stuffed into a pig (\"Ah, Piskunxen; a classic.\").  There were also a few cuts of meat from other species, but Voxiche couldn't identify them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was introduced to much of the cooking crew; she didn't remember any of their names, though, as they were all fairly unmemorable.  She met the various \"scorers,\" the only one of which she remembered was Iroux, simply by the virtue of having been the first \"other\" dragon she met, not counting the mages who, as far as she was concerned, did not have names.  She did take care to remember their leader's name, though:  Aytrien, a <i>big</i> silver dragonoid, nearly 16 feet tall and 3 tons of muscle and fat.  She wondered how he managed to make his way around the hideout, though, what with his height.  He looked like he enjoyed his food and was an agreeable-enough fellow, besides running one of the largest and most heinous crime rings in the region...  Voxiche didn't mind, though, being that she herself was a wanted criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as everything else worth doing was done, Uroer and Voxiche adjourned to the foyer, where Voxiche was to make her \"mealtime decision\"...</span></div></div>",

Voxiche was still feeling unusually emotional about the fate of her last victim, so she tried to look away as they passed tables where the last of Leonard was being prepared either for dinner or for storage. When the two finally found their way to the end of the long tunnel, Voxiche could see why it was so wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Meal-Wyrms\u2019 compound so far had many well furnished, even some elaborately decorated rooms within it, the Feeding Rooms seemed more like a dungeon. The tunnel ended in a rather large square room that was at the center of three more large hallways. The floor was covered messily in straw, and along the walls of the square room were many wooden doors, the bottom halves of which were solid while the top halves were comprised of wooden slats, much like the doors in a stable. And then there was the horrible stench that filled the stale air of the room which, along with the considerable distance at which each door was spaced apart from one another, indicated that this indeed was where the Meal-Wyrms kept their \u201cpiggies\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche stopped at the entrance to the room, gaping as she looked around the large chamber. Normally she might have covered her nose at the stink, but her hunger had been growing considerably on the way here and so the smell indicating that her prey was her instead excited her. She panted lightly as she considered what was contained within these halls: Each cell held an obese victim from which to feed upon, from which to draw delicious fatty blood. She almost felt like a child in a treat shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer grinned, his smile unintentionally unsettling as it displayed his rows of sharp teeth, \u201cI see it is\u2026 a bit overwhelming, isn\u2019t it\u2026? There are many here you could drink from and they\u2019d probably not even feel it\u2026 they are\u2026\u201d He held his hands out to his sides to indicate girth, \u201cThat fat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh\u2026\u201d Voxiche nodded, not entirely there as she thought about all the blood that could be hers. Her painful thoughts about Leonard, her odd emotional flares she had been experiencing recently felt nonexistent as her mind was overcome with hunger, \u201cThere are so many here\u2026\u201d She said, unable to keep herself from drooling a little, \u201cHow do I decide\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonoid chuckled as he looked from the bat at his side to the cells and hallways in front of them, \u201cWell\u2026 would you prefer something light\u2026 you could say? Or do you want to drink from some of our\u2026 heavier\u2026 selections?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bring me the fattest fur you have to spare!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUroer guided the hungry Voxiche away from the Feeding Rooms, past the Fattening Chambers, and toward another series of rooms known to the Meal-Wyrms as 'The Feasting Chambers'. Unlike the Feeding Rooms, the Feasting Chambers were designed to be more like something one would find within a lavished and richly decorated palace, as the vast room was littered with large silk pillows, lavishly rich colored rugs and transparent curtains of various different colors, along with a large and comfy double Queen-Sized bed, made for someone who was consisted of 2 and a half tons of obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what caught the blood-sucking sorceress's eyes was the 3 ton mound of obese fat that was once a female rabbit. Every single part of the rabbit's body was coated in pure, unadulterated body fat. However, the most concentrated areas were the rabbit's belly, butt, legs, waist, hips, breasts, and arms, as all of that excessive fat rendered the exhausted bunny girl completely and utterly immobile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the massively obese rabbit slept from exhaustion, Voxiche couldn't help but drool at how much juicy fatty blood could be inside the massive mound of lard before her, as Uroer noticed Ms. Lecard drooling once more, as he gained her attention once more and said, \"The huge obese rabbit before you was once one of the Sultan of Ikzia's own belly-dancers. The Sultan is still one of the Meal-Wyrms' best clients, due to his unique...fetish. However, when he wanted this certain bellydancer as a part of his obese female harem, she ended up humiliating him. Thus, she was given to us as our own 'piggy' to fatten up. Fortunately for us, even at this size, Ms. Albina doesn't have a nasty case of *ahem* excessive flatulence.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Here however, hidden away from society and amongst those of similar tastes, she wasn't afraid to let herself slip a little. Still though, she should probably be polite to her new \"friends\", especially if she hoped to foster a useful relationship with them. As such, as soon Uroer was finished speaking, she once more had to wipe her lips and struggled to piece together what little she heard of his pattering, \"Yes yes! This is very fine indeed my dear Uroer... It will be a nice change of pace to savor a meal who has at least a <i>little</i> dignity...\" She grinned as she sauntered over to the rabbit girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Uroer watched the sorceress as she climbed upon the bed, causing it to creak under the added weight of the slim bat girl, \"Oooh, she doesn't even stink! In fact...\" She murred, leaning in close to the sleeping bunny's belly, gripping its belly in her paws, and sticking her nose against her fur to take a good, long whiff, \"Is this... lavender? Soooo wonderful! You masked her filthy hog-scent just for moi.~ I am flattered Uroer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed yes, Madame Lecard...\" Uroer replied, smiling and flicking his tongue as he bowed before his guest, \"The Meal-Wyrms always live to treat their... associates with the, ers... utmost satisfactions. She has been rubbed with some of our stronger oil and perfume in order to make your dinner... and the hospitality of your hosts... memorable and supremely enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A female dragonoid with sapphire scales emerged from the other side of the bunny girl's immense body, climbing down off the bed and carrying a bucket in hands dripping with viscous fragrances, \"You're welcomesss...\" She hissed at Uroer as she lugged the bucket out, a scowl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The male Meal-Wyrm only snorted at her as she passed, \"Rude! Not in front of guest foolish whelp!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Voxiche ignored the dragoness, even as she slammed the door on her way out, \"Hmm, she is quite the prize Uroer... she must have been the envy of the kingdom before she was fed to such size... And even then...\" She shivered a little before gripping the sleeping fur's belly more firmly, claws digging to her thick flesh just a bit as she began to climb towards its top. The bat crawled over to the girl's face, knees sinking into the mountain of blubber beneath her as her fingers brushed below one of the bunny's chins, \"Yes... and her make-up!\" She cooed in delight, noting the deep green eyeshadow and matching lipstick of the former belly dancer. She also couldn't help but notice the girl's many gold piercings, most lining her long, floppy ears and weighing them down to rest against her light blond hair. There wasn't too much distinct about her fur though, besides black-dyed floral designs that encircled her arms on fur that was otherwise a soothing light, creamy yellow, the color of butter, \"So exotic... Where did you say she hailed from? Most certainly from across the sea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yaessss... the land of Ikzia, as I have sssaid...\" Uroer replied, scratching at the scales of his cheek as he recalled specifics, \"She was the Sultan's pride, his fattest dancer, and the subject of ferocious desire by him. But when he demanded she join his personal harem, she declined it... She insisted she be his panguian... his queen... instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" Voxiche said, her fingers brushing against the fur of her plump cheeks now before she rubbed it tenderly with her palm, \"A woman with ambition... I do so love such things, but I doubt the Sultan was so impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Uroer nodded, \"Quite yes, sadly. The Sultan was infuriated as he still considered her a servant, no matter how much he craved...\" Uroer paused, his mouth agape as he fumbled for words, \"He... lusted for her curvaceous flesh. And of course the rabbit found no ally in the Queen she sought to replace... So she was sentenced to what the Sultan considered the most fitting punishment for her. He bought as much glutton's leaf as he could, smuggled from the heart of the Walled Lands, and force-fed her large quantities...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Voxiche cringed a bit and pulled her hand away for a moment, a strange sensation she hadn't felt often filling her gut. Pity, was it? That may have been it, \"Quoi Glutton's leaf, how atrocious!\" She gasped. She knew of the herb of course, and the devastating effects it could have on one's appetite and metabolism. Yet despite her outrage, she would honestly have used the plant in her own projects, had it not been so difficult to procure, \"The poor girl, it is no wonder she is such a whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Uroer chuckled a bit, an awkward and slightly unsettling sort of laugh, \"That is one way you can describe her I suppose... But yes, after her... I guess 'treatments' with the plant, they no longer needed to forcefeed her. They simply just let her loose at any food within reach and she carried out her punishment herself. The poor dancer... our agents who deal with the Sultan tell me she was quite skilled, able to move her body as gracefully as a ribbon in the breeze....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How cruel...\" She sighed, raking her claws lightly under the bunny girl's chins before tapping them to watch them quiver, \"Though I can't say the Sultan doesn't have great taste!\" She murred, poking the girl's face more firmly before giving her heavy cheeks a few light smacks, \"Wake up princess! We need to have a little chat, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bunny grumbled groggily, bright blue eyes blinking and nose twitching in sniffles as she struggled to regain consciousness. With a few decidedly firmer smacks from the vampire bat the rabbit girl was soon awake for the most part, eyes listing about the room wearily in confusion, \"Where am I....? Huff... huff... who are... mmmph.... Oooh, sooooo huuuuungry....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Voxiche's tall, pointed ears twitched as she heard the rabbit's mammoth stomach gurgle, and she couldn't stop a grin from spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It has been a while since the glutton's leaf had been ingested... but the recovery process is quite a lengthy one Madame Voxiche. She is still going in... ahhh... withdrawal, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a moment the bat looked back to the sleeping bunny girl's face before turning back to respond to Uroer. She could of course feed from the girl now while she was asleep... yet she could also use the girl's addiction to create an even larger meal for herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Withdrawal or no, we should not deny her some pampering, now should we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Uroer blinked, and then flicked his tongue and bowed, \"Of course, of course, I will return shortly with much food to appease the... guest.\" He said, before turning around and strolling though the door. Voxiche couldn't help but giggle a little. She was sure Uroer would not disappoint once he brought the food in: The Meal-Wyrm was just as likely eager to fatten their mutual meal up further, if not more so. The bat girl was still grinning as she turned her attentions back towards the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Now my petite, beautiful bunny, don't you worry a bit, my good lizard boy friend will bring you something yummy tout suite.~\" She said, slipping her fingers under the highest of the rabbit's chins and lifting it as much as the girl's neckfat would allow to meet her eyes, \"Please, in the meantime allow me to introduce myself: My name is Voxiche Lecard... and you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"A-Albina... huff ugghhhh... Albina Tuno...\" She gasped between breaths. \"Pleeeeeaaaaaase... I need fooooood....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Voxiche still smiled at her, but as she drug her claws down the obese bunny's cheek once more and down to her flabby neck, she pressed them more firmly against her flesh, drawing a few sharper breaths from the bunny as worry filled her eyes, \"Oh believe me, I know you poor, poor thing... I'm sure you practically need to <i>breathe</i> cake and tarts, don't you, you disgusting fatass...?\" And now Voxiche leaned in closer towards the helpless bunny's face, the rabbit trying to pull away from the bat girl but unable to as the sorceress's warm pants tickled the fur on her chins, \"But when Voxiche Lecard is speaking to you, you better listen... no matter how HUNGRY you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The rabbit whimpered, her eyes tearing up slightly as she tried to look away from the menacing bat who now filled her vision, \"P-P-Please... wh-who are you....? Huff! Huff! Huff! What do... mmmph... you want from m-me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Voxiche gripped the bunny girl's right ear before roughly yanking it before her face, causing the fat bunny to let out a husky but brief shriek of fear as the bat hissed into it, \"<i>Voxiche Lecard</i>, what did I just say to you!? I do not <i>see</i> any <i>fat</i>clogging up your silly floppy ears, but perhaps I am mistaken?\" She let go of the rabbit's ear as she whimpered more loudly, the obese girl squeezing her eyes shut tight to try and fight back the tears, \"As for what I want from a fat cow like you... well there is simply so much mon amie... but right now all I'd like is to get to know you a little...\" She purred, her grin returning to her face once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     This did little to ease the rabbit, but she was able to work up the courage to respond anyways, \"No... d-don't say things... mmnn... like that... I'm... I'm not f-f-fat! I'm... I'm just so HUNGRY! I'm always so hungr-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Albina let out another yelp as Voxiche grabbed one of the rabbit's neck rolls and shook the blubber roughly, sending ripples over her corpulent form, \"Oh no ma cherie, you are not fat at all, you are OBESE! You are a horrendous mountain of pudge! You cannot fool yourself about that, not when you can't even move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Cheeks burning red, the bunny girl began gasping in deep panicked pants, \"B-But it's... it's not fair.... huff! I used to be so beautiful, so much... mmnph... thinner... I could have been a queen...  and now look at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes yes, I've heard it all you poor dear. You had your chance and you blew it being a greedy piggy!\" Voxiche grinned as she let go of the girl's flab and patted her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Albina couldn't restrain herself any longer as tears began rolling down her chubby cheeks, causing her makeup to run, \"I wasn't...! My family... huff... mnnf... was so poor... when I got the chance to dance for the Sultan... I just wanted more... I had to be safe...\" She paused a moment before looking up at Voxiche, her eyes meeting the bat's as tears streamed from them freely now, \"I just needed to survive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As soon as these last words registered within her mind, Voxiche's vicious grin faltered a little as she felt something once more stir within her. <i>\"By the gods...\"</i> she thought to herself, suddenly feeling uncomfortable, <i>\"Am I really feeling sorry for her now?\"</i> Such an idea was ridiculous, the bat had heard piles upon piles of sob stories in her lifetime, many of them aimed against her by her meals in attempts to escape their dreaded fates. Then why was this one any different? Why did it affect her so? Why did that one word seem to reach her beyond all else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Voxiche frowned, grabbing the bunny's chin in her paw once more, \"And look at where it got you my dear. A blubbery morsel for a society of carnivorous dragons! Seems as though you've done a great job at 'surviving' so far, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The bunny girl seemed as though she were trying to hold back her tears, but this only caused her to sob harder, \"N-No...! You have to help me....! Unngh... huff... Please... I don't want to be eate-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Albina's whimpers were stifled by Voxiche as she placed a finger to the girl's plump lips, \"Shhh... We can't have you ruining such a pretty plump face with sadness and tears...\" The bat murred gently, her paw wiping some of said tears from the rabbit's face as the bat spread her legs wide atop the immobile woman's immense stomach, \"Mm, no no no... Besides, there's no need to worry over the future is there? Not when the present is so much more pleasant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I... I don't understand...\" the bunny girl whimpered before Voxiche drew closer, grabbing the bunny's cheeks in her paws before pressing her lips to Albina's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Albina's eyes widened and her breath quickened as the bat woman kissed her, wanting to protest at first but instead found herself doing nothing at all. As she felt the girl's tongue part her lips to deepen the kiss, she moaned huskily, letting go of all her fears and confusion and giving into the passion of the moment just as the sorceress had urged. She caught herself purring into the other girl's mouth as she felt her paw caress up her cheek and run through her hair to rub behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Voxiche broke the kiss and pulled back slightly, and Albina felt herself shiver as the bat's breath washed over her face, \"See? Not so bad, no? You bitch so much about how you're soooo fat... but you don't realize how much fun you can have, especially when you have an expert to show you how...\"  She cooed, her paw now brushing down the girl's cheeks and rubbing down to her chest, \"Here, let me show you...\" The bat said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A thick gasp escaped Albina's lips as she felt Voxiche's paw rub over her swollen chest, the woman's touch firm yet smooth as she massaged the rabbit's bare breast. Albina shivered, biting her lip as she waited for the bat to make her next move before she felt the sorcerss giver her tit a squeeze right over one of her plump nipples, causing the rabbit to let out a shocked, heavy moan, \"Ohhh...! That... it feels.... so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Good?\" Voxiche grinned as she nuzzled her body closer to the rabbit girl's, all while continuing to fondle her teasingly, \"No need to be worry my sweet piggy...  Just tell me what you want... what you need from me...\" She purred, licking at Albina's neck before giving her breast another squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The rabbit girl let out another moan, but it was stifled as a blush filled her cheeks, her eyes drawn to the door to the room as it was opened with a creak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Madame Lecard...?\" Uroer said as he peeked his head through the door, \"We have the food if you are.... ahhh.... not busy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Voxiche turned to look at the dragonoid, sliding her legs closer together as she pulled her paws away from the rabbit girl, \"Just get on with it Uroer...\" She said, trying her best not to growl, \"Quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, the food is here...\" He continued, \"Is there anything else you need for now, Madame Lecard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche looked down as she thought for a moment, another strange pang striking her gut. Usually Voxiche would have simply told the Meal Wyrm to leave her alone... but now she began to think back to what Albina had said to her earlier... and began to wonder if she had enough clout with the Wyrms already to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Idiotic, Voxiche!\"</i> She thought to herself as she furrowed her brow, <i>\"Why would you want to help her? It makes no sense!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she looked back up at Uroer, she wasn't so sure.</span></div></div>",

So, out of the many sob stories, why would you even care about this blubbery excuse of a belly dancer!?!\" Her dark thoughts said, as Voxiche's mind was literally split down the middle. One side wanted to keep Albina as something more than just another \"project\", while the other part of her conscience wanted to have Albina as the bat girl's newest pet project, just as the sympathetic side of her mind retaliated and replied, \"Don't you get it, Voxiche? She's just like you! Sure, you don't weigh around 6000 pounds, but still...she wanted to survive, and that was it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mental civil war inside Voxiche's mind wasn't exactly a fun feeling. After all, everything has a price on it. So eventually, Voxiche made up her mind on what to do with Albina Tuno, which came in the form of....</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t take much from Leonard, only a snack as she sometimes did, but just because it was a small amount, that didn\u2019t mean the German Shepherd didn\u2019t have to hate it. He grunted helplessly, glaring at the bat as she looked down at him, smiling in her sadistically gloating fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh poo, is my poor little doggy boy still upset about the whole food-slave deal? It\u2019s what you deserve you stupid little mongrel!\u201d She snickered as she slapped his puffy cheeks, making them jiggle and causing Leonard to growl, \u201cAwww, are you hungry my dear? Oh don\u2019t you worry about that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat cackled and slid down the dog\u2019s mountainous belly, landing on the floor with a ground shaking thud. She strolled over to the stairs and turned to face her \u201cguest\u201d, admiring her handwork as she spoke to him once more, \u201cUnfortunately we are all out of food! It looks like <i>somebody</i> ate it all, but don\u2019t fret my helpless darling, Madame Lecard promised you\u2019d never go hungry, and that is a promise I intend to keep\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire bat began to climb the stairs, speaking over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll just be gone for a short while, but I will return with the most delicious treats from the best this shithole of a village has to offer! I know a nice small bakery that sells the cutest cupcakes, you\u2019ll love them so much, you won\u2019t be able to stop eating them\u2026 whether you wanted to or not\u2026\u201d She cackled maliciously and blew the immobile bounty hunter a kiss, \u201cTa-ta mi amore\u2019! Don\u2019t miss me <i>too </i>much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard struggled to bark at his jailer, but despite all of the strain, all he could let out was a loud, wet belch. He grunted even louder now, panting as he watched Voxiche\u2019 disappear up the stairs and out of sight. He hated her, more than any other person he had ever been in contact with, that smug, arrogant bitch. He reflected on how this had happened, how such a seemingly simple bounty had gone so horribly wrong. When he first saw the sorceress\u2019s wanted poster on a board in Little Silverhorne he thought it couldn\u2019t have been any easier, and the gold that the poster promised seemed like far too much for someone like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA murderous vampire bat that fattens up her victims?\u201d the dog thought to himself, he found himself thinking quite a bit ever since he lost his mobility, \u201cHow could that have been hard? Just don\u2019t eat anything, don\u2019t let her seduce you into eating anything, stay the hell away from food, and she can\u2019t do a damn thing to you!\u201d<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nAnd yet he was reckless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard remembered it vividly. It was a hot, muggy night, the kind that makes you feel like you were breathing in soup. He had tracked her to a house on the outskirts of some backwater farming town called Plowtonsville thanks to a tip he got off of one of the villagers. He was confident, perhaps too confident that he would bag his mark, but things took a turn for the worse when inside he had found the farmstead\u2019s owner. She was a young vixen, her fur a bright, healthy orange, her hair as yellow and natural as the wheat growing in the fields outside. She would have looked beautiful, except for the fact that she was a mound of wobbling blubber, unable to move, the shredded overalls of a much thinner woman crushed beneath her massive buttocks and stomach. When she looked at him, tears streaming down her bulbous cheeks, blood dripping from an all too familiar bite mark on her thick, flabby neck, he couldn\u2019t stop himself. By the time he had run inside the house he was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe must have been out for at least a day the bitch hit him in the back of the head, for he woke up where he was now. He had found himself in this very basement, although half a dozen tons lighter, his wrists bound to the floor by iron shackles and chains. That was when she started to feed him, started to make him into the useless pile of blubber he was now. She delighted in every moment, every last morsel she forced past his lips, relishing that she had turned the hunter into the hunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut force-feeding the German Shepherd wasn\u2019t enough. She wanted to humiliate him and demean him, make him swallow his pride as well as her sweets and treats. And so she turned to her magic, choosing a wretched curse from an ancient looking tome of foul sorcery, a curse that still wracked his body even now, one of crippling hunger. Ever since she had whispered those words into his ear, dark and mysterious words of power, he was doomed to be a slave not only to her but to his own stomach. With each morsel she fed him he grew hungrier, with each drink she poured down his throat he grew thirstier. His belly never seemed satisfied until every square inch of it was stretched nice and tight, and as he grew wider, that became more and more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd now, even while she was gone, and he was alone his mind returned to food. Leonard gasped as his belly rumbled and quaked, the flab coating it jiggling violently as it demanded satisfaction. He struggled not to let it distract him, but it became harder and harder with each passing second he was without food. Almost as bad as his desire for sustenance was his desire for rest, for even though he was almost positive he had just woken up an hour or two ago, he was already feeling tired. The beastman was hardly surprised, his lifestyle could only be described as sedentary, and it didn\u2019t help that pounds and pounds of fat laden pastries and sugar packed frosting were currently digesting in his massive gut, dangerously close to lulling him into a food coma. He managed to fight it off though, difficult as it was to for him, he knew that this was his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t. Voxiche\u2019 hardly left Leonard alone like this; even her trips to secure food for her victim were rare. The bounty hunter suspected she either bought large quantities and stored it elsewhere, or created some of the more basic edibles with her magic, but if he was going to escape then now was his one opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis shackles had been removed the day before when his weight finally surpassed his legs\u2019 strength and pinned him to the ground, yet the dog did not lose hope. Even though he was massively obese he still hadn\u2019t had much opportunity to try to move, not like this, and so he gathered his strength and began to focus on shifting his bulk to his feet. He knew deep down that it was a long shot, but it was his only way and so he still had to try. The canine grunted as he strained himself, trying to push his legs down with all his might and muscle, teeth grinding, sweat beginning to roll off his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYet his feet, surrounded and separated from the ground by the large mounds of fat his legs had become, merely wiggled pathetically in the air. He continued to try though, struggling even harder than before. There were no locks he could see, and he wasn\u2019t being bound by magic nor restraints, only his own massive girth. Hate began to well up in him once more as he realized that it was probably an intentional move on Voxiche\u2019s behalf, her smug way of mocking him and his situation. This thought only made him push himself harder, yet as he still couldn\u2019t feel that he was achieving anything other than pain to himself, his resolve quickly disappeared.  Soon after he gave up, sinking back down into his mammoth, mountainous body, his heart racing and pumping hard and tortuously as he gasped and wheeze for breath.  The helpless dog quickly became overcome by a deep sense of dread as he realized just how helplessly obese he was and just how bleak his situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair\u2026\u201d He thought, whimpering loudly as he gasped for breath, \u201cI can\u2019t even lift my arms anymore, how the hell am I going to escape? Even if I could move how could I fit through the door? How could I run fast enough to get away from that bitch of a bat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe started to whimper louder, filled with regret over choosing to hunt for Voxiche\u2019 Lecard to begin with, \u201cHow bad could it be? Even if I do get fat, how bad could it be? Leonard, you fool\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuddenly he heard a noise, as though a wing flapping or a page being turned\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe searched the room desperately for the source of the noise, a task hard enough for a man who couldn\u2019t even turn his head, let alone move his body around. All he could do was look about the room with his eyes and hope it was in his field of vision. He spotted his sword lying on the table against the wall, but it was useless to him in this state, far out of reach, probably put there to mock him. Yet what was this? Next to the sword on the table, almost out of his field of vision was a book, and not just any book but the witch\u2019s spell book!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis was perfect! He could even make out the words on the page, just barely, and while he wasn\u2019t sure what they would do it was his best bet on getting out of this gluttonous hell alive. He had to memorize the words, that\u2019s all he had to do, remember them and wait for Lecard. Yet even something so seemingly simple was complicated by his seemingly ever present hunger and the drowsiness that threatened to overtake him with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut he couldn\u2019t let it, if he fell asleep now his opportunity would be gone, as well as any chance at freedom. He just wished he wasn't so distracted by hunger, his straining heart, by her wonderful scent...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not even an hour later, Leonard heard the front door open and slam shut, followed by Voxiche's voice calling to him melodiously, \"Oh sweetie, I'm <i>baaaaaack!</i> And you will LOVE what I brought you my sweet fatty boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immobile canine's breathing grew more frantic as he waited for his tormentor, waited for his opportunity. He could hardly speak in his current state, but he had hoped it was more possible than standing seemed. He had to stay calm, had to keep thinking of those two words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet when the bat sorceress finally descended the stairs, Leonard was caught off guard. Surprisingly, all she had brought with her was another single basket of baked goods, clutched to her chest with one arm while she waved at him playfully with the other. Why did she bring so little? Was she hiding the rest upstairs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do anything while I was out...?\" She called down to him cheerfully, and soon began to cackle at her own cruel joke, \"Oh wait, I forgot about your <i>little</i> eating problem, my apologies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the dog caught sight of the food she carried, he wasn't left with much more room to think, for the hunger in his stomach only grew worse, roaring loudly and causing his entire paunch to shake. Voxiche's eyes lit up with mischievous fire as she heard this, and she wasted no time grasping at his belly rolls and scaling his gut to perch herself on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tee-hee! So it seems you <i>have</i> missed me, haven't you my precious piggy boy!\" She reached towards his fat face, pinching the ample fat of his cheek between her fingers, causing him to glare even harder than usual at her, \"Don't you give me that look, you're stomach speaks volumes! Though I suppose it'll have to do all the talking for you anyways, what with all the chins getting in your way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned wickedly, that horrible, evil smile that Leonard hated. She then pulled out a cupcake from the basket, one with ample frosting and sprinkles, \"Now here's your reward for being such a good boy while I was out... open wide...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was somewhat shocked when he did so immediately, \"So, you have stopped resisting the curse then, mmm...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Con.... coooonnn.... huffff....\" Leonard wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this? What could be so important that you'd actually go through the effort to tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consump.....tius..... hufff.... hurrrr..... Fullesti.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat girl's long, sensitive ears shot straight up, her pupils shrinking momentarily, before she looked down at the cupcake and shrugged, \"Babbling like a fool, bounty hunter? I thought that was below even you! Oh well, time to feed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of forcing the cupcake into the dog's maw, she instead shoved it into her own, devouring it ravenously as if possessed by an immense hunger, moaning and gasping erotically as if she enjoyed it immensely. An overwhelming combination of pride, victory, and relief washed over Leonard as he joyfully watched the bat devour the rest of the treat swiftly, her own tricks turned against her. He chuckled deeply as he watched her lick every last bit of frosting from her fingers, imagining her eating herself even bigger than he was now. All he had to do was wait for his rescue, other bounty hunters were bound to be looking for Voxiche', and soon they would find them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to relax now, relieved he had finally found a way out of this horrible mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as he watch Voxiche' pick up a fat eclair, stuffed to bursting with custard, she stopped it right before her parted lips and then turned to face him, that all too familiar look of glee in her eyes, \"Oh yes puppy, these are <i>so</i> delicious, but who am I to deprive my dumb, fat, <i>treacherous</i> boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with those words she gripped the eclair firmly and rammed it straight down Leonard's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sick, stinky, slobby fat <i>fuck!</i>\" She shouted, grabbing a three donuts and shoving them all into his mouth, crumbs spilling and bouncing down his chins, \"Did you honestly think a pathetic mutt like <i>you</i> could outwit ME!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard swallowed the donuts, the hardly chewed pastries going down hard as he gasped for breath. His heart pounded in absolute terror, pain shooting throughout his chest as it tried to keep up with the strain of constant and violent force-feeding. The bat left him little time to catch his breath before cramming several cookies into his open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all I have done for you! After all the food and pampering and love, and this is how you repay me?! Do you know how much food I gave you? Enough to feed this entire city <i>for a week!</i> But I guess you aren't the <i>least</i> bit grateful...\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her rage it didn't take her long to empty the basket entirely into Leonard's gut, and so she set it down, reaching a hand over her head as she glared at him. Not long after her spell book closed itself and slid off the table, launching through the air and into her grip. She slammed it down roughly upon his large, sensitive gut, sending ripples and jiggles through its flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you gassy hog, you wanted to play with my spells? you must be getting horribly bored of my little curse then... well why didn't you just tell me! I have plenty more here for you to amuse yourself with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the old, thick book with a loud crack and began to flip through its many pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, now lets see which of these fun incantations would you like to try? Oh they all sound so wonderful! How about we light your fur on fire? Or fill that embarrassingly large tummy of yours with sand? I doubt you'd even <i>try</i> getting up then... Or perhaps I could simply use this one here and give you spots? Haha! Why is that one even in here, so useless... Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this one is <i>magnifique'!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were times. Brief periods when he just sat in the basement and languished, stewing in his own sweat. It was cool when he first came here, but the place retained his body heat well. And it had gotten fairly warm, humid, and thick with his scent. But there were times when he wasn't eating. Feedings were furious efforts, hours long, to fill his stomach to bursting, toy with him, then leave him be for hours at end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought that his life would be NOTHING but a torrent of food was daunting. He could never walk again. His entire world was this basement, listening to his expansive backside burst from time to time, the sounds of his swollen stomach out in front of him digest. He tried to lift one arm to defend as the bat slipped forward, sliding a glass funnel into his mouth. But his arms were too heavy, thick pillows that rested on either side of him, bouyed up to a nearly ninety degree angle by enormous hips and thighs, and pinned back by thick slabs of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered quietly to herself, and he whined as she watches, incantations flowing out from her lips as she rubbed a fine mixture of an obscene amount of powdered gold and hog fat over the rim of the funnel. \"Adipem infinitius.\" A flash of purple flooded the basement and then the powdered gold and hog fat were gone. Instead, the funnel began to fill and Leonard immediately gagged. It wasn't even the pastries he loved. It was simply warm hog fat, pouring down the funnel into his gullet. He tried to work out the funnel with his lips and tongue, but it was stuck fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche reached out, cupping a fat cheek as she leaned in against the shiny sweating bulk of the dog, \"Oh, had you just been good. You could have been such a long treat.\" She reared back to slap those fat cheeks, making Leonard whine pitifully. \"But you just couldn't help yourself.\" She pulled out a small bit of fleece, and weaved another simple few words. A small transparent german shepherd appeared in the air over Leonard. Angled so he could see it over the funnel. It was standing, but the comically obese nature of the dog made it realize it was him. So that he could see how fat he had truly become as his stomach steadily filled. He didn't know people could GET that fat. His stomach rested out in front of him as a massive doughy belly, dented in the middle by a deep navel. It rested on what would be the ground, he supposed, so he couldn't see his feet. But he could see his hips. He was wider than he was tall, his ass having spread out into two huge globes behind him. Two fat moobs spread to either side of his belly, and two fat arms were pushed up by his hips. His face was fat, buried by cheeks and neckrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do.\" She sighs wistfully. \"I'm going to need jars. And some rendering pots...\" She waved a hand, \"And find another bounty hunter to seduce. Preserved blood is never the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was making plans as if this was her last meeting with him. The illusion wasn't getting fatter, but that doughy belly was getting rounder. It spread out in all directions to match the steady unyielding flow of lard into his belly. Voxiche was certainly enjoying herself. New beads of sweat were coming up on Leonard's face as she spoke, smoothing her hands over the fat sweaty orb as it grew out. \"I might be able to get a butcher to come in at the dead of night.\" It churned loudly under her hand. Usually it was just food he ate, but no, the heavy warm liquid sloshed and churned noisily within him. \"They buy by the pound, you know.\" She cooed, leaning over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funnel worked without cease. Grease dribbled from his chins and cheeks as he struggled to drink it as steady as it came. It was a slow steady process, letting the stuff ooze down his throat. It moved in at a gradual trickle. Voxiche began to move about the basement, taking time to prepare huge jugs with liquids. It wasn't like the stuffing before. Furious sessions of cramming him full. Instead, it was an inexorable growth, his stomach slowly pushing out as it filled with more of the warm lard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours passed and Leonard began to whine. His stomach was starting to fill, and he needed a break. The brown furred orb was pushing up into his field of view, and even on the illusion it looked massive. It slowly stretched taut on either side over the course of the next hour, and his whining grew more insistent. It wouldn't stop though. Instead, his belly continued to push out to either side, the stomach underneath growing taut and full. The grease continued to push inside, stretching the muscles, pushing them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Voxiche made her way upstairs, Leonard realized, she didn't intend to ever let it stop. </span></div></div>",

The figure was wearing a red masquerade mask that obscured their face in addition to the having the hood from their cloak covering the top of their head. The figure then removed the hose from Leonard's mouth allowing the bloated canine to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Leonard McFielder. I am the Lipomancer,\" the figured said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of sweat began trickling down Leonard's body as the Lipomancer gave Leonard's body a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My have you grown handsomely since you left for the bounty I put on my archrival, Voxiche, but we're not here to discuss your massive body. I am here to make a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What kind of deal? Surely, this must be some kind of trick.</i> Leonard thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guarantee this isn't a trick my massive doggo. I could give you enough strength to move your massive body with ease. All you have to do is accept my proposal of becoming my personal bounty hunter. I could really use a canine of your size and talents on my staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard's eyes widened with surprise. <i>Did the Lipomancer just read my mind? If you can really read minds then how do I know you are telling the truth? Also, will this guarantee my revenge on that maniacal sorceress?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer chuckled as they pulled out a small green vial out of their robe. \"Drink this and you'll have herculean strength to freely move in your enormous body. You must drink this quickly before my spell wears off. I have temporarily frozen time. Once it wears off Voxiche will know that I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If it means seeing the outdoors again and getting paid handsomely then I'm in. Also, I would love to squash that bitch for all the torture she put me through.</i> Leonard thought as he opened his mouth widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer grinned as he gave Leonard the vial. Leonard moaned on delight as he drank the vial. Once he finished the vial, Leonard bleched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer climbed onto Leonard's shoulder. Shortly afterward Leonard began to grow larger. As he grew he could feel a several new pounds of muscle being added as he grew fatter. After a few minutes Leonard stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard slowly began to stand up. Tears of joy ran down his cheeks as he used his new strength to stand for the first time in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's leave Leonard.

Instead, his body took up the job of digesting all that animal fat and the second stage begun. The little illusion above him added insult to injury as he watched it expand. He watched as fat began to deposit itself on his form. Around the hips first, his prodigious ass slowly expanding. Thighs pushing further apart and pushing more and move down over his feet. His belly retained the same gravid bloated shape, unable to digest quickly enough, instead stretching very slowly around an ever increasing payload of fat. His cheeks slowly puffed up with more fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is like a sauna in here today. I've had to tell people I'm tanning hides in here. A new very noisy method.\" The luscious bat said as she stepped down each step. She had on a pair of thick wax leather boots used for wading in streams. A soaked rag around her mouth. She stepped down into the basement with a splash. A foot of musky water now inhabited the basement. She calmly moved through the water, stockpiling yet another alchemically prepared jug among the others, before she let herself revel in her deed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion was still floating above, standing with arms outward, but it didn't matter anymore. Both versions of the dog spread out so much, no position mattered. Leonard's eyes were glazed and sleep deprived. He whined and moaned again as Voxiche drew near. A week without sleep wasn't good on the boy. But it was probably also the heat. The house above shook as the shepherd let out another of many thunderous farts, rippling the two fat bloated asscheeks. They pushed up against the eight foot ceiling now, and filled up the entire back of the cave. On the illusion, they were two comically huge orbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach was starting to touch the ceiling itself now, pink and red and shiny from the thinning fur and the week long taut skin. Voxiche thumped it harshly, earning another moan and burst of gas from the dog. He was long buried in his own lard, his arms pinned like two marshmellows with his fat paws just barely poking out. And his face... his face was a valley between the peaks of his belly and ass. The glass funnel marked the point where it was, with his back roll just starting to roll over his eyes, two huge cheeks pushing up at either side of his muzzle. His nose was just barely above a musky lake of sweat where it was pouring out from all over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche's breathing grew shorter as she moved her way onto the stool, putting on her apron to soak up the sweat as she leaned over. Leonard's breathing was short, labored. He whined with pain as his stomach continued to throb. Voxiche coaxed at one huge neckroll, leaning down. She was quivering with excitement, one hand between her legs as she bit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was glorious. For both of them. Voxiche moaned in heat as she lapped up the rich blood. So perfect, so thick. Like nothing she had ever tasted before. Her loins quivered and she dipped her fingers down to please herself as she savored another deep lap of the blood. Sweat began to pour more profusely down from Leonard, dripping from roll to roll, then to the floor as he felt his long buried erection throb. Each new moan came with another thunderous fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoxiche reached up and gently tweaked the funnel. The lard turned from a tickle to a gush. Fat drooled down from his muzzle as he strained to continue gulping out of mindless habit. The creaking of his stomach was only matched in volume by the thunderous expulsions of gas. He whimpered as both got louder by the passing moment. His stomach strained, new stretch marks forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat let out a happy groan as her own climax came, just watching the dog struggle to gulp and gulp driving her over the edge. She slid her fingers in and out of herself as she watched Leonard gulp bigger and bigger gulps, stomach struggling against every new gulp. She let him taste a moment of orgasm, the lazy gush of cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final noise was muted, a dulled bang as the poor Leonard simply erupted, moaning in delight at the last feeling. Voxiche sighed in sadistic pleasure... She would have months with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supply didn't last as long as Voxiche hoped. It was TOO good. She carefully put on her sun dress. This was the second one she had to order this month. The basement was finally cleaned, pumped and ready. But it has only been two months that her supply lasted, instead of a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat had gone from curvy to obese, but magic kept it in all the right places. Her breasts were weighty and unbelievably large, wobbling on top of her thrusting belly. Her ass made getting through the door uneasy, but the steady swing of the two obscene cheeks made it easier to entice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to go hunting for a new snack...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days had passed. Two whole days of being filled with pure, raw lard. Two whole days of being stuffed to his limits. Enough time for Leonard to swallow dozens of barrels of the unhealthiest sludge one could think of and turn it into even more fat on his already disgustingly obese frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor dog couldn't even imagine he could get any fatter before that damnable funnel had been crammed in his maw. Now he hardly needed to imagine. This was what his life had become, this constant, inescapable nightmare, and it was only just getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whimpered weakly, but it sounded more like a hideous gurgle past the rows of flabby chins, past the constant surge of pork fat filling his throat. He wanted to scream, he wanted to cry, but he could barely manage even that. The torrent of lard would sometimes slow to a trickle; just to let him digest, just to keep his stomach right near the edge of bursting as it was slowly stretched, slowly and painfully trained to pack away more and more. All he could focus on at this point was swallowing. It was either that, or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhhrrr... uuurrhhk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLard and spittle spurted past Leonard's fat lips, some of it spilling up his nostrils as he gagged heavily. Tears welled up in his eyes but they vanished as he squeezed them shut, his throat bulging as he struggled to swallow the heavy flow of grease back down his throat instead of choking on it. He was successful, but at the back of his mind he knew this wouldn't be the last time that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more hours passed, and more and more weight piled onto his body just as relentlessly as the grease poured into his painfully taut gut. He began to wonder what would kill him first, his stomach finally giving out or drowning in the slick, slimy flood of lard when he suddenly heard footsteps on the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart began to race, faster and faster as he dreaded the approach of his vampiric captor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, his heart leapt as the doberman came into view, and then sunk as panic seized the obese german shepherd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard!\" The man gasped, his dark longcoat flapping behind him as he ran towards the other much larger canine, \"What did she do to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard's eyes flicked bulged and his thick, nearly round fingers wiggled as he began to gag once again on the endless flow of lard spilling from the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doberman barked in a panic, pausing only a moment to note the tiny, illusory duplicate of Leonard's massive body hovering above his head before scrambling to climb onto his enormous and soft belly. The German shepherd's eyes rolled and he groaned in pain as the lard in the funnel began to bubble and spill both from the top and where it met his overstuffed mouth. The doberman gritted his teeth as he caught sight of the other dog, gritting his teeth in frustration and despair as his boots slipped against Leonard's sweaty, greasy fur, his ears drooping as he heard Leonard's yelp of pain muffled into a thick, wet gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no, no!\" He growled, tearing his horrified gaze away from the other canine as he regained his purchase and pulled himself up to Leonard's flabby neck rolls, desperately wiping the sweat from his paws onto his goat before he grasped at the funnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonard's breathing began to slow, his eyes drooping and face growing purple under his fur as the doberman tugged at the rim of the funnel, finding it stuck between the freakishly obese dog's lips as though they were fused to it. The thin dog's eyes darted up to Leonard's face, panic filling them before he started to tug at the funnel with his left paw while slamming his right fist against Leonard's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Leonard! Don't give up! Please! It's Trent! It's me, Leo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright, purple flash filled the room as two distinct but equally important things happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was that a surge of magical energy arced around the edges of the funnel and leapt onto Trent's paws. The purple lightning crawled up the dog's arms as he howled with pain and stumbled backwards, rolling down the slope of Leonard's stomach and landing with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing that happened was that the funnel finally yanked free from the German shepherd's lips, spiraling through the air as it was released from both Trent's paws and the other male's maw. Globs of lard were slung from the funnel as the magical energy dancing around it began to falter, then fizzle, then completely dissipate; both the seal holding it to Leonard's mouth and the enchantment bringing in the seemingly infinite supply of lard vanishing simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth finally clear, Leonard began to gag harder, coughing up the lard filling his throat as Trent scrambled to get to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept somehow he couldn't. His muscles spasmed as his body twisted on the ground, arcs of electrical energy coursing over the entirety of the canine's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dammit... no..!\" He groaned weakly. He tried to turn to face his partner as he heard the other dog continue to gag and gurgle and choke, but it seemed as though every time he moved the pain grew worse, \"It was a... a-a..!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trap..?\" A feminine voice cooed from above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent turned just enough to see a familiar visage leering at him from atop Leonard's mountain of a belly. The face of Voxiche Lecard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Trent gritted out, his face a rictus of pain as he watched her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" She purred viciously, her face split by a grin as she licked her fangs, \"It would seem I have lucked out with you, have I not bounty hunters?\" The bat laughed as she crossed her legs, slapping her paws upon her knees as she cackled, \"Two puppies for the price of one! Who knew I was so popular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Was all the paralyzed Doberman could groan out as he looked into the woman's gleeful eyes, and then his gaze shifted to Leonard who was still trying to clear his throat. He reached his arm down for the dagger in his belt, but even that sent a fresh helping of agony bolting through his body as Voxiche cackled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh maybe it isn't me who is the popular one, is it?\" Voxiche said as she looked back at the obese German shepherd, \"And here I thought piggy boy Leonard here was a useless sack of fat, but it would appear he still makes the most excellent bait, no? Well I hope you are hungry, my new friend...\" The bat purred, licking her lips once more, \"Because it looks like I will be feeding for two now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he didn't have much time before the vampire bat swooped down to collect her latest prey, Trent's heart pounded as he tried to focus on his next course of action.</span></div></div>",

While the richer sections of the city blazed with streetlights and lamplight spilling forth from the various manors and mansions, the poorer distracts were left to succumb to the deep darkness of the moonless night. A few token guards patrolled the shanty towns, but they rarely did anything to stop the rampant crime common to the slums. The few people braving the shadows quickly darted from location to location as quickly as possible, typically from one run down tavern to another. None of the people on the streets ever saw the shadow darting from rooftop to rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow paused near one of the district walls, quietly observing a pair of guards walking along the base of the barrier. The flickering light from the torch barely illuminated a head peaking over the edge of the dilapidated roof; a hood wrapped around the back of the head and a tight fitting cloth piece was pulled over the muzzle, leaving only the pale eyes and a small strip of tiny midnight blue scales exposed. The guards never looked up to see they were being watched and continued on their way. Once they had safely gone around the corner, the figure continued to wait for a few seconds to make sure there was no one else coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, the person backed up from the edge of the roof before a running leap carried them across the gap to the wall, where a quick flap of a set of wings hidden beneath the cloak allowed them to dart up and over to the roof of a merchant on the other side. Upon landing, the cloak was pulled back, revealing black form-fitting leather armor around a slender female body. After pulling the cloak back around her body and a quick glance around to confirm her position, the cloaked figure took off across the rooftops again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be more careful now, being in a brighter section of the city; fortunately, despite the extra light, there were fewer people out on the streets at this time of night in this area. Nearing her destination, the figure paused in the shadow of a chimney and pulled the cloth covering her face down to better smell for any unseen guards or other people. Not smelling anything out of the ordinary, the draconic muzzle pulled into a slight grin before being covered up again. With that, Kana set off with her objective plainly obvious ahead of her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kana ran out of rooftops just at the edge of the grounds of a large mansion within the city. A wide street separated the nearest buildings from the wrought iron fence surrounding the manicured lawn, but this posed little problem as the dragoness performed another running jump with a boost of her wings to drop silently to the grass. A quick dash across the rolling hills brought her to the topiary nearer the building, near enough to be able to plan a path between the few guards patrolling the paths in the gardens on this side of the manor. Darting through the shadows, Kana was soon right below a darkened window barely cracked open. Taking advantage of the situation, she eased the window open, careful in case of a noisy hinge. Fortunately, the window opened with barely a noise, and she slipped in, pulling the pane nearly shut behind her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself in a sitting room generously furnished with many expensive looking decorations. While Kana did help herself to a few choice pieces from around the room, she was after a specific target, so she quickly continued on her way. A peek through the keyhole showed no sign of life in the hallway outside nearby, so she quietly slipped out, letting the door click shut. Moving swiftly through the hallways, she had to sometimes duck into alcoves or down detours to avoid a passing guard or servant. Strangely, the dragoness noted that the eyes of everyone she saw seemed to be slightly glazed over, and their motions were a bit stiff. It almost looked like all of the people in the mansion were under some sort of spell or enchantment. Shrugging it off, she continued on her way, knowing approximately where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly found herself in trouble when she ended up boxed in with people coming from both directions. The only choice she had to hide was a door next to her, with no time to check it out she was forced to dart through it just before the people were able to see her in the shadows. As she leaned against the door, she could hear the footsteps pass by right outside. Letting out a sigh of relief, she then froze when she heard a voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now my dear, you can surely do better than this,\u201d the haughty voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhipping around, Kana was again relieved to see that the speaker wasn\u2019t taking to her and hadn\u2019t even noticed her at all. The vixen in question seemed to be speaking to a rather unfortunate raccoon fem, tatters of a maid outfit was trapped around the raccoon\u2019s body. The clothing looks like it might have fit better if the girl wasn\u2019t fattened and stuffed to such a ridiculous degree, her whole body reduced to a jiggling wobbling mass that oozed over the edges of the bed, while her carriage sized gut looked like it might be rock hard to the touch despite the fat covering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am, I\u2026urp,\u201d the raccoon  managed to gasp out with the rest of whatever she was going to say cut off as the vixen shoved a massive pastry into the young woman\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen riding atop the bloated stomach wasn\u2019t what Kana would consider skinny either, but she was quite a bit lighter than the young woman below her. It took Kana several minutes to recognize her as Lady Mantrillian, the owner of the mansion as well as the current owner of her target. From all reports, the Lady was rail thin and quite the strait-laced prude, nothing like the fattened woman stuffing the poor woman beneath her and obviously enjoying the action quite a bit. As Kana watched, the Lady pulled another huge pastry out of thin air before quickly shoving it into the maid\u2019s mouth to chase its brother. There had also been no mention of Lady Mantrillian having any sort of magical talent either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana brought herself up short suddenly, realizing that she had been slowly walking forward towards the spectacle. A quiet whispering scratched at the back of her mind, but not loud enough for her to understand the words. Shaking her head, she found that she had again walked closer to the bed, being drawn towards the two women by some unseen force, though neither had noticed her yet, too engrossed with what they were doing. It occurred to Kana that Lady Mantrillian had likely put some sort of spell over the rest of her staff, explaining the stiff motion and glazed eyes. The thought that perhaps the recent item that the Lady had acquired, and that was Kana\u2019s target, was the reason for the sudden change of personality and her new magical abilities was pushed out of her mind as the whispering grew stronger for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head more vigorously, Kana forced herself away from the bed, though her mind and body seemed to protest with each step that she took. The feeling grew weaker when she returned back to the door, but didn\u2019t pass away completely. Cracking the door open, she peeked out and saw no sign of anyone outside, and was about to head out and find the vault she was looking for when she gave another look over her shoulder. She saw that Lady Mantrillian was now roughly groping the younger woman\u2019s breasts, both of them letting out little erotic moans. A thought for Kana to stay here floated through her mind, and if she hadn\u2019t been so foggy headed, she might have realized that the thought wasn\u2019t her own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A burst of willpower forced Kana to turn away from the scene before her, and she swooped through the door and shut it behind her before she could look back again. Shaking her head helped dispel some of the fog gripping her mind and somewhat quieted the whispers plaguing her thoughts. A quick glance around let her remember her position compared to her target, and she set off before another person came by to see her standing there. Reaching the lower levels of the mansion, she found that no lights were to be seen, leaving it all pitch black. Reaching a hand out, she performed a quick series of hand motions, tapping into the tiny trickle of magic she possessed. As she finished, she blinked a couple times before the spell took effect, allowing her to see in the dark without any outward sign of light. Able to see again, Kana set off into the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued on her way, her thoughts drifted to the one who taught her that simple spell: Talia, a snake mage in one of the local guild halls. Kana and Talia had met rather unexpectedly when the dragoness was trying to escape from a rather persistent group after an accidently botched job. Kana had managed to gain a slight lead and saw an open window that she could reach. Quickly leaping through the window had deposited her on a bed\u2026as well as the unfortunate occupant of the bed: Talia. Realizing what she had done, Kana had quickly silenced the serpent \u2013 who didn\u2019t seem to be putting up much of a fight anyways \u2013 as she made sure that the mob hadn\u2019t seen her hasty hiding spot. Once the gang had passed, Kana released the serpent who promptly responded with a bolt of energy that threw the dragoness across the room. A quick explanation with some lies mixed with enough truth was all that saved Kana from a repeat blast. After the unpleasantness, the two actually started a conversation that turned into a casual relationship over the following months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana had to admit that Talia was attractive in a bookish way, with a slender frame with some womanly curves and bright shiny scales, though the standard mage robe that she wore hid most of this. During the course of their relationship, Talia had recognized Kana\u2019s minor magical talent and had helped her nurture it in a few directions like her dark sight, having been told about Kana\u2019s late night activities by the dragoness. It had all come to an end rather suddenly when Talia was transferred away from the capital to another city far away. Kana had thought of maybe tracking Talia down, but another job always came up and she shoved off the idea for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kana continued to stalk through the dark halls within the bowels of the mansion the whispering continued to scratch at the back of her mind, though she was starting to get used to the constant low noise. It subtlety nudged her mind to keep thinking back to Talia and their dalliance. She swiftly stepped through the darkness while her mind\u2019s eye watched the memories of Talia cascading through her thoughts. She never realized how the memories were being twisted and changed as she thought back to them. It started with their first meeting, where the formerly slim serpent was a bit pudgier. Over the course of their sexual escapades, the new memories showed Talia growing steadily fatter and fatter, mostly due to how Kana would bring her food each time and feed the snake more and more. As the changes continued through the memories, Kana would push Talia to eat a bit more each time, savoring the pained groans that the serpent would give as her stomach stretched further and further. After a number of times of this, Talia started to beg Kana to feed her further, pushing well beyond her limits and speeding her gaining. Talia continued to balloon to new weights till eventually she couldn\u2019t even support her weight on her fattened tail. When the changes to her memories finished, Kana thought that the end of their relationship came when Talia was taken away mysteriously in the middle of the night without her seeing a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana stumbled a bit, bracing herself against the wall. Shaking her head, she wondered why she was thinking of Talia so much. She hadn\u2019t thought of the swollen serpent as much recently, and now she was going over much of their time together. Shaking her head again more vigorously, she forced herself onwards. After a few minutes, she had finally reached her destination: the vault of Lady Mantrillian, its large metal door having beaten plenty of would-be thieves over the years, though none of them had been up to Kana\u2019s skill. With a wide grin under her mask, she first checked for any traps or alarms before moving to the vault door and setting to work. Despite her considerable skill, defeating its complex locking systems still took Kana time, too much time as she became more and more concerned about being discovered before finishing.</span></div></div>",

The door was well maintained and expertly balanced \u2013 made by dwarven master smiths from the looks of it, making it exceedingly costly \u2013 so the slightest touch was enough to open it just wide enough that Kana could slip inside, while leaving little sign that it had been opened. Massive elaborate paintings; golden utensils that would never be used; ornate jewelry boxes filled with rings, necklaces, bangles and more, all made from the finest metals and studded with precious gems; there was so much in this vault alone that Kana could have brought a team of a dozen thieves and never made off with everything. She secreted a few smaller items into the pockets of her armor, but kept moving, looking for that one specific item. Towards the back of the room, she found it: sitting on a plinth all by itself was a fabulous gold necklace, with a massive ruby as the center of the amulet. The edge of the amulet was inscribed with arcane symbols, nothing that the dragoness had a hope of understanding with her meager knowledge of arcane lore. All she knew was that her client was paying an enormous amount for this particular item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the necklace up, she examined slowly, admiring the size and weight of the valuable. As she looked, a glow rippled across the surface of the ruby, she thought it a bit odd, but shook her head and put the amulet in another of her pockets. She was unable to see that her eyes glowed the same way briefly as she secreted the piece away. Satisfied that the easy part was done, she now had to make her way back out with her prize. The vault door shut just as soundlessly as it had opened, and she quickly relocked it to help hide her activities. As she continued to avoid the guard patrols, she found that she was ending up back outside the bedroom she had hidden in just a short time ago. For some reason, she found herself pressing her ear up against the door, listening to what was happening inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could make out lady Mantrillian cooing, \u201cOoh, excellent job, pet.\u201d A muffled grunt could be heard, then she snapped out, \u201cYou two, get over here, she\u2019ll be having you two next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hushed voices then responded simultaneously, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana then heard loud gulping and slurping noises mixed with pained moans and groans. The thief didn\u2019t want to know what was happening in there, though a portion of her mind seemed to be resisting her, making her legs harder to move. She shook her head vigorously and gritted her teeth, forcing herself to move on. The room she had come in was blocked now though, so she had to change the plan a bit. She managed to find a clear staircase up to the second floor, which led her to another weak spot in the defenses. From there, it was a simple task to fly partway across the grounds, dodging the patrols, and then get up and over the wall. She had little trouble avoiding the rest of the district guards, flipping up and over the dividing wall, and return to the slums. The entire time though, that whispering was at the back of her mind, almost completely unnoticed by the dragoness. Just a short time before dawn, she slipped through the window above a shop near the port, and landed softly in her small bedroom. Her eyelids were drooping as she put her loot in a secret compartment within the floor, and stripped off her armor and hid that away within the wall, before slipping under the threadbare covers and drifting off to sleep, completely unaware that she had gotten tangled up with an incredibly powerful force.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a loud yawn, Kana sat up in her bed, listening to the noise of the bustling city going about its day outside her window. The dragoness shook her head and rubbed her temple: the oddest dreams had filled her mind as she slept. With the morning\u2019s light, she found that she couldn\u2019t recall anything specific, but the feelings of revulsion and disgust still lingered in her thoughts. Suppressing a shudder, Kana leapt from her bed and got ready for the day. Several minutes later, she bounded down the steps, the smell of breakfast mingling with the much more acrid scent of a river redweed cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, just what I wanted to smell while eating breakfast, you burning that noxious herb,\u201d Kana called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t like it, you can go get your own breakfast,\u201d came the gruff reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKana smiled slightly as she followed the smells back from hence they came, finding Etem already hard at work on one of his clocks. She always thought scared wolf looked a bit ridiculous with those spectacles with all of those lenses and everything perched on his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbled out \u201cHeard you get in early this morning, figured you would be in bed longer\u201d without looking up from his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know me, things to do, places to go, and people to meet,\u201d she replied cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf huffed slightly as it performed some intricate task in the body of the clock, most of the parts seemed to be still scattered across his work table. The dragoness patted the older man on the shoulder, wrinkling her nose as the pungent green smoke drifted off of the smoldering cigarette at his elbow. She had no idea how anyone could stand being around one of those things, let along sucking on one. Breakfast was simple yet filling, cooled slightly by how long it had been sitting around, but still more than good enough to eat. As she ate, Kana gave a report about how the job had done, though when she came to the bit about the radically altered lady of the manor, something made her skip over that portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end, she tore up the remaining fried bread and tossed it between her teeth before asking, \u201cSo how long do I have to hold onto the product?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his glasses and set them aside as he looked up at her. \u201cNow that you have it Daring, you can take it to the customer tonight. I\u2019ll send a message that you\u2019re bringing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing him use the nickname he gave to her when they met years ago always bought a smile to Kana\u2019s face. When he caught her pickpocketing him, she thought for sure that she was going to lose a hand or worse. But instead, the wolf took pity on the scrawny street rat and took her in, saying that she had a lot of potential, but would need to work hard to let her talent blossom. She couldn\u2019t have known that the brusque black wolf who worked as a clockmaker was also a highly experienced lockpicker and thief. He wasn\u2019t very famous, but as he taught her the best thieves aren\u2019t supposed to be famous. That was plenty of practice and many jobs ago. His fur had gone more to salt and pepper now, but he still had plenty to teach his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and she was eager to learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, where am I going?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kana spent the remainder of the day helping out around Etem\u2019s shop, easily slipping into her role as the wolf\u2019s assistant. Despite the filling breakfast, the dragoness found herself snacking throughout the day, as well as eating a big lunch on top of everything else. The few times he looked up from his work, Etem furrowed his brows slightly but didn\u2019t say anything about her new eating habits. No matter what she was doing though, Kana\u2019s mind often drifted back to her memories of Talia and their time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a blush creeping up her neck and into her cheeks as she remembered one night when she slipped into the snake\u2019s room earlier than usual. The dragoness had brought plenty of food, quite a bit more than usual, and proceeded to tie her lover down and stuff her with every bit. Not even halfway through, the mage was moaning and half-heartedly begging for Kana to stop. The thief wouldn\u2019t hear of it, there was still plenty of food all for her bloated scaly lover. More and more of the food vanished down Talia\u2019s gullet till the scales on her belly were stretching apart. Only after the last little bit was forced down the snake\u2019s throat did Kana finally untie Talia, though the snake was so savagely stuffed that all she could do was lie there moaning and cradling what appeared to a vastly overdue pregnant belly. Kana left a trail of kisses across that stomach \u2013 each bringing another moan to Talia\u2019s lips \u2013 before she slipped beneath the swell to lap at her dripping slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vividness of the memory crashed over Kana; she could smell the remnants of the feast mingling with the heady aroma of their combined arousal, she could feel the heat radiating off of the mage\u2019s belly and womanhood, and she could hear the panting and moaning that Talia made as Kana gave her such a tongue lashing. It was almost like she was experiencing all again, so much so that she had to dart off, breathlessly saying that she would be taking a break. Etem\u2019s usual stony silence was all the response Kana received, but she was past caring if she was needed for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Kana rinsed her face off, especially her lip where she bit herself to keep from crying out. She briefly though about how odd that had been, she had never had a memory hit her quite so hard like that before. She shrugged it aside, just like she had when she lost track of that odd whispering that had been going on in the back of her mind. She instead turned her attention to getting more appropriately attired for her short jaunt to the Gold District. It was one of the richest portions of the city, and her usual simpler attire would stand out there, adventurers usually weren\u2019t even let in. The servants from that area wore comparatively expensive attire, but they were relatively easier to attain, so that is what she went with: a higher quality dress that was cut to be a bit revealing yet tasteful at the same time, as if she was maybe one of the pleasure servants for the noble houses. The dress was also made specially so that she had most of her range of motion and could hide a dagger without anyone noticing it, just in case she got in a bit of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding a vibrant cloak and an appropriately haughty expression, she headed out. Before she left, her mentor let her know that her contact would be wearing a rose and ebony broach on their right shoulder. Kana bid Etem good-bye and made for the Gold District. Getting past the guards took a bit of time, but was easily achieved. Soon enough, the dragoness was standing looking up at the sign for The Shattered Mountain tavern, complete with a simple design showing a mountain cracked apart. Stepping inside the door, Kana slipped through the milling crowd up to the bar and ordered a drink. Turning around, she noted a few people looking her over, but none wearing the broach. As usual, the Mountain was packed this time of night, full of off duty guards and other servants that works for the nobles, there were even more than a few pleasure servants, so Kana didn\u2019t stick out too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome concern that this was all a set-up started to wash over the dragoness after nearly half an hour of time spent in the tavern without spotting her contact. She almost made it to the door when a glimmer out of the corner of her eye caught her attention: it was the broach.</span></div></div>",

Kana took several more steps towards the bed as strange thoughts of gorging herself and being fondled raced through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of cookies, cakes, and pastries filled the air, unnoticed until now.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost immediately after asking her gang what they wanted to do, everyone said yes to pillaging the village right away. Silgad grinned wickedly, happy to see that her cohorts were so eager to kill. Swishing her tail around, Silgad turned to gaze at the peaceful village, chuckling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These swine won't know what hit them...\" Silgad pulled out her duel short-swords that she got from some merchant caravan, and yelled at the top of her lungs. Her band of cutthroats responded with enthusiasm, the crescendo of voices becoming almost deafening. By now the pigs in the village were looking in the groups direction, confused as to what was making such noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last yell, Silgad pointed one of her swords forward and began the charge. The pigs were still staring blankly at the bandits, until one mildly intelligent pig woman finally realized what was happening. Screams of terror resounded in the village, pig men and women shuffling as fast as they could to their huts, hoping in vain that the wooden shelters would shield them from the marauders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad and her bandits had reached the edge of the village now, weapons drawn and teeth bared. Several of the bandits split off from Silgad's main force, spreading death into other areas of the village. Soon, squeals could be heard from all sides, and the cackles of the bloodthirsty bandits were just as loud. Silgad, Omar, and two dog men were heading for the center building, which they guessed was the 'Town Hall' of sorts. The wooden door of the building gave very little resistance when put up against Omar's massive stone mace. Two fat pigs were knocked to the back wall, as they had futilely tried to hold the door closed, and were quickly pounced on by the two dog men, their squeals silenced in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad and Omar split up, Omar heading towards the back rooms and Silgad heading for the main room. \"Most of the pigs will most likely be cowering inside,\" thought Silgad. \"Oh, what a meal this will be!\" Silgad broke out into evil laughter, and cut down a helpless pig woman who had been locked out of the main room. Silgad was salivating madly now, the smell of blood and meat making her pant heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to finish this quickly, else I go mad with hunger.\" With that thought, the bandit leader rammed into the large wood door of the atrium with the force of a boulder. About twenty pigs had holed up inside here, each one squealing madly with fear. Silgad full out sprinted to the nearest one and cleaved its head in two, gaining momentum as she jumped over the body and slit the throats of two other robed pig men. In a dazzling display of bloody acrobatics, Silgad flew around the room like a barbarian ballerina, striking down pig after pig with no remorse. All had been cut down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll but one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lone pig, quite possible the largest, was kneeling down at an altar at the front of the room, speaking in rapid tones of a language she couldn't understand. Not wanting to waste anymore time, Silgad walked up behind the robed pig, and stuck both her swords into its back. With it's last breath, the pig muttered a last unnerving sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our...god...will make you....pay\" The pig then lurched forward, blood dripping from its open mouth. Silgad just stood there, basking in the glory of her final kill. She arched her back and let loose a victory yell. She could tell from the guffaws and yells from the outside that her band of outlaws had taken the village, and slain its denizens. She sensed someone and turned, only to see Omar covered in blood with a twisted grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should do this again, Silgad.\" said Omar with a light chuckle. Silgad merely humphed at the polar bear, crossing her arms over her chest. \"First, you and some others have to gather up all these swine and start building a fire. We're not done yet, Omar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear let out a heavy sigh. \"As you wish, <i>my lady</i>...\" muttered Omar sarcastically. Silgad watched him go, then looked over her handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much meat! My men and I will be feasting for weeks. Not that that's a <i>bad</i> thing...\" Silgad grinned, and brought her gaze to the front of the atrium. What she saw nearly made her jump back in shock. Shrouded in shadow was a foreboding statue of a hooded figure. Long tentacles were coming out from the opening in its hood and were wrapped around a figure clutched in its hands. It appeared to be a rather fat woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. These pigs sure were fucked up...\" Silgad took one last glance at the statue, and turned to leave the atrium, not wanting to be in the same room with the freaky thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bright fire light shined in Silgad's eyes. Row upon row of roasting pigs upon bonfires went through the courtyard of the once bustling village, once full of happy and worry-less pigs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was but the scent of roasting flesh, the panting of bandits, and groaning of empty bellies. Silgad sniffed the air, the tantalizing scent of the succulent swine making her body quiver. What was she waiting for? What was the whole crew waiting for? Silgad was perplexed as to why there was not a tasty haunch of pig leg in her mouth right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaaahhhhhh!!!!\u201d yelled Silgad as she launched herself to the first pig in her sight, first bite of many to make its mark. The others all followed in a mad rush of hunger, different groups contending for bigger and fatter pigs to gorge themselves on. There was no order, no control. Everyone just let themselves go, mentally and physically. If anyone was truly foolish enough to try and get a line set up in some orderly fashion, they were going to surely starve tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral pigs were stripped to bone in a matter of minutes, with bandits moving on to other pigs. Everyone steered clear of Silgad, though. The fatty pig she had taken was hers, and hers alone. Most likely the largest pig of them all, Silgad didn't realize how difficult a challenge this would be. Sure, she was hungry as hell, but that pig was really, really big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the gorge-fest, someone broke out a couple of barrels of mead, rolling them out among the drink-craving bandits. One got to Silgad (not by accident), and she quickly quenched her mighty thirst, getting her fill of the drink. She wiped her mouth with her greasy arm, and got back to stuffing herself with her mighty feast. She had gotten a good sized hole in the side of the roasted porker, and began ripping out fat, meat, guts, whatever she could get her claws on, really. She was beginning to feel some pressure in her stomach, rounded out with deliciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena bandit unclasped her trousers and tossed them aside, sighing pleasantly as her gut gained more room. Energized by a second wind, Silgad dove right back in to the portly pig, eating, eating, and...eating some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good number of bandits had gotten their fill of meat, and broken off to collapse into food comas on the ground. But, the massive polar bear marauder, Omar, was still going at it. He had a whole pig to himself, and was making short work of it. He had even guzzled down two barrels of mead all on his own, making the bear teeter back and forth in a drunken stupor. He held a hand on his bloated gut, and let out a thunderous belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis garnered the attention of a severely gorged Silgad, who pulled her body out of her pig to find out whatever made that noise. She tried to stand, nearly losing her balance in the process, but managed to do it. She clutched her round, gurgling belly, hefting it in her hands, and letting it drop down. It didn't move much, being packed with all manner of pig innards, and just stuck out in front of her. She placed a hand on her mouth and stifled an up-coming burp, gaze finding itself back on her half-eaten meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had eaten most of the left side, yet the right side was still ripe for the taking. Surprisingly, Silgad heard a grumble from her belly. \u201c....Hungry still?\u201d thought Silgad, her mind and body slowly shifting to sleep mode. She shuffled lethargically over to the other side of the pig, her eyes glazed over with weariness. Her tongue was half hanging out of her mouth as she lightly rubbed her already over-stuffed stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, Silgad got to the other side of the pig. But, rather than start \u201cpigging\u201d out again, she sorta collapsed against the thick side of the swine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgghhhhh, my stomach is.....Urrrppppppp!!!\u201d Silgad hunched forward to let the gassy belch escaped unperturbed, leaning back almost instantly at the end of the burp. She massaged her globular stomach, the minor discomfort causing her to grimace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that sleep was imminent, as the hyena's eyes were flickering heavily with exhaustion. With one last stretch, and a tiny straggler burp, Silgad relaxed and sped off to dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad found herself laying down on a stone pillar, alone amongst a sea of blackness. She flipped her head back and forth, very confused and slightly afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the fuck am I?\u201d she softly spoke. The empty quiet of this place was unsettling, so much so that she had broke out into a sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad's heart rate had picked up, and her eyes were twitching about so much she was starting to become dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome.\u201d Silgad jumped nearly three feet in the air, letting loose a shriek so loud she herself didn't even know she could muster a sound so loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-what the fuck! Who-whos there?\u201d Had her bandit cohorts seen her in this state, they surely would have mocked her relentlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown voice chuckled deeply, a resonating sound that surrounded Silgad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho I am...does not matter. Yet.\u201d That last word made Silgad's stomach sink. \u201cJust know this, Silgad, leader of the Black Tail bandits. I know who you are, where you are, and what you have done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad's eyes widened with extreme fear. \u201cWhat I have done...\u201d she repeated to herself. She hung her head down, tears beginning to pour from her closed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of her sobbing was drowned out, though, as a deep, rumbling groan was sounding throughout the chasm. She looked up, surprised to see a thin white crack against the back-drop of darkness. The crack was spreading, pieces falling down around Silgad, as a sort of opening began to form. A blinding stream of light shot through, forcing her to cover her red, puffy eyes......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....Silgad!......SILGAD!!!\u201d Silgad opened her eyes, taking in the sight of Omar unched over her with his hands on her shoulders. \u201cFinally! I've been trying to wake you for five minutes! Listen, we've got to get moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad sat up slowly, back sticking against the meaty hide of the pig she had passed out on. \u201cUghhh....not-not so loud, Omar! Whats so important that you had to wake me up so damn early?!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The polar bear's words held truth. As Silgad looked to the horizon, there were indeed dark clouds gathering. The distant rumbles of thunder could already be heard, much to the dismay of Silgad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit! That's no-...wait.\u201d Silgad stopped and looked around, snorting at her own idiocy. \u201cWhy worry? We have this empty village to take refuge in! It's not like those porkers will be needing the huts anymore, right?\u201d Silgad arched a brow and looked back up at Omar, who was scratching his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, 'spose you're right...\u201d The polar bear yawned, a low, drawn out sound coming from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad stood herself up, dusting off her legs and backside. Did her ass feel a bit...jigglier? Silgad began inspecting more thoroughly, patting her cheeks and rubbing her hands up and down her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that's what I get for stuffing myself on pig fat...\u201d Silgad sighed and bent over to pick up her discarded trousers and pull them over her legs, the act a bit more difficult than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that minor task complete, Silgad got to strolling amongst the groups of snoozing bandits, most of them either still bloated from the feast of last night, or getting up themselves to stretch out their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, get your lazy asses up! A storm is comin', and unless you wanna get soaked like a back-alley whore, you'll wake up and move your food n' shit into a hut right now! This little village is gonna be our hang-out for tonight, or maybe even two more nights, depending on how long the damned storm lasts!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad kicked at the side of a husky who happened to be napping in the way of her march, smirking cruelly as the cohort yelped. \u201cOut of my fuckin' way! Didn't you hear me, you slimy scoundrel? Wake the fuck up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky whimpered lightly, crawling away as Silgad growled at the poor sod. The bandit leader relished these moments, making sure her merry band of assholes knew that she was the boss. She watched with amusement as even more bandits scampered away suddenly, dragging their pig remains and supply sacks into randomly picked huts. She yawned, itching at her belly button. Her stomach even felt less toned! Where there was once a flat, well-sculpted board of muscle, there now was a slight pooch of pudge. Silgad pressed more into it, studying the foreign feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit, that little feast of mine ruined my stomach!\u201d Silgad groaned in disappointment as she let her hand drop to her side, other hand resting on her hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of feasts, Silgad turned to look back at her own unfinished pig, one side completely stripped, while the other still had plenty of meat and fat on it. She found herself licking her lips as she stared at the roasted corpse, the smell of the juicy fats and succulent meats entering her nostrils once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGahh, snap out of it, Silgad! You're not even fucking hungry...\u201d The bandit leader shook her head, trying to get the thought of the pig out of her mind. \u201cGotta find something else to do...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Silgad did, in berating a crag-bear marauder who was with the group. She didn't think to remove her iron armor before digging into and stripping clean several pigs (three and a half, to be exact), so now her burgeoning gut had grown too large for her armor! Her pudgy body was squeezed out of the gaps in her armor, causing a very comical look for the other bandits to get a kick out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh shit, Terga, you're like dough squeezing out of it's package! Look at you! Bwahaha!\u201d Silgad roared with laughter as the marauder tried in vain to pull off her ill-fitting iron armor, the futile effort only managing to tire Terga out. She sighed in frustration, giving up on the task and laying down on her back, her grey furred belly pushing the tight iron plate out in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad simply gasped and wheezed from laughter, wiping a tear away from her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's some funny shit right there, heh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain was pouring now, a relentless fall of silver streaks mingled with bright flashes of lighting. Silgad, Omar, and a few trusted others had chose to hold up within the town hall. Seeing as it was the largest building in the village, it seemed natural for Silgad, the leader, to immediately claim it. She only let Omar join her due to their history together, and the fact that he hauled the leftovers of her unfinished pig into the building without being told to. The twin dog bandits were in there as well, accepted due to their damn good killing work in the first moments of the attack on the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Terga, the she-bear with the armor problem, was admitted inside only due to Omar's apparent feelings for her, and because Silgad felt just a tiny bit sorry for her due to no other huts being large enough or having any room left in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad couldn't help but grin as she watched Omar try and help Terga get her armor off. They had made progress, but a couple last straps were being stubborn, so now Omar was carefully slicing them with a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-Thank you, Omar...\u201d Terga blushed as Omar softly nuzzled the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more, my mountain flower. It's the least I could do.\u201d The last couple strips had been cut, and the front plate of Terga's armor popped off straight away. She breathed a deep sigh of relief, hands rubbing her red-marked belly. Silgad snorted at the sight, glancing down at her own slight paunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGross....hrrmm.\u201d She leaned her head back, eyes searching about the quiet hall for something interesting. Her gaze found itself back on that dark statue at the back of the hall, near the wooden podium. The hooded figure still gave her the same feeling as the first time she saw it, that cold, slithery feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it did something.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Omar drew his war axe, and threw himself in front of the exposed Terga, acting as a hulking guard for her. Terga hid behind him still, having left her weapon somewhere when they had tried to remove her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stupid bitch!</i> Silgad cursed to herself. <i>Why the fuck would she not keep her weapon by her side at all times?</i> She wondered how she had even survived this long in this bandit clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther bandits in the room drew their weapons as well, preparing for an ambush. A male tiger nocked an arrow and pointed it toward the statue, and held it, ready to release. However, nothing happened. They waited, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad nodded towards Omar, and the two traveled towards the statue, weapons bared and ready to strike. Terga followed behind Omar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hell-fire, she's like a goddamn puppy dog when she's with Omar.</i> She had to admit, she had no idea what he saw in Terga, she was a bear, like Omar, but she was not becoming at all, in her opinion. She was fairly big boned to begin with, but with the added weight, she looked even bigger. She had absolutely no bust size at all, and in general, was a coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got closer to the statue, they noticed a dark hole where the statue had once been, with a ladder leading down into the blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omar, light a torch will you?\" Silgad 'asked' the polar bear. He was hesitant, looking at Terga and back at the wall where the a torch burned already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, get the fucking torch Omar, Terga will still be standing there, like a fucking idiot when you get back.\" She snapped at him. Omar sighed and went to the wall, removed the torch from the wall scone, and walked toward the black pit. he held the torch down towards the pit, and Silgad looked down. She could see that the ladder lead to a dark underground chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it could go right under the entire village boss, it could be a tomb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a treasure trove, you never know with these pigs, greedy slobs \" Silgad added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to head down there then?\" Omar asked her, he didn't turn towards her, but she could see the feint outline of a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she wanted to! <i>Who the fuck wouldn't want to uncover a damn treasure trove</i> She wanted to exclaim out loud, but something unnerved her about that statue. She remembered her dream from earlier. She remembered what the voice had said<br>\r\n\u201c I<i> know who you are, where you are, and what you have done.</i>\u201d  <br>\r\nIt was just her mind playing tricks on her, she knew that, but still, thinking about it sent a shiver down her spine\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was not such a good idea to head down there, at least, not right now anyway, the group could always take a rest and go down later. Then again, Silgad could not shake off the thought of a massive amount of treasure being hidden down in the chamber below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c All right boys, listen up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

None did.  She felt a sense of satisfaction.  She was tough.  Dominant.  It was almost enough to allow her to forget that somewhere deep inside of her, a part of her was quaking like jelly at the thought of descending into that dark abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terga.  You take first watch,\" she said, grinning cruelly.   A night alone by the hole ought to toughen up the overfed she-bear.   And just to make sure nobody interfered with the toughening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omar, take two men out to the road tonight.   Don't want anyone else stumbling on our little squat, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later, Silgad lay in the pig chief's bed, drowsing and digesting her dinner.  She stretched.   The bed was so large that even when she extended both arms as far as they could go, she couldn't get her fingers over both edges at once, and the mattress was firm and pliable.  It was truly a bed built for a pig.   Even the stolen silk nightgown she was currently luxiariating in, swimming in the vast sea of fabric like a toddler in her mother's dress, had been originally tailored with a pig in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food, she reflected, had been fit for a pig too--in all the best ways.  As one might have expected, every pantry in town had been bursting with delectables, and she'd scraped together a dinner of preserves, sweetmeats, and cured beef topped with another juicy haunch of pork.   If it hadn't been for the pinch of her belt (already a hole looser than it ought to have been) offering a painful admonishment not to go back for fifths, she'd probably still be stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really gonna have to watch it in this place</i>, she thought, idly scratching her distended belly.   <i>I'll be fatter'n Terga if I'm not careful.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned.   The candles were burning low, and she'd almost drifted off to sleep when there was a thumb on the door and Omar strode in, looking concerned.  Rainwater poured in rivulets down his armor, and his boots were caked with thick, black mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to guard the road!\" Silgad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bad news,\" he said simply.  \"The road's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'gone'?  You couldn't find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we found where it should have been, but it wasn't there,\" he responded.  \"No road.  None of those farmhouses we passed on the way here.   I even followed our own tracks back--they just peter out in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot,\" Silgad snarled.  Omar said nothing, but she thought she saw reproach in his eyes.  \"Get out!\" the hyena finally shouted at him.   He turned and left, leaving the bandit leader alone with her pounding heart, her churning belly, and her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning--<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She blinks several times, one hand going up to rub her eyes, the other scratching her furred stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUghh, great. It's still fucking storming out...\u201d growled Silgad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed the heavy covers of the bed away from her form, turning her body around and setting her feet down on the floor as she inched to the edge of the bed. Arching her back, she stretches her arms up above her and yawns, the flowing nightgown still wrapped around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad stood herself up, glancing at the floor where her discarded armor lay, her pants and boots not far from it. Might as well gear up, seeing as I won't get anymore peaceful sleep, thought Silgad, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did just that, removing the billowing nightgown, and quickly replacing it with her aforementioned tunic, pants and boots. The iron breastplate was a smidge tighter than before, though Silgad hardly noticed. She just pulled the leather straps tight around her torso, not aware of how much it actually revealed her pudgy stomach to the world. A sliver of brown fur could be seen, a small part of her belly button also peeking out from the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leather pants also proved a challenge, for they were tight on Silgad even before coming to the village. She really had that much junk in the trunk, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking armor....huff!...fucking pigs....oof!.....fucking...food....\u201d Silgad grunted as she barely managed to pull the pants up and over her chubby ass, the material stretched taut. She had no difficulty with the boots, at least. That's good, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked slowly to the bedroom door, one brow raised slightly. \u201cI don't hear anybody...hmm.\u201d She quietly grabbed her pair of short-swords, pulling the door open and poking her head out, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmar, Terga and the others were all still asleep, to the annoyance of Silgad. Her mouth twitched slightly as she saw the remains of some sort of feast around the two bears, Terga nuzzled up against Omar's gut, who was snoring loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad grinned evily, striding over to the snoozing bears, her hands cupped over her mouth. She bent down, getting right by Terga's head. The hyena took in a deep breath, leaning in even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....WAAAAKE UP, FAT ASSSSS!!!!!!\u201d, roared Silgad with villainous glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerga's eyes shot wide open, her arms flailing around wildly, accidentally hitting Omar's face. The polar bear was by now also looking around wildly, growling lowly as he spotted Silgad guffawing in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh hell, Omar! You should've seen your fuckin' face! And Terga, too! Haaaa! I'm surprised she could move that fa-...\u201d Silgad's mocking was cut short as Omar stood over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat....the fuck.....is your PROBLEM?!?!\u201d yelled Omar, bending down to get right in the bandit leader's scarred face. The polar bear stared long and hard at Silgad as she blinked in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, now....it was just a fuckin' joke! Alright?\u201d stammered Silgad, for once the one being on the receiving end of a scolding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmar snorted, raising his body back up slowly. \u201cA joke, huh? Well, I didn't find it funny...maybe I need a new sense of humor...\u201d The bear glowered at Silgad, turning away from her to go and comfort the slightly whimpering Terga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad just stared, shaking her head as he walked away.

She still had a reputation to maintain, ya know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, listen up, I'll take one more of you sorry sods down with us all, just cause I like having my back covered.\u201d There was a resounding silence among the crowd of bandits, a token tumbleweed making its way across the dry ground behind them.

Bastards...\u201d she looked out over the small group, sighing loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...You! Tiger guy! With the bow! Yeah, you! You're a good shot, so you're comin' with. Yes, you fucking are, now get up here!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger bowman made his way up to the steps with a sullen expression, already praying to his gods that they have mercy on his soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood tiger...now fall in behind me.\u201d Silgad canted her head to her right, where Omar already stood. The polar bear listened, tall and silent, peering over the ruined village as Silgad told the other bandits to guard it, and that if any of them abandoned the gang, she would hunt them down and personally tear out their entrails to wrap around their traitorous necks. Omar couldn't help but smirk. Even though Silgad was a heartless bitch, she knew how to make him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually caught the eye of Terga, the mountain sow he had taken a liking to. She almost looked sad, sad to see Omar go...and maybe never return. The polar bear cleared his throat, looking longingly back at Terga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Omar.....Omar!! Get the wax outta your ears, I'm talking to you!\u201d Silgad shoved his side, Omar blinking in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, what? Sorry, I was...enjoying the view...\u201d Omar grinned, looking back to Terga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad arched a brow, her gaze going to where Omar's rested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, for fucks sake..., glowered Silgad, wiping her hand over her face. \u201cOK! Terga's coming with, damnit! She needs to get toughened up!\u201d Omar turned slowly to the bandit leader, eyes squinted. After a short stare-down between him and Silgad, he growled, beckoning Terga with his large paw as he headed for the town hall. Silgad grinned as Terga caught up to the white bear, panting lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat. A. Fat ass.\u201d Terga chuckled lightly, ignoring the jiggle around her middle and rear-end as she followed the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger archer slowly brought up the rear, staring at all three of his partners. Is everyone in this clan getting fat?!, he pondered, as he watched Silgad's round ass sway ahead of him. The still slim bowman sighed in frustration, shutting the town hall's gate.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silgad dropped a torch into the darkness, the red-orange flame fluttering as it plummeted past the ladder and clattered to the stone floor.   Satisfied that nothing was waiting below to sink its teeth into her juicy rear end, she climbed down the rickety steps and picked up the burning wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't just a tomb,\" she said thoughtfully, sniffing the air.  \"It's big.  I can feel it.\"   She took a step in the direction that felt the most open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're coming,\" Omar said.   The ladder creaked ominously under his weight.  \"Wait for us.  It might not be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anywhere's safer than standin' right under the two of you on that rickety ladder,\" Silgad laughed.  \"That's just asking to be crushed.  C'mon, get down here before it falls to pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ladder held, surprisingly -- or not so surprisingly, when you considered the people it had been built for.   As soon as the group was assembled, Silgad led the way forward into the gloom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them several minutes to work their way across the room as Silgad scrutinized every paving stone for tripwires or pressure plates.  When they finally reached the other side, they discovered the far wall wasn't a wall at all, but a mountain of crates and boxes piled nearly to the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be thousands of them,\" Terga breathed.   Silgad felt her mouth begin to water.  <i>Gold!  Gems!  Valuable ancient pig portraits!</i>   The size of the treasure grew in her mind as she jimmied a crate loose from the pile, forming into a towering peak of gleaming metal and collapsing in an avalanche of wealth as she worked the lid loose.   The inside was filled with what looked like golden bars.  She picked one up--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stopped short.   Pure gold was soft all right.  But not that soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't gold!\" she snarled, bringing her torch closer.   She took a nibble to confirm her suspicions.  \"This is<i> cheese!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's wine over here,\" the tiger reported.   Omar thumped something in the darkness.  \"I think there's hams or roasts or something here, hanging from the ceiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More food!\" Silgad moaned.   \"Well, that's just great!  As if we didn't have enough already!\"   She took a large bite of of the bar.   \"As if we wanted their stupid cheese!  As if --*mmph*--as if it was worth it to come down here--*mmp*--juff to stuff ourf faffes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this one is cheese, too,\" Terga said, nibbling. Silgad snatched the bar away from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme.  Gotta be sure.\"  She chomped down on the second bar.  \"Yeff.  'at's cheese all riffe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this is just a pantry,\" Omar suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more here--*glmmp*-- than than,\" Silgad said.  \"Has to be, with a setup like this.  Who would set up that whole glowing-eyed statue thing just for the sake of food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pigs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad frowned.  \"No.  There's more down here than a few moldy old curds.\" <i> Moldy old delicious curds</i>, she had to admit to herself.  Despite a heavy breakfast, she was practically inhaling the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those porkers were hiding something down here.  We just have to find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright Black-Tails!\" Silgad blurted out, before biting off another chunk of the block of cheese she had snatched from Terga. <i>Fuck, this cheese is divine...</i> she thought to herself as she swallowed it down. Just as quickly as it traveled down her gullet, her mouth moved back towards the cheese once more. Silgad stopped herself from taking another bite however; why was she so ravenous lately? The pigs <i>must</i> have laced their foods with something, in order to let them consume much more than one could generally eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check the crates; there has to be something in them; I don't care if you have to take everything out of them and stuff it in your faces.\" she ordered, giving a stern look towards Terga's frame. <i>She'd probably enjoy that, now wouldn't she?</i>  she joked to herself, considering Olmar's behavior towards her lately. <br>\r\nSilgad's own words struck her odd as well; while she had meant to order them to smash everything and throw it all on the ground, those weren't the words that left her mouth at all. <i>Eat</i>. Why eat? They had had enough at this point, hadn't they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconsciously as she thought about this, she nibbled on another piece of cheese. Before long, that entire block was gone, and her hand was now free. <i>Good shit.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tiger guy!\" She shouted out; she still couldn't think of his name, but that didn't matter; he was quite the looker...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back up there and get more men down here; we've got a lot of crates to go through.\" She ordered. If the men weren't awake at this point... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're still lazy shits, tell them they can gorge themselves when they get down here!\" She added, before turning back to the crate of cheese before her. She'd look in there; might as well, who was going to stop her from doing so? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer search began with another block of cheese being lifted from the stack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower pantry had become much louder than it had before, with plenty of folk now searching for lost treasure. Someone had found a small bag of coins, which Silgad confiscated. She was the boss after all, lot went to her first before the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours after the search had begun, and no one had found a damn thing other than that. Maybe the lack of productivity could be answered by the fact that most people were, as Silgad had ordered, eating the contents of the crates. The Hyena included of course, still munching on that gods-forsaken cheese. A light burp escaped her lips, though at this point, it was not an uncommon sound to hear from the others. Silgad snuck a glance at Terga and Omar; she was shyly sneaking a cookie from one of the crates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilgad scoffed at the sight, as if she needed to hide her gluttonous manners, the irony of Silgad's judgment of Trega completely lost on the bandit leader. While Terga was still much larger than her, the cheese had slowly begun to do a number on her own body as well; her stomach was much more bloated than it had previously been, and her buttocks shook much more as her body swayed. She had noticed, but her mind didn't have the time to be self conscious about it, pushing it aside as she shoved another block of cheese into her muzzle. Would she react to it later? Of course she would, just not at the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking into the crate, Silgad reached within it, her hands stumbling around for another block of delicious cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand did not feel anything soft however, just cold iron... Wait a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolted out of her trance, Silgad shifted her body to look within the crate. Lo and behold , she had found something. <br>\r\nHidden within the cheese was a sphere-shaped knob, slightly tilted towards her. She ripped off the sides of the crate in a frenzy, catching the eyes of everyone present. She then proceeded to sift through the stacked block of cheese, sending them tumbling to the ground. For a moment, she felt disappointed that so much of the fine stuff was going to waste, but shrugged it off, until she could plainly see what those delicious curds had safeguarded for what could have been years.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA metal lever stood idle, tilted to the side. Her mind rushed with excitement! When she pulled that lever, what would happen? What would be revealed to them all? Treasure...or more food perhaps? She'd be Ok with that if it so happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well folks, looks like we're on the right track!\" She called out. She heard murmurs throughout the room, some of excitement, some of wonder, and some of...annoyance? For the first time in a long while however, Silgad shout out against those voices, and instead, took the lever in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally time to get our loot ladies and gents!\" She shouted, as she pulled it towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of metallic screeching and gears was fully audible, as the mechanism the lever was controlled by served its function. </span></div></div>",

There were stories here, some written and some waiting for ink to meek parchment, both rich in potential.

It seems there's been a bit of a snafu involving the chapter choices further down the line. Most of you will know that due to Writing.com's system for interactives the number of choices per chapter gets narrowed down towards two. This normally means that, to offer people as many open slots for characters/plotlines/locations as they'd like, it's best to use one choice for your story and leave another one open for whoever might want to write one next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately that got a little scrambled towards the end here, and I couldn't delete the chapter that broke this chain as people have already added to it. So instead I've had to push Metalmonster's chapter involving Dawn here (Which was a storyline consisting of only this chapter thus far) aside one chapter in order to open up a new branch in the narrative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now the first choice in this chapter will lead to what will be (Hopefully) a greater number of story options while the second one will dead end. I apologize Metal monster for the inconvenience but rest assured your character is not gone, but now rests safely behind choice number one. Also to spice things up a bit I've added a bit of flavor in the form of a short meta-narrative I may or may not remove later. Enjoy!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A gentle breeze rustled the green leaves of the trees. Sweet birdsong lilted from branches all around the grove. Squirrels nattered to each other, and scolded the predators that had chased them high into their havens. Not far away, a sheep bleated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet it was none of these things the armour-clad tiger in the middle of the clearing had his ear cocked to listen to. With his sword drawn, tip piercing the soft, fertile soil, and his large, strong hands folded on the pommel, he looked like a statue, albeit a sleeping one. His eyes were closed, and his chest hardly moved. His nostrils flared slightly, the scent of mutton still in its wool coat wafting by unheeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Shining Master,\" he murmured, lips barely moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squirrel ceased its chattering, looked towards the prone figure, and scurried further up its tree. A breeze sighed around the clearing, and then all was still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the tiger heard, loud and clear. \"Thy will be done, Brightest One.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes, he flicked them around the glade. Buttery yellow sunlight slanted through the leaves on the trees. Motes of pollen danced in Nature's own spotlights. Animals sunned themselves, soaking up all the heat they could bear. Big trees and small shoots alike photosynthesized the solar rays into natural sugar, reaching ever higher towards the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo others, this was merely a peaceful scene worthy of a portrait. But the tiger-! <i>He</i> knew better! <i>He</i> saw more! \"<i>He</i> is <i>enlightened</i>! He is... Sir Jules DeNoon! Champion of the Light! Paladin of Sol-Ra the Illuminated! May he shine forever in the darkness.\" He punctuated this last, quietly-spoken phrase by tracing the symbol of the radiating sun upon his cuirass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome and fit tiger (dashing, too, if he did say so himself - and he often <i>did</i>) could read the sun's rays like a scroll crafted by the most reclusive of monks. This sight beyond sight had been granted him for his pure and unwavering devotion to Sol-Ra the Illuminated, God of Light. There was not a message from his god in <i>every</i> ray of light, but today, in this green glade, he had been sent a small novella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was no love story he had seen - unless one counted the love of the man for torture and death. No, this was a laundry list of sins, mortal and venial, against gods, devils, monsters, mer, and men alike. He had stolen, swindled, lied, and cheated. Murder, after long periods of torture, were to him as thoughtless as dessert after a meal. He encouraged and fostered slothfulness, greed, pride, and gluttony in all his \"subjects\" - some, in his thrall; others, eking out a meager existence in his perverted \"kingdom\" before death; more, trapped and twisted in his labyrinths while trying to vanquish the vile villain for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules lifted his lip in a snarl. <i>The Lipomancer!

And on the back of his eyelids, he saw printed the names of The Lipomancer's mortal associates, loaded Lords and Ladies, already of dubious moral standing, who offered the dark sorcerer monetary and fleshly support in his ventures of death and conquest, both of land, and the spirits of the races of mer and men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Jules DeNoon will cast Sol-Ra's divine light upon thee, wrongdoers, and by it, your dire truths will be revealed!\" The tiger boldly pledged, sunlight flashing along the length of his sword as he pointed it in the direction of nearby Wellingham. \"You will divulge the location of this Lipomancer unto us, and our final campaign against the foul creature will begin!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sheathing his sword, after brushing the dirt and grass from its tip, Jules strode confidently (the only way he <i>ever</i> walked) off in the direction of Wellingham. The Lady Chattow would hardly be able to deny an audience with an illustrious crusader of moral righteousness such as himself, lest her reputation be further tarnished. As he saw it, she was already teetering on the edge of damnation; his actions alone could save her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green cape fastened by golden cords to his shining steel cuirass stirred in the slight breeze that cooled him, its gold trim catching the sunlight. His armour was well-oiled, and moved smoothly with him, producing only the expected clanking. The care with which he maintained his blessed suit of armour was second only to his own self-upkeep. Carrying around an extra fifty pounds of armour daily demanded strength, and strength stemmed from sacrifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he would readily share with anyone he thought deserved to hear it, he had been making the necessary sacrifices for ten years. His body was a temple in the heyday of its worship. Chiseled jaw, six-pack abs, muscled arms, firm thighs, and buns of steel, all accentuated by his immaculately-groomed fur, the contrast between his orange base and black stripes as crisp as noontime shadows. Creamy, whitish fur framed his lower jaw, and flowed from there down to his toes, covering his neck, chest, stomach, and inner thighs. Powerful canine teeth, an inch long each, gleamed in his beguiling grin, and his golden eyes shone like the emblem on his cuirass, a radiating sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoasting extensive training and experience in combat, his platemail was as little bother to him as a ranger's leather, or a mage's robe. One could reasonably expect him to fair bake without cover of shade at noonday, but his god, and Nature, the closest companions, ensured not so much as a bead of sweat glistened upon his brow. It was a small blessing he was ever grateful for, mindful that otherwise, he'd have a lot more grooming to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWellingham was just over a mile away from the glade he'd paused in, and so the trek took little time. The village was fair-to-middling-sized, a safe enough rest spot for travelers and carriages alike. It was home to two taverns, one at either point of ingress, and a single, large inn, smack in the middle. A blacksmith offered his or her services, there was a tailor ready to outfit those with the coin to pay, a bakery wafted delightful aromas into the air, and the presence of a cobbler spoke to a heavy human populace. On the opposite side of the street from the inn, and situated on a rise that gave it a view of the village, there sat a sprawling manor, apparently intended to intimidate by its presence alone, never mind its Gothic architecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout needing to be told, the tiger turned in its direction. He would find his target there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road leading to the mansion, wide enough for two carriages to pass comfortably, was of better quality than the broad dirt path bisecting the village, paved smoothly with bricks. It left little doubt as to whom the person at the other end of it valued most. The sun-baked bricks were also less comfortable than the hard-packed dirt, even through his custom steel boots. If no one had warned the Lady of their discomfort, it was because she had not wanted to hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a walk at least eight times shorter, yet eight times more irritating, than the one that had brought him to Wellingham, Jules raised a mailed fist, and knocked on the double doors of Chattow Mansion. After a quick glance at his reflection on the back of his hand to ascertain his social acceptability, he straightened his back, puffed out his chest, and turned on his charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open smoothly, and a perky vixen began to greet him with a smile. \"Good afternoon, sir, what can I- I-\" she trailed off, dazed or intimidated by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules was used to this, however, and answered gently, but firmly, \"Sir Jules DeNoon seeks an audience with the lady of the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pl-please, sir, come in,\" the vixen scuttled out of the way, opening the door wide. \"I will pass this onto Lady Chattow myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, fair woman,\" Jules smiled down at her, stepping into the lavish foyer. Thick rug cushioned his feet, and the sunlight streaming through the windows high on either side of him lit even the deepest recesses of the ceiling far overhead. A gas-lamp chandelier, all sparkling crystal and gleaming gold, hung from a rafter above. Some twenty feet away, two grand staircases curled back on themselves as they connected the first and second floors. The third floor, situated overhead, seemed to have but one staircase leading to it, from what he could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis inspection was cut short when a <i>thud</i> and a small shriek reached his ears. His hand instinctually strayed to the hilt of his sword, his eyes swept the immediate area, and his nostrils flared open for the stench of evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was only a mouse maid who had dropped a laundry basket as she'd entered the room from his right. She repeatedly squeaked something like \"Sorry, sir, so sorry!\", face flushed red, as she gathered the fine clothes, and hurried form the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules allowed himself to relax inasmuch as reassuming a casual stance. He could hear distant giggles, and the faintest traces of whispers, which he was also accustomed to. Turning towards the source of these, three more maids (also noticeably furry) peeking around the corner of the hallway past the stairs to his left, he winked, and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faces of the two topmost maids disappeared as the giggles grew louder, but the third maid swooned, and slumped to the floor. She was barely visible for a second before the other two carted her off, out of sight, and hopefully out of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules, blushing a little himself, tried to go back to looking noble and businesslike. He wasn't here to cause trouble, but he was prepared for it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, on the third floor landing, Doris (Lady Chattow's vixen maid) composed herself, and knocked upon the door to her mistress' private quarters, preparing for a tongue-lashing even before she could state her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now</i> what is it you featherbrained imbeciles want?!\" the Lady herself demanded from within. \"If I have to repeat myself <i>one more time</i> today, it's coming out of someone's hide! Enter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoris let herself in silently, averting her eyes to the floor. \"You have a- a gentleman caller, Mistress Chattow. He seems to be a knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered this coolly, looking out at the village below from he large, round window, which from outside resembled a leering, Cyclopean eye. Then all at once, she turned on the vixen, satisfied to find her gaze on the floor, where it should be. \"Tell me, Doris... Is he handsome?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment it took the maid to work up the wherewithal to answer, the mansion's mistress read it in her red and trembling countenance. \"I see. Very well. Send him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your- <i>private quarters</i>, mistress?\" Doris hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I not make myself <i>clear</i>, fleabrain?\" Lady Chattow snipped, glaring daggers into the fur between the vixen's ears. \"Or do you not think you cleaned it well enough to be seen by someone you deem more important than <i>me</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'll send him up straightaway, mistress,\" Doris gulped, backing out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce relatively safe, with a thick oak door between the Lady Chattow and herself, the maid dabbed her forehead with a cleaning rag. It was stressful, being the mistress' personal handmaiden, but still better than being the low woman on the totem pole! Lifting her skirt slightly, she scurried down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules had been studying the sunbeams for any further information relayed to him, but Sol-Ra (the Illuminated; may he shine forever in the darkness) seemed to think he had adequately prepared him already. The tiger offered his god a quick prayer of gratitude, and turned to face the maid who now approached him in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Chattow will see you in her private quarters on the third floor, Sir,\" Doris told him, trying to discretely catch her breath. She was supposed to be rearing children at this time in her life, not running up and down flights of stairs! \"If you'll follow me, I'll take you to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, fair maiden, but you deserve rest,\" Jules smiled easily, taking her unresisting hand in his own. Bending down, he planted a small kiss upon the back of it, and then released. \"Sir Jules DeNoon will guide himself to the Lady Chattow. Her private quarters are above us?\" He pointed up towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoris nodded, temporarily dumbstruck, then managed a breathy \"Y-yes, Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules nodded firmly, and set off, leaving the girls with a final, dazzling smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoris' knees failed her then and there, and if Mimi had not been behind her with the laundry basket, her landing would have been considerably more jarring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger ascended the stairs easily, taking them two at a time, and paused outside the Lady's door to make sure his headfur was smoothed down, and his armour sat just right. Then, he knocked, mindful not to leave impressions in the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" lilted a falsely-cheerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules entered the room, the large window catching his eye before the figure just six feet in front of him did. He closed the door behind him. Bowing at the waist, as was respectful when introducing oneself to those of a higher station in life than one's own, he said \"Sir Jules DeNoon, Paladin of Sol-Ra the Illuminated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Chattow lifted her lip in distaste. <i>Paladins</i> were <i>not</i> 'gentlemen callers'; they were arrogant, meddling goody two-shoes, to be shown the door as soon as they'd come in. Fleabags like <i>this</i> were not to get that far in the first place. She would have to have a stern talk with her staff later. \"Lady Viola Chattow. You may rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules straightened up, quickly taking in the composition of the personage before him. Her prosperity showed on every inch of her, whether in the rings and bracelets bedecking her hands and wrists, the necklaces of gold and silver ringing her neck, the fine fabrics of the dark purple dress she was swaddled in, or the extra two-hundred pounds, or so, she carried on her stout frame. Yet she managed to have an unpleasantly sharp face, which Jules felt calling \"ratty\" would insult the species, bipedal <i>and</i> feral. Her dark hair was pulled back into an intricate and tight jeweled headdress. That she was sizing him up with obvious disgust dispelled any qualms he had about what he had come to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Chattow, Sir DeNoon is here not on Temple business, but on a quest given to him by Sol-Ra Himself. We wish for your assistance in but a small manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what might that be?\" Lady Chattow asked, turning her back on him, and slowly sauntering towards the writing desk situated near the large window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules took a few steps towards her, to ensure only she would hear him. \"The Lipomancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLady Chattow stiffened for a second, then slowly turned back towards him, two spots of color riding high in her cheeks. \"What an ugly name. I am afraid, though, I have no idea to whom you refer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Chattow, wherever there is light, Sol-Ra is there. He sees all, and he knows all,\" the tiger said sternly, stepping towards her twice more. \"Sir DeNoon would not be here at his behest if you could not tell him what he needs to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nonchalantly as possible, Lady Chattow positioned herself up against her desk. \"Many slanderous lies are written about me, by light of day <i>and</i> candle. I am afraid you are misguided.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules reached for his sword, resting his hand on the hilt. \"Sir DeNoon warns you, Lady Chattow, you do not want to touch that bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big window seemed to flash in his vision, just for a moment, and he drew his sword anyway. Approaching his less-than-gracious hostess with the point held towards her heart, he commanded \"Lady Chattow, truth is to Sol-Ra the Illuminated as a candle in the darkness. Your disingenuous lies serve only to further jeopardize your soul. Before this gets ugly, tell Sir DeNoon the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, and beginning to sweat unpleasantly, Lady Chattow backed away from the tiger's sword, around the writing desk, and towards the light falling through the Cyclopean window. \"Doris said that you were handsome, but I see now she should have meant as a rug! If you do not <i>leave this instant</i>, I will <i>scream</i>, and my guards will tear you limb from limb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules took three more steps forward, and she three more steps back. Now, she was fully illuminated in the shaft of yellow sunlight streaming through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth always comes to light, Viola Chattow!\" he declared.</span></div></div>",

The Lady Chattow looked like she was going to vomit, but what, he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-haired woman's adipose-laden torso began to rhythmically distend, here and there, and it was a grotesque sight to behold. In her dark purple dress, it came to look like a pot of ink bubbling. Quite literally, she seemed to be coming to a boil in her own skin. Domes of flesh swelled outwards, then disappeared with audible, gut-wrenching <i>pop!</i>s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot limited to her stomach, the effect soon spread to her heavy arms, thick thighs, and fat-swaddled neck. She seemed to be trying to scream, but she could only hiss like a teakettle over the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of respect for the nice person she may once have been, the tiger paladin averted his eyes from what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sound like a gravy-filled water balloon bursting, if it were three feet in diameter, Viola Chattow exploded in a red shower of blood, guts and gore. Her dress floated down in tatters like confetti, and her shoes were propelled to opposite sides of the room. Rings, bracelets, and necklaces flew off in all directions, like the world's most expensive fragmentary grenade. A truly hellish smell filled the air. It was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules stumbled blindly forward into the embrace of the sunbeams shining unfettered through the large, round window, in places splattered with gore. His gorge was rising like a rocket, demanding he reintroduce his lunch to the world; breakfast would tag along, too. But he clamped down on it, telling himself he did not want to make a bigger mess for the maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sol-Ra must have seen his distress, for momentarily, the dappling sunlight soothed his stomach, and calmed his heart. On the backs of his eyelids, he saw spelled \"writing desk\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising, the tiger kept his head bowed as he first uttered a prayer of thanks and praise to Sol-Ra the Illuminated (\"may you shine forever in the darkness\") before turning around, away from the gruesome sight to his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe late Lady Chattow's writing desk sat just five feet from the window, and by luck, or divine intervention, it was as clean as Doris (or whomever the maid was who had tidied the room earlier) had left it. Sheathing his sword, Jules spun the top sheet of parchment around so he could read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">15th - \"Ample Ampitheatre\" performances, Lipomancer's \u00a0Castle Lair.<br>\r\nTwo days by carriage IF travel twelve hours/day.<br>\r\nRoom and board w/ other nobles at \"Golden Chalice Inn\". Ask \"Newberg\" (owner) for \"Lip Service\".<br>\r\nTake Doris (old vixen) to serve; Mimi \"to serve\".</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttached to this were finely-detailed maps. One showed exactly how to get to Little Silverhorne, host to the Lipomancer's Lair, from Wellingham, and the other laid out the town at the base of the castle, down to the residences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sol-Ra, you are as generous as you are wise, and from the bottom of his heart, Shining One, Sir Jules DeNoon thanks you,\" the tiger said humbly, taking a knee while facing the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took this opportunity to consider his choices. Today was the tenth. Armed with this new knowledge, he could continue his crusade against the Lipomancer this very day. A carriage would not be hard to find, especially for coin. He could even arrive in time to perhaps spare the poor souls destined for doom in this \"Ample Amphitheater\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, he could wait a few days here in Wellingham, and then follow the late Lady's itinerary. Posing as one noble among many, perhaps he could get close enough to the Lipomancer to end him before he quite knew he was being struck down. He would have a few days to prepare himself, and to help clean up the messes he had created for the maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing, he opened his eyes; there remained the mess that once had been a woman. The maids were now unemployed - and he wasn't happy to have to break that news to them - but would they still want to clean it up? Or would they only wish to turn their backs on a house full of bad memories, and never look back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules rose, and took a deep breath, the horrific smell filling his lungs unnoticed. He would pass along the news to the maids, and see how it went from there. Before leaving, he tucked the notes and maps into his coin pouch, and pushed the window open; the glass swung out from its diameter, like a coin flipping through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered leaving the door open, but then relented; the window would air out the room plenty. Maybe not enough, but it was better than the stench pervading the rest of the house. He plodded down the stairs to the second floor, green cape as still and solemn as his countenance. He saw the vixen maid waiting for him as he descended the stairs to the ground floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doris, is it? Please, if you can, gather the others in the employ of Lady Chattow here. Sir DeNoon has to say something you must all hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching his grim demeanor, the vixen nodded, and hurried into another room. As Jules repositioned himself, he thought he saw chairs. A dining room, then? A sound that may have been the faintest of tinkles emerged from it, followed swiftly by Doris again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs modestly-dressed servants began trickling into the grand foyer from every direction, she explained to the tiger \"All the maids have a spell laid on them so they hear the silver bells, wherever they ring, and wherever we are. They'll all come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently squeezing the vixen's hand in his own, much-larger and steel-mailed one, Jules offered a sympathetic \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the maids stood before him in the foyer (all furry, he noted, as if the Lady Chattow had thought humans above positions of subservience), he cleared his throat, and began. \"Fair maidens, Sir Jules DeNoon must apologize for this. His questioning of the Lady Chattow took an unexpected turn for the worse, and she- she has passed away. It was not Sir Jules' intention to create the mess that has left you unemployed, or the one in the bedchambers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had not known quite how they were going to react, but \"with cheers\" would have been a thought too silly to consider. Yet the women were laughing, cheering, hugging one another, and jumping up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWringing his hands, Jules turned to a broadly-beaming Doris in worry. \"Sir Jules does not quite understand. He hopes you might enlighten him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vile Viola was a mean and hateful bitch,\" the vixen stated bluntly, overflowing with relief. \"No one <i>liked</i> working for her, but we did what we had to so we could <i>survive</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but now Sir Jules has eliminated your source of income,\" the tiger said sadly, ears lowered. \"That is why he was not eager to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's <i>always</i> a demand for our skills out there,\" Doris assured him. \"And whoever buys this place - and someone <i>will</i>, because it's a nice place, despite the last owner - may well choose to keep us on as their staff, because we know it so well. There is little to worry about, Sir DeNoon. You should just be happy you have freed us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling hesitantly, he nodded. \"Sir Jules will try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoosening the leather straps on either side of his cuirass that held it tight, he hefted the heavy armour up over his head, leaving his top half in just the soft leather tunic he wore to prevent chafing. Not a few breathy gasps were heard from the crowd. \"But before Sir Jules does anything, he has left a bloody <i>physical</i> mess in the Lady's bedroom he intends to help clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoris glanced out at the assembled maids, most of whom were transfixed on the hunky tiger. <i>They</i> certainly weren't going to argue. \"Yes Sir! If you insist!\" she smiled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery individual maid would later <i>swear</i> that he had looked right at <i>them</i> when he flashed a grin that made faces flush, and knees go weak, and said \"Then let us get to it, ladies!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite insistent pleas and reasoning from all the maids at the late Lady Chattow's mansion to get him to stay, Jules departed that evening. He had every intention of ridding the land of the blight that was the Lipomancer as soon as he could, even if it meant departing that very night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving waved a last farewell to the maids, he now clanked back down the brick-paved path to the rest of the village. The setting sun had been visible through the big third-story window in the house, situated on a rise above the rest of Wellingham, but as the path dipped, the glowing orb fell behind first the inn, then the village's wall, and out of sight, though it still offered some illumination. Night was fast approaching, and the land was entering the domain of Nocturpus, She of the Inky Tentacles and Moonlight Eye. Some said she and Sol-Ra were forever chasing one another across the sky, and the explanations for this ran the gamut from forbidden love to eternal hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, Jules had never heard anything from the god Himself to confirm or correct this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWellingham's inn, according to the sign, bore the moniker of \"Le Chateau du Jour\", leading him to think the founder had been from Luxumentum, or had been pretending to be. The symbol on the sign was of a bowl, presumably of stew or soup, with a spoon protruding from it, contents steaming. This had the desired effect of leading him to realize it WAS suppertime, and a hot meal before he hit the road would be most welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, Jules saw nigh two dozen other patrons, not a few seated at the bar, and more around the tables. With an eclectic mix of cloaked figures, armored patrolmen, small families, single men and women, and even a few elves, clustered together for comfort, if not protection, he attracted next to no attention. Strolling up to the bar, he pulled out a stool, and set himself on it. The last time he'd <i>dropped</i> onto one while fully-armored, he'd snapped its legs in twain. <i>That</i> had been embarrassing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for ye, Noble Sir?\" A human barmaid in attention-grabbing dress asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not cross the tiger's mind to lower his eyes from her own as he told her \"Sir DeNoon will have your beef stew, if you have such a thing available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that,\" the barmaid confirmed with a polite smile. \"Bowl, or pot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse?\" He blinked, nonplussed by this turn of phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like a <i>bowl</i> of the beef stew, or a <i>pot</i> of it?\" the blonde barmaid repeated patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Just a bowl, please,\" Jules said, adding, almost as an afterthought, \"and a flagon of milk, if you would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have that out to you in two shakes, Sir,\" she assured him with a pretty smile of her own, flitting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What need would Jules have for a whole</i> pot <i>of beef stew?</i> he wondered, picturing such a dish being set in front of him. <i>Does she think he would feed his family? Perhaps the less-fortunate? He is not sure if it is rude to ask...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more than a minute later, a good-sized bowl and a tall flagon were set in front of him. He pushed the proper coinage across the counter with a \"thank you\", and delicately closed his mailed fist around the handle of the provided spoon. Happily enough, it, too, seemed slightly oversized, perhaps just for people such as himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the aromas alone didn't get the message across, one bite of the stew relayed to his taste buds just how scrumptious the stew was. The meat chunks were sizable and tender, the vegetables moist, the gravy full-flavored and thick, and the potatoes baked just right. The milk was creamy and cool, speaking to either magic, or expensive refrigeration techniques. In the tiger's estimation, it was a meal worth <i>twice</i> what he'd paid for it, and a lovely way to start off his journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about halfway through the bowl when a heavy hand clapped him heartily on the back making the ring of steel resonate in the air. \"I'm surprised you don't have a bowl for your milk, too, kitty-cat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards the source of this verbal tweak of the ear, Jules saw it had come from...</span></div></div>",

The most notable difference was that over his steel cuirass, the jerkin he wore was a deep, inky purple-black, and bore an insignia of a full, silver moon. This, and his late rise from bed, marked him as a Paladin of Nocturpus. Not his opposite number, exactly, but his mirror-match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir DeNoon will find you some roadkill to gnaw on for breakfast, if that is what you're after,\" the tiger needled right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Thanks, but I'll stick to the ribs they got here,\" the wolf laughed, clapping him on the shoulder in a friendly manner. \"Hey, you Daydreamers are alright; I don't care what <i>nobody</i> says. What brings you Wellingham way? Patrol?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules waited for the wolf to place his order, then told him \"Nay. Sir DeNoon is in pursuit of The Lipomancer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf winced visibly (and perhaps exaggeratedly), hissing through his teeth. \"Ooh. REAL nasty piece of work, that one. Was he supposed to have been in this area?\" He fetched glances around the inn at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the tiger could answer, the wolf stuck out his hand towards him. \"Oh. Sir Sidney Coltrane, at your service. 'Sid', to my brothers-in-arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger set his spoon down, and grabbed the proffered hand. \"Sir Jules DeNoon. He is often called 'Jules' by his fellows when in their company, and he has no objection to this. Well met, Sir Sid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well met, Sir Jules,\" the wolf agreed with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question-\" Jules began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could get any farther, however, the barmaid set a bucket and a pitcher in front of the wolf, who thanked her heartily. Seeing his companion's strange look, he shrugged, and said \"What? I'm going to take some with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Jules <i>had</i> been wondering why such a thing was on the menu...\" the tiger admitted, seeing the mystery was solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clearly haven't been in town for very long if you think <i>that's</i> why, though it <i>is</i> nice,\" Sid shook his head, pausing to chew and swallow a piece of his breakfast. \"If you'd seen some of the regular clientele, you wouldn't be so surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit early, but they'll be along before too much longer,\" he added, swigging some ruby red liquid directly from the pitcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough curious as to just what he meant by this, Jules tried to get back on topic. \"Well, anyhow, no, the Lipomancer has not been in this area recently. Sir Jules was here to question one of his associates. She was recalcitrant, and Sol-Ra saw to it she came to judgment for her life of poor choices and lies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did, huh?\" Sid raised an eyebrow. \"How'd he go about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She backed away from Sir Jules as he approached - he'd had to draw his sword when she threatened to call her guards for a fight - and she stepped into the sunlight falling through her large window. She soon began to... bubble, like a cauldron, and then she exploded! Sir Jules was not harmed, but he <i>was</i> surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she, uh, a little on the <i>heavy</i> side?\" Sid questioned thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than a little,\" Jules confirmed. \"Over <i>twice</i> what an average woman of her stature should weigh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid nodded, as if this explained everything. \"Thought so. Hate to burst your bubble, but I don't think that was your god, powerful and mighty as I'm sure he is, what done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" The tiger questioned stiffly, raising his eyebrow. \"Sir Jules is not prepared to listen to heresy about Sol-Ra without a vigorous verbal debate. He advises you to speak carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I could go on all night about Nocturpus, but hear me out, Sir Jules,\" the wolf waved him down. \"I've heard about this before. 'Acquaintances' and 'allies' and 'accomplices' of the Big L who, when captured, cornered, or sometimes even only <i>questioned</i>... Well, whether they like it or not, some sort of defense is triggered. Their bodies - well, more accurately, their <i>adipose</i> - starts attacking them, or starts sloughing off, or, like you saw, they just <i>burst</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid leaned in, lowering his voice. \"He doesn't <i>like</i> people like us, people with the power to act against him, getting in his business. I don't think he's powerful enough to act against us directly, but he can put obstacles in our way. Now that you know where to find him... Pal, you're a <i>big, fat TARGET</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might have made a lesser (or more intelligent) man quiver, but Jules only sniffed. \"Let him try to stop me. I have the blessings of Sol-Ra the Illuminated upon me. Creatures of the dark cannot bear the light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at this bit of pompousness, Sid declared \"And sometimes, you gotta fight fire with fire, which is why <i>I'm</i> coming with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules scoffed into his flagon. \"Says who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says Nocturpus! She of the Inky Tentacles and Moonlight Eye. You might have heard of her?\" Sid nudged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is still light in the sky. Sir Jules does not believe you,\" Jules maintained stubbornly. \"Sir Jules has heard <i>plenty</i> about Nocturpus. He has heard of her ties to the Duplicitwins, for example. Shadows and 'secrets' go so well hand-in-hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is <i>nothing</i> evil about my goddess! Inherently, or otherwise!\" Sid snorted, jabbing him in the chest. \"You want to take this outside? It just so happens to be <i>twilight</i>! Your deity and mine share the sky! They'll clear this up.\"</span></div></div>",

Jules cleared his throat, and took a deep breath. Sid swallowed, and washed his breakfast down with a draught from the pitcher he'd carried out with him. They started to speak, individual invocations entangling in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sol-Ra the Illuminated, who will shine forever in the darkness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nocturpus, She of the Inky Tentacles and Moonlight Eye, bringer of the blissful nights, your humble champion begs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...your light of truth upon the situation.

Their chests heaved, and nostrils flared, for they had become a bit boisterous in their contentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in that band of twilight, the heavens seemed to shift. Sunlight and starlight refracted in odd ways. Like a laser light show worlds and centuries away from the time and place for such a thing, words were there writ for the two of them to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules began. \"Caped Crusaders of the Clock: mirror-matched ye may be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but radiate, each of ye, the rays of justice, strong and true...\" Sid continued, with a sort of wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...from hearts of steel, and spirits, too.

What else could you want to know?\" Sid laughed a little, oddly impressed by his dedication to a stoic demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why</i> are you holding Sir Jules' hand?\" He demanded, raising his left hand, clamped in the wolf's right, up between their faces. Quite as a side note, he now noticed their height difference: at six-foot-four, he was two inches taller than the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought we were having a special moment, here, you and I...\" Sid said softly, looking at him with doe eyes, \"...and you're <i>ever</i> such a <i>handsome</i> tiger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules couldn't quite tell from his tone just how much he was joking, and tried on a few different, confused facial expressions before finding one that would do the trick: righteous indignation. \"Sir Jules would <i>thank you</i> to let go of him now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid did, unable to stop a smile growing on his face. \"Hoo, <i>boy</i>, this is going to be one fun quest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules only began marching back to town, muttering \"Sir Jules suspects you are going to be unbearable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not at all!\" the black wolf scoffed, bending down to grab his borrowed pitcher, then rushing to catch up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he considered, falling in step beside the tiger, \"maybe a <i>little</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger heaved an exaggerated sigh. \"<i>C'est la monde.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand what you just said, but it was <i>beaucoup</i> cute,\" Sid teased. \"Is that a twist of Luxese I hear in your voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules touched his jaw self- and subconsciously, as if evidence of this might lie in its shape. \"Sir Jules originally... hails from a region of Luxumentum, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid's tail swept the air behind him frenetically, and he was never more glad for his dark fur. \"I thought so. It makes everything you say- That is, it gives you quite the silver tongue. Er, I reckon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they reentered the inn, the wolf asked \"Hey, uh, when it's just the two of us- I mean, it seems a little silly for us to call each 'Sir' when we both <i>know</i>... Um, that is, are on a first-name basis, in private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules considered this, then smiled a little, and nodded. \"That is acceptable to Jules.\" He stepped into La Chateau Du Jour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid remained behind a moment, to let out a quiet \"Yesss!\", then followed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sir Sidney Coltrane (Sid to his brothers-in-arms) found his new tiger companion back at the bar, wasting no time in attempting to drum them up a ride. Leaning over an empty stool, he gave back the pitcher he'd borrowed, and then hurried towards the stairs. He only had a few things in the room he'd rented, but he didn't want to leave them behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules turned briefly to watch the black wolf mount the stairs with admirable speed, for all the armour he was wearing, then focused his attention back on the matter at hand. The barkeep was due to report back on the availability of carriages at any moment. The sooner they set off for the Lipomancer's Lair in Little Silverhorne, the better. He tried not to think about how many lives might hang in the balance even at his very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in luck, Sir,\" the blonde woman smiled as she returned, polishing yet another beer mug, seemingly without even looking. \"There's a freshly-rested team out there right now prepared to take you just about wherever you need to go. He won't move until you give the say-so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the gratitude of Sir Jules DeNoon, fair maiden,\" the tiger smiled, relieved. \"Sol-Ra's smile will warm you and yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my pleasure, Sir DeNoon,\" she assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tell Sir DeNoon which room Sir Coltrane rented?\" the tiger paladin asked hopefully. \"He must tell him of this arrangement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need, Sir DeNoon. He's- <i>I've</i> gathered my things,\" Sid said from behind him. \"We'll only need food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules, turning to the wolf, frowned slightly. \"But you just ate alongside Sir DeNoon not fifteen minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food for the <i>journey</i>, Sir DeNoon,\" Sid reminded him patiently, stifling a grin. \"Even if you can survive on air and sunshine, <i>I</i> like, and <i>need</i>, ribs. Or, you know- meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Fair point,\" the tiger nodded. He turned back to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid decided to trust his judgment, as they seemed to have similar dietary requirements, and turned away to look over the inn's other patrons. A number of them were the \"regular clientele\" he had earlier mentioned to Jules, and made a note to point them out to the tiger before they left. The three elves were still clustered in one corner, but they weren't his concern tonight. Nor were the cloaked figures sticking to the shadows - as long as they didn't do anything evil in front of him, he had no reason to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, though - the courier! There was usually one hanging about the inn, gathering money and messages throughout the night, and making regular runs about town. His message was a little more long-distance than that, but the courier could get it out for him on the morrow. He carefully made his way to where the man was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing a folded piece of parchment and the fee across the table to him, Sid said \"For delivery to the Nocturpus Temple in Tranquility, as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courier secured everything in the bag by his side, and nodded. \"With the first run of the day, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Sid inclined his head. \"May your night journeys always be moonlit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made for the door, thinking he would perhaps check out their carriage, but paused, thought, and decided to wait for Jules, instead. Yet no more had he turned around than a sack was thrust at him, giving him cause to jump back, and reach for his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only the tiger, however, smiling a little. \"Apologies. Sir Jules had secured the provisions, and he is ready to depart when you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready, as well,\" the black wolf said, relaxing. \"Was just about to inspect our ride, when I thought- Er, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not have to muzzle yourself around Sir Jules, Sir Sidney,\" he assured him as he followed him from the inn. \"He understands your urge to babble like a buffoon is only due to his incredible good looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a little <i>too</i> nail-on-head for the wolf, until he realized that the other paladin had been joking. \"O-oh, <i>yes</i>, that's <i>clearly</i> it. Wow, looks, <i>and</i> brains bigger than a walnut! You're the whole, hunky package, Sir Jules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, considering his hand was currently gauntlet-clad, Jules ruffled Sid's headfur playfully. \"Yea and verily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid voiced the customary grumbles while brushing his fur straight, including something about that \"great, stripy lummox\", but secretly was rather pleased. Yes, he thought he was going to enjoy this quest very much...</span></div></div>",

The two painted horses who'd be drawing it looked healthy and strong, as tall at the shoulder as he was overall. They snorted, and shook their manes, ready to hit the trail. Their driver was a stocky human, probably in his middle ages, in an... <i>unusual</i> suit. He greeted them with a showman's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Sirs. Fine gentlemen like you, paragons of purity, the gods' own forces for good, you deserve only the best transportation, and in this town, or any other, that is us. You've chosen well, and we thank you for it. Arthur Linkin, with my fast and faithful steeds Axle and Rod, at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Jules DeNoon,\" the tiger introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing his lead, the wolf spoke next. \"Sir Sidney Coltrane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands were shaken, and Arthur opened the carriage door for them, gesturing towards the interior. \"Plush and comfy interior. Viewing windows on either side, with curtains to keep wandering eyes out. Benches long and wide enough for both of you to have a lie-down, enough leg room to swing a cat around your toe, and secure storage compartments overhead for your carry-ons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Jules' behest, Sid climbed in first, and then he followed, lowering himself onto the seat catty-corner from the wolf. It was so well-cushioned beneath his bum, he couldn't feel the wood of the bench at all. He had to admit he <i>was</i> duly impressed, but Sid said it for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods be praised, this <i>is</i> amazing! If I had my way, I'd never use a different carriage!\" he grinned happily, unable to resist bouncing in his seat a little. \"Most impressive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur laughed, pleased. \"Well, thank ye kindly, Sir. Me work is me love, and I've given her only the best. Speaking of, her suspension is a revolutionary new build out of the mountains. Promises a ride as smooth as silk. <i>Is</i> there anything I can get you before we get underway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules and Sid exchanged a considering glance, then looked back at the driver, and shook their heads. \"We're all set,\" the black wolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then off to Little Silverhorne we go!\" Arthur proclaimed happily, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paladins listened as he climbed onto his own seat, settled in, and urged the horses into action. With a slight jerk (to be expected), they were underway. Now, they needed only to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to take off your armour, and lie down for the night, I'll keep the vigil,\" Sid offered. \"I mean, despite what I said earlier, I think we'll be safe, until we get there. And we'll both need our rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules mulled this over, but it didn't take long. \"Fair enough. Jules shall return the courtesy in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be halfway there by then,\" Sid reminded him. \"Probably resting up the horses at some wide spot in the road. They'll probably have an inn; lucky us. <i>You</i> get to hang about in the tavern, and <i>I</i> get a bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned over to help the tiger out of his cuirass as he said \"Lucky <i>you</i>, Jules thinks you mean. Mayhaps if he were one for drunken debauchery...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid looked and gestured toward the window, to spare himself the embarrassment of Jules' reaction to <i>his</i> reaction to the tiger's current state of dress. \"Are you kidding? <i>You're</i> not the one who gets to watch the landscape fly by until morning. <i>You'll</i> have something to see. So I <i>do</i> mean 'lucky you'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now</i> Jules sees what you mean,\" the tiger said, with a note of apology, as he placed his gauntlets, boots and leggings in the compartments overhead. \"You can put his cuirass and helmet on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, yeah,\" Sid nodded after a moment, caught up in examining the emblem of the radiating sun on the big, reflective piece of armour. He lowered both gingerly to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger kicked up his feet, and laid down on the cushioned bench, folding his hands on his chest. His soft leather tunic and pants were far more comfortable sleepwear than his protective panoply. He <i>had</i> been planning to nod off sitting up, but Sid could watch his back. He was beginning to enjoy having the wolf along. \"Good night, Sid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams, Jules,\" Sid smiled. He liked the way that sounded...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger was out in no time, recharging from his long day of walks in the woods, questioning gone wrong, and god-conferencing. Naturally, or as a result of conditioning, he remained quite still, and breathed quietly, chest rising and falling steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a chest it was! Sid took quick notice. Clearly muscled, each pectoral was defined, looking like you could bounce copper coins off of it! What a shame, then, that his abs were yet covered. The wolf was sure they were just as shapely and fit as the tiger's chest and arms (and surely his thighs and rear).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never quite achieved such a level of in-shape himself, owing to his inclination for infrequent indulgence, and inability to truly dedicate himself to something requiring <i>that</i> much hard work. Fighting evil was his great passion - never let anyone doubt that - but unlike many paladins, even of his order, he had... <i>other</i> interests he wanted to pursue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling wistfully, Sid turned his gaze out the window, onto the passing, moonlit landscape.</span></div></div>",

Sort of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf pushed aside the curtain over the window in the carriage's door, revealing, through the open window, the horizon; it was still the colour of the wolf paladin's jerkin, and yet dotted with stars. \"By my estimation, it's about two hours before dawn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Sid,\" the tiger said, so as not to be rude. \"Did you also hear something just a minute ago? It sounded like someone talking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid gulped, and shook his head rapidly. \"Huh? No, nono. Didn't hear a thing. May have been Arthur, talking to his horses.\" He winced as pain blossomed anew on the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Jules asked, concerned. He scooted over towards the wolf, and leaned forward. \"Let Jules see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, really,\" Sid protested, bowing his head anyway. \"Just a bump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is.\" The injury was no more than a minor wheal that didn't even protrude from his fur. It would be sensitive for a short time, but no real threat to his performance. \"Still, Jules can prepare a small poultice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite alright, but I appreciate the offer,\" Sid smiled sheepishly. \"I'll just be more careful in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" the tiger teased, petting the wolf roughly, but playfully, between the ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid laughed, and pulled away, face red beneath his fur. \"Yeah, yeah, har-har. You want some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jules could respond there came two brief knocks on the roof. \"Heads up, Sirs!\" Arthur's muffled voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid stuck his head out the window to answer, and it came to Jules how he'd incurred his bump on the head in the first place. \"Yes, Arthur? Trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur turned slightly to look down at him, but spoke loudly enough for them both to hear. \"No, Sirs! We're nearly to Half Measure Hamlet! We'll rest there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Sid called back before pulling his head inside. \"Well, how about that. Early, even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules sees that Arthur was right to say his horses were fast,\" the tiger nodded, impressed. \"He was not expecting to arrive until well after first light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here. Guess we got lucky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid seemed almost... <i>disappointed</i>, the tiger saw with a small frown. \"Worried your bed in town will not be as comfortable as your seat here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? No, that's pretty much a given, I know,\" Sid chuckled. \"Why do you ask? Do I <i>look</i> too comfortable, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No; you look <i>disappointed</i>,\" Jules stated. \"Jules reminds you that, barring unfortunate circumstances, you will get another ride in this carriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not! I'm not worried, or sad, or anything like that!\" Sid protested. \"Now, just- Come on. You want my help suiting up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the hunky tiger encase himself in steel, instead of only soft leather, was going to be disappointing, too. Whether more or less than losing three hours' worth of chances to sneak glances at him, he wasn't sure. Maybe it was an extension of the same disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules will gratefully accept your help,\" the tiger acquiesced, after a moment of thought. In a confined space, it would be easiest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he fetched his boots and leggings from the overhead storage compartments. These, even under these conditions, he could get on by himself. Sid salvaged some happiness watching the tiger wriggle around as he clamped on and tightened the bottom half of his armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was his cuirass, itself as heavy the rest of the set combined. Sid stood behind the tiger, and helped him fit his cuirass one right, and strap it up tight, sighing quietly. Such broad shoulders he had, and what a fine tail...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules put on his sword belt, with pouches for money, papers, simple field medicine supplies, and a dagger, as well as a place to tie his helmet on with a simple knot, ready to grab and wear at the first sign of battle. Sid noted it was an arrangement mirroring his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he pulled on his gauntlets, flexing and clenching before securing them to make sure they'd properly function. They were heavy, but he'd always liked the way they felt on his hands, and while wrapped around the hilt of his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage jerked at just the wrong (or right) moment, making the off-balance tiger teeter backwards. Fortunately, Sid was right there to steady him, wrapping his arms around his chest and waist, and easing him back onto his feet. \"Whoa, easy there, big cat. Don't want to find out if you'd fall through the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held him a moment longer than was quite necessary, and Jules noticed. \"Jules thanks you, but you can let go of him now, Sid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, heheh, sorry,\" the wolf recoiled, looking down sheepishly. \"Just, you know, making sure you're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger gave him a strange look as he sat back down, but said nothing more of it. \"Have you communicated with Nocturpus since we left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid sat down a little harder than he'd meant to, and bounced. \"Er, uh, no; not a word. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vague memory of some recent dream stirred sluggishly in Jules' head, but slipped away before he could grab it. \"Jules was only wondering if there had been developments to keep us abreast of, but now, he would guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nope, nothing like that,\" Sid shook his head, relieved. \"Everything is just peachy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight sway as the carriage decelerated, and then stopped. They heard Arthur clamber down from his seat, and then knock at the door. \"We've arrived, Sirs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules leaned over, and opened the door. Arthur stepped aside, and held it open for the paladins as they stepped out. \"The hamlet of, well, Half Measure Hamlet. Room and board, a tavern, a blacksmith, and a stable. And a jail; mostly for highwaymen caught closer to here than Little Silverhorne or Wellingham.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Arthur,\" Sid said warmly, and Jules echoed the sentiment. \"When would be a good time to set out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just after lunch, I think,\" the man said. \"That'll give us all a good chance to rest up, freshen up, and feed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see you then,\" Jules agreed with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf Measure Hamlet's inn went by \"Halfway Hostel\"; if it was supposed to be a play on words, Sid wasn't entirely sure he liked it. Jules marched in without pause, though, so he had to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this hour, all was deathly still and quiet. On their left was a row of three rooms; all the doors were shut. To their right, a candle was gradually melting into a puddle on the counter; no one stood behind it. Straight ahead, the drinking and dining area sat empty, a single lit candle on the only table fully in view. There wasn't enough room to swing a sword where they stood; Sid readied himself to grab his dagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules stepped up to the counter, and peered over. The proprietor was asleep on a bedroll, drooling slightly on her pillow. This, and the steady rise and fall of her chest, indicated she was alive. The paladin made it a point to gesture to her for Sid's benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing up a little, Sid moved to the counter, himself, and tapped on it with one steel-plated finger. Hopefully, the sound wouldn't wake any other residents of the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, slight, dark-haired, and human, rose with enviable alacrity, taking in the two of them, and asking \"Welcome to Halfway Hostel. One bed, or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules smiled gently, and replied \"One, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't suppose it's too early for a spot of breakfast?\" Sid asked hopefully, while she was dazed by the tiger's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Sirs,\" the woman nodded, more awake now. \"You can have the first room, and I'll get you menus right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the big iron key across the counter to Jules, then strode swiftly towards the dining area, perhaps to locate and awaken the cook.</span></div></div>",

It clunked and clattered, but released, and the door creaked inwards. Sid waited while he stepped inside, and used the provided flint and steel to light the candle in the sconce on the wall. In the small space, it provided all the light necessary. Jules backed out to let Sid in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid thanked him, and entered his room for the night. A simple armoire stood along the wall to his left, the bed with a straw mattress was pushed against the furthest and right-hand walls, and in the corner on his right squatted a wooden chair. A trunk at the foot of the bed sat ready to accept anything child-sized or smaller he might want to place inside it. There was, at least, enough room to turn around when standing between the furnishings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reminds me of the sleeping quarters at the Temple,\" he muttered to Jules, watching him get accommodated (or perhaps that he did not fall through the floor). \"Want to help me out of this cuirass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules squeezed through the doorway, and undid one half of the wolf's bindings, while he took care of the others. Largely, the insignia or jerkins they wore were the only markers to differentiate them on sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Sid said gratefully, hanging the armour on the pegs inside the armoire. \"I wasn't about to try sitting on the chairs here in full regalia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules cast a glance at the chair in the corner, then admitted \"Probably a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of want to take my leggings off, too,\" Sid said lowly, removing his gauntlets as spoke, \"but I don't want to be too far from my blades. Something about this place... I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules does not feel completely at ease, himself, which is why he plans to patrol after he has eaten,\" the tiger shared. \"He wonders if it is not knowledge of our quest instilling in us this sense of foreboding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid worked his boots off, one at a time, and wriggled his toes in relief. \"Hmm. Could be. Either way, I'm glad it's not just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, tested his weight, and then stretched his arms over his head, yawning. His soft leather tunic pulled up over his stomach an inch or two as he did. This naturally caught Jules' eye, and he was perversely pleased to see the wolf wasn't quite as <i>defined</i> as himself. His arms left no question as to his strength, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid followed the tiger into the inn's dining area, where a table had been cleaned and set with menus for them, as well as another candle lit. Jules took the stronger-looking of the two chairs, and both held under their weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eggs, eh? I am impressed,\" Sid muttered while scanning the breakfast menu, not entirely kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso on offer were such things as ham steaks, bread and toast, oatmeal, fruit tarts, and flapjacks. To drink, there was milk, water, ale, and fruit juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, I suppose they get a lot of traders through here,\" the wolf realized. \"Flapjacks sound good to me. What tickles your fancy, Sir DeNoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fruit pastries do, Sir Coltrane,\" the other paladin responded in kind, aware <i>others</i> may well be listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid,\" Sid commented mildly, seeing he was understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to prove their point, their hostess emerged from a swinging door in the rear of the area, and came up to their table. \"Do you know what you'd like to order, Sirs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir DeNoon will have the fruit pastry plate, and a glass of milk, please, fair maiden,\" the tiger began, placing a hand on his chest to clarify whom he spoke of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small plate, or large plate?\" She asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small plate, please,\" Jules finished, offering his menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took it, then turned to Sid. \"And for you, Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try your flapjacks, please,\" he replied. \"<i>Large</i> plate. And a tall glass of fruit juice to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of fruit juice, Sir?\" their hostess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise me,\" Sid smiled a little, chuckling. He held his menu out to her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have those out to you as soon as they're ready, Sirs,\" she assured them, taking the wolf's menu. \"Thank you for your patronage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for being so accommodating at this hour, fair maiden,\" Jules returned with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our pleasures, Sirs,\" the woman assured them, before heading back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you never smile at <i>me</i> like that?\" Sid pretended to pout, though he <i>had</i> felt a sting of jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules looked at him now, but in confusion. \"You mean, like <i>this</i>?\" he asked, and then beamed his most charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazzled, Sid could feel himself blushing crimson to the tips of his ears, and it was all he could do to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules stopped (a shame; yet a relief), and frowned thoughtfully. \"Sir DeNoon had not thought about this before... He guesses it was because he did not feel the <i>need</i> to be charming to you. But Jules will make an effort to do so, realizing you are in it with him, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid tried very hard not to squeal with delight, and managed to squeak out \"Fair enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger seemed to be sizing him up, but on the verge of saying something, he stopped, looking away with a small smile hovering about his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid's heart jumped, but he tried not to show how nervous this made him; how it sent his mind racing. What did it mean? What had he done? What <i>hadn't</i> he done? How was he supposed to react? To what purpose was the tiger doing this to him? <i>Was he going to be able to stop his guts spilling out through his mouth?</i> He clamped his muzzle shut with his hands, and stared resolutely at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules had before encountered a <i>very</i> few cases of what he'd been told was his \"animal magnetism\" affecting other males, but only in passing. It was funny to see such a case up close, and further amusing to have an extended opportunity to observe just how the wolf might react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Starting</i> with teasing him about what he might or might not be thinking. And if he hadn't had his boots on, he might've \"accidentally\" nudged his feet under the table, just to watch him squirm. As it was, though, he was only likely to injure him more. He rested his chin in his hand, and stared at the black wolf as if he were the most fascinating thing he had seen in quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid couldn't help but shift his gaze upwards, of course, but when he found Jules gazing at him like a schoolboy, he averted it to the table again, cheeks reddening. Maybe he had been a little hasty in wishing for him to loosen up around him? <i>Although, he</i> is <i>just trying to have fun with me, in his own way, and now</i> I'm <i>the one who's being uptight. If</i> I <i>relax... It can only lead to good things, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing the hold he had on his muzzle, he met Jules' gaze, and though he felt heat flood his face anew, he opened his mouth to say something. He wasn't sure <i>what</i>; only that it would be clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't quite get the chance, though, for their hostess chose that moment to bear down on them with breakfast. Well, Jules' breakfast, at least. She set the plate and his glass in front of him, announced \"We'll have those flapjacks out for you in a moment, Sir\", and just as quickly returned to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing the plate, Sid whistled lowly. \"Alright. <i>Now</i> I'm impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more apprehensive...\" Jules muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe so-called \"small\" plate had a dozen thick, oozing strudels arranged on it, each stuffed with fruit, and as big as the tiger's palm. This was an absurd amount of food for a single person, never mind if they <i>were</i> six-foot-four, and active-duty paladins wearing fifty pounds of steel plate armour all day. There was plenty to drink, though, for the cup looked like it held enough milk to fill a mixing bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules cannot hope to eat all these in one sitting,\" he said, surprised. \"<i>Four</i> would make him nauseous. And <i>you</i> ordered a <i>large</i> plate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid's ears and tail drooped. \"Oh dear. I <i>did</i>, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOminously enough, the door seemed to bang open with the sound of thunder. Sid saw the tiger's eyes widen as he beheld whatever was approaching, but didn't dare turn to see for himself. Frozen in place, he offered a quick, silent prayer and apology for every stupid thing he'd done, including this one, to Nocturpus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plate - no, the <i>platter</i> - their hostess set in front of him was loaded with a half-dozen stacks of a half-dozen flapjacks, each the size of a dinner plate, each stack topped off by a mound of whipped cream. To help ease all this down his throat, <i>pitchers</i> of maple syrup stood ready. If he got thirsty, there were three pitchers of fruit juices to wash it all down; enough to overflow a milk bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm going to be here until lunch!</i> he silently despaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse, fair maiden,\" Jules interjected as politely as he could. \"Sir DeNoon is curious as to how you, ah, decided on your serving sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to decode this into Common, the woman said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waiting for their breakfast at Half Measure Hamlet's inn, \"Halfway Hostel\", Jules' and Sid's fears that <i>something</i> was off were realized when a \"small\" fruit pastry plate contained no less than a dozen huge strudels! Now, faced with the wolf's impossible flapjack feast, they ask their all-too-obliging hostess \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, Sirs,\" the dark-haired human woman began, \"so close to Little Silverhorne, they <i>have</i> to be! I'm sorry! I thought you knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules and Sid exchanged an uneasy glance, but this didn't stop the black wolf from beginning to nibble at his one of his flapjacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that, innkeeper? Do you know?\" Jules pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been to the city, myself,\" she replied, looking vaguely ill-at-ease. \"We're just close enough to be bound by its laws. I-if you don't like that, I can get you something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I</i> like it...\" Sid murmured defensively, chewing on a piece of flapjack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, this will do fine; thank you,\" Jules assuaged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's anything more I can do, Sirs, just call,\" the woman bowed slightly, then headed back towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was gone, Jules stood up from the table, and said quietly \"Sir DeNoon will be looking into something outside. Do not worry if he does not return right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid nodded (his mouth, at the moment, full), acknowledging this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger controlled his footfalls, and stepped out as quietly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no one around he might have to make conversation with, Sid let loose on the flapjacks, pulling a stack towards him, and drowning it in syrup. They were indubitably delicious, each one moist, flavorful, chewy, without being mushy, and otherwise perfectly cooked. There were still far too many on his platter, but he thought he was going to put quite a dent in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Jules was outside, the wolf snagged a strudel from his plate, and bit deep into it. The warm fruit filling <i>gushed</i> out, galvanizing his taste buds with yet more delicious flavors. The crust was flaky and soft, yet not so much that it fell apart, complementing the rich flavor of apple, in this particular pastry. The tiger didn't know what he was missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf downed a dinner plate-sized flapjack soaked in syrup, then pulled close a jug of his fruit juice to wet his whistle. As no smaller cups were provided, he guessed it was alright to drink from the jug, and did so, taking a long draught. The liquid was crisp and cool (which surprised him, although he didn't know <i>why</i>, everything else considered), cutting through the sticky flapjacks with the spirited taste of... strawberry - and raspberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the <i>Crescent</i>, this is great!\" Sid sighed happily, between mouthfuls. \"I wonder if the food in the city is even this great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, and tucked back in, while meanwhile, outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Arthur,\" Jules said again, \"and sorry to have roused you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Sir,\" the cabman said dismissively. \"I hadn't even laid down yet. Just making a visual inspection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, it was kind of you to answer,\" the tiger said. \"Sir DeNoon will stay out of your way, now. Goodnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Sir,\" Arthur nodded, closing the carriage door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules switched their sack of provisions to his left hand, keeping his sword arm free. He had felt a gut need to get out of the inn, and was already regretting not dragging Sir Coltrane out with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the wolf, too, was a holy warrior, he reminded himself, and would be just fine on his own, for this short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling restless, the tiger paladin decided to begin his patrol early. They were in the countryside, some twelve hours away from major cities, and the night was quiet; he'd be able to hear trouble coming. Still, crime was not known to sleep; nor most gods. He borrowed a torch from outside the blacksmith's forge, lit it from one mounted outside the village's gates, and set off on the path to Little Silverhorne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf trouble was coming, he thought, it would come from that direction. But where there was light, there was might - the might of Sol-Ra the Illuminated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid made a valiant effort, complete with a second wind, but in the end, the flapjack feast had proved too much for him to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not bad, though...</i> he thought with a smile, surveying the extent of his destruction. Fully three of the six stacks of flapjacks had been decimated, nothing more than sticky plates with a few crumbs left behind. One jug of fruit juice was drained of its last drop, and a second was lacking a quarter of its fluids. The only syrup remaining in one pitcher was stuck on its sides, too inert to follow gravity's pull. And there were only <i>nine</i> fruit tarts remaining of the dozen that had originally festooned the tiger's plate. <i>Not bad at all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid grunted as he heaved himself up, belly so full, it was <i>swollen</i>, rounding out an inch in front of him like a curious distortion in the fabric of the night sky. It felt <i>very</i> good, though, warm and pleasantly sensitive to the touch. It poked out against his soft leather tunic, and just about over his steel leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ooh... It's</i> definitely <i>time for bed...</i></span></div></div>",

Are you done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf considered this for a moment, then turned to her with a grin. \"Right now, I've <i>got</i> to be, but can I take this to my room, so I can finish it at lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Sir!\" The dark-haired human woman beamed, nodding. \"I trust you found it enjoyable, then, Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best flapjacks I've ever had in my entire life,\" Sid swore, hand on his heart. \"And you can trust me on that; I'm a paladin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sir!

If the door to the outside world happened to slam open when he was sidling through the one to his room, then there would be a mess... but it stayed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid set the tray down on the table, which creaked worryingly, and then turned it so that he wouldn't bump it off, brushing by. Next, he closed and locked the door, remembering Jules had the key to let himself in. He unfastened his sword belt - which afforded him some relief - and leaned the weapon up against the wall, next to his bed. At long last, he removed his steel plate leggings, sighing again at the release of pressure on his abdomen this allowed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough, he thought, to fit in a last fruit tart before turning in. He blew out the candle in the sconce on the wall as he leaned in to take one, then straightened back up. Naturally, being a Paladin of Nocturpus, his vision in the dark was as clear as day. He lay down carefully in the bed, relishing the gooey, warm fruit flavors exploding in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, but his bloated belly felt so <i>good</i>...! If only his tiger were there to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>MY tiger? Now</i> there's <i>a thought...</i> Sid smiled, closing his eyes. <i>MY tiger. My hunky, brave, silver-tongued,</i> dreamy <i>tiger...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought, and his smile, followed him down into sleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the noontime sun overhead, Jules made his triumphant return to Half Measure Hamlet. Triumphant, at least, in that Truth and Light and Justice had come through, and on his patrol of the roads west of the small village, he'd detected no criminals to keep at bay. A day without crime was <i>always</i> a day of triumph!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReentering the Halfway Hostel was eerily like stepping in for the first time had been, though with better lighting. It was silent, and there was no one in sight - except when one stepped up to the counter, he saw, and looked over. There was the owner again, sleeping on her bedroll. He decided to try and not disturb her, and turned to wake Sid up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitting the big iron key into the door's lock, he turned, and with a few <i>clunks</i>, the door swung slightly open. Jules pushed his way through, and closed it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid was sprawled inelegantly across his bed, mouth agape, tongue lolling. One leg lay straight, and the other bent at the knee. His one arm thrown was above his head, and the other rested on the upper part of his abdomen, unknowingly pulling his shirt up some. A broad swatch of his black, furry (firm, <i>cut</i>) stomach (<i>belly</i>) was exposed, and though it was inarguably silly, Jules caught himself thinking of the rumors that said if one rubbed a canine's stomach <i>just</i> right, his legs would kick by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a thing was certainly very silly... Yet he felt an odd yearning to try it out. He was worried about the wolf's reaction; but then, he <i>was</i> a bit of a silly sort, himself. He would more than likely appreciate the joke. Jules removed his gauntlets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSidling into the space between the bed and armoire, he crouched down carefully, steel buns impacting the wooden cabinet behind him. He held his hands over Sid's stomach, looking for a good place to start, flexed his fingers, and then began. He picked a spot, and ran his big, cupped hand up and down the black wolf's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aroo?\" Sid made an inquisitive sort of noise deep in his throat, and sighed, stretching out. His subconscious mind had registered a feeling, and it was <i>good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules smiled, and tried up near his ribs, wondering if it would only tickle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid (or his body, anyway) bent one leg, knee sticking up in the air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules shifted his area of effect just slightly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess! Sid's right leg bent itself into the air, and began to kick quickly and rhythmically, as if he were stomping spiders, or pedaling some machine. At the same time, he let out a low, quiet sort of howl, smiling dopily. His dreams were getting better by the second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules tried not to laugh (out loud) at the sight, grinning wide enough for it to hurt, merely memorizing the location of this mythical \"spot\" (just in case). Still curious, he used his other hand to rub a different spot, to see if this would affect the wolf any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no earthly way of knowing how the future might have been different if that second spot he'd chosen was not a broad stroke of the middle of Sid's belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it happened, Sid reacted to this almost instantaneously, with deep, pleasured moans, an arching back, and a whispered litany of \"Oh yes, oh yes, oh <i>yes</i>, oh <i>yesss</i>, oh- Oh, <i>Jules</i>...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules did laugh, now, delighted, and said \"Yes, Jules! You can be very silly, Sid, but this is why Jules likes you.\" He stopped rubbing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid came around momentarily, blinking, sitting up, and then uttering a short scream as he realized Jules was <i>right there</i>, apparently <i>watching</i> him. \"Agh! Jules!\" he snatched at bedclothes that weren't there, trying to cover himself up before he caught on that he was dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger flashed him a happy smile, and asked \"Have good dreams, Jules hopes, Sid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf blushed crimson beneath his dark fur, but decided it was safe to nod, if he didn't have to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is lunchtime,\" Jules clarified for him as he stood up, \"though Jules sees you've got something there, already. Was it <i>that</i> good, Sid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid's hand unconsciously strayed to his (again flat) stomach as he nodded. \"You have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, do you want your second breakfast in bed?\" Jules teased, \"Or shall we take it out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what the thought of the tiger offering him breakfast in bed was threatening to do to him, Sid grinned, and agreed. \"Yeah, alright. I <i>will</i> take it in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, not unamused, Jules said \"Then decide how you want to sit, and I'll bring the platter to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe propped himself up against the headboard, legs extended straight out in front of him. \"Just put it on my lap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules obliged, lowering the loaded platter carefully onto his thighs. \"Are those <i>Jules'</i> fruit strudels he spies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, heh, I was just holding onto them for you,\" Sid said sheepishly. He picked up the plate, and offered it up to him. \"Uh, here you go! Lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules was teasing you; he already ate,\" the tiger smiled. \"You may have the rest of them, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I doubt I'll be able to finish them all,\" Sid frowned slightly. \"I'd feel worse if I didn't try, though.\" With that said, he dug in, starting with the flapjacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules didn't trust the chair in the corner to hold his weight, fully-armoured or not, so he sat down between the bed and armoire again, parallel to Sid. \"You are quite determined; this is good. We will need strength of spirit to succeed in our quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf decided not to mention how sorely tempted he was to call the whole thing off, and run away with the tiger; find someplace they'd never heard of the Lipomancer, and live together in peace. Problem with <i>that</i> was he didn't think the tiger - or their respective gods - would go for it. He tried not too sigh too loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look bored,\" he commented of the tiger. \"Why don't you pass the time with a story? I get the feeling you like to talk about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules shot him a glare that bounced right off his thick skull and wide grin. \"Fine. Jules will tell you of the origins of an illustrious paladin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here, I thought it was going to be non-fiction,\" Sid ribbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shush,\" Jules scolded mildly. \"Now, his story begins at the beginning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There's</i> a novel idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jules cleared his throat, and began his tale. \"Once, on the Luxumentum Riviera, there lived a healthy and happy family of... leopards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were they orange? With stripes? And actually tigers?\" Sid interrupted, grinning ingratiatingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking a finger under the black wolf's nose, Jules warned him \"Jules is going to make you <i>wear</i> your breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid only stuffed another bite of syrup-soaked flapjack into his maw, and chewed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring steadily at the wolf, Jules resumed his story. \"Ahem. This family of leopards were not the most prosperous, but they were good people, and lived a comfortable life. There was a mother leopard, a father leopard, and one each <i>leopard</i> son and daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, silently daring the wolf to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Sid was bursting to, he behaved himself, fearing the tiger might follow through with his threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Jules relaxed, and continued. \"Though the children differed in age by a gap of seven years, the older girl loved and cared for her brother as if he were her twin. From the day he was born, she doted on him; tickling his toes, spoon-feeding him meals, playing with him, and tucking him in at night with stories. He was like a child of her own. It would not be inaccurate to say he loved her more than his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, at fourteen years of age, the girl announced her intention to become a cleric. This was certainly unexpected. She had never before expressed a strong devotion to any particular god, and she had seemed to be a natural fit for the role of mother. Nevertheless, her family loved her, and they were proud of her decision. They gave her what money they could spare, and saw her off to follow her dream. On the day she left, her brother swore he, too, would dedicate his life to being a holy warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was gone, her family received a letter from her every week. In them, she told them she was doing well, having fun, learning much, and making lots of new friends. She was happy with her decision, she said, though curiously, never what decision this exactly had been. And she always said to tell her brother she loved him. The boy treasured these letters always, keeping them in a special box beneath his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a year, these letters were their only connection with their daughter. Spring turned to summer, summer to fall, autumn to winter, and then spring came again. The leopard boy missed his sister terribly, but knew she would want him to grow up big and strong. He ate his vegetables, roughhoused with the other village boys, lifted heavy rocks, fished in the river for dinner, and greeted the rising sun every day with a wooden sword and shield he swung at imaginary shadow-foes. His parents saw in him a bright future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one Spring day, they received their shortest letter yet; just two words: 'Coming home!'. Of course, they were overjoyed at the prospect of seeing how worldly and womanly their daughter had become in her absence. Her mother gathered all the necessary things to bake her a cake when she returned. Her father bought his buddies a round of drinks at the tavern, and they toasted her triumphant return. The boy promised his own friends that his sister was coming to kick their butts with her 'awesome cleric powers', so they had better just watch themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a week before she arrived, in the dead of night. She tied her black horse - her very own! - outside their home, and knocked. When her father came to the door, the candle in his hand did nothing to cut the shadows in this mysterious stranger's hooded cloak. But when a pair of st- spotted hands pushed the hood back, a familiar face was seen - his beloved daughter! His loud, joyful greeting and laughter woke the other members of the house, who came rushing out to see the situation, the boy armed with his little wooden sword and shield. But they laughed, too, when they saw her, and there was much hugging all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy of course proclaimed how much he had missed his beloved sister, and how he was going to grow up to be just like her. She smiled, and laughed, and said she had missed him, too. And she had missed his birthday - but she still had a present for him. He was, of course, excited to see it; surely, it was some mysterious and foreign object that would make him the envy of all the other village boys. But she poked his nose, as she had always done, and told him he would have to wait; she had something to discuss with their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them - the mother, the father, and the daughter - went, laughing and smiling, into the leopard parents' room. This was the last memory the boy would have of his parents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing nothing of this now, the boy warmed himself in the light of the stove. His mother had lit it in preparation for a cake she would never get a chance to bake. He never got too close, knowing well how fire could burn. It was perhaps ten minutes before he heard a door open, and then the padding of paws that he had come to know as his sister's. He turned to greet her with a great, big smile, and that, perhaps, saved his life that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard woman, for that she had become after leaving home, had her hands outstretched towards him, and her hood back up. The light from the stove behind the boy dispelled the shadows on her face, and he saw, just for an instant that his sister's eyes were colored red - not a feature he remembered, and he had seen her face every day for seven years. Perhaps she sensed this, though, for she stepped back from the light, and the boy came to dismiss it as a trick of the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her arms wider, she beckoned him towards her for a hug, and once he was in her arms, she told him 'Your birthday present is that you get to visit the city with me! Won't <i>that</i> be exciting?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened, and he gasped. Leaving the village? Traveling across the countryside? Going on an adventure his friends would only be able to envy? He was sold in a heartbeat! 'But what,' he asked, 'of Mother and Father?' Had they objections to this plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't worry about Mother and Father,' his sister told him. 'They are not going to disagree one bit.' She held up his bag, packed full of his clothes. They would leave right now, she said, and be to the city in a week. 'Say goodbye,' she said, 'to Mother and Father. They are dead tired right now, but Sister will hug you enough for both of them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Goodbye!' the boy yelled, all too trusting. 'Goodbye, Mother and Father!' And, of course, that he loved them; he would bring them back big-city presents. And he followed his sister outside, to her horse. This would be the last he saw of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister helped him onto the horse, then sat behind him on the saddle. She spurred the dark steed on, and they raced out of town. The night swallowed them up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is not easy, riding such a distance, but the boy, although raw and untrained in the art of horsemanship, and unfamiliar with sleeping anywhere but a bed, enjoyed it all immensely. It was all an <i>adventure</i>, see. With his beloved sister, no less. The greatest time of his young life yet. He would never forget it. Not even the village they had rode so quickly through, all he could remember was its scent - death, decay, <i>unlife</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared and grew on the horizon, one sunny day, but they stopped just short of the city at sundown, and made camp. The boy was disappointed, of course, but his sister assured him they would go in the very next morning. He should try to get some rest, she said, because it was going to be a big day for him. He didn't think he could sleep a wink, but after supper, he was out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, the next morning, mounted on their horse, they trotted through the big gates, and Sister announced 'Welcome to Vermeil L'on!' The city was, and still is, <i>enormous</i>; there were many shops and services up and down the street. Temples and taverns dotted the city. A huge castle towered over it all, keeping watch. And people! People <i>everywhere</i>! More people than the boy had ever seen in his life! Furries in shapes he had never imagined! And humans, living alongside them! He was smiling fit to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving their horse at a stable, they walked around the city on foot, taking in the sights and sounds and smell of it all. And the tastes! It seemed they were eating all day, always stopping at this restaurant, or that stand, to sample something new and exotic. It was all very good, and it was a wonder to the boy how people created it all. He would never forget anything about this day, either. Including what happened that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper, with the gates closing on the sunset, they retrieved their horse, and Sister led them all deep into the city. 'Now you will get to see,' she promised, 'the secret temple where your sister lives.' They left the horse in a nearby stable, home to other black horses, and entered a big, old house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, they went not up, but down, into the basement; through a tunnel, and to a red door. The leopard sister knocked, spoke some cryptic phrase, and it opened. Ignoring the smell, of blood and decay, the boy followed her through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sanctuary was far bigger than the house above, four stone pillars hung with red tapestries supporting the main room, double wooden doors to either side, a corridor straight ahead that turned sharply away, and more red rugs underfoot. Torches on the walls and pillars kept it well-lit, though it was slightly damp and cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could stay in her bedchamber, for now, his sister told him, leading him off to the right, while she talked to her Master. And she would have a ceremony that night, she explained, so if he fell asleep without her, he shouldn't worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe double doors opened onto a short corridor that quickly turned to the right, and then opened on the left into a bigger room. The right half of this room was semicircular, with beds arranged in just such a pattern along the wall; wooden chests squatted at their feet. The left half of the room was square, with wine racks and dining tables, chairs arranged around them. The rugs, more wall hangings, and even the beddings were red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard boy's big sister escorted him right to her personal bed, sat him down on it, and said the last things he'd ever hear her say. 'You can sit or lay down right here. I'll be back, but don't leave this room. And remember: Sister loves you.' Then she kissed him on the forehead, and she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with food, and fresh memories of fun and excitement, the boy dozed off into a peaceful slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it seemed like hardly any time at all before he heard a distant door crash open, and the steely thunder of armored men stomping around. When he began to hear yells and screams, he rushed down the short hall, and nearly into the double door. Thinking better of it, he settled for peering through a crack in the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what he could see, the double doors across from him had been torn off their hinges, and there was a scuffle inside. Light glinted off of steel swords as they cut through the air. Cloaked figures, unarmed, raised their hands, in defense or pleas, against the marauding men, but were swiftly cut down. More than one bellow of 'For Medremelth!' could be overheard. Cries of frustration and hatred rent the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, hardly a minute after it had begun, it was over. The armored men clanked back into the sanctuary's 'hub', and stopped. Someone - mayhaps their leader - suggested 'We had best check the bedchambers; though I don't feel anything coming from that direction, Medremelth wanted a clean sweep.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the boy scrambled away, as fast as he could. Gods only knew what they would do to <i>him</i> if they caught him! Desperate, he spotted a chest that wasn't latched shut, and dove inside. It was tight, but empty; apparently because it wouldn't close, leaving only a sliver of light streaming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hardly dared breathe as the sound of steel-booted footsteps pervaded the room. For what seemed like an eternity, he crouched, prone and motionless, in that box. Terrified. Wanting to scream; to jump up, run; to burst into confused tears; to kill; to <i>die</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, finally, a voice called 'All clear!', and the armored men, whomever they were, left the room. In a kind of terrified stupor, the little ti- the leopard boy, so young, passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor how long, he did not know, but when he came to, all was silent; <i>deathly</i> so. The boy climbed out of the chest, joints aching from being curled up so long. But he hardly noticed; he ran, out of the bedchambers, through the common area, and past the shattered wooden doors. The sight that awaited him was horrific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood. Everywhere, there was blood. The floor. The walls. The room's pillars. A book, a blood-soaked <i>book</i>, lay nearby. But this wasn't what made him scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbly, he picked up a severed arm, still wrapped in a dark robe sleeve. Pale, hairy, scarred - it had belonged to a human man. He set it down, and moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were bodies, and parts of them, scattered all around. Hacked-off hands, far-flung fingers, lopped-off legs. Hooded heads. Still, he did not cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stumbled forward until he found what - whom - he was looking for. His sister. His beloved older sister. Her mouth was frozen in a rictus of pain. All the light was gone from her glassy eyes - mysteriously red. Her fingers were curled up, as if frozen partway through making a fist. Her tail was limp and lifeless. She was in one piece, he saw. She had received a sword through her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now</i> he screamed. He screamed, cried, threw out all the curse words he knew, and asked the world at large 'Why?'. He screamed until his throat was raw and swollen, then squeaked terribly, sobbing, tears wetting his shirt, and his sister's robe. He sat with her a long time, petting her head, over and again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was some time before sense returned. Knowing he would have to bear this terrible news home to his parents, the boy stood up, laid his sister down gently, and kissed her goodbye. And he swore to her, on whoever had done this, he would one day take revenge. It was a brash promise; the kind young men are given to make. The gods to later come would not hold it against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he returned to the bedchamber for his bag of clothes, though, he began to think. What was it the men had said? 'For Medremelth'? He had heard that name before... The God of Medicine! The God of Health! But- That made these men- 'Paladins!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can imagine, he was crushed. Why had holy warriors - paragons of peace, and justice, and <i>good</i> - done something so- so <i>evil</i>? Why had they wiped out these clerics, other men and women of the cloth? <i>Why had their god told them to do it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard boy felt he could no longer join their ranks in good faith. Yet, he couldn't just be evil, either. So he had no hopes; no dreams. He would grow up to be a farmer, or a blacksmith, or a cooper; live a quiet life, grow old, and die. This was depressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed his clothes, wet and stained with blood, and took his bag with him into the city above. Dawn was just breaking; he could tell. What should have been inspiring was only saddening. This was the first day of his life without his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horses were all gone, he noted. Even if he could have mounted one, he had no idea how to control it, or how to get home. He would have to rely on the kindness of strangers. If he had stopped to think, he might have been scared. But he only wanted to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely lost, a stranger in a strange city, he walked to the east, towards the rising sun. The first friendly-looking face he saw, he decided, he would ask for help. You see, everyone in the village he had come from was willing to help one another; they had to be. He assumed, besides those Paladins of Medremelth, it was the same here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not catch sight of anyone until he found his way back to the merchant's district, where he'd received his first impression of the city. There, people were setting up stalls, opening shops, doing breakfast shopping, and stumbling home after long nights in the taverns. Except for the drunks, they looked friendly enough to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first approached a comfortably-familiar target; that is, a furry. The fox ran a fruit stand, and at this time, he was examining his stock for anything he couldn't sell. The boy had a polite, but heart-wrenching speech planned. 'Please help!' he'd say, to catch their attention. Then he'd go on about how his sister had brought him to the city for a vacation, and met a terrible fate. Could he help him find a way home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, alas, all the boy could muster was a pained squeak. His throat had not recovered from its earlier exertions. Try as he might, he could not properly talk. It should go without saying that this discovery did not fill him with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the fox heard him, or perhaps sensed him. Turning, his polite smile fell away at the sight of the dirty little child. Selecting a few rejected fruits, he tossed them to the leopard boy, saying \"Aw, geez. Here you go, kid. Now beat it; you'll frighten off the customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, dejected, yet grateful, the boy took his prizes off to a quiet space behind a nearby building, and sat down to eat and think. The fruit wasn't rotten; just not 'pretty' enough to sell. He would... come to <i>relate</i>, over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhem, anyhow, he thought about what he would do now. Until his voice recovered, he couldn't ask for help. So young, and with no money, he could not buy parchment to write on, ink and quill to write with, or get his message out. He could try to find a place where they would take him in, no questions asked. Normally, this would have been one of the Temples; but he'd seen he couldn't trust them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe racked his little brain, and with his blessedly ignorant, black-and-white view of the world, he came to a solution: he would go to the castle. Everyone knew the king was a 'good guy'; <i>he</i> would help him out. And he would surely bring his sister's killers to justice, too. This was the last time he would get his hopes up, nearly ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocating the castle was hardly difficult. The widest road led straight to its gates, and the stone structure was an intimidating presence, looking over everyone's shoulders. It reminded the population to behave themselves - or be very wary when they weren't. Countless carts were on their way there, so the boy naturally assumed getting in wouldn't be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got through the outer gates without trouble. Urgent as his mission was, he took the time to goggle at the splendor of the castle up so close. Old, grey stone, fresh green ivy climbing its walls, old and new wooden fortifications and stairs, and the beautiful garden. This area was open to the public; at least, before sundown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy followed a path, bordered by flowers, deeper in towards the castle. The pair of great wooden doors, reinforced with steel bands, rivets, and who-knew-what spells, beckoned from across the drawbridge. He thought to march right in. Bold fool he was. But, you already know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers stationed on the inland side of the moat stopped him. 'What business have you,' they asked, 'in the castle?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he could not tell them. He gestured to his throat, then shook his head, trying to convey that he had no voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers understood at least <i>that</i> much. They did not, however, particularly care. 'The King has no use for mute, dirty <i>urchins</i>,' one man sneered. 'Get out of here, before you're thrown in the moat!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy would not understand the meaning of that word, 'urchin', for some time yet, but he understood the tone well enough. He was again unwanted. He was frustrated, more than anything, this time, though, because he <i>knew</i> the King would help him, if only he could get in to see him. The leopard boy decided to wait in the castle garden, and hope an opportunity would present itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be brief, none did, though he waited all morning. Near lunchtime, remembering how the fruit vendor had treated him, the boy returned to where the food stalls were set up. He found that, even without saying anything, many of the merchants were kind enough, or eager enough to get rid of him, that they had a little to spare him, and he made a decent, hodgepodge meal of samples and rejects. This was a trick he would not soon forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating, he went back to wait in the castle gardens again. He was there until sundown, when he was hustled out, no closer to his goal. If the King would not see him, even after he had waited <i>all day</i> near the castle, then he never would, the boy felt. And now, he had nowhere to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you can imagine how he felt. Alone, unwanted, miles from home, in a strange city, one beloved sister short, and with night falling. Maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tried to make his way back to the house he had left that morning. He could avoid the massacre easily enough, and use the beds there. He remembered enough to find the area where the fruit vendor had been set up, and then walk towards the setting sun from there. By fate or providence, he made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the house itself had been boarded up, solid planks of new wood nailed across the doors and window, barring entry. He walked all around it, but there was no way for anyone, even his size, to sneak in. The paladins had covered their tracks. Profoundly saddened, he curled up behind the house, out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleep did not come easy, but it eventually took him. Transported him, for a brief time, away from the nightmare he was living.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ah... The next six years of his life were... the toughest he ever experienced, even considering what was to later come. Tough, emotionally <i>and</i> physically. Even more than his childhood up to that point, it shaped him into the man he would become. We'll not go into great detail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy lived alone on the streets of Vermeil L'on, an unkempt, unwanted, unloved orphan. He eventually stopped wondering why his parents hadn't come for him. He stopped thinking anyone was going to help him. He stopped thinking of that distant village as 'home'; his home was the streets of Vermeil L'on. He forgot the very <i>name</i> he had been given at birth; no one ever used it. He never forgot, though, his sense of right and wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would put him at odds with the city's other 'street urchins' and dwellers. By and large, they were a swindling, thieving, cutthroat bunch. They did whatever they thought they had to do to get by, including stealing from houses, shops, and food stands, extorting more upstanding citizens than themselves, breaking into empty houses, eliminating their competition, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese people did not like that the tiger- <i>leopard</i>, excuse - would not join them in their illicit activities; even foil them. They did not like that he seemed to think himself above them, hardly speaking to them, even when they challenged him to his face. They <i>really</i> did not like that he could beat down many of them in a fair fight. He was an outcast among outcasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard learned quickly the value of fitness and self-defense, living on the streets. When unwanted, one too often had to make a quick getaway, be it from angry citizens, shopkeepers, or soldiers. In this way, too, he came to know the streets in a way only those who become a part of them can. He resumed rising at dawn, and his training, as the sun rose, discovering, before too long, where the soldiers daily drilled. He watched religiously, studying all their moves and mannerisms. He had left his wooden sword and shield at home, but a discarded metal scrap proved just as good, for his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween waking and sleeping, he usually sat in the alleys around the market area. Sympathetic strangers sometimes offered a few coins, scraps of food, small charms from their temples, or rarely full meals. The leopard always thanked them politely, with his earnest smile. More often than not, this made them offer a little more, which always vexed him. After all, he was not, exactly, the tapestry-boy for charm. But he never turned them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways, <i>always</i>, when living on the streets, he avoided paladins like a plague, regardless of their affiliation. They were easy enough to hear coming, clanking like kitchens in their weighty armour. He knew they offered alms and food for the poor, but he didn't trust them a bit. It would be too easy for them to curse or drug him at these meals, or kill him in his sleep, and rid the city of him, once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving on the streets made the leopard agile, crafty, and cunning. Maturity made him tall, strong, and good-looking - it is said. He shot up in height rapidly his twelfth year, nearly two feet. And his growth topped out the next year, making him, it is said, nigh six and one-half feet tall. For a young man of thirteen summers, this was unusual, indeed, but an indicator of great heritage, and great destiny. Or, so he would be told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis height made it harder, if not impossible, to hide some places, but opened paths to many more. And he enjoyed seeing the world from such a vantage. He felt, as he had so long ago, <i>powerful</i>. The others of the street would come to leave him alone, for his victories seemed assured now, more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day he believed to be his fourteenth birthday, the same age his sister had been when she'd left home to pursue her dreams, the leopard was approached by a most unusual man with a most unusual offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was dressed in a dark cloak with the hood up, even on such a warm day, and no part of him was exposed to the light. He seemed to glide along the ground, rather than step, and his movements were furtive. His face was hidden in shadow, and the leopard had a brief, distant memory of his sister looking the very same way when she had returned- and then it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man explained that he had a prime job opportunity, just for him. He was an artist, and the leopard would be the subject of his next painting. All he had to do was come to some sittings, and he would be fed, clothed, and paid handsomely. Just for sitting still!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, this was tempting, but the leopard wanted to get a few things straight. Did the man work for a temple? No, he said, and laughed. Did he work for the castle? No, he said. Not them, either. He painted what he liked, and sold them to whomever paid the most. One final question: would they have to leave the city? Again, the answer was no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, the leopard had wanted to see the world. Now, he had seen quite enough of it. He knew the city of Vermeil L'on like the back of his hand, and he never wanted to feel lost again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the leopard agreed; it really was too good of an offer to pass up. He'd soon find out why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith these promises made, the man led him deeper into the city, to the west. The leopard kept an eye on his mental map, and it became increasingly clear where he was being led. He was not surprised at all to find himself once again at the house that stood over the secret sanctuary where his sister had been slaughtered six years ago. Did the man know what lay in the basement, he wondered, or had it been sealed away, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house itself had been nicely restored, and instead of down, they went up, into the attic. It had perfect light, and space, and <i>essence</i>, the man said. The leopard didn't disagree with him, or think much of this. Artists were known to be strange types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was, though, slightly uneasy about where he would sit. There was some large, odd circle carved into the floor around and beneath the chair, made of some mysterious, icky lines and letters. Candles dotted the edges of the circle periodically - but they were black. The man would only say, though, that it was all decoration; a part of the painting. So the leopard sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreparing to begin, easel and canvas already set up, the man pushed back his hood, and this is the only thing the leopard saw: his red eyes. So much like his sister's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said as much, and the man smiled. 'Well. Isn't that just a funny coincidence. Who is your sister?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the leopard told him 'She was killed. By paladins.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man seemed shaken, but said only 'Apologies for your loss. Let us begin.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... the leopard... would not later remember much of what happened between that, and the next thing, and so not much is known of the details of what the 'artist' did in the attic that afternoon. But they are details best left that way: unknown. What matters is what happened next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a <i>crash!</i> from downstairs; a sound the leopard had heard before. He started to quaver inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the thunder of steel-booted feet. The leopard's insides turned to jelly, and the man started to work faster. Now, the leopard could hear him chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stomp stomp STOMP!</i>, up the stairs came the feet. The leopard wanted to move, but he couldn't; he was frozen in place. He shut his eyes against what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>STOMP! STOMP! STOMP!</i> The boots, the armored men, were coming closer, crashing and clanking up the second flight of stairs. Any second, the door would burst open. The man was practically <i>screaming</i>, now, rushing to finish his odd incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright, senseless, clutter of noise... And then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOM!</i> The door was knocked off its hinges!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'SOL-RAAAAA!' A hoarse battlecry scraped the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'EeeeeEEEEEE-' a girlish shriek was cut short!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thump.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn exhalation. The clatter of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Boy! Say there, boy!' The leopard winced at this voice, refusing to open his eyes, praying with all his might they would just <i>go away</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Boy, are you alright?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth. His head swam. The world spun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke, he was on a cot. A stone wall loomed on his right. His throat felt raw and swollen, and for a second, he feverishly wondered if the last six years hadn't been some sort of horrific demon-dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no, when he swung his legs out, they met the floor. His clothing was current, if dirty. He was long and lanky, head full of streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his left, a small cart waited. On it was a fresh change of clothes - they were yellow, not a colour he particularly cared for, considering his fur - a bowl of water, presumably for washing his hands and face in, a towel, and a glass and pitcher of water for drinking. Despite the danger, he grabbed at these eagerly; his throat was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slaking his thirst, throat throbbing, he considered the clothes. If they fit, he should hardly pass them up. He unfolded them, held them up, and found that they did. It was unsettling, to be sure, but you know that old saying about beggars...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce changed, he left his old clothes on the bed, and started to look for an escape. Wherever he was, he didn't want to be there. He wanted to be out on the streets he knew best, putting this whole terrible incident behind him. He wanted to be <i>away</i> from the paladins who had finally caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, and saw he was in a room lined with other cots, though none of them were occupied. It seemed to be a soldiers' dormitory. There was a wooden door in the wall in the middle of the room, between the two sets of rows of bunks. He opened it up, and peeked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was at the end of a hallway, with another wooden door across from him, and a possible escape route to his right. Assuming the other door led to more beds, he crept down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the next junction, he took a left, away from the lights of what seemed to be a dining hall in the distance. This part of the temple, if he had to guess, was darker; he was less likely to be spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hall let out onto a training area. There were wooden dummies, slices from bales of hay painted with colorful rings, heavy bags hanging like men at the gallows... And best of all, racks of weapons! Though he couldn't picture killing anyone, he knew he could use one to threaten anyone who got in his way. He took an iron sword, grinning just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far side of the room were stone stairs that led to an upper level, which seemed to ring the training area. He took a torch from the wall as he continued down the hallway up here, for it was dark. The corridor jigged right, and ended in a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, when he pushed through, he found himself in a courtyard. And below, down a set of stone steps, lay the city! Once he got to those streets, he could flee from this place, and they'd never find him again! That it was nighttime made no difference to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just about to run for it when slow, dry claps began to ring out around the courtyard. From out behind a pillar stepped a smirking paladin, looking right up at him. He was unarmored, but a fine steel sword hung by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jolly good show, boy; jolly good,' the man said. 'You are a wily one. And <i>quiet</i>, too. No one else thought you would leave. But with the way you were screaming- Well, <i>someone</i> had to know better. And that someone is Sir Yancy D'white!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard said nothing, of course; only calculated his chances of outrunning, and then losing the man. They looked pretty good - he was a burly warrior, not a fleet rogue - or cleric...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'white must've known the leopard better than that, for he drew his sword. 'Sorry, boy. Can't let you leave; we'd never find you again! If you'd get back inside-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the leopard brandished his own sword, mostly as a warning. He would hurt him if he had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, D'white laughed. 'Well then! If you can best me in a duel, you can go free. We fight to first blood. Agreed?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard nodded, and moved down the steps towards the man. They met in the middle of the open courtyard, staring one another down. They raised their blades, tapped them together, and sprung back. The duel was begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ti- leopard had seen duels before, in the square, and had been in not a few, himself. Those were street fights, though, where dirty pool was expected as a matter of course. The leopard, honorable though he considered himself, was not entirely above this, when it came to survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it should come as no surprise to hear that after some sword clashing, with parrying, thrusts, circling, jumps back and forth, and feints, he batted aside the man's arm, and with his left hand, punched him in the nose. D'white fell down, from the force or surprise, and clapped a hand to it - sure enough, it was bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just laughed. 'So, the kitty has claws,' he said. 'Go, then; you've won your freedom. But know what you'll be passing up if you do. A better life. A chance to help people. Heh; three hots, and a cot. A reason to get up in the mornings, and <i>live...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few sparse rays of light broke the horizon behind him, and the leopard turned, realizing it was dawn. As a new day began, so could he begin anew. He really <i>didn't</i> have a reason to live; he'd only been living not to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these men were <i>paladins</i>... Could he trust them? Could he <i>forgive</i> them? By the time he figured it out, would it be too late to run away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>why</i> run away? At this point, the futility of life staring him in the face, he was ready to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard turned back to the man, and crouched down. He set his borrowed sword on the ground, and then extended a hand to help the man up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'white broke into a sunny smile, and stood up with him. 'Welcome, brother,' he said, 'to the Temple of Sol-Ra.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger - all he could do was smile back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules finished his epic tale, and took a draught from the pitcher of juice he'd snagged from Sid, clearing his throat. \"Ahem. Excuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set the juice aside just in time for Sid to drop down onto his lap, throwing his arms around his neck, and moaning \"Ohh, <i>Jules</i>! Wh- That's- I- What a story...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were tears in his eyes, and tracks on his face, as he shook his head. \"That was beautiful, and <i>touching</i>, and-!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting on Jules' lap, the black wolf had the tiger pinned, sitting between the bed and armoire, with his back against the wall, as he was. As the tiger had just finished telling his harrowing backstory - thinly veiled as being about some unnamed <i>leopard</i> paladin - Sid had teared up, overcome with emotion. And before the tiger could get more than a few words out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black wolf pressed his lips right onto the tiger's own, releasing the confusion, excitement, and <i>lust</i> that had been building up since he'd met him. It was, he knew, so very wrong. But in this moment, ooh, it felt <i>so right</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules felt confused for a very short fraction of a second; then, he was feeling something else entirely. <i>Pleasure</i>. Pleasure, and warmth, flooding his body, from his lips to his ear tips, and down to his toes. Carefully, delicately, he squeezed Sid to him with his steel-plated arms, against his battle-ready chest, and kissed back. If he'd had to think, he wouldn't have known what to do. But this felt <i>perfect</i>, and <i>natural</i>; think, he did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules began to involuntarily purr with pleasure, and Sid's tail wagged faster than ever before behind him; if there had been a candle still lit, it would have been blown out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf moaned again, this time happily, and stroked what little of the tiger's fur he could feel: his head. Over and again, he worked his fingers through the thick fur on the back of Jules' head, loving how smooth, but <i>wiry</i> it felt, and how <i>warm</i>. He could only imagine what stroking his arms, or back, or even <i>chest</i> would feel like, and what pleasure it would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules instinctually worked his hands up under Sid's shirt, rhythmically rubbing his ribs, up and down, fur working against him, and then flowing with him. He could feel his heart racing in his chest, and each breath he took. He <i>thrummed</i> beneath his hands, like a raw current. It was somehow <i>exciting</i>; he enjoyed it very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen, finally, regrettably, they pulled apart to breathe, faces still mere centimeters from one another, Jules had the sense to say \"We shouldn't be doing this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was always a lousy Paladin,\" Sid panted, petting the fur between the tiger's ears. \"You're <i>perfect</i>; the gods will forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was irresistible; they went back for seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pant, pant, pant...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Wheeze... Wheeze...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was official: they were too winded to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid sat on Jules' lap, reclining against him like an odd steel chair. His tongue hung out of his mouth, and he panted rapidly, as if experiencing a heat wave. The room <i>was</i> getting warm, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules leaned up against the wall, hands on the wolf's waist, beneath his soft leather shirt. He was glad he had taken his gauntlets off before starting his story; funnily enough, to rub the wolf's stomach, though not quite as he was doing now. His chest heaved steadily, seeking fresh air; he was really quite hot, in nearly full armour. The room seemed <i>stifling</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think I can finish that breakfast, now,\" Sid said, breaking he relative silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do hurry,\" Jules encouraged. \"We need to be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing a string of curses, Sid nodded, and rose. \"Yeah. Only got one stack of flapjacks, and those fruit strudels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules is surprised you didn't finish already,\" the tiger commented, rising rustily, himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of got caught up in your story,\" Sid said apologetically. \"Uh- Were the red-eyed guys who I think they were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules nodded grimly, attempting to stretch, in the small space. \"Sanguimancers. Hemocytes. Blood Mages. Whatever you want to call them. The <i>leopard</i> dedicated himself to fighting evil after learning this, and learning his sister had been tricked and seduced by these scum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid winced sympathetically. \"Yeah. I mean, it's not an <i>inherently</i> evil art, but what most everyone seems to end up using it for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Jules sighed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really am sorry,\" Sid said, and resumed eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sid,\" Jules said, his only implicit acknowledgement that his story had not really been about a leopard, at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid <i>did</i> finish pretty quickly, downing the last six, dinner plate-sized flapjacks, soaked in syrup, the eight remaining fruit strudels, each the size of the tiger's palm, and the last jug and a half of fruit juice. This, of course, was on top of the twelve other giant flapjacks he'd eaten <i>before</i> cutting himself off a slice of a certain tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was stuffed, and quite happily, at that, black belly bloated out at least an inch over his soft leather trousers. He was looking forward to having a lie-down in the carriage, and <i>hopefully</i> having the tiger give him a nice little belly rub...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great; you're done,\" Jules clapped, eyeing him happily. \"Jules will take your dishes out there and pay the tab while you grab your stuff, and then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might need some help with that,\" the wolf said sheepishly. \"It's just, er, difficult to carry it all when you're <i>not</i> wearing it, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Jules nodded, pulling his gauntlets back on before grabbing the tray. \"Jules will be right back, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out, while Sid rose. Groaning lightly, the black wolf slung his sword belt over his shoulder, and opened the armoire to get at his armour. The cuirass was the heaviest single piece, so he took this, and started towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules was off to his left, but he opened the door on his right, and walked out into the fresh air. He would miss Half Measure Hamlet a little, he decided - or at least, the food at Halfway Hostel. Seeing Arthur was sitting atop his carriage, he waved as he made his way over, and opened up the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing in, Sid stowed his cuirass and sword in the overhead compartment, then backed out. He didn't want to bend over, if he could help it, so hopefully he could just grab his boots and gauntlets from the armoire, and Jules could get his platelegs. He hurried, as best as he could, back towards the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules was still discussing something with the innkeeper, a dark-haired human woman who had been uncomfortable with their line of questioning regarding her serving sizes. The wolf reentered the room he'd rented, took his gauntlets and steel boots from the armoire, and headed back out again. He took his time storing them in the carriage, hoping Jules would come out with his leggings quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily enough, he did, waving to Arthur, as well. Sid made room for him to enter the carriage, scooting to the far end. \"Everything square?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's paid for, if that is what you mean,\" Jules said, climbing in. \"You Marshins have strange expressions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not!\" Sid stuck his tongue out at him. \"You Luxumites are the weird ones. All fancy, and eating snails, and frog legs. And always drinking <i>wine</i>, instead of beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The empty and petty criticisms of the ignorant Marshin drudges,\" Jules needled right back. \"You are jealous of our excellent, high-class food and fine drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like we're tired of your snobbery,\" the wolf retorted, lying down so his head was across from where the tiger sat. \"You've got your noses up in the air so you can't smell the tripe you spew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only around Marshins, because you all smell like manure, from rolling around with the farm animals,\" Jules sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the smell of <i>victory</i>, you cheese-eating surrender-monkeys,\" Sid harrumphed. \"Fighting all your battles for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You beer-swilling cornpones are just bloodthirsty savages,\" Jules poked him in the chest. \"Why <i>not</i> let the lesser 'men' take the front lines? Fewer of them to stink up the place afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be the legendary 'Luxumite charm' I've heard so much about,\" Sid sneered. \"It should have <i>stayed</i> in Luxumentum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Luxumite is about to throw down the gauntlet on your thick skull, boy,\" Jules warned, literally removing his gauntlets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid rolled away from him, scoffing. \"Pfft. Empty words from an empty head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules seized him, and rolled him back over. With one hand on his chest, he pinned him down, and with the other, began to softly rub his swollen stomach. Smiling, he bent down to stare the wolf in the eyes. \"Jules dares you <i>now</i> to say one more disparaging thing about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not entirely unlike a dream come true for Sid; he was having trouble <i>thinking</i>, much less saying anything, with the powerful waves of warmth and pleasure coursing through him, weakening his defenses. But he managed a smirk, and a quiet \"I hear... Luxumites didn't <i>really</i> invent the 'Luxese Kiss'... I hear they're <i>terrible</i> at it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules has obviously never done this before; he's honestly pretty lost,\" the tiger admitted quietly. \"He does not know how to deal with these new feelings. He thought had had found meaning in life again when Sol-Ra found him. Now, he wonders why he feels the same way again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sid could really take this in, he was being kissed again; he did not, <i>could</i> not, resist. With the added pleasure of the belly rub, it was, in a word, <i>bliss</i>.</span></div></div>",

Let's talk about this. <i>What</i> is it you're feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules blushed, looking away. \"When Sol-Ra arranged for Jules to see the light, as it were, he realized that he had been, up to that point, living just because it was expected. He lived, because nothing had stopped him. But when he joined the Temple of Sol-Ra, he felt purpose in learning to vanquish evil, in avenging... the innocent, and protecting them. He is happy to serve the greater good, and die doing so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, thinking. \"Now, Jules thinks he has had a moment like that again. Where the light washes over him, and everything seems so <i>clear</i>... This was when <i>you</i>- you <i>kissed</i> him. It was like the sun breaking the horizon, and this new path was revealed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid squeezed the tiger's hands, heart thumping in his chest. \"Yeah? Is it- are you <i>on</i> the path? Is there a fork in the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules squeezed back gratefully. \"<i>Oui</i>, it is a fork. Jules thinks, on one side, there looms in the distance this... Lipomancer's Lair. Light falls sparsely on this path; Sol-Ra is saying his help and influence here is... limited. That this will largely be a path Jules would walk... he does not want to say <i>alone</i>, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Sid assured him. \"Without that comforting hand on your shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, like that,\" Jules nodded, and began to blush. \"And the other path... Jules sees himself, and you, hand-in-hand. And it is clear, and it is brightly lit. This says to him that Sol-Ra would be... would still give him his blessing, if- if he chose this. That means a lot to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffled, and freed a hand to wipe at his eyes, alarming the wolf. \"Jules! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a difficult decision; Jules is sorry,\" he apologized. \"Jules thinks this first path could join up with the second, at some point past all this Lipomancer business... Jules does not want to <i>abandon</i> the life Sol-Ra has gifted him with! He is very torn up about this; very conflicted on these feelings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's- You don't <i>have</i> to stop being a paladin entirely!\" Sid said, feeling his urgency. \"Wherever we go - if we <i>did</i> go - maybe Luxumentum, if you wanted. Anyway, you wouldn't have to <i>stop</i> fighting for good there. Or even being a paladin! You could just work on a smaller scale, like you've <i>been</i> doing, right? Isn't that what Sol-Ra could have been saying, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger thought on it, and nodded slowly. \"Yes... Jules could see that. But, if <i>he</i> is working the day, and <i>you</i> are working the night, when do we have time to see one another?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid laughed a little, bowing his head. \"Well, I- Like I said, Jules, I make a lousy paladin. I don't have your dedication, or qualms. I haven't really been touched by Nocturpus' inky tentacles like you have by Sol-Ra's... <i>shining rays</i>, or whatever. I mean, we <i>have</i> spoken, but I'm sure everyone in my order can say that. I joined because it seemed like a good career choice, really. I'm not cut out for much else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing hard, and blushing, himself, he reached out, and placed his hand lightly on Jules' cheek. \"You talk like us being together forever is a given... You have no idea how that makes me <i>feel</i>, Stripy Snout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules chuckled, and raised an eyebrow. \"Stripy Snout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought I should come up with a pet name for you,\" Sid teased. \"You like that one? No? Maybe I'll keep working on it. Heh. So anyway, I can give it up. Be a- heh. Be a <i>housewife</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be <i>happy</i> with that, though?\" Jules asked, concerned. \"Would that be a life you wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid closed his eyes to picture it. An image of himself, pink bow tied around his forehead, as if keeping the hair he didn't have out of his eyes. A pink, frilly apron tied around his waist - and just his undergarments beneath. Cooking for himself, and Jules. Tidying up their nice little house. Snoring the morning away, after snuggling his tiger all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, he nodded. \"<i>Very</i> happy, mon tournesol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules nodded, satisfied by this answer, but still deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll want time to think about this, of course,\" Sid acknowledged, leaning back in his seat. \"I'll probably just doze off, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Jules sat up straight, and looked him in the eyes. \"Jules is ready to make a decision right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the black wolf's face in his hands, he said:</span></div></div>",

Holding the black wolf's hands, looking into his inky purple eyes, he said \"Let us begin our new life right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid uttered a happy sort of squeal, and threw himself at the tiger, hugging him as tightly as he could through his plate armour. \"Oh, <i>Jules</i>! You're the best! What direction are we heading? And where's Luxumentum from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Silverhorne lays south of Wellingham,\" Jules answered automatically, \"but Luxumentum is west of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing him, Sid threw open the window in the carriage door, and stuck his head out. \"Arthur! Scrub the mission! I will pay you whatever it takes to get us to Luxumentum! Go west, young man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur looked down at him, surprised. \"You- you're quite serious, Sir Coltrane? You want me to take you to Luxumentum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! And I'll pay handsomely!\" Sid said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll make the next turn west, Sir!\" Arthur agreed, deciding not to ask why. \"Hope you're prepared for a long journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Arthur!\" Sid said, and assured him \"We'll have no cause to regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his head back into the carriage, grinning at Jules. \"Think Luxumentum is far enough away from this Lipomancer business? Warmer than the Northern Territories, for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules smiled back, but it looked tight and worried. \"Yes, and Luxumentum has many beautiful areas. It will be good to see her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Tiger Lily; they'll send someone else to clean up this Lipomancer deal,\" Sid comforted him, squeezing his hands. \"Fate will, probably. It'll find some great hero whose destiny it is to stop him, and he or she will get the glory and fame, but me and you? We'll have each other. And no one else can say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules nodded, and exhaled, relaxing. \"Jules is sure you are correct. Meanwhile, he will continue to serve Sol-Ra in a smaller, but no less important, capacity. And adore and dote on his Nightingale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nightingale? Please, I'm more like a night<i>hawk</i>,\" Sid sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, <i>Sidney</i>...\" Jules shrugged, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you even <i>go</i> there, <i>Julie</i>,\" Sid challenged right back, though he was smiling. \"You know, if you take off your armour, the ride <i>could</i> be a lot more enjoyable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules caught on, and though he was worried about the possibility of the carriage being accosted by highwaymen, he had trust in his god. \"Alright. This once, Jules will. But he is going to be ready if something happens later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid reached over to expedite his removal of his armour, reassuring him \"Tournesol, we are going to be just fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[See the epilogue at: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/7702386/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/7702386/...</a>]</span></div></div>",

Feel free to put it on at your own leisure.\" said Jonah grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules then finishes the beef stew and milk and goes to sleep. However his new ally was gorging himself and talking it up with the ladies. Yet he was rumored though to always appear whenever one of the Lipomancer's henchmen were killed. Some people even thought he was the Lipomancer but there is no proof to whether or not that is the case. Some believe that the Lipomancer is a group of Lipomancers who act in each others steed. Yet the time would come when Sol-Ra would reveal whether or not Jonah was an enemy or not. The next morning Jules and Jonah set off for Tarkentin. Jules had put on the amulet and it seemed like he was fine, however Jonah convinced him to hold off on breakfast for Tarkentin was only three hours away by carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir DeNoon's stomach won't stop growling for sustenance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for not eating enough the night before. If you'd gorged like a real warrior you wouldn't feel hungry. I'm used to skipping meals if I hear that the grub in the next town is better. If you want to take down the Lipomancer I suggest you bulk up buddy. You need to build resistance to his Lipomancy and the best way to do that is by filling your stomach beyond belief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir DeNoon would not do such a thing. That might work for a glutton like you but I prefer to not give in to such a temptation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever floats your boat bud. I was only giving a mere suggestion. Yet I guess you'll find out what I mean sometime or later when you're a blob that needs to be towed everywhere. Yet I'll let you ponder about it during brunch. You should be used to carrying extra weight due to your armor. If you think about it having some more meat on your body would make you stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules and Jonah arrive in Tarkentin. Upon arriving the two order a lot of food. The two then eat beyond their fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you skipping breakfast was a good idea. Looks like whether or not you want to gain weight is almost nonegotiable. With me around you're bound to do so. But it would be nice to relax. I know let's see if they have an arena. I'm up for a good fight after a hearty meal. It's also the best way to find allies. If you best them in combat or negotiate you can make powerful allies. Since most of my magic is offensive we need a healer to be able to cure poison and etc. My amulets can offer such assistance but it won't be enough. We also need someone who can act as a spy for us. Since we're dealing with the Lipomancer a sumo wrestler would make an excellent spy. So what will Sir DeNoon do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir DeNoon believes he should...\"</span></div></div>",

During the last few days he would train like usual but, would allow the maids to pamper him to his to heart's content. Yet with all the pampering came one side effect, weight gain. In a matter of a few days Jules went from a hunk into pamered lord who is still in good physical condition. Now weighing 285lbs. Jules looked like he would fit in with the other nobles despite his still muscular physic. The reason for his rapid weight gain was that the food was enchanted with magic that would lower the consumer's metabolism while ensuring a healthy weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's the day the Sir Jules will head to the Ample Ampitheater.\", said Jules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi and Doris prepared the carriage and off they went to the Ample Ampitheater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later Jules DeNoon arrived at the Golden Chalice Inn and asked for \"Lip Service\" where the owner gave him his room key and showed him to his room.

That's quite the armor you got on.\" said the mysterious young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sir DeNoon likes the challenge to help strengthen his body and mind.\" replied Jules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see by your bulging muscles and well-fed physic. I better get going I got to prepare for the introduction.\" said the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the woman left. Yet when Jules was talking to her he felt something peculiar. Despite being unusually thin for one of the Lipomancer's nobles he also noted that the woman had a dark aura about her. He knew by the way that she dressed she was a mage. Yet he also heard tales of an omnimancer who mysteriously vanished after being rejected by the council for her failed youth spell, yet there were rumors that she was alive though and that she spent her time in an abandoned castle somewhat similar to this studying magic to be recognized as an omnimancer. Then it suddenly hit Jules. That woman was in fact the omnimancer or should he say the lipomancer for it was clear to Jules that the omnimancer's quest for knowledge corrupted her from the inside-out turning her into a vain witch. But he also saw a small spark of purity though. If he could convince the lipomancer to repent of her wicked ways then it will save him from slaying her, but if she resists he would have no choice but to kill the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules then worked out and devoured his care package seeing no harm in eating before the introductory feast which was within three hours. Jules then fell asleep on the emperor sized bed. However, little did Jules realize that the care package was spiked with a weight gain potion instantly causing the already chubby paladin to rapidly put on weight. Yet, the care package was also laced with strength enhancer thus allowing him to be able to move at a humongous size. This was planned by the lipomancer from the start for she knew that he would go incognito to try to save the nobles. She figured with his increased girth Jules would be willing to give in to his inner glutton and join her cause, but little did she know Jules doesn't give in easily. Unbeknownst to her a band of heroes had infiltrated the castle to save Jules from her hand. Having taken the guise of stewards the heroes managed to sneak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir leader was a priestess of Sol-Ra by the name of Sun Everbright who foresaw in a vision that a paladin who worships the same deity would try to infiltrate the lipomancer's lair. In her vision she forsaw Sol-Ra purposely let the paladin gain weight in order to beat the lipomancer at her own game, but she had to him from being turned into the lipomancer's puppet. Like Jules she is also a tiger who addresses herself in third person but her fur is of an inverse coloration of black with orange stripes and unlike Jules still has her lean build. Her companions are Leo the sumo wrestling lion who also happened to be an incognito lord from Brushelsire and Zargon the warrior dragon who had an appetite for anything edible. So with her odd ragtag group she snuck into Jules's room and removed the enchantment from his oversized suit of armor that would of brainwashed him into doing the lipomancer's bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jules woke up he noticed that the care package caused him to gain weight yet he felt stronger for some odd reason. There was also a note on his new armor telling him that after the introduction that he meet with the priestess of Sol-Ra in secret. </span></div></div>",

Sir DeNoon has a question for his lordship. What were you telling his loyal maids?\" said Jules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was simply asking them if they could find out more about the week's activities. I've heard rumor that the Lipomancer intends to make \"himself\" known. Yet, I fear that his talk about peace is strongly misguided. It's a shame seeing some of my fellow nobles treat the cities and towns that they reside in with contempt. Hopefully I can ask the Lipomancer to see all the harm that \"he\" has caused.\" said Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJules then realizes that Leo is actually an ally to the priestess of Sol-Ra. Throughout the night the sumo and obese paladin form a close friendship talking about their training methods that they implore to keep in good physical condition. The Lipomancer's right hand man, who was acting as the \"Lipomancer\" opened the event declaring that by the end of the week that he would bring peace  to all of the kingdoms. During the night the stewards performed for the nobles or served the greedy nobles food and drink. Apparently Mimi had a hidden talent for playing the flute. As she played her song some of the nobles couldn't help themselves but fall into a blissful sleep. Noticing this Doris and the other stewards had to drag the heavy nobles back to their bedchambers. Even the acting Lipomancer fell asleep to Mimi's song. After the song Leo, Jules, and the nobles who didn't fall asleep gave a round of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the performance the real Lipomancer had no choice but to finish the night's events, but before doing so she decided to get in one more performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I end the night on my lord's behalf I believe there's time for one more act.\" said the real Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lipomancer hoping that the dark puppetmaster's enchanted suit of armor would of already worked on the obese tiger but was stunned when he didn't \"volunteer\" like she had hoped that he would. Then to the Lipomancer's delight one of the stewards decided  to volunteer. The steward was on obese dragon warrior by the name of Zargon. She noted that he had purposely shown up late to put on a show of sword play. In actuality he spent the whole time flirting with the Lipomancer's guard, a plump dragoness who was almost as big as the warrior himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saori is a dark mage from one of the many dark guilds in this country, and is notorious for being a very diabolical criminal. She\u2019s mastered a very dangerous art of Dark Puppetry, which as the name suggests, allows the caster to control others as if they were mindless puppets. The ability itself is rather powerful, but doesn\u2019t usually last long since the user\u2019s mana gets depleted at a fast rate. However, Saori has found a way to get past that little handicap \u2013 Submission Collars, which hold the same effect as the puppetry magic she has, but filter in Mana from the one who wears it and from the mana from other living creatures (however, making these Submission Collars is quite costly and the materials are very rare, so she only has three to her name, two of which are currently in use).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaori is a young woman standing around five foot four with long silver hair that is pulled to the sides of her head into a pair of pigtails held with a pair of blue ribbons (giving her a bunny like appearance) to keep out of her cute, yet cold looking face. She has pale skin, but she\u2019s dressed in form fitting black armor that\u2019s covered with runes and a blue chest-plate, a long flowing black skirt that reached the top of her knees (which also has armor on it), and a blue cloak that usually covers her armor. Underneath her armor Saori\u2019s figure is rather average, a modest chest and a curve for her behind and hips, but nothing dynamic (she\u2019s more comfortable in her armor, and is really self-conscious about it since there are a number of scars on her skin).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned before, Saori has a few Submission Collars in use, this is because she uses them on two of her fellow teammates.  A few years back, Saori was a white mage, but because she was treated so poorly by her teammates she studied the dark arts and sought revenge against the two teammates that got on her nerves when she was a nerdy white mage. When she perfected the Submission Collars, the two were made into her mindless servants who now serve as her personal body guards and, should the need arise, her personal toys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two was a warrior wolfess \u2013 Diana \u2013 Who stands about seven feet tall and physically built to match her height. She has a dark fur coat save for a tuft of white hair just at her collar (dipping into her impressive cleavage) and usually dressed in a leather bikini with light silver armor on her shoulders, waist, and limbs. She also known to wield a powerful lance and was well-known throughout the warrior guilds. Before she was tricked to wear the Submission Collar, Diana was quite cocky and often berated Saori for studying the mystic arts instead of training her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other unfortunate soul who had a Submission Collar placed around her neck was the Elven Archer of the group \u2013 Rose (or that was the name that she gave). Like a number of her kind, Rose is a girl of natural beauty, silky blonde hair, smooth blonde skin, and a figure that would steal the gazes of everyone she passed. Considering the fact that she also wore a leaf green tunic with silver leggings and leather gloves/boots, her figure was only enhanced. Unlike Diana, Rose was actually really nice to Saori, but really cared for Diana as well and Saori knew that if Rose was left uncheck, then her submission collar would be removed from Diana and Saori would be punished by the hot-headed wolfess. So she had no choice but to put Rose under the control of one of the three Submission Collars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the reason why Saori is seeking out the Lipomancer is to find a way to improve her own magical abilities and make it so that she doesn\u2019t need the Submission Collars to control people for long-term times. It also wouldn\u2019t hurt to learn some more dark arts to add to her spell book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you wanna take this storyline so you can get three victims for the price of one? Or do you wanna have more?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whatever Little Silverhorne was, she needed to find out more. Hoping out of bed, the silk pajama'd Puppetmaster stretched her back and arms, already planning where she'd look for information on the village. Walking down the hallway towards her personal library, Saori lit torches against the cold walls, opening the heavy oaken door with her magic. Inside, she casually strode through a half dozen bookshelves, sliding out a book as she passed, bending over to stack a large tome over that, levitating another thin one from a shelf over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud thud, all of Saori's selected texts and tracks of parchment piled up on her desk. Rolling her neck, The Puppetmaster sighed, \"So much for a full night's rest...\" Swinging open the first tome marked the beginning of her lengthy cramming session, one that wouldn't keep the night young...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning slowly peeked it's head, the sun's soft glow beam in through a grand window over Saori's desk... Where her head lay sleeping in an open book. Her eyes creaked open, a hand propping up her groggy body up. \"Ughhh...\" She groaned, doing her best to remember what information she learned in the wee hours of the night. Looking down at her lazily scrawled notes, the village didn't appear to be far. It seemed fairly average until she read a few manuscripts written by some of the townsfolk. Nearly each account across the years had a tidbit about adventures being called in via some sort of dream, or so the questing folk told them, and were in search of the fabled lipomancer. Every 5 years it seems, a swell of people visit the village and go off into the forest. Adding to the suspicion, nearly no one came back; when some did, they hardly looked the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was certainly enough suspension surrounding the village, enough to warrant Saori's investigation.</span></div></div>",

After all, you don't get dozens of adventurer types hearing the same whispers in their heads and never returning unless it's something good. \"The raw power I could take,\" Saori mused to herself, \"The piles of loot!\" Her voice filled with energy, a smile appearing on her giddy face; it was settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diana, Rose!\" Saori shouted in their room's direction, \"Wake up and gather up traveling supplies, we're going on a bit of a road trip!\" She clapped her hands together, sending a small stream of magic for their collars to receive as a bit of an incentive for the two to get the job done quickly. The silver haired girl walked to the kitchen, whipping up a little traveler's breakfast. Her culinary skills still served their purpose from her days as a white priest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaori finished her hardy breakfast, putting away the dishes for her puppets to clean later. Turning round the corner as she exits, the two 'subjects' were waiting with bags packed and ready, dressed, and at attention. \"Jeez, can't a girl get some space?

Once all was said and done, Saori ribboned up her signature silver hair, giving her reflection in the vanity a smile, \"Alrighty!\" She turned to the door and pulled up her hood, clasping the front to conceal her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the Puppets, The Puppetmaster wordlessly commanded them both to follow her to the stables and grab their horses for the road ahead. Walking through the front door, she waited till her servant were through and locked it behind them with her key. Channeling dark magic she warded the entrance for good measure. Turning around, her servants were trotting upon their horses with Saori's in tow, \"Let's get this show on the road!\" Mounting on her steed, Saori set off down the path, the sound of two horses following her...</span></div></div>",

Even the horns cresting her head seemed to present no threat to him; they bent like quills beneath his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she found herself being picked up - first by her head, with the carelessness a child handles a doll, but then the barbarian's hands were wrapping around her narrow waist, and holding her above his head, as if he were a father making his little girl \"fly\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookit 'er little wings,\" he commented to the elf, indicating the membranous appendages jutting out of her shoulderblades. \"Now <i>that's</i> attention to detail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She <i>does</i> seem like some wizard's magical little toy brought to \"life\", does she not?\" the elf agreed. \"Oh, look, I think she's trying to set your helm aflame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Margret was inhaling and puffing, cheeks rounding out, going quite red in the face. She was trying with all her might to summon a gout of flame to incinerate his face, but all that was coming out was a mildly-uncomfortable hot breeze, ruffling the fur crest on the helm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think? Should we keep her? A little mascot?\" the barbarian grinned. Bringing Margret down to face-level, he offered \"We'll pay you in sweets. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down, you dung-farmer! You brute! You smelly grunt! I'll tear out your throat!\" the diminutive dragonkin swore, gnashing her sharp little teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian began looking around and, spotting a lake far below where the mountain path dropped off steeply at the sides, began to turn towards it, rearing his arm back. \"Five gold if I make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me ten if she <i>does</i> fly,\" the elf agreed, watching with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Deal!\" the barbarian leaned back, and <i>threw</i> the pink dragonkin as hard as he could, far and away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched the pink dot grow distance, the elf's sharp eyes more easily able to pick out the moment she splashed down in the middle of the lake. \"Well, I wouldn't call that <i>flying</i>. Five gold it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbarian found the sword, examined it, and carelessly chucked it after her. \"What were we fighting about, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our last bet, you dung-farmer,\" the elf reminded him, smirking just a little. They set off up the path together. \"Thusly, I'll be keeping that gold, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.. How was I s'posed to know bears have that weak spot...?\" the barbarian grumbled, sheathing his sword.</span></div></div>",

She had landed back-first on the surface of the lake, breaking it with an incredible <i>SMACK!</i> that must have resonated for a mile around. As such, her back currently felt like it was on fire; there couldn't be an inch she wouldn't soon have a bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVomiting weakly, she dragged herself away from the bilious puddle, lying face-down in the rough crabgrass. Humiliating. That whole performance, just humiliating. Why hadn't she just snuck up? Waited for one to kill the other, then stab him in the back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rogues are cowards, dishonorable, shameful cowards, that's why...</i> she reminded herself. <i>Not a scrap of honesty or honor in any of them. I'm better than that. I'm a gladiator!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gladiator, sure. But what was a gladiator without an arena? An audience? Fame? She was a nobody, a wannabe, a dreamer. All the heart, all the spunk, and none of the luck. She just needed one little break, one chance to show what she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And a new sword... Shit.</i> She sighed into the dirt. She'd trudge back up the mountain, see if it was still there. Maybe that would be her lucky break for the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace-first on the ground, she felt the footsteps instead of hearing them, light footfalls coming nearer. She looked up, squinting against the sun, and croaked \"Help... Please...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark brown cat in black leather armor approached her warily, seeming surprised she was still alive. he said nothing, only drew cautiously close, came to her side-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-and snagged the coin purse from her belt, making it jangle in his paw before he stole off, leaving her alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poooooooop...\" the pink dragonkin groaned into the dirt. Filthy, stinking rogues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun began to set shortly after, and it was full dark and growing cool before Margret found the strength to sit up. As expected, her back was a tapestry of fire and pain, muscles pulled tight, bones aching. Her wings flopped uselessly; she couldn't feel the muscles that controlled them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding took it out of her; she was gasping and wheezing as she claimed her feet. Still, she persevered, bringing every last scrap of moxie to bear as she trundled along the side of the lake. Off in the distance, on the other side, she could see the dark opening of a cave. She would take shelter for the night, and strike out in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own leather armor weighed her down as she dragged her scaly butt around the lake, the moon high and bright before she reached the opening of the cave, collapsing in the cool, dark interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gods preserve me...</i> she prayed, and closed her eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pink dragonkin opened her eyes slowly, muddled memories of yesterday running through her mind - or maybe half-forgotten dreams. Flying? Swimming? A castle, shrouded in darkness, standing out as a black spot against the face of the full moon...? Where <i>was</i> she...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft candlelight; silken sheets; a fluffy pillow; a plush bed. <i>When</i> was she...? These were the accoutrements of home... Where once she had called home... How long had she been asleep? How much had she <i>dreamed</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, she winced, as if expecting pain... but none came. Reaching around to rub her back, confused thoughts floating back to her, she felt mud caked there, but no soreness. Hadn't she... been in a fight? Reaching to her belt, she found her purse was still gone. She had been robbed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing away the depressing memories as they sharpened and became crystal-clear, margret swung her legs out over the side of the bed (they dangled over the floor; they always did), and took stock of her new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a... quite nicely-furnished room, actually. A wardrobe next to the nightstand next to the bed, a bookshelf opposite her, a wooden door to her right, a table for one pushed into the corner of the wall she was facing. Craning her neck, she saw a full-length mirror behind her, where the wardrobe stood on the other side of the bed, a chest next to it, a wash basin along the wall behind her, a rack made for weapons next to it, and an armoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she was, she couldn't begin to guess. Rubbing her face in her hands, she murmured \"I need a good scrub before anything. I'm filthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air tingled, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SPLOOSH</i> The wash basin behind her was suddenly filled with water. The tendrils of steam rising from it spoke to its apparent warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the heck? What <i>is</i> this place...?\" Margret gasped, wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoundlessly, yet somehow drawing her attention right to it, a rolled-up scroll appeared upon the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising to her feet, approaching warily, the dragonkin reached out a hand, and took it. The parchment was very real. She unrolled it, and it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Welcome, weary warrior, to the Wishing House! This magical place is a temporary respite from the cruel world outside; a safe haven into which the Gods see fit to invite the ailing, such as yourself, to stay a while, and get back on their feet. Some small services will be available to you if you only ask, such as a warm bath, a hot meal, and even some basic equipment to protect you from the barbs of the cruel world to which you must return. Sorry, but unlimited wealth and power are off the table! Please, take your time, mend your spiritual and physical wounds, and avail yourself of our comforts. When you are ready to proudly face the mortal world again, simply open the door, and walk out. You will find very little time has passed outside, and that you exit into a safe position. Even if you don't believe in us, we believe in you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Margret breathed, more deeply touched than she could say. What a stroke of luck, indeed! The Divines had blessed her this day! She could get her sword back, get her money back, and get ready to fight again! She was feeling better already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping down out of her worn leather armor, she hopped into the wash basin, finding it just the perfect temperature - naturally. With the provided cloth, she scrubbed her scales clean of mud and grime, bringing them back to their natural luster. Sky-blue scales embraced her lower jaw, flowed down the front of her neck, over her flat chest (being non-mammalian, her species had no use for milk-producing glands), and between her legs to the underside of her tail, nearly to the tip. The rest of her scales were the pink not of healthy roses, but of some artificial dye; a garish color. It had been said (to her face, nonetheless) that the only threat she posed upon sight was to fashion. Several small, white horns crowned her head, angled backwards, though they were more like porcupine quills in shape and number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water never seemed to get dirty nor cold, no matter how much mud she scrubbed off of her, and the cloth remained pristine, too. A slight fragrance rose on the steam. It was the most relaxing bath she'd ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially reaching for her outfit when she stepped out, dried off in a fluffy towel, Margret instead hesitated, and spoke carefully aloud \"I wish I had some new leather armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air tingled as if a storm was coming, and her attention was drawn to the armoire next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding over, and throwing it open, she found awaiting her a brand-new set of brown leather armor, in her size, freshly oiled and looking ready for battle. She couldn't help but smile, pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess new clothes to wear under that won't hurt...\" the dragonkin tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just a moment later, she knew she'd find what she needed in the wardrobe beside the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying over, Margret dressed herself, then armored up, finding the clothes comfortable and attractive, and the armor tough, but easy to move in. Already, she felt like a brand-new woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's possible, Gods,\" she said after she had finished looking in the mirror, clasping her hands in prayer, \"I would like my sword back; my Barb. Please and thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed her eyes shut, hoping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and <i>vorp!</i> There was suddenly a familiar weight on her hip. Her grin widened as she saw Barb was back, scabbard and all. Whipping it out, she gave it a few experimental swings, then sheathed it again, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling it right to linger too long in this house of wonder, Margret moved for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Gods...\" Yet, she paused with her hand upon the knob, her thoughts growing muddled again with a dozen unspoken desires. The one that fell from her lips, though, was \"...I just wish I was bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, she stepped out with her eyes closed, fighting back the tears - of joy, of gratitude, of wonder, of pain - and swung it shut behind her with a <i>click</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes, Margret immediately looked around, startled. Grey stone walls, a torch above an archway, a wrought-iron portcullis before her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not at all where she'd thought she'd be. This looked like... a <i>dungeon</i>. Where <i>was</i> she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portcullis opened, drawing up into the stonework above with a shriek, opening the way before her. Stepping forward, now her ears caught the distant sounds of... a crowd? Chanting and cheering? Applause? what was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargret walked forward, drawn on, through a smooth, stone tunnel, then into an area that curved around to her left and right, more iron portcullises separating her from the center. From the arena!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on the outskirts of an arena, beneath the seats above, lying in wait! Through the portcullis before her, she could see an anthropomorphic lion warrior and a fiery elf girl duking it out, blades clashing, before a table laid with a grand feast. Gladiatorial combat! Where <i>was</i> this magical place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand fell on her shoulder, and a voice said from behind her \"Welcome to the Ample Amphitheatre, meat...\"</span></div></div>",

Also, in case there's any confusion about Margaret's \"Gladiator\" class, I mainly based it off of the Gladiator class from the <i>Dragon Quest</i> series, specifically <i>Dragon Quest IX</i>, so look that up if you want the full details. So, without further ado, let's get this show on the road.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Anna, Lilly, Margaret and Travis split into groups of two to try and find the mysterious \"Lipomancer,\" whatever that was. Its lair was easy to find; it was a giant castle perched atop a tall, wide plateau. Getting inside, however, was another matter; the cliffs were too steep to climb, and the only way in was through a cave at the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once they entered the cave, they noticed something that struck them as rather odd: the walls appeared to have been carved by hand rather than any natural phenomenon, and it was fairly well-lit to boot. Our heroes believed it was the work of the Lipomancer, but before they could ponder that, they came across a fork in the tunnel and decided to split up. Anna and Lilly took the left tunnel, while Margaret and Travis took the right tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This is a very strange place,\" Travis said. \"It feels like there could be traps or monsters waiting for us.\" Margaret rolled her eyes. \"Calm down, Travis; as long as we stay on our guard, we'll be fine.\" \"I'm not scared,\" Travis interjected, \"I'm just saying that we don't know anything about this Lipomancer. For starters, we don't if it's a guy, a girl, or if it's even a person at all; it could be a monster for all we know. Second, we don't know what it can do. I mean, given the name, I guess its powers have something to do with BMI, but, until we see what it's capable of, we won't know for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margaret sighed. \"Those are some good points, but just remember everything we've taught you about combat and you'll be fine. You were a pacifist when we all met, and now, not only are you a capable fighter, but you also get really sadistic in battle, so I know we've trained you well. Quit being so paranoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Travis took a deep breath and calmed himself down. \"Ok. I'm calmer now, I'd feel a lot LESS paranoid if you'd just use a shield.\" Margaret turned and looked at him. \"How many times to I need to remind you; Gladiators don't use shields because they're for cowards who don't trust their armor.\" Travis replied, \"I know that, but between you wearing light armor and not carrying a shield, I worry about you. I get that heavy armor is kinda redundant for reptiles when you guys have tough scales, but still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margaret stopped walking, which prompted Travis to stop. \"Then why did you decide to come with me this time? You and Anna are the only two members of our team with healing spells, so I know why you never go with her whenever we split up like this.\" \"Yes,\" Travis said, \"because if me and Anna are together, you and Lilly are left without any healers, and you'll eventually run out potions.\" Margaret nodded. \"Yeah, so if you're so concerned about my choice in armor, why didn't you just go with Lilly like you normally do? I'd say it's because you want to have sex with me, but as you're currently demonstrating,\" she gestures to his shield and heavy armor, \"you don't have any balls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Travis indignantly retorted, \"Oh I have balls. I have two of them, and they're the only two I'll ever have, so I ain't too keen on losing them. Mammals don't have internal testicles like reptiles do, so we need to protect them, and I do that by wearing heavy armor and carrying a shield. And, to answer your question, I felt like mixing it up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margaret sighed and said, \"Well, quit complaining about my armor and get a move on.\" Travis nodded and they started walking again. \"Speaking of your armor,\" Travis started, \"it really accentuates your curves.\" Margaret blushed (at least as much a cold-blooded creature like a dragoness could) and said, \"Thanks, that's part of why I wear it.\" \"Although,\" Travis continued, \"it also accentuates your slender arms, which reminds of something I've been meaning to ask; how are you able to use that giant axe so easily? I mean, the blades are as big as you are tall and the handle's as tall as you are,\" he then gave Margaret's upper arm a light squeeze, \"and with these slender arms of yours, it's a wonder you're able to even lift it, let alone use it in battle efficiently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's a secret,\" Margaret giggles. \"Besides, Anna uses a giant hammer, and I've never seen you question how she's able to use IT efficiently, with one hand, no less.\" \"Her hammer's half the size of your axe, and her arms aren't as slender as yours,\" Travis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could discuss this any further...</span></div></div>",

It was her annual day of spring cleaning; a day she always pursued with a very chipper attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dusted off a small pile of dust off of the top of a bookshelf, she wiped a bead of sweat from her brow and scanned her eyes across the room, reveling in how clean and new everything looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*...another day of spring cleaning, come and conquered!\" She said with a hint of pride. \"Now all I have to do is check inventory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bustled about her kitchen, checking to see if any products had been depleted recently. Thankfully, there were only three items that were in need of replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oranges...soap...and Redweed!\" She narrated as she wrote them down on a small parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then trudged up the steps, exiting through a door to the left that led to the balcony. Rather than go to the nearby shop first, she decided to get the more challenging Redweed first, which could be found in the woods at the foot of the eastern mountains. Thankfully, she knew of a small clearing in the woods where Redweed was quite common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crack of her knuckles, she stretched her arms to their greatest length, letting all of her large feathers show. She crouched down, then shot herself in the air, flapping her wings to remain airborne. After a few desperate flaps, she'd managed to maneuver herself horizontal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind increased in her face as she flew onward. There weren't many others outside as she flew off, as the overcast sky seemed to foresee some incoming rain. The plain she lived in receded from the horizon as she neared the stripe of trees ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe circled above the forest a few minutes as she tried to zone out the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...It's got to be somewhere...but where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>BLAM!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear-shattering blast of thunder roared above, causing her to let out a shocked yelp and frantically try to re-achieve equilibrium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her flight was reestablished, she looked to the sky with unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better get home soon...There's no telling wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trailed off as she looked ahead at the tree she was barreling towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now dazed hawk began to plummet towards the ground.

Her sight was temporarily lost as she gasped for air, forcing some of the ooze into her mouth. She cringed as she swallowed the viscous fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes burned as she opened them, letting her see the translucent green she was immersed in. She swam upwards towards the light, and let out a loud gasp when her head broke the surface. She hoisted herself back onto the ground, laying on her ground and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she finally sat upward and looked to the green slime nearby. She stood up and walked towards it to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe substance left her baffled. She'd been in these woods before, but she'd never come across anything like this! To top it all off, it was traveling in a stream that journeyed somewhere deeper into the forest. What part of the forest could it have been coming from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached a hand out and touched the surface, claiming a small bit of the fluid on the tip of a feather. She brought it up to her beak and got a small whiff of the substance, which smelled rather sweet. The sweetness of the smell brought her back to when she swallowed a mouthful while underwater. Despite the shock and urgency of the landing, she could recall a vaguely sweet taste to the amount she had consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat memory of its taste, for whatever reason, seemed to fascinate her. She brough the sample she retrieved up to her beak, just touching it with her toungue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in amazement. It tasted <i>amazing!</i> She scooted closer to the slime in order to observe it with a more generous handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked with interest at the handful of the stuff she held. Despite the chilled moistness of it, it seemed to emanate some sort of comforting, almost warm sensation in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...did she dare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a larger quantity consumed, the delicious taste was overwhelming. She immediately reached for a larger handful, happily downing it as she had the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral handfuls had gone before she resorted to bending down near the stream to get to the slime faster. She continued to shovel out large amounts of the slime and devour it with glee, oblivious to the world around her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and what a world it was. Her stomach naturally began to bulge out further and further in an attempt to contain her spontaneous gluttony. However, there was no pain...the slime seemed to alter her stomach in a way that would allow her to stuff herself with no hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate more and more, Breeze became more detached from the environment, her mind gradually becoming more and more focused on eating the river. It went on for several minutes, culminating to the point where she was pretty much eating unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the slime's second effect took place. It digested immediately within her stomach, it's unfathomable calorie content piling onto her body. Slowly, but noticeably, Breeze began to broaden. At a gain of a few pounds with every second, her stretched stomach became more soft and pliable with fat. Her legs expanded, rendering her pants more cramped. Thankfully, her clothes (which were soaked from the landing) stretched with her body as she fattened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill it went on, with Breeze devouring the river's stream like a pig eating slop and inflating like a blimp. Her stomach grew larger and larger, starting to claim a lot of the area beneath her, her breasts starting to inch closer and closer towards her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then her body started to stretch in height, as well...Her arms, legs, and shoulders lengthened along with her gain as if trying to match her expansion. When she had gained almost a foot in height, she had resorted to diving her head underwater to eat as much as possible. Her body had pretty much become a fleshy mattress that she laid upon, her enormous legs forced a few inches above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gained altitude, she slowly tilted towards the river...</span></div></div>",

She hesitated (albeit slightly) as she felt herself in motion, but it was too late, as she rolled into the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised to find herself underwater, but was happy to realize she could eat as much as she desired. So she gulped as much as possible, forcing as much of it into her expanding belly as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Some time later...</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's how she felt, sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach. Oh, man, her stomach. She felt that she's explode if she ate another bite, her stomach was so tight.  A massive headache stabbed at her brain, rendering it hard to see anything or remember the past few whatevers. She could feel her body trapped beneath some sort of soft, unfathomably heavy mass up to her cheeks. As her vision cleeared, she could make out a blurry, light-tan mass that apparently pinned her to the ground. It pressed against her chin, blocking part of her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...my head...\" She moved her arms to massage her temples, but she grew surprised when the mass binding her seemed to shift as well. When she looked to her arms, she'd noticed that the mass had swallowed them, her dainty hands peeking out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only they weren't some random constriction. Her eyes widened in shock when she recognized her feathers on their surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she noticed the feathers on the now familiar-colored prison atop her, reality struck her, prompting her to scream in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?\" The mass atop her was <i>her stomach</i>; she was pinned under her own weight. She desperately tried to roll over and orient herself upright, which was thankfully easy despite her massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of struggling to become upright, she finally managed to roll over in a way that she could get back onto her legs. Now able to stand at full height, she gaped in pure horror at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once petite hawk now stood at over ten feet tall, near double her height. Any semblance of a once slim, lean bird was now hopelessly lost in the monstrosity she had become. Her globular, tight belly stuck out over eight feet from her back, her gigantic breasts resting atop. Her legs had fattened to over four feet in width at their widest point, her ass nine feet wide and sticking out three feet from behind when standing. Each of her arms had fattened to over golf-bag widths at the biceps, the shirt she was wearing stretched to almost a latex-like surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeze could only stand there, whimpering and mumbling in shock as she took in how big she now was. Her sight of anything directly in front of or beneath her was obstructed by her enormous breasts, also preventing her from getting her hands to meet. As she turned to look at her own butt, she was met with yet another surprising sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stream she stood in was coming from a nearby passageway in the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how could I have floated upstream?...and how could I have traveled into such a shallow part of the river?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to think about the situation more and more, pondering every possible solon to her dilemma. As she did, she started to feel relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...This is a dream.\" She chuckled. \"Yeah, a dream! All I have to do is close my eyes, and it'll all be over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to clench her eyes shut, envisioning herself in bed about to wake up. She opened them again, only to be met with the same landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her stomach let out a monstrous rumble as the remainder of the slime within her was digested. The surprised Hawk began to grow again, giving herself almost a few inches in height. The fat she accumulated forced her belly out further by a foot, her breasts growing so they'd obscure her view slightly more. As her arms, legs, and ass grew wider and softer, her clothes met their peak elasticity and started to enter tearing territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAghast that her nightmare was a reality, her shock worsened when the grumbling persisted. Despite her gargantuan size, she was painfully hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to clutch her stomach, she glanced fearfully at the environment around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good...\"</span></div></div>",

Then there's Aaron Hawke the feared master assassin. Even though he is usually silent, deadly, and calculating he's a pretty nice guy if you're not his enemy or have a bounty on your head that is, but he also has a dark hidden past that involves the Lipomancer. At night he is usually tormented by nightmares from four years ago when only a teenager of how the Lipomancer used his magic to stop the famine in his home town, however he was out of town for training during that time. He regrets not being there to stop the Lipomancer from casting his mind control on the town. And finally we have Kyle Monroe the destruction-restoration mage. Being skilled in both white and black magic he knows many spells. He even managed to learn the featherweight spell, a spell from one of the Lipomancer's spell books when he saw one of his apprentices. After defeating the apprentice he tried to learn whatever spells he could but the featherweight spell was the only page out of the whole spell book to be in good condition with the rest being splattered in blood or faded. He is the youngest member of the group who is just merely a teenager but a year away from being 20. Ergo he tends to act like a child often getting into trouble. He doesn't trust Aaron though often commenting on how too quiet he is and fears that Aaron will kill him in his sleep, run off with Katherine or both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur adventurers were travelling in the kingdom of Delusia, a kingdom said to be under the Lipomancer's control. This was due to the people stuffing themselves or stuffing any of their guests and were often disillusioned by the wonderful works of the Lipomancer claiming him to be the bringer of peace to all the realms. All was going well until Katherine activated a booby-trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! by Sol-Ra what was that!\" yelled Katherine as she was hit by a poisonous dart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads up! There's more of those darts.!\" yelled Aaron who is normally quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron quickly dodges the darts and deflects them with ease. Kyle manages to obliterate them with fire magic, while Katherine feeling lethargic from the dart's poison is hit by more darts and who's body was beginning to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katherine!\" cried Kyle as he saw his leader/crush swell before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like the darts had stopped raining down on the heroes but Katherine was swelling like a water balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just terrible. If I detected that trap sooner our leader wouldn't be under...\" Aaron is cut off by his own sobbing feeling guilty that one of his new friends fell victim to one of the taps from the Lipomancer's henchmen and that he couldn't warn Katherine in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle however believing Aaron's crying to be a ruse casts a detox spell and his Featherweight spell. With that the poison Katherine was cured of the poisoning and she returned to somewhat normal condition with the exception of the 15 to 25 extra lbs. of fat on her body. Aaron then stops his crying and goes into a rage cursing the Lipomancer's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get my hands on that Lipomancer I'll skin him alive to make him pay for the suffering that he's caused!\" Aaron shouts raising his fists in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron then calms down and decides to take the lead to make sure that none of his new found friends get harmed by the Lipomancer's traps. Kyle and Katherine then blush not noticing that their attracted to each other sigh and catch up with their silent comrade. The rest of the day goes well without another trap being activated. Our heroes then make camp for the night. Kyle who made sure to cast a protection spell over himself and Katherine for fear of being killed by their comrade. Katherine thought it was cute and a good idea not because of Kyle's fears but just in case something tried to attack her group but thought it strange Kyle wouldn't cast the same spell for Aaron, but dismissed it due to his reputation as an assassin and was confident . Meanwhile Aaron tried falling asleep but had a strange feeling that he and his friends were being watched. Later that night.</span></div></div>",

One could say that she was a nymph due to her chubby frame which is typical of the subspecies. Her wings were blue with purple tips while her clothing resembled a witch's gown and her skin was a light purple coloration. Aaron had heard about fairies during his travels when executing many of the Lipomancer's followers. Fairies could either be good or they can be completely evil often using sick and twisted means of killing their victims. Aaron had also seen or heard many people of the draconian race cower in fear at the slightest thing that resembles a fairy for fear of being brutally slaughtered by the devious tricksters. He also heard tales that nymphs can be a threat to anyone of the male persuasion often causing fellow comrades to kill each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman then let out a blood curdling scream almost causing Aaron to temporarily lose his hearing.

I remember as a child I was told of such a story where two children reverse the witch's scheme against her in order to avoid being eaten themselves.\" commented Katherine who was now suspicious of the fairy ready to give Aaron the ok to rid of the fairy if she tries anything funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have doubts why don't you taste my house.\" replied Candessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine rejects the offer feeling too bloated from today's mishap leaving Aaron and Kyle to decide. Aaron fearing that it might be a trap hesitated while Kyle thinking that such a moment would be perfect for his comrade to strike him down while he tastes the house. Aaron sensing Kyle's distrust of him is saddened by the fact that Kyle would hold onto the childish fear that he would do anything thing to hurt him or Katherine. Aaron then reluctantly agrees to taste the house for the greater good and also he got his friends into this situation in the first place even though he meant well. Aaron then takes a chunk of the house noticing how the exterior magically restored itself and took a bite. Aaron was then filled with a blissful sensation and was starting to want more but was prevented by Candessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there big guy. Too many sweets at this hour are bad for you. If you would like you can spend the night here until you're ready to leave. I'll even prepare you all a magical breakfast tomorrow.\" said Candessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine then agrees to the offer and thanks Candessa for the generousity. Katherine and her friends are then shown to their rooms.</span></div></div>",

Her plan was to fatten Katherine and co. until they're big enough to become the witch's meal. At this the mischievous fairy rejoiced over the thought of turning Katherine and her friends into one of her tasty dishes. With that the heroes spend the night in the gingerbread house. Unfortunately for the witch Aaron becomes suspicious after having a nightmare where he and his friends are slowly cooking to death in an enormous cooking pot. The next morning while the heroes were asleep Candessa prepares a magical meal that would not only cause the consumer to gain weight but to also have delusions of still being their trim selves while in actuality they would turn into ravenous gluttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: This is the only time that Aaron and Kyle fall for a trap since Candessa acts on her own accord for she is not affiliated with the Lipomancer. This might also be the case for anyone who doesn't serve the Lipomancer in future chapters as long as it is subtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok friends breakfast is ready!\" cheers Candessa giving off a false glimmer of goodwill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Katherine and Kyle, I don't think it's a good idea to trust her.\" said Aaron worried about his nightmare coming true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Aaron, is this one of your tricks so you can kill us all and take whatever bounty your client is paying you?\" remarked Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm serious though. Something doesn't feel right.\" said Aaron in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't be that bad. Didn't you jump for joy after tasting her house?\" said Katherine eating next to Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please my friends listen to me. Whether or not she's affiliated with the Lipomancer beats me, but I think I was temporarily enchanted by her magic.\" said Aaron emphasizing his mysterious 5 lb. weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly my friend. You were carrying a little extra weight since you got here.\" said Candessa staring Aaron directly into the eyes hypnotizing him in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron who is now fully hypnotized nods his head in agreement eating his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was a close one. I can't let that meddling assassin blow my cover. Yet I might have no choice but to resort to the classic power of hypnosis to keep this guy under my spell. The other two are not much of a threat since they're too preoccupied with wondering whether they like each other or not. BY the time this is over I'll be even more powerful especially after consuming the boy for I sense great magic within him. Nothing is tastier than eating magic. </i> thought the gourmet witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gourmet witch then gives off an innocent laugh to conceal her true intentions. Over the next few days Katherine and friends start putting on a ton of weight. Katherine who gained 400 lbs. was surprising the smallest of the three with a an extra plush body exaggerating her feminine features. Kyle was probably the next fattest being only 50 lbs. heavier than Katherine. This was due to Candessa's cook book on how to cook adventurers that recommended that the magic user be 400 lbs. or more. However Aaron really let himself go. No longer the trim master assassin he once was but a 600 lb. plush of an assassin who is still somehow able to retain his cat-like reflexes. This was due to the hypnosis wearing off every time he had a nightmare causing the tubby assassin to go into a panic attack and ergo try to work off the weight to no avail only for the fairy witch to stare him in the eyes and hypnotize him again as soon as he tried to warn Katherine or Kyle. However the illusion finally wears off when one of them realizes the truth but who figures it out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Aaron then notices that the thing watching him was only a wild forest creature running along and enjoying itself. Aaron then falls asleep. As soon as Aaron falls asleep he has a nightmare of events from four years ago when he was about nineteen. A teen-aged Aaron was walking home after a day of training at the military training academy. He was an aspiring young assassin hoping to be a hero and dispose of those who sought to do evil. Aaron didn't have many friends due to his tendency to keep quiet but he had one friend though. She was a lynx and a soon to be cat burglar. She saw how the corrupt nobles were stuffing themselves silly why the poor were forced to do manual labor. She was also abhorred by the thought that a man who calls himself the Lipomancer would act like a hero and then force the innocent people into glutting themselves all in the name of peace. Aaron remembered making a promise to her to someday meet again for they had recently graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron knew that things were tough back home. His father was a respected blacksmith while his mother would plant crops in order to put food on the table. His family wasn't overly rich but they had enough to get by and fared slightly better then their unfortunate neighbors. His father taught him always to do the right thing no matter what and often told him tales of how the hero is always willing to serve for the just cause. Thanks to his father he actually learned how to make his own weapons which were of high quality. However when he got home he noticed something was off. He noticed that the residents were a lot larger then normal and that there was no sign of famine. When he arrived home he saw two blobs of fur that used to be his parents. The sight scared the young lad seeing the two mounds of fur waddle towards the door with open arms ready to embrace him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home son ... burp... glad to see you're ... burp... back.\" said the mountain that was his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad you're alive! Please have soon dinner you look hungry.\" said his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron remembering that he ate dinner with his friend Robin earlier declined and asked what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you noticed our weight gain. A few days ago a young woman proclaiming the peace of the Lipomancer cast a spell that caused our crops to grow abundantly with new ones everyday. We thought that she could be trusted so the town bought into her words. She called herself a master sorceress despite being so young. Once we tried the food we couldn't help ourselves. As we ate we seemed to rapidly gain weight. It even got to the point where everybody had to eat on the job to calm the hunger pains. What's worse is that we can't even do physical exercise without gorging ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father's right dear and some people who want to lose weight can't because they might get shunned or arrested for saying terrible things about the Lipomancer. Please my son run. Escape while you can and don't look back for if you stay here you'll be cursed as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron then nods his head and runs with tears running down his eyes. He was going to make the Lipomancer pay for destroying the lives of  these innocent people. For the Lipomancer crossed the line by sending his right hand woman to cast such a terrible curse. He could even hearing the woman laughing evilly mocking him saying that true peace could only be come from the Lipomancer. With that Aaron made a vow to help all of those oppressed by the Lipomancer swearing to not stop until his reign of evil ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron then wakes up from his nightmare. It's early in the morning and his friends aren't awake yet. Aaron then begins to burst into tears about what happened to his home town. Yet being in Delusia wasn't easy for the young cheetah because he knew he would eventually have to return to the scene of the nightmare where it all began. Yet his home was another kingdom that bordered Delusia and was said to be ruled by the witch who destroyed the lives of all those people. Aaron tries to calm himself by saying that he'll save everyone but winds up crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. Dad. I'm sorry that I couldn't save you. I promise I'll do what I can to help those in need and hopefully I can find a way to restore things to the way that they were.\" says Aaron crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile his comrades are awoken from his sleep for they thought they heard someone crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's child did that nutcase kill?\" said Kyle who was in a terrible mood for waking up early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle! Have you no compassion! Yet I find your cockiness adorable now's not the time to be making judgments about our friend.\" said Katherine concerned .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle apologies to Katherine only because she called him adorable not realizing that she had a crush on him. Katherine glares at Kyle insisting that she is not the one that he needs to apologize to. She then sighs at Kyle concerned that he jealous of Aaron. When they arrive they see their friend crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok big guy. We're here. What happened? Are you hurt?\" asked Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy is supposed to be a master assassin. So far he's been more of a master crybaby if you ask me.\" said Kyle in an arrogant way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle! That's enough! Is that all that you are going to do is shun your comrade! That is truly barbaric and mean. I can't stand it. If you can't be nice then don't say anything at all. In fact I won't speak to you until you apologize to Aaron this instant!\" said Katherine annoyed by her secret crush's immaturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron then explains his past to his friends stating that it has been haunting him for four years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. We're here to help. We'll help you you the Lipomancer to justice. Won't we Kyle.\" said Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever.\" responded Kyle jealous that Katherine might have a crush on Aaron which is surely not the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine then storms off seeing that Kyle still doesn't see that he could be hurting his friend's feelings. Later that day.</span></div></div>",

However, many people surprisingly liked the assassin but always felt sorrow because he would keep to himself. Many people even offered the assassin gifts for killing the tyrants that had enslaved them.

There has been talk about an evil sorcerer who has dabbled into a forbidden dark art. It is also rumored that nobody knows this sorcerer's identity but they say he's a perverted guy who sees the world full of wickedness and has thus took it upon himself to torture people through unorthodox means, such as feeding his victims until they can't move. This person is known as the Lipomancer and he's a guy that everyone wants a piece of. Our story begins in this very guild where a group of adventurers decided to form a party to take down this dastardly menace to society as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it looks like the king has offered a reward to anyone who slays this Lipomancer. This Lipomancer must be some crazed pervert to call himself by such a stupid name. I Maximus Burnslow will slay this fool and claim my prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to burst your bubble Max, but how will this restore my memories? The only thing that I remember after you freed me from my lamp that my name is Zodak Mist and that I know how to cast magic and make things appear out of thin air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not my companion. For the Sovereign on High will help you break free of this amnesia. Sometimes it takes a journey to remember what has been lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you priestess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Anya Caletta, the divine priestess who serves the one who shines for all eternity. My quest is to kill all of Gluttoneous's minions. They are a group of priests who call themselves Lipomancers, yet only the high Lipomancer can unleash that demonic god of destruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But according to this bulletin there's only one Lipomancer, Anya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Ms. Anna Redsack, but the high Lipomancer often uses the other Lipomancers to pose as him. That's why we must destroy them all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're forming a party. This Lipomancer sounds like a delusional nut who just does this for his on self-interest. I'll lead our group while Anya will be the team's navigator. Let's go guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the group of adventurers leave Starkheart and travel to defeat the Lipomancer. Their first destination was a place called Calaria. It has been rumored that a witch who calls herself the Deranged Queen has ties to the Lipomancer.

It became louder and more venomous until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRAAH! DAMNIT! HOW could she escape?!\" he roared in fury. Earlier that day, a young, Anthropomorphic Fox, Serena, had escaped from the Lipomancer's Keep and made her way to the cave system underneath everything. It was an understatement to say he was livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her seat, Sarah Hayes listened fearfully to her master's ranting. \"You, you had *one* job, Miss Hayes!\" The Lipomancer shouted, \"You <i>saw</i> Serena escape... you could have done SOMETHING, in fact you SHOULD have done something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped nervously and began to stutter. \"M-M-Master, I,\" she tried to say as a hand came flying her way, slapping her hard on the muzzle. She whimpered in pain as he spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" he warned, \"You will have a lot of work to do to make up for this, my student. There's been a disturbance down at the Temple. I want you to head there immediately and take care of the threat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded slowly and replied affirmatively. \"Yes, Master...\" she whispered pitifully, slowly standing up and walking away, facing the Lipomancer with terror in her eyes. As soon as she left the room, she closed the door behind her and walked down the spiral staircase. She was halfway there when she looked back up, and seeing nothing/nobody, she sat down on the steps and began to cry. How did she let herself get mixed up in all of this insanity? A year ago she was nothing more than an aspiring mage seeking to learn about the world around her. She had an absolutely adorable sense of curiosity and loved to read and write poetry, even if she wasn't the best poet in the world. She was thin, and beautiful. She even had a few of the men in her village begging her father for her hand in marriage, but thankfully he turned them all down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah buried her head in her arms as she sobbed. Her relatively thick arms. Now as she looks at herself, she believed herself to be merely a husk of what she once was. Now? She was an obese, subordinate plaything for the Lipomancer to manipulate. She spent her time not studying the magic of restoration she so wanted to know more about, but learning how to make innocent people's lives a living Hell as they struggled for freedom or the riches said to be held somewhere in the territory, and then crush their hopes in one fell swoop, enslaving them for eternity. She had already captured 4 hapless adventurers, and every time she did so, a small part of her died inside. She had already mastered a great amount of Lipomancy spells, and could revert herself to normal size, if the Lipomancer weren't watching her like a bloody HAWK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and sobbed once more before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b><i><u>One Year Earlier...</u></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Hayes stumbled around as she tried to find shelter from the ferocious wind and heavy rain that struck one's skin like a hammer strikes a nail. She had been out exploring the forests around her village when she became lost. In a panic she searched about, wincing as the rain, which frankly felt like hail, beat her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she discovered a large cottage centered in a clearing. It seemed suspicious somehow, but, because of her desperation to get out of this weather, Sarah took what she could get. She burst into a run, stopping at the door and twisting the knob, expecting resistance. To her surprise, it flew open with ease! Deciding not to question how easy this seemed to be, Sarah ran straight inside and shut the door. \"I'm SO sorry for the intrusion!\" she cried out. No response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah finally calmed down and looked about. No signs of life besides a few candles to light the room... A light grumbling could be heard from the far corner of the cottage, which Sarah investigated. Upon discovering what it was that made that noise, she stumbled back and fell on her rear in shock. This... *thing*. It looked like a sack of something... a leash... no, a tube connected it with a hole in the floor which obviously went down to something in the basement. Sarah narrowed her eyes and crept forwards, staring at the creature. \"What... are y-\" she attempted to say. She had opened her mouth at just the right moment. The sack-like creature hissed and flew forwards, hugging her face and inserting a tube into her mouth. It's legs tied her muzzle shut and stuck to it. Sarah screamed (although it was muffled) and tried to pry this thing off of her to no avail as a bulge in the base of the tube to their left formed, moving through and to the creature, which sent a sweet liquid cascading into Sarah's mouth. She refused to swallow, but found that was a bad idea as her cheeks bulged painfully. At last, after struggling as much as she could with the device/creature/monster/thing, she finally swallowed the viscous fluid to alleviate her immediate pain. Also a bad idea for her. Still she continued to pry at the beast until she could pull no more. It was stuck, and it was never coming off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt something heavy on her midsection and moved her hands to try to find whatever it was. Something warm, soft, and scaly... she moved her hands back until she felt her own chest. She realized what this meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began screaming at the top of her lungs, only a muffled howl thanks to the creature. She felt her belly, legs, and arms begin to rapidly put on weight as she stepped back and thrashed her head wildly. It did nothing but quicken the flow of liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo.... heavy...\" she thought to herself. She yanked one last time with her head, but only lost her balance, landing on her hindquarters. She attempted to stand back up only to find that she was too heavy! With a final whimper, she resigned to her fate, shaking her head gently in disbelief, and placing her hands on the shelf of her belly. She would black out soon after, and only after her body filled almost the entire cottage save for the entryway did the creature relent, detaching and sliding to the ground, limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b><i>Next Morning...</i></b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound of a creaking door and footsteps fill the air. Sarah's eyes gently slide open. All she can see is a sea of blue scales... her own scales... Once this information processed, she panicked and began thrashing about once more, sending her belly into waves. \"Please! Somebody help me!\" she cried, tears flowing down her cheeks. This was no dream. This was a strange, screwed up reality. She felt a hand press against the front of her stomach. \"Who's there?\" she inquired, trying to see over herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your new master,\" a raspy voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Sarah asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice replied again. \"I am the Lipomancer... you are the stupid girl who fell into a trap of mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not stupid!\" Sarah shouted, throwing a little firebolt at the doorway, unsure of what she'd hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was silenced for a moment, and Sarah smirked in victory, before her face fell in irritation when the voice started up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magical ability... interesting... well, I must take back my previous comment about you being stupid. Genuinely stupid people could never understand the Arcane like you and I... let's go with careless instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes. \"What do you want from me!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me make this simple: You either pledge your allegiance to me. I can grant you eternal life in exchange for eternal servitude. The riches of my territory will be yours. I treat my slaves rather fairly,\" the Lipomancer announced, leaning on Sarah's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I say no?\" Sarah replied indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say no... I could reintroduce you to our little friend,\" the Lipomancer sighed, gesturing to the limp creature from earlier. \"I'll tell him to fill you up some more... so much, you could...\" he added, growling slightly with these words, imagining the scenario in his head. A sadistic smile spread across his face as his eyes brightened and grew wide. \"Pop!\" he said in a eerily playful tone, making an explosion gesture with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped nervously. Her options were die horribly or be a slave to some creep for ETERNITY. She valued her life, and the man mentioned something about the arcane. Her greatest desire was to learn magic and become a Master Mage, and... trapped here? Beggars can't be picky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine... I'll go.\"</span></div></div>",

She'd made up her mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long walk to her dorm, she began packing her things. A copy of the Lipomancer's spellbook, mainly issued to his students, some spare changes of robes, a little food and some canteens of water, and a dagger were among the things she owned currently. With a final sigh she slung her pack onto her shoulder and turned to see another of the Lipomancer's students. His name was Erik. He had come here on his own accord and asked for the Lipomancer, so, he never experienced the traps. Needless to say, he was a Loyalist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" he asked, crossing his arms and leaning on the wall. Sarah gulped as her eyes darted back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just heading out. Some more travelers got caught in here. Master chose me to go after them!\" she explained. A slight lie. She *was* supposed to go after the adventurers, but there was a change of plans when she finally decided she was going to leave this hellish nightmare behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik stared her down for a full minute before stepping aside. Sarah squeezed by and made haste for the door. Avoiding the suspicious glances and the security prefects on the way out of the Keep, she smiled wide when the sunlight kissed her face. She now had a choice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah thought for a moment. She couldn't just leave. Not without helping as many of the Lipomancer's other slaves as she could. Even if it meant death, she knew that the freedom of others was worth it. Considering there were no escapees to date, nobody knew about the Lipomancer except him and his \"kingdom\". No doubt Serena would escape and bring an army back. Taking the Lipomancer down the hard way wasn't Sarah's calling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to turn left at the fork in the road, heading down to the Temple below the mountain. Last she checked, there were some adventurers who were en route to that very location. She had to warn them before they reached the Locks. The Lipomancer had tanks of special liquid attached to the locks to gates on the Temple interior. They had already claimed a Feline rogue. Her druid friend was taken down later by another trap. His stubbornness cost him his life. Sarah was there to see him burst. The Rogue was captured and forced into the labor camp outside the Caves. Never did Sarah want to see another suffer either of their fates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final look back, Sarah took off into a run, using her magic to increase her endurance once she began panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>At the Temple...</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Human Paladin stood at the main entrance of the Temple. \"This is their place-of-worship? Heathens...\" he muttered as he turned and asked his squad for explosives. \"It's locked down from the inside. Any of you got TNT?\" he inquired. An anthropomorphic lion hunter pulled out a single stick of TNT. \"This might make a small hole. Good enough to crawl through...\" he said as he passed his bomb to the Paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. We'll go in through the front. We're here to take what information we can on the recent disappearances and clear the Hell out of here,\" another Anthropomorphic creature, this time a Bull (Think Tauren). He was a warrior by vocation. This was evident by his giant sword, which rested on his plated shoulder casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's going in to take the barricades down?\" the Hunter asked. The Paladin shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it... you got a light?\" said Paladin inquired. The Bull simply stabbed the ground with his sword and snatched the TNT. He struck his hoof across the blade and cast sparks, which he quickly used to light the fuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRE IN THE HOLE!\" he roared as he flung the explosive. The fuse was short enough so that it exploded just as it landed, creating a hole in the side of the door. It was big enough for the Human and the Lion, but the Bull would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the Paladin began to crouch into the hole, a voice cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT! STOP!\" Sarah shouted, waving her free arm erratically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Paladin bumped his head into the top of the hole and hissed. \"Agh! Who's there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lion readied his rifle to fire when the Bull pulled his arm down. \"Let her speak.\" he warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stopped in front of the group and bent over, breathing heavily. \"Please... give me a... second. Whew!\" she said, holding her chest where her heart was and panting. The Paladin approached and patted her thick shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive. Quite fast for a woman of your...\" he said, before biting his tongue and looking away, not wanting to be rude. Sarah blushed in reply and blew her brown hair out of her eyes. Her hair was unusual for a reptilian species. Her entire family had hair on their heads, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I know,\" she replied, smiling as she regained her strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you need us for?\" the Lion asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do *not* go in the front. There is a golem just WAITING for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bull narrowed his eyes. \"How would you know this...\" he asked, tightening his grip on his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Paladin raised a brow. \"I concur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped nervously and looked at the trio. \"M-My name's Sarah H-Hayes. I am a Student of the master of this territory,\" she introduced herself, IMMEDIATELY crouching and holding her hands over her head, \"Pleasedon'tkillmeorcapturemeordounspeakablethingstomeplease!\" she panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Paladin blinked, looking down at the cowering dragoness. \"Why would you think I'd want to kill you? If you were to go against your master's wishes and tell us about a potential threat, you must have repented for your previous sins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shut up instantly, looking upwards into the human's eyes. \"Y-you're right, I guess...\" she replied shyly. She stood back up and dusted off her robe. \"I want to help you get out of here. We should turn back, right now, and go get help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lion sighed and slapped his face with the palm of his hand. \"We tried that. The King won't listen to *us*. He knows about disappearances but refuses to engage in combat until we have an idea of what we're facing. Some of the courtmembers though Dragons or demonic entities. We're trying to confirm their fears or deny them the excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah frowned. \"So let me guess: You're going in no matter what to retrieve data, and I'm unable to sway you in any way shape or form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bull chuckled. \"Yep. Although I myself have second thoughts about this. If teams of five end up missing, then a team of three is royally #%$!ed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-scaled dragoness thought on that. \"Let me help you. I know my way around the Temple!\" she suggested.</span></div></div>",

Come to think of it I remembered visiting a Dragonkin village on a diplomatic mission at some point... this was a year ago, yes. Saw a young woman, taken by her intellect... thought about dropping by and meeting her father to talk about the possibility of courting her, but I saw that he was rather defensive when it came to his daughter... Some time after I left, heard she had disappeared in a horrid storm... pretty much broke my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes widened. This was becoming less and less comfortable... \"Wh-what did she... look like?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn reminisced further before snapping his fingers in remembrance. \"Beautiful lass. Brown Hair, blue scales, green eyes, this cute little mark... on... her cheek...\" he said, voice lowering as he observed Sarah's features,  including her brown hair,  blue scales, green eyes,  and scar-like blemish on her right cheek. He was silenced as he recognized the dragoness before him. \"God... what did they do to you?!\" he asked, placing a hand on Sarah's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaa'shad stood scratching his neck. \"Awwwkwwwaaaaaard...\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to marry me?!\" Sarah asked, blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to come HERE to study magic?!\" came John's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to storm this temple for the King?\" Odin interjected, gesturing to the dynamite-created hole in the wall of the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to stop the growing confusion.

Out of nowhere, it started rambling about how \"2+2=4 is a 'crock of shit'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn lifted an eyebrow as he drew his sword, <i>Shadowbreaker</i>. \"I'm pretty sure that's what it equals,\" he commented as the weapon began glowing with a holy energy. The Golem charged forwards, switching topics to his favorite romance novel as John's party rolled out of the way, weapons at the ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Thanks to Sarah, we anticipated this,\" Odin murmured, moving into a defensive stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Sarah.

Dead silence filled the room. The Golem stopped moving, and all eyes were on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not anticipate that, however,\" Odin added under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eye twitched and she awkwardly cleared her throat. \"It's composed entirely of assorted meats and organic tissues, all edible, all cooked. That said, it is highly unstable. Aim for the legs!\" she shouted, throwing a bolt of frost magic at the Golem's ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, silence. \"I'm sorry, what?\" Odin replied, barreling over the Golem's foot as it attempted a sweep-kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her! Question it later!\" John shouted, charging towards the Golem and swinging his sword, firing off a ray of holy light that seared through the Golem's sausagey legs, cutting the behemoth down and onto its torso. Still it flailed, looking for targets. It then began computing Pi, only making it about 15 digits before looping an obnoxious error message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking note of its pattern, Raa'shad took the brief window of opportunity he had and fired and explosive round into the Golem's head, effectively destroying it. It went completely limp, to the relief of the entire party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was first to speak, \"That's over.

Odin smacked him in the back of the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbass. Ask about it before putting it In your MOUTH.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled at this. \"He is right. Rule #1 is don't eat anything, including possibly your own rations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn scratched his head before slipping his helmet on over it. \"The reason being...?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the Master's MO. Instead of killing you or ransoming you, he inflates your body or fattens you up. Swings by, threatens you with servitude or death. Takes any race and any gender as long as the sick bastard gets his harem. It's how he got me. Some organic-mechanism filled me to the brim with some sweet liquid and left me a blob for a good 24 hours before my enslavement as a student of his,\" Sarah explained, nervously shuffling her foot on the tile floor beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on her for a full minute before Raa'shad and Odin walked off in disbelief, leaving only John to stare at her, baffled. \"So that would explain the disappearances of you and so many others. This man's soul is already damned. Death hasn't come to collect yet. Let's keep moving.\" He said, with understanding as he put his hand on Sarah's pudgy shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin was busy observing an ornate door decoration in the shape of a human face, made from Iron. All of a sudden, a voice was heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, fools, to my lair! The Lair of the Lipomancer! You have come here seeking material gain... And so I shall give it to you! Perhaps you noticed the number on the door, and chose it due to being the smallest one out of the three. Fools that you are, you never realized that the number could stand for a single unit of great quantity! The only way to escape this room is to suck on the lips of the beautiful iron face before you. Doing so shall activate a mechanism that will drain a solution of my own devising from a hidden container in the walls and into your mouth. This container holds enough of my solution to induce a weight gain of one TON! How fortunate for you that there are four of you... Perhaps you can split it! Not that it will make any difference in the long run! And if you choose NOT to drink... Hohohoho... Well. Let's just say that you'll wish you had. If you make it past here, seek me at the highest point of my fortress, that I might give you your 'reward'! Until then! Ahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes at the recording. She had a feeling that LM had made more of that damnable solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin's face was contorted into one of shock. \"I am so sorry, but what the FUCK.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked down at her belly, which was sizeable enough to block her view of her feet. \"He isn't kidding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn blinked, clapped his hands together, and turned on his heels. \"Who is going to take one for the team?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaa'shad coughed and took out his engineering satchel. \"Won't be necessary milord.\" He took out a dime bag of a squishy material and smeared it on his fingers, spreading it over John's lips. He was too confused to protest. \"Give this a minute, and slowly peel it off. Stick it to the iron face and I'll bring out the pipe. One of us can suck the solution out in smaller quantities and not get stuck to the face, then spit the fluid out... or swallow it if you are looking to fill out the armor...\" he explained for the human paladin, who nodded in understanding. John followed the directions exactly and Raa'shad brought out a small metal pipe, spare scrap from an earlier project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it from here,\" Sarah announced.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah stepped up to the lock and slipped the pipe into the iron face's mouth. Receiving a thumbs up from her allies she placed her own mouth on the other end of the pipe and gently inhaled through her mouth, bringing the liquid out of the lock, through the pipe, and almost to her mouth before she withdrew to see if she could've simply bugged the lock into pouring the contents out. A little dropped out of the pipe, but hardly enough to warrant that course of action efficient. With a distressed whimper, she realized she was going to have to suck, spit, rinse, repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did so. She felt the cool fluid wash over her tongue. It had a unique taste to it. Had the LM added a flavoring? Whatever it was, it tasted of cherries... which were Sarah's favorite fruit. She smiled upon recognizing the taste, and begrudgingly spat the liquid out on the floor. She went back to continue draining the lock, taking more of the cherry flavored formula into her maw. The desire to drink it was... intensifying, to say the least. Was it becoming fizzy? She didn't really care anymore. She kept up the routine, slowly draining the contents of the lock's tank of potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just a little bit more to go...\" Odin said, tapping the glass on a meter measuring the quantity of fluid left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged to herself and giggled as she swallowed a sip of the liquid, putting her hand to her pudgy belly as she felt it surge forwards a little bit. Odin and Raa'shad jumped back in shock, and John's eyes widened in dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't kidding...\" Raa'shad muttered under his breath. He added a curse and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only had just a <i>small</i> bit to go, so she decided to drink the half-cup that was remaining. She purred as she felt a warmth wash over her; arms, legs, belly, and breasts expanding slowly, making her robes tighter but not uncomfortable. When she ran out of potion she sighed contentedly and stood back up, before remembering she was being watched. A fierce blush painted her cheek's blue scales purple as she giggle nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord John blinked before chuckling and shaking his head. \"I take it you're not particularly vengeful regarding what the Lipomancer did to your body hm? You seem to enjoy this sort of thing, unlike some of us here. I'm glad you're with us right now,\" he remarked, patting Sarah on the back. The door swung open slowly and Raa'shad stepped through, weapon at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, milord?\" he asked as Odin walked in behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled warmly at Sarah and nodded in Raa'shad's direction. The lion marched on. \"Will you be okay?\" he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and thought, \"I <i>should</i> be able to reverse the effects once everything's digested. It'll take some mana but I can reset my weight in a pinch, in theory. Until then I say we keep moving as I am now,\" she replied with a cheerful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way?\" asked Odin, looking up the flight of stairs. Raa'shad peered down a hole behind the staircase and lit a flare, dropping it down to reveal a soft landing not too far down. It was dark, sure, but a completely survivable drop and probably would serve to avoid whatever traps await at the TOP of the temple. He could see the light pouring out to the left, meaning there was a tunnel system. This could lead to wherever Sarah arrived from, where the Lipomancer is NOW, but it means delving into the heart of his territory and the center of his student training program... all of whom knew how to inflate any living being simply by physical contact and willpower, or enchantment of the mundane object.<br>\r\nHowever, going up the temple proved equally costly; countless traps and mechanisms designed to, embarrassingly, immobilize our heroes with nonsentient machines. It actually sounded worse to be caught by witless automatons and booby traps than to be bested in a duel by an opponent with great wit, and a pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso John wasn't too keen on dying in a religious building for a heathen sorceror, especially one of the LM's nature.<br>\r\nBut there was a chance that there were slaves to be rescued in the temple somewhere... potential allies to bolster the ranks of the mission at hand...</span></div></div>",

Besides I have torches, so that isn't an issue,\" Raa'shad said, preparing to climb down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you an idiot? Who knows what's down there!?\" Odin boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn intervened, stepping between the two. \"Raa'shad, where did you see the flare light go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, to the left, sir!\" the hunter-engineer shouted, saluting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Castle Mount is to the left. We can take the tunnel and move up through the mesa to the Lipomancer's castle and fight our way to the inner sanctum. He can't teleport, so he'll be trapped. The only way in is the front door and he's not unstable enough to toss himself out a window should things get tough!\" Sarah explained, voting for the tunnel path. John immediately agreed and Odin rolled his eyes indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you two first,\" the bull said, lightly shoving the two forwards. They yelped briefly, grabbing onto each other as they hit the ground and rolling into the tunnel. John could feel a heavy, soft, warm weight on his chest, likely Sarah. He cleared his throat of any dust he may have taken in and laughed to himself. He couldn't hear a response from Sarah except for her breathing and became worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" he whispered, before feeling something make contact with his lips. A hand moved to cradle his cheek briefly before the kiss was broken. John knew <i>exactly</i> who it was, too. He was silenced by the shock, but smiled awkwardly as light filled the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaa'shad and Odin had hopped down into the hole and lit torches, holding them up to illuminate the tunnel. Sarah scrambled to get off of John and lift him off his back before the two had any ideas or asked any questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion and the bull merely shuffled past the two and continued cautiously down the tunnel. Sarah blushed again and rubbed her arm, looking away and shuffling her right foot in a small circle. John grinned and took her hand, leading her down the tunnel after Raa'shad and Odin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long does this damn tunnel go on for?\" Raa'shad spat. As time went on, their torches began to dim ever so threateningly slowly. As the torches' lives waned, the pace quickened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there. There are no traps in the tunnels, but... I think there MIGHT be one at the exit, I'm not so sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of what sort? Spikes? Poison? Pitfall?\" asked John, gripping his sword with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inflating poison darts,\" Sarah replied, and both Odin and Raa'shad froze in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\" they said in unison, processing that before turning to face each other, and step back, backs to the walls, and they bowed and let Sarah pass through with John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes, \"such gentlemen...\" she sarcastically stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey neared the end of the tunnel when they came across a tiled floor, each tile raised up, like pressure panels. \"A certain sequence of tiles don't activate any dart launchers... I... damn it I can't remember which!\" she panicked, putting a foot forwards to test the first tile before her. As expected, it triggered four dart launchers, two on each side of the tunnel, which shot their payload into the walls across from each other's launcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily she had pulled her leg away before she could be hit by any darts, but it didn't comfort her any<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you step on it again?\" John asked, drawing his sword in an act of defensive reflex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The launchers are <b>LOADED.</b> Their ammo supply is overstock ahead of time because refilling them every day is tedious. Trust me, I once had to fill the launcher's magazines,\" Sarah replied, whimpering. She took a seat in front of the tiled floor and huffed, trying viciously to remember the right pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sat next to her, \"We can afford to wait, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdin shook his head, \"I don't like the look of this, and I feel like I am being watched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, we'll keep moving. I just have to remember the damn pattern...\" the dragoness sighed, rubbing her forehead, stressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How potent is one dart?\" asked the Paladin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were skinny, and hit with one... probably enough to look nine months pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then scratch the 'fuck it and run like a maniac' plan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have some recollection of the right path...\" Sarah murmured, standing and walking onto the tiles. One... two... three... she was on a roll! Fourth tile... just eleven to go for a total of 15 pressure plates in the sequence on a 15x7 grid. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes widened in horror as she felt a sharp, stabbing pain in her sides as four darts entered her. She was quick to pluck them out, but whimpered as her belly began to swell with air. She was now forced into a waddle as her robes grew tighter. She was having trouble seeing the floor under her at this point, and her torso was growing on all sides. If she failed, she'd become a sphere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray you have a spare set of clothing, milady,\" Odin snickered, only to be punched in the arm by a pissed off John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she can reverse this and be careful next time around, I have a robe I can spare in my bag...\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was feeling... lighter. She managed to make it across two more tiles, at 13 tiles before tripping the 14th and 15th ones, stumbling. She was struck with just about every one of them. She yelped as she made it through the open door into a wide open, circular chamber. The team ran across the tiles, careful to memorize and repeat the proper pattern so they wouldn't be victimized by this trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the chamber to see Sarah's torso pushing against her robes, small tears forming on her equator. Her hands frantically glided around her belly and breasts as she tried to clear her mind and focus on her magic, but she couldn't keep her mind from racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>John's watching me, what is he thinking? Damn it, this is humilating!</i> she thought. She sighed and submit to her fate, arms resting at her sides and gently being pushed up by her torso. Her limbs were being engulfed by her own belly. She failed to stifle a moan as her body broke out of her robes, leaving her nude before her party. She blushed, giggled in sheer nervousness, and patted her belly as the growth slowed to a halt. The inflation, in its final hurrah, dragged her arms and legs back as they were engulfed; she groped her gut one last time as her hands were stuck out to the sides.<br>\r\nHell even her <b>tail</b> was swallowed up. She still had her footing, thankfully, but she dared not move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of her new friends stared, two of them in a mixture of disgust, pity, and confusion, and John himself had a different expression about his face. Confused? Yes. Disturbed and/or bothered? Not at all, actually. In fact, looking at her there, smiling so adorably, even though she was likely hiding her embarrassment, actually appealed to John in a way. Oh he was definitely still questioning the LM's M.O. and mental state, but he was hardly put off by Sarah's appearance as of now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...dare he say she was actually kind of cute this way, moreso than she was already, and he wanted to <i>marry</i> her last time they met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry...\" Sarah said, trying to hide her eyes with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odin, Raa'shad, have a look around, check the shelves and adjacent rooms. I need a moment with Sarah,\" John ordered, approaching Sarah and placing his hands on her, slowly rolling her into a smaller room; a bedroom with two beds and a small cooking fire, likely for students posted to guard this chamber. Nobody was here though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally alone, John took a seat on a bed and looked Sarah in the eyes, \"There is no need to apologize. You've been taking more for the team than any of us could ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah whimpered again, \"I meant, I am sorry that you guys even have to be involved in all of this shit, that you have to witness THIS happen to me, that you're even challenging this bastard at all...\" she rambled, and John stood and wrapped his arms around Sarah's neck, leaning in to close the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, there is no need to apologize. You, are the bravest, smartest, most gorgeous lass I have had the honor of meeting and I love you for these traits and more,\" John replied, sternly. \"Seeing you like this? Doesn't bother me at all, if you mean that I am bothered by you. What bothers me is your ex-Master doing any of this to not only you, but a vast group of people! Sarah, we've known each other a short time and already I feel things around you that I've never felt. You know that after I left your town, I'd been saving myself for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blinked, blushing heavily, \"You... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potential spouses left and right, thrown at me and glorified by my serfs and knights. <i>Sarah, I turned down the King's daughter at one point,</i> because I didn't want anyone else but YOU.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Princess?! You turned down the throne!\" Sarah cried, shocked and awed to no end by this decision that would be viewed as horrendously foolish or insane by anybody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. You're my one and only, Sarah. My one, and only. Now that I know you are alive, that you are here with me, we're going to get through this together, we're going to dismantle this demon's kingdom, and we're going to have our happily ever after,\" John said, tears beginning to stream from his eyes. \"I don't care, that these strange events have happened. I don't care, that you picked up some unorthodox magic. I don't care, that you look like this right now if anything I actually like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head, moving her brown hair out of her face, and she smiled wide at John. \"You are the sweetest, most faithful man I've ever met,\" she sighed, giggling as John planted a deep kiss on her lips, cupping her cheeks in his hands. The two of them moaned softly as they shared this long-lasting moment together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Cracking it open and discarding the remains, he found three satchels. In each bag, there was a neatly folded Plus Sized robe, containers of food, and flasks of liquid. Signalling for Raa'shad, they eagerly looted the satchels and returned to John and Sarah, who were locked into a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Awkward enough for ya?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn broke the kiss finally when Odin cleared his throat, blushing fiercely and stepping away from Sarah to speak with the muscular bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully that which we have interrupted may resume shortly, though we found some supplies. Potions, food, and robes,\" Raa'shad whispered, handing John a robe to give to Sarah. He also put a flask in his hand for Sarah to identify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Paladin walked to Sarah and held up the flask, and her eyes lit up. \"Whoever worked here packed a countermeasure for the dart's venom!\" she cheered, and John popped the cork, and brought the flask to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of deflating, Odin and Raa'shad had left John alone with Sarah, who deflated down to a size reminiscent of her shape before the Lipomancer ever got involved in her life. She threw on a robe and cheered, throwing her arms around John and pinning him to the bed. \"Oh I feel so light!\" she cried as John returned the hug. \"It... it felt so normal, being that fat. I can't really remember my life before being the LM's slave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll all be over soon enough. You can control your weight, yes?\" John asked, wary of the traps that may lie ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course. It doesn't cost a lot of mana to lose or gain weight, probably one unit for every minute I spend growing or shrinking... why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn blinked. \"Well... there *are* traps ahead which may prove a pain to handle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gave him a smug glance. \"Oh? Or do you just prefer me all big and soft?\" she crooned, nuzzling his cheek. \"Because I can waste some mana for you, darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was giving him a choice? Well... this required some thought... after all, he fell in love with the thin Sarah, but... then he fell for her again when he remembered who she was outside the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-should we keep moving?\" John asked, and Sarah looked up at a clock set on the wall above the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5:45 PM... normally somebody starts patrolling the dungeons just outside of these chambers. They never come in here, though, so we should be safe if we stay here,\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's said, if you fall in love with two people, choose the second; if you loved the first, you wouldn't have fallen for the second, so John had once heard.<br>\r\nBut still, she seemed so happy right now... on the other hand she said she'd be perfectly fine if she were to waste a little mana for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked over to see that the door was closed. He smiled... \"You sure you'd be happy to gain again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you...\" Sarah said, slipping her robe off, glowing very faintly as her belly began to bulge against John's silvery armor, which Sara helped to remove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sat up and leaned against the back wall, with Sarah sitting in his lap as she grew. She wrapped her arms around him as her belly squished against his, her bosom expanding as well. He rubbed her back, kissing her neck as her legs and arms began to grow. Eventually, he was sliding back down onto his back, with Sarah pinning him to the bed, her warmth radiating off of her weighty body and onto John's skin. He wanted her. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were not married. To take her as his now would shatter his vows as a Paladin of the human One-God. He would likely lose his power and be defenseless outside of his sword and shield.</span></div></div>",

So enjoy the following.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalta-Nosteronk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat makes this place special? Well, it's special because of one reason: It is the City of Everything! It's even in the name; Calta means City, with Nosteronk means Everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is not the city itself that is special, no, it is the people within the city that make it special. Here, everyone of every race, every creed, every occupation, may have resided here, or visited here, or continues to live here. This city has a very interesting history and way of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalta-Nosteronk is not divided into districts, like many other city-states, but since the size of the city is so massive, it is split into 2 cities: the Upper City, where the most prestigious of the prestige resides, and the Lower City, where most of everyday life takes place. The Upper and Lower Cities are then divided into City Districts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Upper City, the city districts are as follow: <br>\r\nThe Holy District, where the highly respected religions are worshiped with giant Churches, cathedrals, and temples<br>\r\nThe Luxury District, where the wealth resides in mansion sized houses<br>\r\nThe Representative District, where the members of the city's government conducts its business<br>\r\nAnd the Academic District, where the schools for education in both the Intellectual and Arcane Studies are housed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Lower City, the civilians live and shop in it's many markets and stores. The Lower City makes up a majority of Calta-Nosteronk, and has more city districts than the Upper City. Out of the many city districts that make up the Lower City, these are the major districts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bazaar, one of the most largest market in Calta-Nosteronk, many work in this open area flea market, selling exotic merchandise.<br>\r\nThe Gates, one of the residential areas of Calta-Nosteronk that houses the large main-gate that leads into the wild wilderness of the mainland.<br>\r\nThe Docks, another residential/business district where ships dock to unload their cargo for the city.<br>\r\nThe Quarters District, the most largest district within Calta-Nosteronk, where neighborhoods of different races live.<br>\r\nThe Guild District, where many guilds and organizations conduct their businesses.<br>\r\nAnd the most infamous of all, The Lawless District, a city all it own. This is where the most vile creatures of society resides and works. Here, one can escape from law and find members of the lowest of the low, featuring: cutthroats, scoundrels, pirates, gangs, thugs, mercenaries, brothels, etc. The Lawless District borders the Docks and takes up 1/4 of the piers on the waterfront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that is the basic rundown of this massive city-state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd everyone here has a story that either starts or end here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does your story start?</span></div></div>",

It is a bustling commune, with noon and early afternoon being busy to the point of nearly packing the main streets full of marketgoers trying to be thrifty and haggling endlessly for their vaunted goods. It is often a place to see beggars and grifters as well, so one must be careful of the smaller stands the not-so-visible stalls that might be hidden in the corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guild District is home for all those who want work and to find an apprenticeship. It has inns, offices, and even stores fit with goods that are paid for by the guilds, and only members or those with large amounts of coin can actually pay for the cost of equipment and goods associated with the organizations. On the surface, there seems to be a hierarchy of which guilds have the biggest influence on what goes on in the city, as well as the largest section of the guild district with the best facilities. However, there are always shadowy goings-on happening behind closed doors, and sometimes the most influential force may not necessarily be what is the biggest and best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Docks is, of course, the port for all goods that come into Calta-Nosteronk from the sea. A great deal of trade is connected from over  the grand blue to the massive megacity, with much of its cargo distributed across all city fronts. It's a bit damp, but most of the time it is a very well-kept area, save for the docks and warehouses close to the Lawless district. Those are oftentimes full of the seedy folk that dominate the lowest and darkest of all the district, and as such most of the area is unkempt, rife with corners where ne'er-do-wells can easily stalk their victims from permanent shadows. This is not to mention some of the thievery that goes on with the porting ships themselves, with cargo occasionally going missing depending on the hit.</span></div></div>",

These wares often go for excessive amounts, but for the price of finding them, it's usually worth it. One other interesting attraction is the number of gypsies and minor carnival members often patrolling parts of the district, trying to hawk fortunes or scryings, or performing great illusions for the common masses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guild district is often treated as a home of prestige, worth, and the working individual who dedicates his life to a craft, but some portions of the guilds are often very cutthroat, especially when it comes to brand new contracts and requests tacked up on the board. The place is overflowing with full organizations, conglomerates, small factioned guilds, and even a monopoly or two despite the city council's best efforts to curb it. The competition, despite the outward appearance, is nearly as bad as the lawless back alleys and lowest sections of the entirety of the city, and duels are not uncommon for perceived sleights.

This crowd, however, was gathered as a result of a flyer that had been distributed by a local newsboy and placed on the ad board for all to see. It was an advertisement for a new act in town which had just arrived on the last caravan from the next city over, a traveling jester so to speak who was looking to make more of a name for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, she wasn't quite any normal jester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids, moved to the front by the performer in question so they could see without the interference of adults crowding the little space she had prepared for herself, oohed and aahed with fits of applause in between as she currently twirled about on a single large rubber ball, her dexterity on display with every pirouette and sweep of her lithe body. Rolling it underneath her with nary a missed step, her balance was yet to be interrupted as she leaned down while on top of the ball, pulling a tulip seemingly from nowhere before presenting it to a child at the front of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding straight up before rolling the ball back to the center of the stage, she hopped off of it before picking it up, balancing it on top of another ball of similar size with not much more than a nudge, accompanied by a deep bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all, and I sincerely hope you enjoyed the performance! I'll be here all day, so please, if you were tickled by my act, don't be shy and stop on by once more~!\" She cheered before placing a small top hat on the ground in front of her, looking mostly for donations for a room at the nearest inn rather than grubbing for money. With her sincerity and genuine tricks rather than sleight of hand to steal the hard-earned and treasured belongings of the parents and other marketgoers that had decided to stop by her little performance space, much of the crowd was happy enough to give her a few pieces of gold, some even giving their kids a small handful to dump with glee into the hat. Clapping her gloved hands happily and thanking each one who donated, she watched as the crowd dispersed for the time being, her next showing not for another thirty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, a clown, jester, or harlequin would take this time to adjust her makeup or costume, but she needed no such thing. Her skin was alabaster, and not a speck of it were paint or powder. Rosy cheeks and her reddened nose were probably the only thing truly painted, but unlike temporary paint, the coats were made to last and shone with a lacquered charm as if they had been applied and sealed with the utmost care. Her auburn hair was perfect, almost too perfect, and kept into two large pigtails with black ribbons which were tied neatly into little bows. One of the things she had the hardest time dealing with was the fear over her eyes, which were a brilliant, deep and penetrating emerald, and to others shone with an intelligence that belied her young appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened up the ruffled white dress shirt and her yellow bowtie, smoothing out the fabric of her blouse and making sure she was dressed proper. Adjusting the cream-colored stockings she wore, as well as the frilled cuffs, the clown girl flinched as she heard a soft ticking coming from her left elbow, the joint sticking firmly for a second and causing her to huff just a little. \"Aw, why now? I think I needed to take that mage up on his offer to scrub my insides with a good cleaning spell. That port act toasted me with the salt water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over with her good hand, she picked up a small vessel which was filled with oil, putting the long, thin spout over a visible gap in her arm right where the elbow connected her upper and lower arms before pressing the lever and letting the paddle open, a small dribble of oil dripping into the socket area and causing her to sigh in relief. Placing the vessel down, she grabbed her stiff arm with her right hand before pulling it to the extended position ever so gently, the joint and socket returning to normal function with a soft series of clicks. \"Much better...the oil quality is great here! At least no one asks what I use it for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis jester's name was Bebe, and she was a true rarity among artifacts: she was a living automaton doll, given the breath of life by arcane magic powerful enough to last several lifetimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far as she could remember, she was the lifework of a dollmaker who spent his entire existence crafting dolls and mechanical automatons of wondrous quality, and was famed in his age for the intricacy and life he seemed to give his creations. But at one point, with no children and no family left, he grew lonely, and so tried to construct his final work which was a life-sized doll in the shape of a young woman, someone to at least remember his time on the mortal plane. The final piece of this, however, was to try and give life to the doll, and as such required spells that were far out of his reach. Nonetheless, he managed to pay for a great archmage to bless his doll, and so for weeks he waited to see the signs of life he so desperately wanted. Due to his advanced age, however, and the length of time the spell actually required to integrate life force and animate such an object, he passed away in his sleep with his head on her lap, mere hours before she finally awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loss of who she considered her father saddened her greatly, and so she collected as much information as she could to remember him by. Deciding to try and do something with her newly minted existence to bring joy, just as he had wanted out of simply having contact with someone who loved him unconditionally, she became a student of illusionists, acrobats and thespians, submitting herself to a roaming troupe and being taught all of the basics before being allowed to perform with the rest of the acts. Within a few years, she had felt she had outgrown the troupe, and wanted instead to travel the world and spread her new ability to give smiles to people's faces without the connotation of being a 'lying charlatan' as they were sometimes called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the top hat full of gold coins, she smiled widely before dumping her funds into a small chest she had recently acquired, slipping a peculiar round lock over the front and twisting the different segments of its face several times to seal it shut. \"I'm glad it went well today, though-this is enough to buy me a decent room and a ride to the next town!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe packed and prepped her stage area for another show, hoping that the sinking sun would provide people with better incentive to check out the bazaar and its many sights.</span></div></div>",

The crowd gasped as she juggled four torches at once with one hand while lighting more of the rag-topped sticks with her right, tossing them into her juggling routine before returning with a full seven flaming torches to woo the audience with. Their trails burned brightly, the ash fluttering around her in a whirlwind of her art, kicked up by the speed of her hands and the enthusiasm which beheld her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe didn't pack up her performance space disappointed that night. The last show she pulled before the bazaar closed in its entirety had netted her enough money to get a few things from the marketplace, as well as a room at the inn and enough fee for two or three more trips! Rubbing her hands in delight, she rolled the trunk on its wheels behind her, moving to a well-to-do inn in the Gates district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the influx of travelers that day looking to see the city in its fullest capacity, the inn she had chosen called the Rosewick had plenty of rooms to offer for her, and especially with the gold she had, was more than eager to offer her the room. Taking the price as she could get it, she stored all of her luggage before heading down for a bit of light reading and exploring before turning in the for the night. She didn't need to sleep, but closing one's eyes and letting the mind wander felt like a relief from the hustle and busybody of the world. On occasion, she wondered if people felt the same way, or if sleep would be an annoyance or a hindrance to someone with enough drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Bebe pondered the question in her head as she laid out a map of the region she had purchased a week or so ago when she first arrived. The city took up a good portion of the center, but that was to be expected; it was a colossal monstrosity after all. She was moving north now, having come all this way from the east coast where her last act had taken place. There were a couple choices of where to go now, but she knew very little of the area around the giant city. Her curious expression must've caught one of the innkeepers, a heavyset but kind mountain lion, who thudded his way over to her. Hearing his footsteps, she perked up, looking into the smiling face of an old and grizzled cougar. \"Oh! Sorry, should I not be down here now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed deeply, scratching his rounder middle gently before moving up to his thick neck, looking at her with amber eyes, \"No no no, you are perfectly entitled to read as late into the night as you want. I was just about to turn in m'self. You seem a bit lost, though; need a little help choosing your next stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes! You can tell I'm a traveling performer, so I thought it was time I moved on from here and to different places. I don't know the area so well here...\" She petered off, furrowing her brow and tapping her fingers against the wooden table. In the meantime, he drew out a pair of large spectacles, popping them on the bridge of his nose and coughing a little before examining the map and inspecting it with a large paw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let me help you! North a ways is a placed called Orrenshire, a very lovely town that's known for its mead as well as its summer festivals. Lots of great folk out that way come through here every now and again, and it's always a pleasure. A little ways westerly is Bilford, a bit of a dank place as it sits near a swamp if you ask me, but it's fairly large and would have more for you to do. To the nor'east is a place called Silverhorne. Now...I'm not sure about it, as there have been many rumors, but so far as the temperament of the people there, they're...well, rather like me. Big and jolly, most of 'em. So far as I know, they don't seem keen on too many outsiders to be honest, but you're kind enough. I'm sure you'd be able to fit in just fine. It <i>is</i> a big adventuring hotspot though; somethin' about the catacombs and a lotta temples 'round the place attracts them like flies to honey. The other good thing about it is it's a major transport hub. Lots o' caravans in and out. Just be wary of those going past that estate outside the city limits. Heard some seedy things about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe grinned widely and put her hands together, now armed with a full knowledge of what to expect. She looked up at the mountain lion and beamed her widest smile at him, giggling just a tad, \"Thank you very much! I, er, would you like a bit more of a tip or something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you don't have to do that. Just promise me you'll stop by again soon. Lot of my patrons today said they loved yer show. I'd love to take a gander someday when I can get the barkeeps and the maids to help me watch the place,\" he chuckled back before wandering towards the counter and his quarters again, waving goodnight to his jester guest. \"Good night when you get to it. And maybe I'll see you in the morn 'fore you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile never left her face as he disappeared and her emerald eyes turned to the map, the gears in her head churning as she plotted her next course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere should she go next?</span></div></div>",

She was the only one up that late into the morning, but as the innkeep said, no one really minded. Bebe was looking quite forward to this new locale, even if the friendly advice was against her going. If she ran into trouble, her mechanical body was more than enough of a match for most rogues and highwaymen, but she was betting her speed would get her out of trouble more than brute force. Climbing up the stairs and entering her room, the automaton pulled back the covers and rolled onto the fluffy, cotton mattress, breathing softly as she felt the cradling embrace of the bed. <i>I never did give myself an answer to that question</i>, did I, she queried in her head, <i>but I suppose it doesn't matter</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe closed her eyes, her clockwork brain ticking softly in the night like a lullaby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Bebe was packed and ready right at eight, and with the fare paid, all she had to do was wait for the rest of the passengers to be on their way towards Silverhorne and beyond. Some gave her odd looks, but others either ignored her or waved at the jester-dressed performer, the automaton doll greeting them all jovially in return before the carriage started moving down the main road out of Calta-Nosteronk. The ride was to be a few hours long, so Bebe decided to pass it by practicing small tricks, such as illusory rings and card tricks, enough so that they wouldn't disturb the rest of the nice folk on the ride over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout midway through the trip, there was a nice jostle as the carriage hit a large rock in the road, causing some of the patrons to curse or yelp at the driver for not paying attention. A man who had sat next to her, swaddled in a dark robe which covered his face knocked into her, the auburn-haired doll moving her arms out to catch him gently while his wrapped around her shoulder. Sitting him back up after the vehicle had settled, she smiled a little, \"Are you okay, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmbrbrm! Ugh!</i> Hoo...why yes, thank you, young lady. Sorry for that, I suppose the bump must've jostled my insides!\" the older gentleman chortled before straightening up, leaning back against the wall of the caravan for his nap. She watched him for a moment before he began to snore ever so lightly, the automaton pulling out her little bag of pocket illusions to practice them again. Her shoulder felt a little funny though; it wasn't her skeleton or her internal parts, but it felt like something had been imprinted on her skin. Every time she moved her hand back to check, there was nothing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a clown girl automaton, she had a lot of human qualities, her slender palm moving to her middle as she felt something off there as well. \"I wonder if it's the sea salt again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = =<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Silverhorne should not have been called Little at all. There was nothing little in any sense of the word. The residents, anthromorphic and human, were all outrageously large, ranging from hefty chubs to hulking balls of flesh that tried to mill about the town square on daily business. That wasn't the least of it: everyone was eating <b>something.</b> Mothers with children snacking on sweets as they moved from stall to stall, patrolmen grabbing morning pastries to stuff into their maws, shopkeeps sampling their own goods to show off how tasty they were, or eating in between customers to fill out the rest of the day. Everywhere there wasn't a restaurant or an inn, people were still stuffing their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weirdest part was she could almost see them growing before her eyes. Certainly, her better hearing caught the sound of millions of threads of fabric screeching in distress, moaning and howling as bellies lurched towards the floor and thighs grew too large for dresses, arms blowing out of sleeves and armor buckles whimpering before they snapped at the masses of flesh they tried to contain. A couple others got off with the automaton at the hire stand, a burly barbarian of a coyote while his bobcat friend, an archer, followed after him towards the nearest inn for information but that was about it so far as other travelers. Still, she could see the streets were filled with folk, the enlarged storefronts, roads, entryways and even seats and tables home to all kinds including adventurers and explorers. The innkeeper hadn't been kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thickness lay across the air however, and being a magic-infused entity, she could sense it far better than anyone else save an experienced mage. The air was suffuse with a light miasma, she could feel, which seemed to be in everything. Thoughts popped into her head about how it could be related to why everyone was eating and how they were all pretty happy and bustling, but she dismissed it. Moving both hands down to her middle, she pressed into the artificial skin before grabbing her luggage. \"Stop that! I don't know what's wrong with you, though...the atmosphere is kind of weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe began the short walk to the nearest inn, hoping to get some information and to see whether she'd need a permit or not to actually perform. Her free hand reached back to scratch the spot on her shoulder, but again, there was nothing there. She hoped to undress that night and see if something had snagged in her costume that was causing her such irritation...</span></div></div>",

It had its gorgeous sides, such as the splendid view if the ocean in the Upper City, and its poverty-stricken sides, such as the infamous Lawless District.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite the sight for sore travelers, especially if those travelers spent months in rural areas, fighting off monsters, living off nothing but dried fruits and meat, and sleeping on cold, hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch was the case for Kina, a barbarian wolfess, who was dressed in the typical garb for her kind: boiled leather with bits of armor, and a wicked looking axe on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her late twenties, this wolf was well-built, a strong, independent anthro that feared no one. Her fur running down her belly and part of her thighs were as white as snow, and the rest of her fur was as dark as a heavy storm cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weary sword-for-hire surveyed the busy street, watching as smallfolk went about their last few hours of daily business, not even sparing a glance at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" she thought to herself, breathing in, \"Someplace I could rest for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in noon, and the sun was hanging low in the West, turning the sky a bright orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted the bag of gold that was attached to her belt, both to reassure herself that it was still there, and to enjoy the feeling of the hard gold inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last mission had brought a great amount of income for her (at least one hundred gold coins!), and she could not wait to spend it on a nice Inn where she could order a decent room with a feather-stuffed bed and a good meal to fill her empty, growling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKina didn't fear that her money would be stolen as she strolled down the street, for she was very close to the gates where the City Guards often patrolled, meaning that crime was little to non-existent here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also here that most of the inns were, greeting travelers as they entered Calta-Nosteronk, their colorful signs naming the establishment, swaying gently in the gusty wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kneeling Servant was a large, popular, three-story Inn, which was packed this time of day with costumers eating food, drinking beer, or doing both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll also have one room,\" Kina said to the waiter, a human, while he was still hovering beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf was currently busy munching on her third dish of mutton, served with a few potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'll be five ten gold coins,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe price was preposterous, but Kina did not argue. She had to admit that the place was quite fancy, and when she arrived at her room she saw that it could almost befit a noble: it had a large double bed with clean sheets, a balcony, a spacious room that had enough space for furniture, and a bathroom that had actual running water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalta-Nosteronk was one of the few cities that could clout having proper plumbing, and some buildings, if the owners were wealthy enough, could have it installed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKina was delighted that she could have a bath to wash away the dirt off her muscular figure, but she never showed it openly, only saying to the human that escorted her: \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf closed the door behind her when he left, took the bag of coins off her belt, and began to search through the money for one specific object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold was not the only thing she was rewarded for her service to a shady wizard. The sorcerer also gave her a peculiar, but beautiful, silver necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally dug it out, Kina studied the piece with interest: it had a large, purple crystal attached to the silver chain, which glittered and flashed in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling faintly, the wolf placed it around her neck. It had a slight weight to it, like all valuable metals had, but, for some unknown reason, Kina could feel a bizarre, dark aura floating around it, like it had some serious black magic on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging the feeling away, Kina went to the bathroom, opened the water, allowing it to flow into a marble bathtub, and undressed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting for the hot water to fill the tub, Kina studied her nude body in the mirror: like it was said earlier the wolf was muscular, typical for her kind, with bulging arm muscles, legs, and abdominal, but she was still rather curvy, with large breasts dotted with inverted, coin sized, pink nipples, and thick thighs and large rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKina was often told that she had childbearing-hips, a characteristic that was seen as something special in the clan she grew up in, for it meant that she could give birth to more pups with fewer problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother had that same hips too, and she went off to marry one of the chief's sons, resulting in her birth a few months later. The same would have happened to Kina if she did not decide to go off and become a sword-for-hire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf climbed into the steaming bathtub, giving a audible sigh of pleasure. After washing off the dirt, causing the water to get a brown tint, she soaked a little longer until the water began to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not favor wearing her travel-worn clothing again, so, she took one of the robes that was conveniently placed over a chair next to the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she left the bathroom she noticed something: her crystal necklace was still around her neck. Kina raised it in her paw, eying it suspiciously. She could have sworn that she took it off before she climbed into the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she did, perhaps she did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter, though, for Kina was rather tired and wanted nothing more but to jump on that comfortable, large bed and fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the sun was only beginning to set over the mountains in the distance, Kina was sprawled on the bed, her legs wide open, exposing her neither regions, sleeping soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she snored on, the crystal around her neck began to glow faintly...</span></div></div>",

He turned around and went back into his home, calling to his wife: \"Martha, I'm going out for a walk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife, Martha, a small but sturdy women, wearing a dull yellow dress and a apron, looked at him strangely when he came into the kitchen and said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"There is a storm coming. Why do you want to go out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be a quick walk. I promise that I'll be back home long before it breaks,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come, too, father?\" asked Timothy, the youngest of Luke's children, a ten-year old boy, who was sitting at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shook his head. \"I'm sorry, Tim, but you can't come. I want to be alone for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child whined, but he didn't protest any further against his father. And so Luke strolled down the path that ran up the little hill to where his house was built on. It connected later to the main road, a wide dirt road that was often used by travelers and merchants alike, which ran south until it reached Calta-Nosteronk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Luke himself did not know why he decided to take this walk. Even though he was a farmer, a man who knew what hard work was like, Luke was more of the well-off peasants, and he had the the firm, bouncing, beach-ball size gut to prove it, which also meant that he disliked exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, there was a storm coming. At this very moment gusts of wind was rushing over the land, causing tree branches to sway and dust to kick up. The dull roar of thunder sounded in the distance, announcing that the storm was coming, and it was coming fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Luke was compelled to take this walk, almost like he was ordered to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to take the hunter's trail through the forest and head back home,\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he entered the forest, the deep green pine trees sighing and bending in the gusty wind, the first few fat drops of water began to fall from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then began to rain hard.</span></div></div>",

Relieved that he had finally found some shelter, Luke ran up the porch and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opened rather unexpectedly, and he peered inside gingerly. It was dark and Luke could scarcely make out the outlines of the furniture inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, is anyone home?\" he called, stepping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to intrude on your property, but I was caught in the storm and I desperately needed shelter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one must be home,\" he concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was wrong, he knew, to enter into someone's home without their permission, but he would be damed if he had to stay outside in the pouring rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luke sat down on the nearest chair, his first thoughts were of his family. His wife was probably worried sick about him, but, as much as it pained him, he had to wait for the storm to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water drummed on the roof and a chilly wind blew through the open door. Shivering, he closed the door and decided to light a fire in the hearth for some heat and light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found some wood, conveniently placed next to the fireplace, and soon had the fire going. Now that the room was lit in a orange glow, he could study the interior of this cabin more closely now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of those typical one room cabins where no walls separated anything; the bedroom was connected to the living room, and the living room was connected to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen spite its cheap style of building, Luke saw that it was decorated with lavish furniture: rich oil paintings hung on the walls, a expensive, shaggy carpet was on the floor of the living room, surrounded by beautiful chairs, and a bookshelf stood next to a queen-sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a place that would have befitted that of a wealthy merchant. Luke wondered why anyone would leave his or her house like this unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting on one of the chairs, pondering this, the door of the cabin suddenly opened, and someone stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who was it?</span></div></div>",

But when it came to my master, a wizard, another being of magic that was far more superior than I, I had to do his dirty work, or else he'll inflate my already plus-sized body until it popped like a balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, here I was, naked, avoiding cold puddles of water as I stepped into the small room. The excessive amount of steam made it hard to see only a few feet in front of you, and the air was so thick that I could not help but cough a little, waving my hand in front of my face. With the humid and hot conditions, sweat began to break out all over my body, droplets running of my ample rump and breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more flustered I look, the better,\" I thought to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA private session was rather costly, which meant that whoever I'm going to serve was wealthy, which also meant that I had the right target. With his back leaning against the wall, his arms spread-out over the railings, half-sitting and half-laying down, the hot water reaching up to his hairy chest, Lord Fernando Alberto Augusta, or simply Lord Augusta, was grinning at me like a schoolboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing one of the most powerful men in the city, a shady political figure, it was hard to believe that this bald-headed person was ones a ex-soldier, a commander that boldly defended his lands from invaders. But the years in office had pampered him until he grew soft, but the evidence of muscle still lingered on him: his arms were rather thick, suggesting that there was more than fat underneath, his torso still toned, his belly a round sphere, a little bit larger than a beach ball, sticking above the water like a little island, his navel like a small crater on the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to join me?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis accent, the way he rolled his \"r\", gave away his nationality. He didn't come from here but from lands far from this, where it was hot and dry, where people are ridiculously hot food and held strange celebrations on the end of each month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's room,\" I said, fusing with my long, red hair, flashing one of my pretty smiles to give him the idea that I was eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoosebumps sprouted across my flesh when I slipped my feet into the water, and I slowly began to swing my wide hips. His grin grew wider as I kneeled before him, my busts pressing against his muscular chest, my hands resting on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Lord Augusta began, cupping my round chin, \"when I asked them to bring my a large women, I was half-expecting them to bring me something half-descent, like a women only leaning towards the chubby side, but you-\" he gave one of my moons a squeeze \"-take the cake. Perhaps I should pay this pleasure-house the tip I promised them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned over and gave his prominent noise a kiss. \"Thank you, my lord,\" I said, giving his shoulders a squeeze myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I hate to admit it, but his words genuinely flattered me. It wasn't everyday that a fat women like me was complimented on her figure. Most men were after those skinny ladies, and shunned the heftier ones. And still they complained about a difficult childbirth? With thin hips like those it was bound to cause complications. I almost felt ashamed of what I had to do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand cradling my soft cheek and the other running through my hair, Lord Augusta said: \"Why don't we get busy, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled my head into a long, passionate kiss, his tongue working its way into my mouth, his meaty hands groping every inch of my flesh. Now was the time to work my magic. While he was kissing me, my hands left his shoulders and moved down his back, squeezing at his love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt the warm, fuzzy of magic beginning to spread to it, and my hands began to glow a eerie blue, like that of the full moon on a foggy night. His skin was most likely soaking it up like some sort of sponge, the blue light visible on the surface of his skin before disappearing all together. I broke the kiss, due to the lack of air, and climbed, with some effort (I'm a big lady, after all), back on my feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Augusta looked at me strangely, and asked, though a little out of breath: \"Hey, why...did you...stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't want to answer; there was no need for it. I saw he attempted to rise for whatever reason, but the spell, like to chains keeping him pinned to the wall, prevented him from doing so. Before he could begin to wonder what was going on, lord Augusta's gut, with audible rumbles, surged forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith mild interest I watched, and stepping back every now and then when the space began to deplete, his form expand, his remaining muscle being covered in thick layers of fat. He gave cries of alarm and fear, screaming at me what did I do to him. When the evidence became clear that I had not interest of answering his questions, he began to frantically speak something in his language (perhaps he was cursing, or perhaps it was a prayer to whatever gods he served to aid him).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as the spell began to come in full force, his cries and please of terror shifted into ones of groans and moans of delight, a red blush spreading across his basket ball-sized cheeks. As he neared his climax, the blob known as lord Augusta began to glow a faint blue around his cavernous belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to act quickly now. Flicking my fingers, a transparent crystal appeared in my hands with a puff of red smoke. Stepping forth, I pressed it against his sloshing and gurgling mountainous belly. Immediately it began to absorb it, the crystal turning blue, no longer transparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, observing my handiwork. Essence: there was only two ways of getting it, through intense pain or pleasure. Personally I wouldn't mind capturing this politicians and torture him myself until I had what I wanted, but my master, being the pacifist he claimed to be, wanted a more fun and merciful approach. It was ironic that he still had to die anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing and breathing hard, his transformation and climax now over, lord Augusta whispered between his massive cheeks and sets of chins: \"Please, hel- \"uuurp!\" me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment I felt sorry for him, seeing him in such a pathetic, his rolls of fat overflowing on the sides of the pool, his limbs sausages, helplessly flailing about, his head sinking away into his corpulent body. But the moment quickly passed, and I only shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, my lord,\" I said, flashing him one of my smiles, this one cruel and sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, I waddled towards the exit. Just as I was about to leave, two creatures, no bigger than a small dog, hideous in appearance, appeared seemingly out of nowhere. I gestured with my thumb towards the immobile man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's all yours, boys,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled, showing rows of sharp teeth. \"O, yummy!\" they chimed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I put my distance from the room, I could hear lord Augusta's screams of fear, sounding high and shrill, echoing throughout the pleasure-house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shining amongst twinkling stars and a few wispy clouds, the full moon casted a pale white light on Calta-Nosteronk. The gusty night wind blew litter and howled around the corners of the streets of the Lawless District. It was unusually quiet this time of night. Usually it would still be alive with activity: whores would be standing idly on every corner, waiting to sell their bodies for coin, men would come stumbling out of taverns, spewing alcohol, or they would be standing around bonfires, talking, laughing, and gambling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no doubt that this was the work of my master, placing a spell on the small area that caused people to abandon their late activities and go to bed early. Though I could defend myself effortlessly (I'm a sturdy women and a sorceress, after all), I knew that he cared little for my safety, that he only wanted no one to see me performing this task for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople could grow suspicious when they saw a well-fed women, who looked like much like a noble, wearing a red satin dress (my sorceress' robe), which I filled out quite nicely, prancing around the poorest area in the city. Someone could get the idea to report this to the city's guard for a reward, and confrontation is the last thing my master needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just in case, I kept a lookout for any strangers following me. When I was sure that there was none, I suddenly took a sharp turn into a dark alleyway. I continued to walk down the narrow pathway, looking left and right, up and down, searching for any sign of my master, but I found none. This was odd. He said that it was here that he would meet me. Perhaps I took a wrong turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when I turned around and attempted to waddle out of the alleyway, a voice spoke, startling me. \"Well, good evening, Kelly,\" it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirling around, I saw a figure emerge from the gloom, stepping into the moonlight. Dressed in a long black cloak, his hood pulled up, his sleeves tucked into each other, it was impossible to tell who it was. But it was his voice that told me that it was my master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly composing myself, and remembering my position, I bowed as low as my potbelly allowed me to go, saying: \"Good evening, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you bring what I requested for?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI straitened myself. \"Yes, I did, master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached between my ample breasts, a place I always liked to keep small, valuable things, and pulled out the blue crystal, which glowed a faint blue in the darkness. I did some modifications on it, and now it had a golden chain fastened to it, making it possible to wear around your neck. He stretched out a bony hand, holding it open, and I plopped the crystal into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held it close to his face, holding it by the chain, studying the crystal. \"Well done,\" he praised, \"I had a feeling that you would have failed me. I guess that I underestimated you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he said this, he threw back his hood. For a brief moment a saw red hair, but it disappeared when he placed the golden chain around his neck. Before my eyes his figure began to fill out, his girth filling his clothing. He also seemed to lose an inch in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, but it wasn't my master anymore but lord Augusta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked every inch like him, even having the accent. And no, I was not surprised. To morph yourself into someone else was a rather simple spell, but it demanded essence, like that that was sealed inside the crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI studied him for a few moments with mild-interest. \"So, do you think it would fool the council of the city?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" he said, making a show of pushing his large gut as far as possible, giving it a rub and a pat. \"The council, or their wizards protecting them, will never know it is me. I'll soon bring this city to its knees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited a few moments until his fit of evil laughter was over before I asked gingerly: \"So, am I free to leave your services now, master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regarded me for a moment. \"No,\" he said, shaking his bald head, \"My master plan isn't finished yet, and you could still be of some use. But, to make you feel better, I'll give you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dug somewhere in his cloak, producing a brown bag, the sound of coins jingling within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your hard work,\" he continued, \"I'll give you a bone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the bag towards me. It would have fallen at my feet, spewing out the coins if I hadn't caught it with my magic, levitating it to me. I opened it a peered inside. Gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, ho home,\" he said with a flick of his beefy hand, \"You need to save your strength for the next task I have for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew better than to protest, to except his reward, so I said with a bow: \"Thank you, master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" he said, disappearing into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and left the alleyway.</span></div></div>",

I allowed a uncharacteristic moan of bliss to escape as the ointment took effect, relaxing the pain in my muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rough day, huh?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't answer, for he knew fully well what the answer would be. Using magic was tiring, especially if the spell was strong. It felt like running a mile without any pause, and it often left me aching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't allow him to treat you like that, mistress,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but chuckle. Peasant boy indeed! Nathan, my servant, had little knowledge about the world of magic, and the world and general, than the small village I plucked him out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough his ignorance saddens me, I find him quite useful. He always ran mundane tasks that I had little time, or frankly were too lazy, to do. And on evenings like this, on a large bed in some expensive Inn after a long day, he would rub special ointment on me to ease my pain. He would also do other things to...please me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this very moment I could feel how pent-up Nathan was. His throbbing member was resting snug between my buns, and his hands, much to my irritation, was moving away from the ache on my back and traveling lower to my lovehandles and belly, almost giving me a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would mistress like it if I pleased you tonight,\" he said in a whisper, no doubt trying to sound seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo tell you the truth, I was rather tired and wanted nothing more than to go to sleep after this message session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not tonight, Nathan,\" I said, \"I'm tired and want to go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, pleeease, mistress,\" he whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. Thinking about it, I had to admit that Nathan was a good boy today. He did everything I wanted him to do: finding a good-looking Inn, paying for the room, setting up the necessary charms, bringing my baggage in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that deserves a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" I said, rolling over and spreading my legs, my weight jiggling as I shifted, \"But make it quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting one hand on my belly and the other on my knee, he said while grinning, \"Thank you, mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him now, I saw that Nathan was a handsome youth. He had sleek, blond hair that fell to his shoulders and a cute, though arrogant, smile. His body was toned, but it had little muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan brandished his cock, slowly sliding it into my womanhood, uttering a gasp of pleasure. I could not help but gasp, too, when I felt the sensation of a man's tool spreading my folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to thrust his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would mistress like some after-sex cuddles?\" Nathan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really pushing it,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally my servant slept in his own bed, or on a bedroll on the floor when there were no extra, but after such sessions I permit him to sleep with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, mistress,\" he said, taking my warning as a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged himself close to my soft body, burying his head between my large breasts, falling asleep. For some reason I found myself smiling, stroking the young man's hair. I gave his head a peck before I drifted off into the land of dreams.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasn't even a hot day but I was sweating like a pig. As I waddled down the street, I could feel their eyes upon me. And why won't they stare at me? To them I probably looked like some sort of over inflated balloon. I could have used a glamour to create an illusion that I still had a normal body, but I could only hold one spell at a time and one was already in use to keep my breasts filled with milk from lactating, a sight that I was sure would lure even more eyes, and not just from men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear some shopkeepers making lewd remarks as I passed, and women, carrying baskets filled with groceries, going about their daily business, stopped to giggle and point fingers at me. I would have set them on fire in half a heartbeat, but here in the main market square, where the authority of the city was well-fixed, it would be a very stupid thing to do. It wasn't like the Lawless District, where such actions would go unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, the recent turmoil the city has been thrown into has left those that practice magic in a tight spot. New laws now decreed that those caught using magic in public, especially harmful ones, would be arrested by the city's guard (apparently they had ways to do it without too many dyeing in the process) and taken in for questioning. From what I heard from common folk drinking at taverns, it apparently was a bloody story. You most certainly did not want to get caught!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, I had to bit back my pride and make myself scarce at the first opportunity. A while later that opportunity showed itself, and I took a sharp turn left, climbing slowly up a short stairway, breathing hard and swallowing with effort. At the top was a small park. It was one of the many that was placed throughout the city. According to those that planned the city many years ago, the flora helped keep the air clean, cooled down the air, and kept people relaxed. It was a convenience that I was more than grateful, at this moment, to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, and, maneuvering my heavy body and swelling, round belly, I sat down on the soft grass, kicking off my slippers and dipping my hot feet into the small pond where geese floated idly on the water, mildly interested in my presence. The park was empty, and I took a gulp of the fresh air. No wonder my master wanted me to meet him here. It was so peaceful and relaxing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes, tilting my head upwards and enjoying the warm rays of the spring sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself, Kelly?\" a familiar voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes and looked to my left. And there stood my master, dressed in fine clothing, a smile on his face. But he wasn't wearing the glamour that disguised him as Lord Augusta. Instead, he was his plain old self, flaming red hair, much like my own, and scrawny body. He was young, too, no older, I guessed, than my servant Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master!\" I exclaimed in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled my feet out of the murky water and tried to stand to give him a formal bow, but a hand rested on my shoulder, setting me back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, Kelly,\" he said, \"You don't have to trouble yourself with formalities, especially in your state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, especially in my state. If it wasn't already obvious to the average person on the street, I was pregnant. Dame that boy! On that evening, more than eight months ago, when I gave that servant of mine what he wanted, I forgot to put a seal over my womb, a spell that protected it from the invading seed. Though, it wasn't completely his fault; I was tired that night, and my weariness made me forgetful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbortion, by drinking a special tea, would be a quick solution to my problem, but I saw such an act as something obscene. No, I had to go through this dilemma, unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy master sat next to me on the grass. \"You seem to get bigger everyday I see you,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis typical smirk he always wore gone now, replaced by a genuine look of sympathy which made him look older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are,\" I said, running my hand over my bloated tummy with affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were more than one, I discovered, when I used a spell to detect life forces. I found three. Triplets. I'm going to be more of a mother than a sorceress soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master,\" I ventured, \"Do you think, in my state, that I should do this task?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged, hugging his knees. \"I'm not sure,\" he said, \"that's why I called you here. You know how close I am to achieving my goal. That one wizard could ruin my entire plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy master had been busy throughout these few months. Somehow he managed to assassinate not only a great deal of the council that ruled the city, but he managed to poison the king (he was now laying on his deathbed) and frame a wizard name Arion for doing all of these despicable crimes. He was currently standing trail for his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was one young, amateur wizard named Keith who managed to escape my master's wrath, fleeing into the woods, and my master was desperate to capture him, for he suspected that the wizard knows what's going on, and might assemble a force to stop the Lipomancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But master,\" I pleaded, \"My pregnant state might hinder me if I go after him. I also don't want my babies to come to harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kelly,\" he insisted, \"Just do this last task for me. Like I said, he's an amateur, and it would be easy to catch him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Alright,\" I said, \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy master nodded. \"Thank you,\" he said, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched him leave, activating his glamour and changing into Lord Augusta. I stayed in the park a while after he left. After I cooled down, I placed my shoes back on my feet, lifted my thick body, and went back to the Inn I stayed in.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing my sweat-stained robes, I pulled the red dress over my head, and under my clothing I was stark naked, not bothering with small clothes anymore due to the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few moments to study myself: my breasts, due to the milk filling, had grown a tad larger, my nipples hard and erect, my belly, ones flabby, had hardened as the life inside grew, giving it a almost spherical shape, my belly button popping out somewhere during the fifth month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I studied my hips, I saw that my pregnancy wasn't the only thing affecting me. I was gaining weight, too. Cravings were a bitch. Nathan was more than willing to comply to bring me whatever large and ridiculous food I requested. The lack of movement also allowed a few pounds to be stored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, sinking into the warm water, which had islands of bubbles drifting on its surface. I felt my thighs brush against the wood where a inch of space used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I soaked in the bath, my eyes closed, I felt a hand touch my wet stomach. \"I hope they are boys,\" I heard Nathan say. \"If they are, what should we name them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened one eye. \"Shut up,\" I said with some scorn, ignoring his question, \"It's your fault, too, that I'm like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flinched. \"I'm sorry,\" Nathan said, looking hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. \"Just grab that bar of soap there and was my back,\" I commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I was freshly scrubbed, I laid on my bed, covered in a white bathrobe. Now less hot and rested, I was in a better mood, and I allowed Nathan to lay at my side, his ear resting against my bloated stomach, his hand spread all over it, commenting every time he felt or heard signs of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, mistress,\" said Nathan after a while, \"but you still didn't answer my question from earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What question?\" I asked, not quite remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About naming them if they are boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments I was silent thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged, finally saying: \"I guess we can name them all Nathan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth,\" I continued, \"I was hoping that they'll all be girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan lifted his head from my stomach, looking at me. \"Why's that?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that I can teach them all the art of magic,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if they are boys,\" Nathan pointed out, \"then they would be wizards, right. You can still teach them magic, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged again. \"I guess so,\" I said, \"But the satisfaction would be less than teaching women. Besides, it feels good being surrounded by fellow sorceresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you name them, then, if they are girls, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went silent, thinking again. \"I was thinking of Claudine, Verna, and Lexis,\" I said, \"They're names of powerful mages that lived long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy servant tilted his head left and right, thinking about the names. \"Sounds like great names,\" said Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother silence dragged on until Nathan broke it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we really have to do the task tomorrow?\" Nathan asked, \"In your state, I was hoping that your master would send us home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept my servant up to date to my tasks I had to perform, to let him know where I was going and why he had to do certain things for me. When he heard of the wizard we had to hunt down for my master, Nathan was dismayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" I said, \"But he asked nicely and I complied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't it be dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"Most likely,\" I said, \"But, from what I heard, the wizard is a amateur, and it would be easy to track him down. There could also be a chance that my master could send out a few minions to make the job easier. He knows, just as well as we do, what state I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan sighed. \"I guess we have no choice, then,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"No choice,\" I said. \"Did you ready the coach like I asked you to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan nodded. \"Yes,\" he said, \"It's packed and ready to leave tomorrow at 9 a.m sharp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, reaching over to ruffle the young man's blond hair. \"Good boy,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe beamed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The coach swayed and jumped as it moved across the uneven road, like a ship that was caught in a bad storm. I tried my best to hold on to something while a was rocked about, not only for my own safety but also for those of my future offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel them kicking inside my womb. It must be a frightening experience for them, being thrown around like this, not knowing what was going on, wondering what their mother was possibly up to. But a bumpy coach ride was the least of my and their problem. I was about to plunge us into a very dangerous task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan, sitting opposite to me, where I had placed him to prevent him from groping my swollen stomach (which was rather unfair, seeing that he was the parent of these children too, but his touching was becoming annoying), was stirring up small talk about pretty much anything that he saw along the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had been traveling for quite a while to get to the forest where the wizard Keith was hiding, and I guess Nathan was bored. Either that, or perhaps he was trying to make me feel better. It was a rare sight to see me visibly nervous, but the fear I had for losing my offspring was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might be an amateur, like I've heard, but I suspected that Keith could pack a terrible punch if he needed to. Whatever Nathan's purpose was with the small talk, it at least made me feel a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach came to a sudden halt, for we had arrived. Nathan was the first to jump out, helping me climb out as I cradled my big belly. We payed the driver handsomely, not only for his service but to keep his mouth shut as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan unloaded some of the lighter objects on the coach while I used my magic to float the heavier ones. The chances were high that I wasn't going to find the wizard on the first day, for the area was large, so we had to camp for the night here in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't like camping, especially if there was a chance that I could go into labor here, but yet again it could be worse. I could have ended up doing this completely alone. My master had thought of me and had sent reinforcements to aid me in my task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two of them, standing at the edge of the treeline, watching as we approached. The one was a well-build wolf, and he, judging from his leather armor, large broadsword and battle scars, was most likely a barbarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he watched us with his big yellow eyes, he scratched behind his ears wildly, giving me the impression that he might have lice, and spat at the ground afterwards, leaning against a tree casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second person gave me some hope for my task. Wearing a blue dress, her breasts pressing against her bodice, threatening to spill over, the woman was thin with long raven-black hair. I could tell that she was a sorceress, for she had a special twinkle in her eye that showed that she possessed magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pretty face twisted into a sympathetic smile as she saw us approaching, her eyes resting on me. It wasn't hard to tell what she was looking at, my taut belly and posture screaming that I was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said formally, \"Good day, Kelly. My master -or should I say our master- have informed us about you and ordered us to accompany you with your mission. My name is Sorsah and this is Took.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" I said before gesturing towards Nathan, \"And this is my servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you have one of those too,\" said Sorsah, offering Nathan a wink, \"I have plenty of those had home, ones just as cute as him. Correct me if I'm wrong but is he the father of your...litter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" I said, \"But let's stop talking to each other like two housewives. We have a job to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we do,\" Sorsah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went into the forest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even now she could feel the adrenaline rushing through her veins, aching her knees as she crouched. The thrum of her heart was deafening, but Rozenna knew this was her only chance. With a forward tumbling roll out from behind the pile of crates, the thieving young lass clung to the backside of the empty stall. High noon was the busiest time in the Bazaar District, and she knew the guards were maintaining extra vigilance thanks to the numerous thieves recently arrested for attempted larceny. \u201cHonestly, how hard is it to lift a damned coinpurse?\u201d Rozenna sighed; she had a reputation for always making her mark, and she was not about to break that reputation now just because some thieves were too foolish to keep from getting caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRozenna eyed the adjacent alley and, upon seeing no other living souls in sight, set to picking the lock on the display case. The young woman gnawed on the corner of her lip as the lockpick eased in between the tumblers, sliding silently into the unexpectedly complex lock. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about a damned scroll?\u201d the thief muttered to herself. Rozenna jostled the lock one last time before it finally unlatched with a quiet click. \u201cEureka! Mama\u2019s gonna eat well tonight!\u201d she hissed with glee. Rozenna smirked to herself and reached into the case. Her fingers trailed across several necklaces and bracelets, but she ignored them and continued her search. Another part of her reputation was that she never stole anything besides her objective. Well, nothing that would be missed anyway. With absolute dexterity, she wiggled one ring around her pinky just as her hand grasped the scroll\u2019s casing. \u201cJackpot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Rozenna retracted her hand with the scroll in tow and whirled about just in time to see a large man in a silk tunic. This must have been the poor sap who owned the shop. \u201cThief!\u201d No sooner than the word flew from his broad chest, a patrol of guards rounded the corner. Not good! Rozenna, who had fortunately covered her face, hopped to her feet and glanced around the narrow alleyway. The guards charged, swords drawn in preparation for any resistance. However, fighting wasn\u2019t exactly Rozenna\u2019s style. The crates caught her eye, and in a flash she charged the guards. They held their swords aloft, but the clever thief dropped to her backside and slid between the legs of one guard. Scrambling to her feet, she leapt from box to box, scaling the pile of crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long, suckers!\u201d Before the armed men could even stop to look back she was already up and over the alley wall, running across the rooftops. Rozenna was no novice, she always made sure to scope out several escape routes in case of any surprises. Dropping down into another corridor, the young thief slunk along the wall before diving into her home turf, the Lawless District. \u201cThat was easier than I expected, considering the reward.\u201d Another means of maintaining secrecy was to always work through connections. Meeting a client in person was a sure way to get your face drawn up on a wanted poster. Thankfully, Mikael was the perfect broker; he never took more than his fair share of the cut, and he never disclosed the identities of his contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping a brisk pace, Rozenna had already arrived at her destination: The Sticky Fingers Saloon. Although the beer was nothing to write home about, the beds were comfortable, and it was a great place to meet in private. That, and they made the best spicy chicken crispers in the city. Where might they get chicken in such an impoverished area? Stolen from the supplies of the aristocracy in the upper level. Regardless, Rozenna\u2019s nose was met with the savory spiced air of the saloon, and it immediately set her mouth to watering. She found her meal for the evening. With a tug, Rozenna lowered her hood and mask as the light of the tavern spilled over her through the windows. The thief stood before the swinging doors to the saloon and pushed them apart as she strode in. No one even noticed her enter, and the low banter continued uninterrupted. She didn\u2019t exactly need to make a scene at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOver here, kid,\u201d Mikael called out; he was one of the shrewdest men she had ever met. At a glance he looked like little more than your average thug, but his brains were to be feared more than his brawn. Sure, he could probably beat most men in an arm-wrestling match, but the weight of his coinpurse was much more significant. Mikael was the sort of man who kept his true fiscal worth a secret to everyone. Well, everyone except Rozenna. After all, it was she who ensured his investment was not lost that one time several years ago. During her little escapade at Mikael\u2019s behest, she discovered he was actually worth more than some of the nobility of the upper district. She never understood what kept him down in the Lawless District, but considering his wealth and power, it was probably best not to ask. After weaving between bar patrons, Rozenna finally reached Mikael\u2019s reserved table in the corner of the room. As she pulled out her chair, she shook the loose braid of hair free from the hood flattened to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMik, it\u2019s always a pleasure,\u201d Rozenna began with a bow of her head. Removing her cloak, she hung it on the back of her chair. The thief could feel the old broker\u2019s eyes tasting her slight curved body. Rozenna had always been on the thin side, but she kept herself physically fit for the agile demands of her trade. Nonetheless, her tight-fitting leather suit did little to leave her body to anyone\u2019s imagination. She had the common decency to keep herself covered, but the clothing still clung to every supple curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoz, love, the pleasure\u2019s always mine,\u201d he flashed a yellow grin and gestured for the young woman to take a seat. Rozenna obliged, gracefully folding one leg over the other. She leaned back in the chair, and glanced up as a bar wench sauntered by. Without words, she held up one finger, and the loosely-dressed woman nodded with a smile too heavily adorned in make-up. Rozenna returned her attention to Mikael, and she caught him staring at her chest again. Knowing better than to scold her broker, she cocked her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe this is the part where you pay me, Mikael,\u201d Rozenna smirked and folded her arms across her chest, blocking out any further view of her modest bosom. The broker ran his fingers through his greasy, unkempt hair, and raised both brows. He stretched out the same hand and jabbed his stout finger down onto the wooden table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I believe you owe me somethin\u2019, kid,\u201d Mikael grumbled his words, but there was no hostility in them. The pair had been working together long enough to know that trust was not a concern. Rozenna flashed a white grin and reached into her satchel. Retrieving its contents, she rested the scroll casing on the table but did not remove her hand from it just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this thing, Mik?\u201d Rozenna now raised her own brow in curiosity, but Mikael darted his eyes around the tavern. She had never seen him so anxious before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how it is, kid. Gotta keep confidentiality. Hand it over, and the money\u2019s yours,\u201d the broker bobbed his head as he explained his terms, but the faintest bead of sweat coursed its way down his face. He was right about the confidentiality, but Mikael was never nervous about anything. Rozenna played along and rolled the scroll across the table. Better to leave it alone than get mixed up in something unpleasant. The gaudy bar wench returned and laid the platter of spicy chicken crispers in front of Rozenna. The thief flipped her a polished coin and sent the wench on her way. As Mikael reached into his deep pockets, the thief removed her leather gloves and began to chow down on the spicy chicken fingers. Each one seared her lips and tongue, but the wench returned with a tall beer just in time. Rozenna huffed and puffed and flipped the wench another coin while simultaneously guzzling the frothy beer. As expected, it was nothing remarkable, but it eased the spicy heat of the meal. Rozenna, now fanning herself with one hand, peered up at her stocky broker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you planning on paying me, Mik?\u201d she pried between sips of beer. He was now inspecting the stolen property with great scrutiny but finally nodded and tossed her a bag of coins. The greedy little thief chirped with glee and snatched up the purse. Being the expert she was, she gave it a light toss and scowled. \u201cHey! This is only half of what we agreed on! Are you trying to cheat me, Mik?\u201d Rozenna growled fiercely, though deep down she knew she could never intimidate the man. However, Mikael did seem to react to the threats and hushed her by holding up his hands in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, kid, I wasn\u2019t completely honest with you before,\u201d he began. Rozenna only deepened her scowl, now leaning over her crispers with a look of pure rage. \u201cThis is actually a two-part job, and stealin\u2019 the scroll was the easy part,\u201d Mikael swallowed hard, glancing about the room with even more anxiety than before. Rozenna stood from her seat and shoved a crisper into her mouth while grabbing her cloak. \u201cWait, wait, wait! The client is willing to give you ten times the agreed upon reward if you finish the job!\u201d Rozenna spit out the crisper, and it deftly landed back on the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much?!\u201d She gawked, immediately plopping down into her seat again. \u201cWhat do I have to do? Just name it!\u201d Rozenna now bobbed her head like a doll, eager to reap in the reward. That much money could even raise her out of the slums, make a proper lady of herself. She eagerly gnawed on another chicken wing, huffing with each bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie, it\u2019s gonna be rough. I can only tell you the mission if you accept if first,\u201d the broker warned, and Rozenna balked, leaning back in her seat. She didn\u2019t exactly like the sound of signing up without knowing the terms first. \u201cSo you in or out?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rozenna meandered through the bustling afternoon streets of the Lawless District. A heavy scowl hung on her face, and it wasn\u2019t about the imminent inclement weather. Storm clouds were already roiling over head, and the swollen gray sky looked fit to burst into a downpour at any moment. Her cowl was pulled up and her cloak wrapped tightly about her shoulders. \u201cThat no-good, sneaky, double-crossing\u2026\u201d Rozenna\u2019s conversation with Mikael had not ended as well as she expected. Then again, the promised fortune should have made her realize the possible risk. Ten times the original offer, but she had to agree before hearing the rest of the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said it would be easy, but with so little experience outside of the city limits, Rozenna was more than a little concerned with the adventure that would precede her payment. She had always played it smart, played it safe, never biting off more than she could chew. Unfortunately, the prize was too big this time, too shiny. Rozenna now had to march out into the damned forest and find a filthy, dark cave. Inside this cave would be a narrow, dirty tunnel. At the end of the tunnel would be an unnecessary castle filled with all sorts of unusual treasures. Mikael had gone out of his way to explain that this castle belonged to the client and nothing was to be disturbed. Nothing except for the oddly named book: \u201cExpanding Horizons.\u201d Hell, with the amount of money she was going to get paid for a simple snatch-and-grab like this, she\u2019d be willing to dance naked in the Saloon for a week straight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoing somewhere, miss?\u201d a gruff voice called out, and upon looking up, Rozenna stood face-to-face with a city guard. Well, not exactly face-to-face. Coming from a long line of short people, Rozenna was at least a head shorter than the man. He shifted his weight, folding his arms across his breastplate. Numerous armor creaks rang out with every movement he made. The thief\u2019s eyes peered around the guard, and she realized she was already in the Gates District.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I, um, was going out for a stroll. You know, catch some fresh air,\u201d she feigned a girlish giggle and batted her lashes at the guard to no avail. His brow wrinkled, and a stern grimace overcame his mustachioed upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat so? Just goin\u2019 for a walk, then? Outside the city limits? Got any particular business in the forest?\u201d The armored chap leaned forward, narrowing his eyes and casting a scrutinous gaze over Rozenna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m a trader, and I must return to my home town,\u201d Rozenna shifted her performance from doting damsel to innocent young entrepreneur. She rested her hands on her modest hips and nodded abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see no wagon with you. What sort of trader doesn\u2019t even have a horse?\u201d he wrinkled his nose as if catching wind of her fishy claims. Rozenna had to think quickly, and promptly removed the scroll from her satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a courier! I trade messages from one person to another. Yep, that\u2019s what I do,\u201d she replied with a wide, forced grin. The guard raised one bushy brow but promptly shook his head while rolling his eyes. Without another word he gestured toward the tall city gates. Rozenna bowed her head in appreciation and breathed a small sigh of relief before tensing up in front of a second guard. This one, however, said nothing at all as he unlocked the person-sized door crafted into the side of the gates. If she did have a horse, they would have needed to open the whole gates, and Rozenna was fairly certain they would have been more annoyed than they already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool, spring breeze swept over Rozenna, bathing her with the scent of trees and grass. She deeply inhaled the aroma and exhaled it slowly. Shafts of sunlight peeked between the gray streaks above. \u201cAt least it looks like I\u2019ll have sunshine during my travels,\u201d the thief beamed and tapped the toe of her boot into the dirt path that stretched out before her. Rozenna snapped her fingers and retrieved the crude map from her pouch. Although it was only a quick sketch, Mikael was kind enough to sell it to her for only one little gold coin. \u201cGreedy bastard,\u201d she hissed beneath her breath just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe map showed, in hardly any detail whatsoever, that she needed to continue down the road for about a mile. After that she would have to venture into the forest and follow a stream. At least there were some landmarks. Rozenna had little-to-no experience in navigating the wilderness. Give her a crammed city street any day. Following her instructions, Rozenna marched down the dirt path, humming a light tune to herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Noon crept overhead, but Rozenna had located the particular stream with no trouble. The Summer heat caused her tight, leather armor to cling to every curve, sweat beading along her browline. Mikael hadn\u2019t given her a deadline, so no one would complain if she took a little time to cool off. Ever vigilant, Roz scanned the treeline and continued along the murmuring stream until the road was well out of sight. She leaned her pack against the base of a tree. Scooping up a small stone, she tossed it into the crystalline stream, watching it sink to the bed. It certainly wasn\u2019t running fast enough to carry her downstream, but it looked deep enough for a quick bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne final scan of her surroundings led Roz to strip down to her birthday suit. Her slender fingers scratched at her scalp, fluffing out her hair as her toes met the brisk, blue waters. She shivered slightly; a light breeze encircled her at that exact moment, layering her fair skin with a swarm of goosebumps. \u201cMeep!\u201d She squeaked, her foot catching an unexpectedly slick rock. She wavered once before toppling into the stream with a loud splash. It may not have been her preferred method of easing into the cold water, but it was certainly effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit! Cold-cold-cold-cold!\u201d Roz shrieked, flailing out of the stream like an octopus on a stove. She scrambled across the riverbank before stopping to breathe at her belongings. \u201cWorst idea ever\u2026\u201d She certainly didn\u2019t feel sweaty any more. With a towel covering her naughty bits, Roz wrung out her hair, a dour expression stuck to her face. Now she remembered why she hated the forest; there was not one enchanted thing about it. Between the freezing water and the incessant bugs, this was certainly nothing like the story books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief rest to dry off, Rozenna continued onward through the forest, following the the river upstream to its source. The daylight still beat down, but with the extra shade of the deep woods, it was far more bearable. Twigs crunched underfoot, birds chirped overhead, and the petite thief whistled to herself. There really wasn\u2019t much else to do, but as a rogue, Roz learned early on how to keep herself entertained. The life of a pickpocket didn\u2019t make for friendships. Really, the only people she spent time with were her marks, strangers in the tavern, and Mikael. Thankfully, she enjoyed being alone. It gave her time to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep thoughts make for speedy travels, and before long, Rozenna found herself at a clearing in the woods. Halting, the young thief listened intently to her surroundings. Not only did she hear no voices, but there were no birds calling, nor any crickets chirping. It was absolutely silent. Gripping the strap of her pack a little tighter, she slunk along the outskirts of the clearing to get a better view. It appeared to be some sort of crude campsite. There didn\u2019t seem to be anyone home. Smoke gently billowed from the central campfire, carrying the scent of spiced meat. Though she had already eaten, there was something tantalizing about the smell. Low grumbling broke the silence, and Rozenna glanced around for some wild beast before recognizing the sound of her own stomach. She blushed, even though she was alone, and reluctantly scampered into the camp. Not eager to attract any attention, the thief stayed low and ducked behind a broad tent. It looked big enough to fit a small family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner, Rozenna blanched. If only it did house a family\u2026 instead of the massive sleeping troll. Three other tents of equal size encircled the cooking spit. Oh, and what a meal it held; perhaps the largest boar Roz had ever seen! Poaching in the nobility\u2019s woods was forbidden, but the thief doubted anyone was willing to tell that to a quartet of enormous trolls. Still though, she was amazed that they had the mental capacity to conjure up such a culinary feat. Glancing back at the dreaming behemoth, she eyed its sizeable gut. Second thought, not that surprising. Creeping closer to the center of the camp, Roz licked her lips, ogling the enticing pig. Larceny may have been her lifelong career, but even she had doubts about the sanity of stealing from trolls. Surely they wouldn\u2019t miss a few slices...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It just looked so tasty. Succumbing to her escalating hunger, Rozenna drops her pack to the ground and unsheathes her dagger. She prodded the boar\u2019s flank and found it soft and yielding. The thief brought the blade beneath her nose, sniffing it once before licking the blade. By all the fires of hell, this was perhaps the tastiest pork she had ever had the good graces of savoring, and she hadn\u2019t even taken a bite yet! An unquenchable hunger glazed over her eyes, and the diminutive damsel plunged her blade into the flank of the roasting boar, carving out a large hunk of flesh. Shoveling the morsel into her mouth, she chewed it enthusiastically, moaning beneath her breath even as the juices dribbled down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygods\u2026\u201d she shuddered with delight before slicing off another chunk of pork. Inhaling the fragrance, Roz chomped into the delicacy, tearing off a mouthful. Meat was hard to come by in the city, and her only regular intake of protein came from the tavern\u2019s spicy chicken crispers. The quality of this roasted pig was beyond comparison. \u201cMmm, compliments to the chef\u2026\u201d she moaned again, licking her fingers clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFanks, lil\u2019 lass,\u201d bellowed a deep, growly voice from behind. Roz froze. Whirling about, she eyeballed the towering figure of the tent troll. His beefy arms were crossed, resting atop the bulge of his gut. He looked even taller standing. Rozenna laughed awkwardly before diving for her dagger. However, the troll moved faster than she expected, wrapping its thick hand around her entire arm before it could reach the puny weapon. \u201cNot so fast now. Didn\u2019 anyone ever tell you it\u2019s not nice to be stealin\u2019 fings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWot\u2019s da ruckus out here, Blag?\u201d a second troll mumbled, stumbling out of his tent while rubbing his eyes. He pressed a finger to the side of his nose before ejecting a snot rocket to the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems we got ourselves a sneak-fief, Mag,\u201d Blag snarled and grasped his second hand around Rozenna\u2019s legs. He brought her up to his bulbous nose and inhaled deeply, sending a repulsed shudder down her spine. Things were looking worse than grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi hate tieves!\u201d Mag scratched his hanging belly and hobbled toward the campfire. \u201cWot she be stealin\u2019? She take any of our shoinies?\u201d Both trolls stared down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fink so. But I can smell some more on her,\u201d Blag turned her upside down and gently shook until her coinpurse plopped out onto the ground. Great, now they were taking her money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoice!\u201d Mag eyed her over and licked his lips. \u201cShe smells roight tasty, she does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s th\u2019pig, you git,\u201d Blag raised her higher, leveling his dim eyes with her shimmering, terrified pair. \u201cLook here, she were tryin\u2019 t\u2019steal our meat!\u201d Blag growled, glancing between the carved boar and the girl. \u201cHang on\u2026 she might be worf eatin\u2019...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoight be worth eatin\u2019, yeah!\u201d Mag licked his chops as he echoed his comrade. \u201cWant me ta bash her loights out?\u201d The troll cracked his knuckles, eyeing up the small damsel in distress. Roz went wide-eyed, flailing and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got me a better idea,\u201d Blag chuckled and brought her face mere inches from his own. \u201cEver \u2018eard of a turducken, Mag?\u201d His breath reeked something fierce, though even Roz perked a brow. What in the hell was a turducken?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA wot? Turd sammich? Sounds tasty, Blag!\u201d the dimwitted second troll wrung his hands and bobbed his head. Blag lowered the girl and ran a palm down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA turducken, you git. It\u2019s when you put a chicken inside\u2019f a duck, inside\u2019f a turkey. Then you cook up th\u2019whole fing,\u201d Blag clarified. Admittedly, it sounded delicious, albeit rather decadent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clearly more intelligent of the two trolls plucked up the cooking spit with his free hand and held it alongside the upside down thief. Glancing between the pig and the troll, Rozenna finally solved the puzzle. They weren\u2019t just going to eat her, they were going to stuff her first! Mag took a moment longer, but squealed with glee, hopping up and down. He bobbed his head in wordless agreement, and Blag grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you\u2019re hungry, sneak-fief. I\u2019m gonna stuff you like a prized pig\u2026 wif this here pig,\u201d the trolls attempts at cleverness fell short, but it was by no means an empty threat. Resting the boar on its place over the campfire, the pair of trolls immediately lashed rope around the girl\u2019s wrists and ankles, effectively hogtying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing her onto a nearby sack of flour, lest they bruise their savory meal, Blag and Mag seized the huge boar along with a carving knife and crude, wooden plate. Rozenna was in an absolute panic. These monsters were going to eat her! No amount of gold was worth this. Mikael told her the castle would be empty, and she knew how to handle the occasional trap. Trolls were a different story. Her helpless shrieking was cut short as Blag pushed the first hunk of pork between her lips. With a smelly troll hand clasped tight over her mouth, she had the options of chew or choke. The thief silently cursed Mikael before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between mouthfuls, Roz had scarcely enough time to breathe, let alone speak, until finally the more moronic of the pair stopped the feeding. \u201cHey Blag, Oi were thinkin\u2019. Wouldn\u2019t da lassie taste better if\u2019n we basted her with some of our beer?\u201d Mag beamed a dopey smile at his own brilliant idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad idea, Mag. I fink she looks a lil\u2019 firsty anyways, heh heh,\u201d Blag lowered the next fistful of pork, allowing Roz a moment of rest. Labored breaths came hastily, for her stomach now squeezed against her tight, leather armor. Why did this have to happen to her of all people? She never hurt anyone. Well\u2026 she never hurt anyone other than financially. Mag hefted a troll-sized bottle of ale in one hand, though it looked equal to at least two liters of frothy beer. Roz wriggled in her bindings, dreading the extra volume that would fill her already stuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026 I\u2019m so full already,\u201d she whined, still trying her damndest to get loose from her bindings. Blag and Mag just cackled and popped the bottle\u2019s cork. They pressed it to her lips, but when she refused to open, one of them pinched her nose. Blag kindly let her take a deep breath before shoving the bottle opening past her lips. Roz never imagined how frothy troll beer could be, but this stuff had more suds than a noblewoman\u2019s bubblebath. As the liquid surged into her stomach, she would close her throat just long enough to breathe before the unrelenting tide of alcohol continued its descent. She now looked at least three months pregnant. Each gulp expanded her middle a little more, until finally Blag bashed Mag over the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou git, don\u2019t waste it all on th\u2019lass. I\u2019m gonna want somefin\u2019 to wash me meal down later,\u201d The second troll groaned and pulled the bottleneck out of her mouth. Rozenna was experiencing the definition of a stupor. Not only was the beer more frothy than what she expected, but it also had at least double the alcohol content. Where there were two trolls, now stood four, and she rolled onto her side. The thief groaned and felt the contents of her distended stomach slosh with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s lookin\u2019 roight stuffed, ain\u2019t she, Blag?\u201d Mag chuckled and pressed a meaty finger into the poor girl\u2019s gut, forcing a deafening belch to blast from her lips. Both trolls visibly gawked at the number of decibels before turning to one another. \u201cToime to put her on the spit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You fink we\u2019re roastin\u2019 her? No way, you git. We\u2019re gonna sear this one to a nice crisp!\u201d Blag licked his chops and stretched out his hands toward Roz before Mag slapped them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re skewerin\u2019 th\u2019lil\u2019 piggy! Oi\u2019m not keen on searin\u2019 her loike a tuna,\u201d Mag growled, stamping his feet. Blag didn\u2019t say a word, but grumbled unintelligibly before slapping his dim friend upside the head. The two trolls roared and their fists flew; both brutes toppled into one of the adjacent tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her chance, and even in her booze and food-induced coma, Roz managed to finally untie her bindings. One hand scooped up her backpack, and the other clutched her belly before she finally trudged back into the woods. Each step uncomfortably sloshed the contents of her stomach, sending the boar and beer bouncing as she fled the campsite. Custom leather armor did not help ease her running, and after she was out of sight, Roz collapsed in a heap, breathing heavily. She just needed a long, long nap...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The streets and alleyways of the Lawless District are illuminated by the moonlight and the city's lanterns. A man walks through the streets, unknowingly being followed from the rooftops. The pursuer follows the man who turns a corner and into a lit doorway with a ruined wooden door. The man on streets opens the door and enters. The pursuer jumps from the rooftops and lands, his tail swinging from the impact. He enters the doorway to a tavern where his target sits on the opposite side of the room near the corner of it where a group of the same people sit, pirates. His target is a pirate, more importantly, a pirate captain. he sits at a table where the pursuer takes his hood down and sits at the bar. He casually sits so he doesn't bring attention from his target he was sent to assassinate. He looks over the small piece of paper he received from his contract who meet him in The Representative District. He reads it over and smiles when he gets to the reward at 4,600 gold and remembers the bounty on the captain's head at 45,000 gold. He was looking at a large reward which would set him for life. He puts the paper away as the captain stares in his direction with the look like he thinks he's shooting daggers out from his eyes. He tells a tavern maid something, maybe ordering rum since it is a pirate-y drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door bursts open as men with war paint on their faces, braids in their hair, and wielding claymores bigger than doors. They were loud as their bagpipes and as big as their claymores. They spoke in this accent that sounded much like their personalities. They take the bar sets making the hooded pursuer feel like he was in a ham sandwich and he was the lettuce. \"Aye, bartender,\" One of them says in his accent, \"We need a bit o' tha good stuff, so giv' us all tha mead yae got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar tender gets out the tankards as he pour the mead into them. Then one of the guys to the hooded pursuer's left asks him, \"Aye boyo, what's yae business doing here at tha bar? The milk shop be up tha street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'm here doing my business.\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOHH, so yae think youre important? Too good for us common criminals? I see how yae be.\" the guy tells him. \"Well this sword be more for decoration, I've actually killed many in the field of battle. What weapon be your usage? Your breath yae skinny, small boned, scaled, wingless dragonkin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for a man being more experienced in the field of fighting, allow me to introduce myself,\" Standing up to bow \"Kloppi, Criminal for Hire. I am experienced in stealth and cunning to make my pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahh, so yae think your skills are better than mine. Hey lads,\" he call out to the others. \"Let us introduce ourselves to this lad here. We like to call ourselves the Scotsmen; we come from our home in the highlands and live for the trill of bloody battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wish to join your group,\" Kloppi says, \"I'm more of a freelancer, I can work for you for pay but being a member of your group is something I wouldn't be inclined to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we wern't askin' for yae to join, yae would have to fill a certain profile: One, being from the highlands; two, being human; and Three, being a man. Yae don't strike off as being a man since your not human, and I doubt your from tha highlands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I may not be from your highlands, but a am male.\" Kloppi says without showing anger since he isn't angry. He is a Dragon without wings. His scales colored a darkish blue with 5 fingers on each of his hands, and 4 toes on his feet with an extection from his heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because your male don't make yae much of a man. It takes certain qualities to be a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I will love to prove you wrong,\" Kloppi starts as he sees his target is getting ready to leave. He turns to the Scotsman shoving a tankard full of mead towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well prove it.\" the Scotsman says. </span></div></div>",

He chugs it down, demanding another as he starts to feel drunk. He grabs two tankards as he chugs them down, feeling a bit more drunk. He tells the bar tender to get a whole mead barrel as he slams the empty tankards down on the countertop. The bartender comes back carrying a full mead barrel. He sets the mead barrel down where Kloppi asks one of the Scotsmen to lift it for him. One of them obliges and lifts it so that Kloppi uncorks it. Then, Kloppi puts his dragonic muzzle to where the hole for the liquid pours from. With his mouth in place, he tilts the barrel and starts drinking. As he continues to drink, Kloopi can feel his armor getting tighter as his belly distends. He loosens his armor and clothes so that he can let his stomach have room to grow. A few minutes in, Kloppi's stomach made him look like to be pregnant and was really drunk. As Kloppi finishes the mead barrel, he is so drunk he blacks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Kloppi wakes up in the city's sewer system without his armor, clothes, and weapons. He noticed that his stomach has gone down, but was still bloated. He looked around and found a few hobos were minding their own business and cooking beans over a can with fire in it. One bearded hobo with a funny hat passed Kloppi who was lying on the stones that plastered the walls and floor of the sewers. \"Excuse me,\" Kloppi said to the hobo trying to get his attention, \"How did I get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your in the sewers boy.\" The hobo told him smiling with a grin of half his teeth missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm in the sewers. But how did I get here?\" Kloppi asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You entered.\" The hobo replied hoping it was a useful answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKloppi got up and quickly his head started to hurt. \"Damn hangovers.\" He tells himself. \"Where's the exit?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always questions you have. Why not ask the Hobo King.\" The hobo tells him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, where's the Hobo King?\" Kloppi asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hobo removes his hat and puts on an even sillier hat. \"Hobo King speaking.\" The hobo claims. Kloppi looking more annoyed having met a person turns to walk away. \"And I see that you've been branded as well.\" The hobo tells Kloppi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Branded?\" Kloppi says as he turns to see that his upper buttocks has a branding mark on his left side. His face goes from confused look to a more oh-no look. \"I can't be branded,\" he thinks to himself. \"I'm a freelancer. I can't be owned by anyone.\" He further examines the mark and realizes it the one used on members of Mel-Felax's. Mel-Felax is the most noctorious crime lord in the Lawless District. Kloppi has two choices he has to make: One, stay in the city, kill his target, find the Scotsmen, and try to find out what happened in the last hours, all while trying to avoid Mel-Felax's men; or two, leave the city.</span></div></div>",

He made sure his makeshift cloak doesn't reveal the brand on him ass and tugs it to cover. He looks around and figures he's in the Lawless District's border near the Quarter's District. He knows he has to make it through the Quarter's District and two more districts before he even gets into the Gates District. So Kloppi starts through the Quarter's District.</span></div></div>",
