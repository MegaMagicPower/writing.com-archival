The head chef shouted, 'it is only an hour until serving; HURRY UP!'; you heard the head chef panicking in the kitchen for the 6th time this week; the kings food demands were getting bigger as his belly got bigger. People were charging around taking plates out and sweeping the floors and washing up pans that needed to be done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YOU BOY!' the head chef shouted at you, you walked over to him 'ummm ye...yes sir?', 'I need you to go to the kings chambers and explain that dinner preparations have fallen behind schedule and that it will be another hour'; your heart pounded, you had never been up to the kings chamber before and to tell him such news may get him angry. 'Ye...yes of course sir' you say and bow to the head chef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way out of the kitchens you see a spare plate layered with fruits, cheeses, some cold meats and bread. You grab it and run out of the kitchen and ascend the stairs towards the kings chambers. You know at this time the queen is out at this time as she usually is on a Saturday evening and the King would be eating on his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass some armed guards and explain that you have to bare news to the king. Arriving at the large doors you nervously knock lightly expecting the king not to hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Enter' you heard a voice speak from the other side; slightly muffled by the thickness of the door. As you enter the door is closed behind you. You walk through the large entrance and turn a corner to see a lavishly laid out room filled with gorgeous silks and satin's and large wooden furniture. The King is nowhere to be seen; you lay the plate down on the table and look up to see a large painting of the king in his youth; short brown hair and chiseled features and a large muscular body; topped with the crown and wrapped in quite revealing clothes; tight trousers and a shirt that opens up from the chest upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there for a moment looking at the painting and imagining the King as he is now; when suddenly someone puts there hand on your shoulder, making you jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it? </span></div></div>",

'Oh my apologies!' you turn to see the king stood there in all his beauty. You notice he is wearing the same clothes as in the painting but without the crown and a much tighter attire; his belly pushes firmly against the top and you can just see the top of it through the gap at the chest. His hair although still brown was now a lighter brown in parts due to age and his face, although still handsome showed signs of wrinkles around the eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N....no the fault is mine sire, I came to bring news on your dinner but found myself snooping around your royal chambers' you said whilst bowing. The king laughed 'that is quite alright young one; now rise' the king says placing his hand back on your shoulder. You rise and smile at the king; 'now what is this news of my dinner?' the king asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well; it shall be an hour late I'm afraid....bu...but I thought you may not be able to wait that long and have brought you a snack' You say and point to the plate covered in foods on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why; how thoughtful of you! I give you my thanks.' The King says; you stand there in silence for a moment; 'come sit, sit' the King says and gestures you to the chair you are stood near. Not wanting to disobey the king you take the seat and he takes the one opposite you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So how goes things my boy?' The King asks; as he takes three slices of meat and shovels them into his mouth; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh umm, very well thank you sir' you say, transfixed on the kings eating habits, as he takes a bite out of the large piece of bread <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good; because I would want you to tell me if any bad happens or if anything I can do to help you in anyway, I know your upbringing was very difficult and I'd like to help out in someway' the king says, you feel incredibly touched by this; that the King wanted to help you personally. You watch again as he wraps the cheeses in meat and stuff them into his mouth. He then proceeds to grab the grape bunch and put the whole thing in his mouth, he pulls it out slowly completely bare of grapes, sits back and lets out a satisfied burp. You smile and look up at the painting, the king notices this and laughs 'hard to believe its the same person sat in front of you eh?' The King says; patting his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N...no....well....I mean....that is to say' You say nervously; the king laughs again 'don't worry lad; it is my doing' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, if I didn't know who you were and I saw the comparison, then it would be hard to believe, but knowing who you are. It suits you deeply' You said and instantly covered your mouth. The king raised his eyebrow at your statement and the two of you remained quiet for a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do you have any other duties this evening?' The King asked; You instantly felt low, you let slip something so stupid and now the King was kicking you out after his loving hospitality 'ummmm....ye....yes sire' you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well not anymore you don't; you officially have the evening off, I shall be asking the staff to bring the food up here if you care to join me? I mean with the Queen out till tomorrow evening, the company would be most grand' the King said, 'yes!' you say instantly; the King laughs 'I...mean, that would be fantastic, thank you my lord!' You say. 'Not at all' the King says, he proceeds to stand up and walk to the chamber doors, he starts talking to one of the guards outside and re-enters. You can't help but notice the fullness of his belly already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king looks at you 'the feast shall be on its way' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before they passed away they used to let me play with the animals.\" you say comforted by the King's fatherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that they truly loved you. If it wasn't for my daughter, Marissa then we wouldn't have found you. Yet she's always been an adventurous young lady.\" said the King as he looked at a painting of him and Marissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is Marissa?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine. She still can't decide who to marry. Yet word has spread that she likes a certain someone.\" said the King in a joking manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought makes you blush. It was almost too hard for you to believe. Yet it does make sense since she has been acting weird around you lately. Yet the idea of being a son of the King made your heart almost skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the one that she likes. I can see why she likes you. Out of all the servants you are the most well-built. It's no wonder why the servant girls giggle when they see you.\" said the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is then a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" said the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the food is being brought in you see...</span></div></div>",

He looks at you and gives you a look of jealously as he is forced to push such a huge cart of food into the Kings chamber where the two of you are sitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops and says 'sire, I have brought you your food for the evening. Please accept my humble apology for its tardiness but we were down a pair of hands' he says, glancing at you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King senses this jealousy and soon states 'that will be all thank you, my regards to the head chef' before waving the servant away. The servant looks in shock and then storms out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I apologise if my asking you to stay here causes you any issues. If anything arises then please let me know' The king says and places his hand on your shoulder, 'thank you your majesty' you feel privileged that the King treats you with such kindness compared to anyone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now. Let us feast!' The king said as he pulled the cart over and began to feed, you watch in awe as the king gobbles up chicken, beef, fish, fruit and cheeses. He allows you to eat any food you wish, but as a servant you only take enough to fill you moderately, you want the rest to be inside the King's belly, which had begun to round out and tighten his attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity for you as you watched the King eat everything. He leaned back in his chair and let out a satisfied belch 'a meal fit for a king' he said as he patted his ample sphere. He stands up and you get a great view of how round his belly is, he undoes his belt which causes it to push out further and bounce up and down slightly. His top rising slightly as you see a tiny bit of rounded flesh poking out from underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king notices your gaze fixated on his round middle, 'I apologise but I may have one duty for you' the king says in a kind manner. 'Ye..yes my lord?' You say, the king then walks over to you and with a flash he removes his tight top, his stuffed belly bouncing up and down and wobbling to a stop 'I wish for you to rub my belly' the King says and gives it a smack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ye...yes my lord!' You say with vigor, you place your hands on it and begin to rub. It feels firm yet soft at the same time, 'the Queen does not approve of my current size, what do you think young one?' The King asks, 'well...umm, that is to say...I do sire' you say nervously, 'thank you for your honesty...I approve of my size too...part of me...part of me wishes for me to just eat and grow larger' He said as you notice his hand rub in circles on his belly, but you also notice a growth in his pants, 'well...as king, you must show power. A large belly is a sign of power, growing it bigger would certainly show you are a powerful ruler' you say as the king closes his eyes, 'yes...a great big fat powerful ruler...That would be incredible' The king says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in front of you the King appears to be turned on by this situation, your desire begins to stir as well as this is something you have always dreamed of but what if this is not what the king wants? It could be rewarding but also dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

She's tall and has brown hair and emerald eyes. She blushes upon seeing you and you blush as well. She was carrying a cherry pie. It wasn't a surprise that whispers about having a crush on you were spreading among the servants. Even though you admired the king as a father figure you definitely couldn't help yourself around Marrisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ideas of marrying Marrisa floated in your mind. If you married her then the king would become your father and spending some father-son time over a meal with the king stuffing himself definitely turned you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a cherry pie father. I know mother may not like it when you overeat, but I think it's cute. A man with a big belly is definitely a man of great power.\" Marrisa said as she handed her father the pie and lovely rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start getting turned on as Marrisa rubbed the king's belly. Two of your people having an intimate time of bonding almost made you want to squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarrisa turns towards you causing you to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), would you come with me? I'm sure my father would like some personal time.\" Marrisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice the king lovingly rub his belly as he took a bite of the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Marrisa.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then walk out of the king's room and follow Marissa into the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Name), I have a favor to ask.

The thought of watching the King eat and grow fatter made you joyful. This is probably due to the fact that you were an orphan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something up boy? You look like that you were in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then explain to the king what you were thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatter? You want me to grow fatter? I'm not opposed to the idea, but does this have something to do with being an orphan? I'll do it if it makes you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped for joy as the King agreed to your idea.
