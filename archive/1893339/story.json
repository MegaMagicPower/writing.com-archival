Then you remember, you had passed out when some guy offered you a drink, saying it would be the best thing you ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now where am I?\" things don't look quite like they should, but you can't put your finger on why. you almost fall 100 feet when you don't notice the edge of the metal surface you are standing on. you look around and see there are dozens of identical giant metal containers in a rough square. you look down to the ground and see about five giant platforms, raised by large pillars. You look up and see the sun is in the middle of the sky. Wherever you were, it was noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seeing all of this didn't quite add up. Why were you here of all places? Was this some kind of cargo facility for ships? And why did the overall layout look so familiar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had seen something like this place before, but where? Docks usually had cranes, and it would take a fleet of massive ships to take these containers where ever they needed to be taken. and those platforms on the ground didn't exactly look like cutting edge loading technology, they looked more like benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenches?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you. You knew what this place reminded you of. A locker room, like those at a swimming pool. Those platforms were benches, but too massive or tall for any normal person to sit on. and the metal containers, they were the lockers, but could easily have a hundred people stuffed inside. You look up and realize that wasn't the sun, it was a light-bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had you realized this, you heard voices and laughter. Suddenly, a door you hadn't noticed before opened and dozens of very attractive young women that you recognized instantly from all the video games you played, and the mangas and anime you've read and watched; poured in, wearing only bathing suits. The sound of the metal lockers opening and banging shut was almost deafening at your scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground, or rather, the locker you were standing on, shook as someone opened it to get their clothes. You almost faint from blushing as these twenty-to-thirty giant girls undress and put their clothes on. You notice a clothes basket at the bottom of the locker next to yours, you slowly make your way over there.</span></div></div>",

I just want to get out of here,\u201d you plead, but Peach doesn\u2019t seem to be listening. She suddenly thrusts you down into her gym bag and zips it up hastily. As you struggle to stand, you feel clothing beneath you shift. You eventually reach your feet, but not for long, and you fall down on to what feels like a pair of silk panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach\u2019s muffled voice comes from outside the bag.

One wall had a lot of sports trophies. Some trophies had decorations that only could be from the mushroom kingdom. Others seemed to have decorations that were from other video game series and even a few anime ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wall had several bookshelves. Some shelves had many books. Others had pictures or models. There was even a large dollhouse version of her castle on a bottom shelf.

The woman who was carrying you was on the other side of the large attic in what seemed an impossibly short time. she lifted a panel and peeked into the room below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Apparently satisfied with the surrounding, she jumped down. you were in a womans bathroom. she approached the door, then remembered you were still in her hand, she reached behind herself and unzipped a small sack just above her waist and put you in, she then zipped it back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    you are once again is a small space, but at least not pressed against a giant woman. the sack swings side to side as the woman walks, in sync with her hips. eventually, you hear a door close and the sack opens, and, once again, you are pulled out by a giant hand, but this time, placed on a small table, that the woman kneels next to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I guess i should introduce myself at least, my name is Marino, and, as you probably heard, i'm a professional treasure hunter; but i've never seen a person quite as puny as you.\" she says as she pokes you in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You don't quite like being called 'puny' or getting poked like a fish bowl, so you swat at her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh, you don't like that?\" Marino says teasingly as she pokes at you some more. You back up, not wanting to be poked, but the finger which is almost as thick as you, clips you on the shoulder and you fall to the ground. Before you can get back up, Marino holds you down with the one finger. \"1,2,3, your down for the count,\" she says playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you struggle to get free of the giantess' finger, you catch sight of her, comparitively, massive chest, but quickly look away. \"I saw that,\" Marino says, \"I guess my breasts would be pretty hard to miss at your size.\" she moves closer to you slowly as she moves her finger and hand to the end of the small table. You start to crawl backwards, \"What the matter? you don't want to see'em close up?\" she says as her body rises and she holds her self over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You look up as the massive mounds are almost directly above you, then they slowly descend upon you.

One good poke and she could accidently cave in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we play a little game?.\" Marino said coyly, with an alluring, but mischief-filled, smile. You started getting a little anxious. she stood up and walked across the room, her rear wiggling more than it probably did normally. she stopped, her back still to you. She put her hand on her hip and spread her legs abit. You knew she was messing with your head, but you can't take your eyes off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent over to grab somtheing on a shelf, bending only her upper body to give you a good long look at rear in the contour-hugging spandex-like material. she apparently finds what she was eroticly looking for and slowly straightens out. she turns around and holds up a hexagonal piece of metal, about an inch in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Force-metal grants the user super-human abilities for a brief time. If you can reach it, you can have it.\" she picks you and places you on her bed. \"this way, you probably won't get hurt.\" you swallow at the 'probably'. \"All you have to do, is climb me and reach my face without falling off. That's easy enough, right?\" she grinned playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarino lay across her bed in an alluring pose, with her head in her hand at the top of her elbow. she leveled out her head and placed the force metal on the side of her brow. \"No shortcuts, you'll have to start at my ankle. If you fall because I moved, I'll put you back where you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way across the bed and reach her right ankle. you climb up and attempt to find your balance, but end up hugging against her leg and pulling yourself along. when you reach her knee you have to climb up on top of her left knee to stay on top of Mt. Marino. you walk along her steadily rising and widening thigh and find yourself practicly standing on her well toned ass. you look towards your goal and see her looking at you with the best she can with out moving, and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little annoyed that she finds this humorous, but you're not really able to say anything at this point and simply carry on. From where you are, you notice continuing along her side would meet with her shoulder, and that would be pretty difficult to get over, and down with out falling. You then notice the side of her breast is almost level with her neck, and then the rest would be easy. It was win/win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously traverse over her thigh and reach the side of ther abdomen. she seemed well toned, but a quick stability test showed you wouldn't be able to stand on that part. so you slid yourself along her hip as you did her lower leg. once you reach her ribs, you were able to stand up. you walk along them, using the available wall that was her left arm for support. when you first tried to step out on to her breast, the soft gland sank under it. You quickly pulled back your leg and try to think of another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Marino giggling in her throat at your awkwardness. You regain your composure and press on by crawling along the side of her breast to get around her shoulder and reach her neck. You slowly make you way along her neck, reaching for the force metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuddenly you're picke up by her hand and she retrieves the force Metal herself. \"Nice going. Don't worry, you won the prize.\" she said after you gave an incredulous look. \"I just thought of something else we could do.\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't too hard, honestly. You were actually looking forward to this womans gradually-more-mutual 'fun'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you in her open hand, she headed into her bathroom. \"I know you've probably gotten excited, but I do have dignity, you'll have to wait in here.\" said Marino as she stacked two toilet paper rolls on top of one another, and dropped you into the hole. It was snug, dark, and you coughed from the sudden, overwhelming smell of cardboard. You look up to the only exit, and hear her start the water. then you hear her start to hum some tune, she could have been one of those people who sang in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well this sucks' you think to yourself. Then a thought crossed your mind, you were surrounded by paper. not even paper made for writing, but soft, disposable, and very light, toilet paper. without any room to kneel or back up, you throw yourself at each side of your cardboard blinder, but it's like hitting dry wall, it doesn't hurt, but it won't budge. You realize that this is a full roll, and the bottom is very wide, preventing any kind of force you could muster from toppling it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsuddenly, the ground starts sliding from under your feet, the ony reason your feet don't get caught by the bottom of the roll is how snug you were against the tube. Then the ground disappears and you can feel your self slowly sliding down, but then you feel a new ground with a different texture, sort of gritty, and more flexible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe top roll disappears from sight as Marino picks it up, she picks up the others roll, but notices you come with it. she then lightly shook the tube to try and get you out, but you yelped after third time from the rug burn you were getting from the cardboard sides. she apparently heard you because she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your feet were out of the tube and looked down to confirm it. a second later, two fingers the as thick as you chest grab your feet, then you feel the tube being pulled up as you're held in place. To cut on the rugburn, Marino was pullng the tube slowly. Finally, the smell of cardboard wafted away and you could see light all around you once more. You looked around and saw you were in a square tupperware bowl, then glanced out into the water, only to meet moderate disappointment when you discover the surface of the water is covered by bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour disappoinment must have been visible, as you heard Marino chuckle. \"Aww, were hoping for something? Like I said, I have dignity, but not enough modesty.\" she said reaching for you. She plucked at your shirt and was able to pull it off, then she tipped you over and pulled at your pants, but they fit too well. \"Would you mind unbuttoning that, and go ahead and remove the rest yourself?\" she said with a hint of impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she says and put your shoes, socks, pants, and underwear in a small pile, which Marino wisks away and puts it on top of the counter leaving completely exposed in a plastic bowl. She simply looked at you, grinning, like you were some newly obtained award. It disturbed you to think of it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarino then had a look of realization. She cupped her hands and put them in the water, lifted them out and hovered them over your head. Then she let loose a reletive bathtub full of water on your head, it was so much at once you fall to your knees. The taste of soap fillls your mouth and you spit in an attempt to get it out. \"There, now we're really taking a bath together.\" she said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait in your bowl as she teasingly washes herself. The possible highlight was when she lifted each of her legs, aligning them right next to the bowl to wash them. close enough to touch, but too close to mean you were allowed to. once she had washed her back, she looked at you, all the while grinning coyly as she lathed the rag. Your heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe next several minutes were filled by ignored attempts at privacy, and semi-rough scrubbing. when she was done, you were too tired to stand and sank into the water of your personal bath. You noticed the bubbles were starting to disappear, \"You don't have to get your hopes up, I'm done in here.\" came Marino's voice. You aren't sure what she meant by that, but you quickly stop thinking as she rises out of the water, her incredibly seductive body finally bared for you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up her slender, but solid legs to her perfect thighs, and see a squarish patch of teal hair between her legs. You continue your visual tour up her abdomen and see her supple breasts, which you had the pleasure of feeling not too long ago. You finally reach her face after a prolonged stop, and notice she is smiling the same mischievous smile she had been giving you since you were snuck into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got another game we could play.\" said Marino as she lifted you out of the tupperware bowl.she walked into her room, still puite naked, and set you back on the table. then went to a drawer. she pulled it out and walked back to the table, where she dumped the contents. fortunately, it was all underwear, either very revealing, or made of silk or cotten. You were able to find your way to the top of this pile of unmentionables to see Marino turning around, holding a black sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's how this game will work, I'll try on underwear while blindfolded and you try avoiding the pair i'm grabbing.\" She lifted the sash around her eyes. \"Or stay right where you are, either way, you win.\" she chuckled as she tied the sash around her eyes and tightened it.</span></div></div>",

By the looks and feel of it, this must be a bra. It's gonna make for an uncomfortably comfortable experience, but probably a more suitable fate than being caught in a pair of panties... at least in your current size, anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could've ran. You could've jumped out of the way. Hell, you could've ran from the pile of clothes to the door while Marino was still blindfolded. Yet you didn't. Why? Maybe you felt like a deer caught in a pair of headlights. Maybe you didn't want to risk upsetting your humongous captor. Or maybe you had something else in mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the blindfolded giantess' hands came down around you. After feeling the bra under you a little, she finally picked it up off the pile and strapped around her bare chest... with you caught in the middle of it!<br>\r\nThe tightness of the cotton behind you followed by the soft tender flesh of her boob smothering you almost to the point where you can't breathe proved to be too much for your tiny body to take!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the uncomfortable feeling in her right breast did not go unnoticed by Marino herself. The moment she took off her sash, she looked down at the tiny man in her grasp and smiled. \"Well... looks like you won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MPHMMM UBMM BA DALLLGHHH!!\" you shouted with your full of boob!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. Hang on!\" with just two fingers, she carefully rearranged her bra and pushed out of the smothering range, but leaves you pinned rather tightly right in the middle of her cleavage. Sure you had room to move around, but you were too bashful to do so!<br>\r\n\"Better?\" she asked with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to adjust yourself between the two humongous pillows you were trapped in while stuttering, \"Uh....I...um....err....ul.....thanks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! So you CAN talk after all!\" Marino seems obviously intrigued over the fact that you're not mute, \"Why the silent treatment the whole time? ...You dont like me?\" she even puffed up her lips and gave you sad puppy-dog eyes, mocking you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont answer her question. You shivered a little just uttering the 'thanks'! It felt as if you dug yourself even deeper into the ditch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. Did I get a tic-tac stuck in my cleavage or are you just happy to see me?\" Oh hell! Apparently shivers werent the only side-effect from terror! Despite your size, that little happy friend between your legs didn't go unnoticed by the playful treasure hunter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UM!!! Uh....uh...\" you build up the courage to talk as you try to cover your crotch with your arms, \"C...M..May I have my clothes back, please?\"<br>\r\nShe just puts a hand to her hip and raises an eyebrow at you, \"Aww... what's wrong? A highly experienced and undeniably beautiful treasure hunter such as myself too much for a tiny little pervert like you to handle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W..What?\"<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd enjoy all this attention youre getting!\" Marino remarked as she slipped on a pair of black satin panties from the clothes pile, \"Isnt that what you wanted... sneaking into all girl's dorm like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I NEVER SNUCK IN!\" you actually shouted, nearly throwing your uneasyness out the window, \"I just woke up here. Somebody must've dragged me and brought me here, let alone shrunk me down to THIS size!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" Marino hmphed as she slipped on a black short skirt, \"You're an even worse trickster than that third-rate ninja girl! Not to mention a lot 'PUNIER'!\" she mocked you AGAIN with that word you hate being referred to as!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you know how to pick your battles. \"Look! Just tell me how to get out of this dorm and I'll gladly get out of your cleava-uh, HAIR!\"<br>\r\nHer mischievous grin appeared as she slipped on a black zip-up vest, \"Sorry. Shoulda thought of that before you snuck into our 'forbidden garden'. Therefore, I'm gonna make the punishment fit the crime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch. Now you definitely wish you hadn't opened your big mouth! It looks like you're gonna be Marino's property a little longer. Oh, the possibilities of what a gigantic agile woman like her could do to a puny little bug like yourself!<br>\r\n\"W..w.w....what you plan on doing with me?!!\" you ask, knowing you're gonna regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That all depends. Can you magically grow yourself about a hundred times your size for at least ten minutes?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... no.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, so much for THAT idea,\" Marino pouted disappointedly, \"....HOWEVER... it just so happens that I'm also a professional guardian for hire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuardian for hire?<br>\r\n\"Guardian for hire?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" she smiled rather proudly as she began to zip up her vest, \"I am well-trained in securing and protecting the very lives of poor unfortunate clients in desperate need and are willing to purchase my services. I guarantee you that no harm will come to you by anyone's hand... especially the OTHER girls... as long as I remain your guardian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she offering to be your bodyguard?! \"Gotta warn you though,\" Marino grinned, \"good service like mine doesnt come cheap!\"<br>\r\n\"How much?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"For now, it's free of charge!\" Before you could say yes, the zipper of her vest stopped JUST inches below you, \"At least until I can think of a suitable method of payment! So, do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA suitable method of payment, she said? You're not exactly sure how you can pay for her 'services', but as of now you could use protection. If any of the girls of this dorm are like Marino.... youre gonna need ALL the help you can get!</span></div></div>",

They moved away from the table, making a jump maim-worthy. You were caught in the middle as though it were a hammock. then her first foot came down on your left, then her other to your right. You saw her calves getting closer and closer and looked up to see the small patch of teal hair once more. Then everything was cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, feels like I've caught a winner,\" you hear Marino say as what is most likely her hand press against your silk, cotton, and flesh prison. Your face in her neatly trimmed hair, and your pelvis being pushed into her opening. You heard her moan some, \"Well, maybe I oculd make you a perminant resident? What do ya' think?\" You thought you were becoming claustrophobic, but you didn't have the air to yell that to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard a knock from Marino's door, \"Come in!\" your captive responded to your dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marino, I...Oh, i'm sorry, I didn't realize you were changing.\" said a mystery woman with an all-business kind of voice. \"Don't worry about it, It's not like we haven't seen one another in the spring.\" You heard Marino reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask if you would be joining us for dinner. Aerith, Mana, and Cinnimon are almost finished.\" the woman said, seeming unphased by the theifs reply. \"yeah, I'll be down in a bit, Samus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll see you there.\" You hear her take a step or two but Marino calls back to her, \"Wait, could I ask you in here for a bit?\" You were jostled abit as her legs moved next to you. You hear more footsteps, then the door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You hear Samus ask. \"I was just wondering, being a Reploid and all, I wanted to know a bit about humans...intimate rituals.\" You think to yourself, 'Why ask that now?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" you hear Samus reply in the same serious voice. \"Well, I just thought you could show me what Humans do to pleasure one another, I have my ideas, but I am just a Reploid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't participate in sexual activites, especially with other women.\" the Bounty hunter said. \"But if you think about it, I'm not a woman. I just look like one. It wouldn't even count as homosexuality, more like...well, I don't know what term you'd use, but It couldn't be called sex. And besides, it would be a learning experience on my part.\" Such a technicality would stand in a court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a length of silence as your captors guest seemed to be contemplating such the theifs logic.</span></div></div>",

While she was busy mocking her neighbor, You were making for a breath of fresh air, and hopefully a way out of her little-too-friendly clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you think your going?\" you look up to see Marino looking down at your exposed head, peeking out of the top of her, rather comfortable, underwear. \"Am I going to have lock you in your 'room?\" she said holding up the spandex-like material. You had a hard enough time getting the neccesary air with out being constricted into her crotch, though you noticed a distinct lack of odor. You guessed being an artificial human, they didn't install the various kinds of glands that make the detering smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But's it's hard to breath, being held so close against you.\" You tell your captor who started pulling at the straps of your lacy prison. \"Well, You'll just have to live with it until after dinner, cause I'm not missing a meal just over you.\" she leaning over ato grab a pair of blue jeans, \"But, I'll take it easy on you, these are loose-fit jeans, as long as you don't try to get away, you get fresh air whenever you need it, just don't bring attention to yourself.\" she said slipping them on.

It might have had something to do with the love/hate realtionship you were developing towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Marino headed off to the dining room, while you were jostled between her moving legs, but kept in place by your silk and cotton bindings</span></div></div>",

Strangely enough, it's as soft and cozy as a nice warm blanket. Just what type of fabric material is her hair made out of, anyway...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, you tried to peek a little through the waist of the jeans, but because of the constant swing of direction from her legs moving back and forth with each step she makes, it's hard to stay still long enough to get a good looking. The only that could remotely catch was that one big blue firefly that zipped past your field of vision in a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like youre gonna have to wait patiently for Marino to her finish dinner... speaking of which, the movement finally stopped. The quick shift of gravity downwards told you she just sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good news,\" you overheard your captor tell you, \"no one else is here Looks like it's just you and me tonight!\" You ushered a slight sigh of relief as you peaked out of her jeans, \"So... will you let me out of... here, now?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" she crammed you back down her jeans with a single finger, \"cant take any chances. But if you keep quiet in there like a good boy, I might slip you a treat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as try to get comfortable against the silk binding trying to gag you and away from that uncomfortable comfortable teal 'rug' beneath you. Seconds seem like hours as you wait for her to finish whatever meal an artificial being such as her would eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, you'd wonder just why a machine-made woman such as Marino would be programmed to eat human food... that is, if the silk and cotton strap of her panties wasnt cutting the blood flow to your brain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you like steak!\" you heard Marino's voice call out. She was even staring down at you in her pants as she said it. She cut a tiny slice off and lowered it down to you. No good refusing her generous off at this point. You are at an 'awkward' position!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou graciously accepted and took several bites of the piece. You could sense her eyes were staring down at you while you were trying to eat. Despite the uncomfortable, you paid it no mind and finished up your share of the steak. Finally after swallowing the last piece, Marino quickly got up out her seat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now that that's out of the way, let's-\"<br>\r\nMarino stopped in mid-sentence. Her look of carefreeness quickly changed to caution.<br>\r\n\"Uh... what's wro-\"<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" she shushed you, \"...we're being watched!\"<br>\r\n*zip!* Just then, you saw something zip across Marino's face!

Hey, wasnt that firefly-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ZZZZIIPPPP!!* In a heartbeat, you were blinded for another split-second and the next you knew, a strong gust of wind swooped you out of Marino's pants and sent you flying in the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven worse, whatever blew you out from your under Marino is still blowing you as far from her as possible!<br>\r\nIt's not the wind.

Good news is, they both look at you, bad news is, they don't want your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!\" they both call out at diferent levels of deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Marino, this isn't something you want to do, you're just being a little...\" You try to think what your last words could be, \"Well, I doubt you want to KILL someone over me, do you? I'm just some guy who woke up in a locker, got kidnapped by a teenage ninja, then kidnapped by a robot...ninja,\" you shake your head and almost facepalm yourself at how it all sounded, \"I was bound to be discovered by someone sooner or later, whether by Yuffie, or someone else by accident, I mean, you couldn't have expected me to LIVE in your underwear could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence later, \"Do you really think crushing a faerie is something a Reploid would do? That sounds a bit Maverick, to me.\" you say, hoping that her worlds logic might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Marino's face seemed to soften, her eyes moving as she read your words in her head. She sighed, then looked to Navi in her fist, \"Promise not to tell?\"<br>\r\nNavi glared at her, \"Promise to listen?\" They both made an unsaid agreement, and Marino released her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi fluttered down to your level, you noticed right away that she was almost as tall as you, the top of her head about level with your eyes, and her form completely revealed, dispite being as bright as a tanning bed. you noticed Navi holding her sides, \"Are you okay?\" you ask, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing I can't handle, Faeries recuperate very quickly. I'll be back to normal in a minute.\" she said with a slight groan. From her pained face, you see her crack a smile, and try to cover it up as she looked the other way. You wonder what's so funny when you feel an invasive draft go over your equally exposed body. The return of your happy little friend was the joke. You freak and assume many odd postures to block yourself from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavi turned to Marino, chuckling, \"You didn't even give him underwear?\"<br>\r\nMarino returned with a smirk, \"What can I say, he's a nudist.\"<br>\r\n\"Could we please go back to your room at least! Someone might come back!\" you call out, hiding yourself with a bottlecap you found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, gonna put him in you underwear again?\" Navi inquired.<br>\r\n\"Why? Wanna join him?\" Marino rebuttled.<br>\r\n\"Please, I don't know where you...\" she remembers the agreement, \"I'll just meet you up there.\" Navi says in a sigh before shooting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, roomy, in your 'bunk'\" Marino said, reaching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost wish you could walk there yourself.</span></div></div>",

Then everything turned upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid up...er, down the giantesses body and with nothing to grab but the edge of her panties, you cling for dear life as you slip out of her underwear and dangle some 70 feet in the air as Marino is upside down standing on her hands. \"Hi! just thought I'd get some stretching in before bed, You're welcome to stay.\" Marino said all too cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hung there, suspended stories from your demise, Marino's left leg lowered to you, practically 90 degrees, her other leg bent backwards. though you couldn't see behind her, you guessedit also bent nearly 90 degrees back. After a moment, her leg straigtened upward and you could see both legs, then she started to spread her legs to either side, and witness as her legs became almost level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt your gravity shifting compared to Marino, and noticed you were getting closer to the ground. Marino was holding herself up with just her arms as she spun her body back around to be right-side up. Her legs were still spread and were parallel to the ground when the sudden jolt of her body stopping made you lose your grip, fortunately, you only fell a couple inches, so it didn't really hurt. You turn onto your back and sit up, then look up to see a sky of white cloth fall onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs were pinned completely and the front of Marino's all-too-familiar crotch covered almost up to your shoulders. You look up and just make out your all-too-friendly captor looking down at you, with a smile that was sincerely mischievous. \"I would get up, but i'm already in my position for the last of my stretches, I'm sure you can wait just a minute or two.\" she said before leaning forward as far as she could without rolling her legs and held herself there for several seconds, all the while, you're on virge of being smothered by her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally sat up, but your relief was short lived as her legs came together, making a rather small triangle that supllied you with neccesary air, but through that hole you see Marino stretching forward, then sitting up, then stretching forward, then sitting up. She repeated this process another 48 times. you counted since you didn't have anything else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her knees bent back and she lifted herself off the ground, and you were free, that is until she picked you up again. \"TIme for bed, squirt.\"</span></div></div>",

I made you a little bed!\" she dropped into a small little black box on her shelf with a couple of small white cushions inside it. Which was good, because that was all you had to break your fall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not very cozy, but compared to your OTHER 'room', it was fit for a king! Since it's probably gonna be the closest thing to comfort for a while for you, you lie down and accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy?\" Marino's head and smiling down at you from above outside that box. You just sigh and nod, despite your head was still aching from the stretches.<br>\r\n\"Good. Now get a good night sleep,\" she tells you, \"We got a big day bright and early tomorrow. I just hope that little firefly doesnt pull anything!\"<br>\r\nYou wouldnt be surprised if Navi does. However, you are still thankful Marino didnt kill her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, she flipped off the light switch and lied down on her bed, pulling the covers over here. \"Nighty-night, shrimp!\" you heard her call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night,\" you answer back... just before muttering, \"maverick!\" under your breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt so alone, inside that little box. Shrunk to such a very small size, confined with possibly three captors that took claim of you. One currently has you. As you slowly drifted off to sleep, you couldnt help but wonder if you'd ever see the outside of the dorm ever again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you managed to fall asleep pretty easy (probably because of the 'busy day' earlier!), you tossed and turned in your sleep. You just couldnt get in a right state of mind to slip into a dream state, because your body was itching all over. You wanted to scratch, but you couldnt move your arms! It felt like a million ants were crawling all over your skin and there wasnt a damn thing you could do to get them off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the itching, the space around your body began to feel even tighter. It felt like you were being squeeze into a very small space. Any second, your body would bust that space open!<br>\r\nAnd then, just seconds later, the itching and tightness just instantly stopped. Everything was back to normal again! 'What was that all about?' you wondered. But by that time, you started to wake up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the lack off space under your legs, they seemed to be leaning over something. The somewhat comfy cushions under you were gone and replaced with cold hard wood! The room around you looked nothing like that box... it looked exactly like Marino's room, only much much smaller. There was even a Marino doll your size sleeping on that mini-bed in the opposite corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait a sec. That aint a doll! Most importantly, youre no longer the size of her bright blue pupil anymore! After a while of measuring yourself, you finally came to a conclusion and smiled brightly because of it.... YOURE BIG AGAIN!!<br>\r\n'Im big! I'm big again!' you thought to yourself as you celebrated in your mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait. Before you could start jumping for joy, other thoughts came to your mind. HOW did you get back to normal size? Was the shrinkage temporary... or is THIS temporary? Regardless, you didnt wanna stick around to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you looked back at your former-captor still fast asleep in her big cozy bed. As much as you admired her beauty, you still remembered the hell she put you through! Oh, if she could just see you now! And OH, how you wanted to pay Marino back for those pleasant trips to Crotchville!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wanted to yank that long teal ponytail off and part of you wanted to pin her to that bed and have your way with her until she short-circuited! But you dared not act out either! Marino is practically a ninja-type Reploid. And trying to 1up a ninja is the equivalent to stomping on a nest full of yellowjackets while naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, now that youre bigger, youre in a bigger predicament! Youre a naked man stuck in an all girl's dorm! What do you think would happen if you got caught?! At least back when you were small, you could be more discreet. Now youre just a crazy pervert that snuck into an all girl's dorm! Imagine the headlines...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDAMN! You flew out of one mess only to fall into another! Now what are you gonna do? The only 'friends' you have in this dorm are Marino and Navi and you really dont trust either of them. But youre gonna need some sort of help if youre gonna get out alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But then AGAIN, what if your growth IS only temporary?</span></div></div>",

All in all, Marino hadn't been that bad a host, you were just too vulnerable at your previous size. though you might not have been in a much better position now, so you kneeled next to Marino's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when a thought accurd. What If Marino didn't recognize you right away? Reploids had super-human strength, so crushing your windpipe wasn't out of reach. Literally! You thought about calling her name to wake her up, maybe try to explain the situation while she was coming out of r.e.m. sleep, but then you wondered if reploids had r.e.m. sleep. Tapping her on the cheek might be a bit easier, since you were small and her bed was within jumping distance of the table you had slept on. You had considered more...lude methods, but you decided against being disemboweled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scooted back just enough to where you could poke Marino's cheek at arms length, just incase she decided to pummel you first and inspect later. Gingerly, but decisively you prodded her cheekbone, trying not to rock her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Marino starting to come around, inhaling deeply for what ever reason she needed to. \"Well hello to you too.\" She said in a just-woke-up voice, her hand reaching yours and wrapping around it as her tired eyes feebley opened. This was the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you head turned partially, you watched in anxiety as she looked at the hand, a bit confused, then followed the arm to your face. You could tell she was still half asleep, but as her thoughts cleared out of sleep-mode, a look of shock dawned on her. You see her arm stretch out towards you quickly and close your eyes as you flinch...</span></div></div>",

Noticing you hadn't moved, and not wanting Ryoko to question why, she pulled you next to her, \"We were just playing...strip freeze tag! Just something we came up with last night. It's okay, honey, you can introduce yourself to my friend.\" she said her voice growing more intense as she completed her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to snap yourself out of it, \"Uhh...nice to...finally meet you Ryoko.

See ya!\" she floated away, smiling slyly as she closed Marino's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Marino sighed deeply in relief. \"Well, that went alright, don't you think?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know Ryoko was a Space Pirate, and how in HELL did you know about Ryo-Ohki?\" Marino asked, cutting right to chase.</span></div></div>",

Just then, she snaps out of and let go of your neck! \"S...sorry!\" she flinched, \"dont know what came over me!\"<br>\r\n\"N...no problem!\" you stuttered as you rubbed your neck. Yikes, again. And there's plenty more where that came from in this dorm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore more 'fun' could unravel, Marino took a look at her clock.<br>\r\n\"Oh great! I'm gonna be late for Athletics!!\" she gasped as she dashed through her closet, pulling out clothes, \"How am I gonna explain this to Ms. Clanclan?!

Sure, she'll be right back but still!<br>\r\nOnce again, you were alone... all alone in a big scary place where someone like you does not belong. You tried to keep calm about this whole situation. After all, at least you werent small anymore! Yet, while dont you feel much better about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you could almost overhear laughter coming from behind you... a lightly high-pitched feminine laughter echoing from afar. It felt like it was laughing at YOU. But there's no one else in the room, is there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the mirror and saw the reflection of the window.... You could see someone standing on the roof of a building. A white-haired figure in a black dress wearing a white mask. Although it was far away, you see glowing yellow eyes not covered by that mask staring toward your direction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it see you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turned around and looked out the window.... but by then, it was gone! No masked figure up on the roof.<br>\r\n\"W...weird,\" you said to yourself. Could someone really be watching you?<br>\r\n\"It's gotta be just my imagination,\" you shook your head as you closed the curtains. Yet... you still had a very bad feeling about it.

She had several chests with objects you assumed once belonged to someone else, and a rack of various twin knives, many of which you recognized from the Command Mission game. You took a gander inside her closet to see a rack of her clothes, and in a standing case you found her outfit from the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door made you jump as you spun into the closet and carefully closed it. It had slants so you could look out. A familiar voice followed the knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marino, are you in there?\" you recognize Samus' voice from last night. the knob shook but it was locked. You give a small sigh of relief, but the click of a tumbler came to your attention in the reletive silence. You look up and watch as Samus steps in cautiously. she was wearing the blue two-piece suit from some of the game endings with high enough completion rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll take a quick look around the room to see if her 'collection' has grown. The other's might not care about her proffesion, but I will not let a Thief live here unchecked.\" you watched as Samus opened and closed the chests in rapid succesion, as though she had memorized the contents of each one before. She hesitated once or twice, but only enough that you could notice. \"Nothing of note, but I'll need to compare those doll clothes to others on the market.\" You knew she was talking about your original outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the closet is left.\" you want to say 'Shit!' but you squeeze behind the standing case as best you can, before the closet door opens. You don't dare try and peek around the corner, Samus was all business, with super-human abilities due to her transfused Chozo blood and training, you'd be better off not raising the ire of a feared and respected Bounty Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there for at least a minute without so much as blinking or breathing before you heard Samus say \"Nothing here, she's getting better.\" you see her shadow disappear from against the light from outside, and give a small sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're spun around so suddenly it hurt when you stopped, and you felt yourself hit a wall with your chest. your arms hurt badly, most likely because Samus was holding both of your wrists between your shoulder blades with one hand. You cry in pain a couple times, having never stretched that way and you could feel your back cramping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? What do you want?\" Samus demanded. All that came out when you tried to respond were yelps of pain. Samus eased her grip then spun you once more and threw you on to the ground. You feel her boot place it self between your shoulders as she kneeled on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, Who are you?\" through small gasps, you give your name. \"What are you doing in here, and answer truthfully, the only reason you're not through that window is because I'm in a good mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-I'm a friend of Marino's.\" you answer to a level of honesty, \"She...She snuck me into her room.\" also true, but not totally accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me to stay in her room and not to answer her door, but when you tried to come in, I hid.\" Not completely the truth as you were already hiding when she broke in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her get off of you, \"Sit up.\" you respectfully oblige. \"back against the shelf.\" she tells you, refering to the cabinet behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus crouches infront of you and examines you carefully. You eye her physique while trying to avoid her gaze. You couldn't tell if she noticed or not since she didn't say anything. \"Why are you wearing Marino's clothes?\" just her icy gaze nearly winds you. She was someone you didn't want to bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story, but I can't wear my old clothes anymore, so Marino lent me some of hers before she left just now to her athletics class.\" You might have been able to convince Marino with your on-the-spot stories, but you weren't about to try and make a bold-faced lie to someone like Samus Aran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that thief has learned of a way to get PEOPLE past an infallible system developed by the greatest technological, if not immature, genius? I'll have to present this to the others, she can't defend herself this time, and you are coming with me.\" Oh boy...what had you gotten yourself, and Marino into now? Samus dragged you to your feet and you notice that she is quite tall, almost a head taller than yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you by both arms as she takes you towards the door.</span></div></div>",

Without your hands, you use your shoulder to scratch your face, but it's not just your face, your whole body feels like thousads of insects are crawling all over you, tickling and itching your every nerve. You fidget trying to get the itch but nothing works, and it only makes Samus crack down on your more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop fidgeting or I will drag you out if I have to\" she said grabbing you by one of your wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I just can't get this itch.\" you say as you use your free hand to scratch your other shoulder and your knees to scratch one another. All in all it makes Samus back up, looking at you weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up against the wall, trying to find a way to make it stop but it persists relentlessly. While you were next to a standing shelf you held on to it to keep your balance, you feel you arm stretching, not away from it, more like it was getting higher. And you stopped suddenly, ignoring the sensation. A thousand thoughts go through your head, but the thought that Samus was still here rang through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, eyes wide at Samus to see if she had realized what was happening to you. She obviously has, but when you look up she assumes a defensive stance, not letting you out of her sight. Just based on your glance you were already almost half your height. You glance to your side and see that the corner of the room was cluttered with odds and ends, probabley the only place you'd be able to escape Samus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a dive for the pile of random stuff knocking over a chest that was almost as big as you and scattering its contents all over you. Fortunately, none of it was heavy or sharp.</span></div></div>",

You figured it was gonna be inevitable... you just hope it'll kick in quickly before Samus breaks you in half for resisting arrest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, she was very observant to where you tried to dash off to. Not that she'd have to be. Your hiding spot was a little obvious!<br>\r\n\"Tsk!\" you heard her tsk followed by her footsteps coming closer and closer to your direction, \"It looks like that thief is terrible at choosing her accomplices. Come on out, [Alex] if that is your real name. Marino's not gonna save you. She's abandoned you. You owe her no loyalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont need her. All you need is just a little more time. You never thought you'd actually be GLAD that youre shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Suit yourself. HYA!!\" She knocked that pile flying all across the room with a single kick! That coulda hurt you pretty bad... BUT...<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" Samus's calm and collective expression on her face quickly changed to absolute shock at the fact that the man hiding under the pile wasnt there! Nothing left but that one set of clothes you borrowed from Marino...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... how did he do that?\" she leaned down toward those clothes with a hand to her chin. Unnoticed by her was that tiny little man running past her toward the door she picked open! That was a close one. You may have been reduced to Marino's puny little pet size, but at least you might have a better chance at fleeing this damn dorm and never looking back! The question as to whether or not you'll get your normal size back doesnt break through your already-determined mind!<br>\r\nBy the time Samus finally realized something was off, you had already fled down the hall running as fast as your legs could take you. The red-velvet carpetfilled hallway seemed pretty empty. You didnt pass a single gigantic girl in sight! Not that it was a bad thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Spoke too soon! You stopped in your tracks at the sight of two big black boots in front of you, blocking your path. Being too curious for your own good, you looked up to see what giant anime/videogame girl you just bumped into now.<br>\r\nWorking your way up, you noticed greenish colored pantyhose over the legs, a big black and grey debonair dress with a little purple on the sides. You noticed a pretty little black lacey bonnet over her long flowing grey hair. Her face was covered under a mask, but you could make out big yellow eyes gazing down at you from behind the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...wait! That girl! She's the one saw in the mirror!<br>\r\n\"Y...y...YOU!\" for some reason, her cold unsoothing presence chilled you down to your soul. You dont know why, but you had a bad feeling about her. Although you couldnt see her face, you could sense an eerie grin on it as she gazed down at you. The eyes were completely focused on you as you slowly backed away from her, watching your every move. It was almost like a hungry hawk staring down at a little mouse before tearing into it with razor-sharp talons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain was telling you, 'Run you moron!! RUN!!!!' but your feet took too long to react! When the blood finally rushed to them, you turned around and ran as possible to the other direction! No surprise, the masked girl chased after you. She was walking very slowly after you, but her boots were only inches away from you as they came down making little tremors with every step. She could step on you really easily, but every time she steps close to you, she misses you by a few inches. Is she just trying to scare you or something?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuz it's working! Not only that, but youre starting to get tired! Damn it, why did you push yourself leaving Marino's room?! Better yet, why did you even leave Marino's room in the first place?! Sure Samus wasnt exactly friendly with you, but you'd be in better hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Uh oh. End of the hall. Nothing but a table with a pot of dandelions in the corner. No stairs, no doors, not even a window. Youre trapped. With no other options available, you ducked behind the leg of the table and caught your breath. The eyes of the masked girl were still on you as she caught up with you. Sweat dripped off your face as she leaned down toward you. You backed against the corner of the wall, shivering from the ice cold presence of her big pale hand reaching out for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod only knows what she has in store for you, but you were defenseless. You closed your eyes and awaited your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE ARE YOU, TRESPASSER?! I KNOW YOURE OUT HERE!\" Just then, you overheard Samus's voice call out to you. And by the time you opened your eyes, the masked girl was gone! But how?! She was just a couple feet (or a couple inches) away from you a few seconds ago! Now she's gone? How does she do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your final warning, [Alex]!\" You could see Samus stepping toward your direction, looking everywhere for you, \"If you dont come out and give yourself up right now, I will alert the entire dorm that we have a male who snuck in!\" She pulled out some sort of walkie-talkie from her pocket. It didnt look like she was joking. But then again, Ms. Aran isnt the time joke, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving you to the count of three!\" she gives you fair warning as she seems to be hanging a finger over on the buttons. \"One.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. Looks like youre not gonna be sneaking out of the building anytime soon. It was bad enough a few of the girls know of your existence... a rookie ninja, a playful robot, a touchy fairy, a sharp bounty hunter, and some creepy yellow-eyed girl in a mask! Now youre risking to put the whole damn building on red-alert over you! You dont need that kind of attention. You dont want that kind of attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, [Alex]! If you know what's good for you, you wont risk testing the tolerance of a few thousand woman who are highly trained in self-defense. Two....\"</span></div></div>",

I GIVE UP!\" you call out as loud as you possibley can, hoping the giant bounty hunter would hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe obviously hears something, as she hesitates and looks around cautiously, her finger a hairsbredth from the button. To assist in her search you jump and wave your arms as you call to her, trying to make yourself as noticable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor better or worse, it worked. you saw as she locked on to something in her periphial, you. She had a surprised look as she gazed in your direction, then she approached your location frighteningly quick; you stepped backward as her sedan-sized boot landed right in front of you, and looked up to see her descending with her hand outstretched towards you. you close your eyes and clench for your immanent trip skyward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it never comes. You don't even feel her fingers wrap around you, so you open one eye and meet with two gorgeous blue eyes, and a stern, but beautiful face. You really didn't get a good look when you were in the room, but she had an aluring, if not intimidating face, and you sort of lost yourself for a moment in her eyes. Once you regained your composure, you realize she is examining you, and when you look behind you, and she's doing something with her hand in correlation to you, like she was measuring you or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't harm you, but you must do as I say, and I will accomodate to carry you however you are comfortable with.\" Samus said, seemingly over your condition and having put together what had occured earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver all, you had only been 'carried' three different ways; in the shirt of a teenager, an android's fanny pack, and the same android's panties, so anything Samus was refering to would be new to you. \"I suppose just sitting in your palm would be just fine.\" You weren't going to even try to take any liberties with her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand that was behind you cupped to allow your presence, which you feel both excited and frightened about.</span></div></div>",

No doubt she's gonna be any less dangerous than Samus, but you might be in better hands than that... girl... damn it, who the hell was she?! She reminds you SOOOO closely of someone and you just cant put your finger on it. Maybe it's cuz of that stupid mask, but man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, too bad you couldnt at least say goodbye to Marino or Navi, not like they'd be willing to let you go, would they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, speak-o diablo! You can make out a little extremely bright ball of blue light flying your direction! As it gets closer and closer, the light gets even brighter and brighter! To avoid being blind you closed your eyes. Yeah, you already knew what was coming and who that blue light belonged to. It looks like little Navi coming to save the day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO YOU DONT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe not. It sounded like Navi wasnt fast enough to get past Ms. Aran's keen superhuman senses! By the time you opened your eyes, you saw that slightly dimmering winged blue girl caught in Samus's hand. Hopefully, she aint squeezing her as tightly as Marino was.<br>\r\n\"H-H-HEY!\" Navi screamed one of her trademark quotes yet again, \"WHAT'S THE BIG ID-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it, Navi!\" Samus snapped, shutting her captive up, \"I already know youre in cahoots with the thief, too!\"<br>\r\n\"L-LOOK! Rouge and I were planning to return the materia we borrowed from Aeris, but-\"<br>\r\n\"I was referring to Marino!\" Samus interrupted, causing the blue dimmer to change to red!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh... um...I-I-I knew that, I was just kidding!\" Navi stuttered before clearing her throat, \"*Ahem!* Anyway, I dont know what youre talking about! I'm not with that mechanical slut!\" Ouch again!<br>\r\nNonetheless, Samus didnt believe her, \"I had sources telling me you were talking with that thief last night. I wanna know what about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Navi replied, \"We never talked! I would never degrade myself being near some walking trash-heap of girly parts!\" Yikes! And you thought she had a big mouth in the GAME! Marino's gonna murder her if she finds out what she just said! Nonetheless, the humongous blonde bounty-hunter remained unaffected by the fairies lies. Instead, she turned her head to YOU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this little bug with you?\" Samus asked you. Sure enough, that didnt go unheard by Navi!<br>\r\n\"BUG??!! WHY YOU BIG, SPANDEX-WEARING, BRA-STUFFING-\" While Navi continued shouting obscurities, you thought pretty hard of your answer. Despite her big mouth, you didnt want to get Navi in trouble, too. You ESPECIALLY dont want her to get crushed into fairy-paste when she gets tossed into the same holding cell as Marino! But it's really really difficult mustering the courage to lie to the big bad bounty hunter that could easily crush both of you in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only idea was to give her a slight nonspecific answer that's kinda a lie and kinda not. \"Uh...um... I'm not with her.\"<br>\r\n\"THERE! You heard him yourself! I never met the guy in my life! Now lemme go already! I told ya I'm innocent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Samus kept on walking down the hallway with the both of you. \"I know something's going on that neither of you are telling me. And I will find out one way or another.\"<br>\r\n\"You cant prove nothing!\" Navi still couldnt keep her big mouth shut, \"We're innocent! Innocent, I tell you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell it to the Head of Security!\" Samus snapped at her, \"I'm sure she'd love to hear the tale.\" Hmm..<br>\r\n\"Tsk! You mean that Amazonian moron, Shampoo?!\" Shampoo?! \"Why her?! She knows about as much English as I know about Ice-Hockey! Besides, kitty'll probably swallow [Alex] before he can get a word in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOPS! She just blurted out your name! 'Smooth move, genius!' you thought to yourself as you smacked your forehead. And unfortunately for little big-mouth, Samus heard ever word she said!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know his name?\" Ms. Aran questioned Navi. The blue girl blushed like crazy! \"Errr...umm... uh....\"<br>\r\n\"HOW DID YOU KNOW HIS NAME?\" she raised her voice speaking even more lenient and more demanding than ever! As much as she deserved the spotlight on her, you still kinda felt sorry for Navi. But what are YOU gonna do about it? Answer the question for her?<br>\r\nMaybe you should... you dont wanna add MORE suspicion to you than there already is, do you?</span></div></div>",
