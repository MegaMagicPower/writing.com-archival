She was fantasizing of her cousin Ben, but not in the usual way most girls would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the Ben in her fantasies was always dress in girl clothes. Right now, he was dress in a cheerleader outfit. With his hands tied behind him and was wearing a blindfold. She was teasing him, making him beg for release. After another hour, she climax. She was panting, as she decided to take a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying off, she put on a blue lace bra and matching thong. She sighed, she been fantasizing about Ben for years.

Ben loved playing the hero and acts before thinking. Plus, Ben loved acting alone and thinking he could do anything along as well. So this will makes things so much easier to manipulate him. She got wet just thinking all the things she could get Ben to do. He would do anyhting the kidnapper said, no matter how humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a grin, Gwen got to work. She took a shower and got clean up. Then she put on a red sheer lace bra, matching thong and a pair of black thigh high stockings. Then she got a chair and took a seat. She used her magic to levitate her phone and to work the camera. Then she used her magic to tie herself up. She blindfolded herself and place a ball gag in her mouth. Then she bound her ankles together with rope. She moved her hands behind the chair and bound then together with rope. Then she tied rope above and below her breasts around the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she took a picture with the camera, then she untied herself with her magic. She levitate the phone to her, she grinned looking at the phone. This should be enough to get Ben into a panic and once he's panicking she could get Ben to do anyhting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she wote a small message with the picture and sent it to Ben. She smirked, as she put the next part of her plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was just sitting in his room, his parents where out so it wa just him. Then suddenly his phone started vibrating, he pulled it out and check the text message he got. What Ben saw and reed made him not only blushed but scared. It was a picture of his cousin Gwen, she was strip to her lingerie and tied to a chair. There was a message with the picture, it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have your cousin, if you want her to be release unharmed. Then first, tell no one about this, if we see anyone trying to save her or with you then she will pay for it. Second, we will be contacting you through varies ways with tasks and lastly not completing or referencing any or all tasks will not end well for your redheaded cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen was both angry and scared. He knew he should get help, but he feared this person finding and Gwen paying for it. Plus, he was Ben Tennysin after all. He could can do anyhting this person wanted and then beat him to a bloodly mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly he heard a knock on the door, he rushed to it. He opened it and looked around. He saw no one but a letter on the ground. He picked it up and closed the door. He opend the letter and reed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your first task Ben Tennyson, I want you to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: buy the following pieces of lingerie, one green sheer baby doll style negligee, matching green thong and a pair of black thigh high stockings. One green lace corset, matching thong, green garter belt and green thigh high stockings and finally a green lace bra and matching panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: I want you to go to your cousin's house.</span></div></div>",

Clover sighed, why was her mother acting like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dress Clover wanted to go bikini shopping, but Stella talked her into going to someplace else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the mother and daughter stood out front of Mistress Latex, Clover blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Mom, why are we here ?\" Asked Clover, Stella just giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sweetie, do you want to know a secret about mother ?\" Asked Stella coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover just nodded, Stella got behind Clover. She pushed her breasts into Clover's back and warped her arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in and whispered, \" Your mother was a dominatrix in college.\" Whispered Stella, this made Clover blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" And I thought maybe I could teach you somethings about being a dominatrix.\" Said Stella, this made Clover turned crimson red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas her mother serious, this was kind of embarrassing. Wearing skimpy leather outfits with your mother of all people and teaching her about stuff, that she haven't even do with a boy yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't worry Sweetie, we will go nice and slow.\" Said Stella, in a sultry tone. This didn't help calmed down Clover, but before she could say anything. Stella was dragging her into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover was totally embarrass as she and her mother looked around the store. Stella picked out some leather outfits for them, handcuffs, gags, blindfolds and a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella paid for all the the stuff, Clover was glad leaving the store. She didn't know how much more she could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" OK Clover, since we have time. We can go bikini shopping.\" Said Stella, Clover sighed. At least Bikini shopping with your MILF of a mother was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella grinned she couldn't wait for tonight. Enjoy your freedom why it last my daughter. Soon you be at my foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich mother do we go with next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You suspected that Mandy might actually wanted to be friends with Clover, but didn't want to lose her popularity position in society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she had that high-pitched voice that either one liked it or hated it.  Sure, Mandy was quick to try out new trends. Sure, Mandy often talked about how rich she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from what you observed when she thought no one was looking, she tended to be lonely. You heard rumors she latched on to those who were kind to her, but that she quickly betrayed them the moment she suspected they were using her to be popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, Mandy noticed that Clover kept flirting with you and you tended to leer at Clover when you thought no one was looking. (unknown to Mandy, she had problems telling Clover and Stella apart from afar. You mostly leered at Stella)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in one of her talks with Dominque, Caitlin, and Mandy, Mandy decided to pull out an old trump card to show Clover her place. By making you  her boyfriend, Clover would have to admit to defeat once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo during your job, Mandy appeared dressed in a tanktop and shortshorts that flattered her figure. She ordered, \"So, Will... I need you to move the furniture around in my living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, okay, Miss Mandy.\" You replied, having finished cleaning Mandy's pool. It was during summer, so all you were dressed in was some shorts and flipflops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Mandy, handsome,\" Mandy said as she walked into her home, making sure to put a bit of extra sway in her hips. She might be annoying, but she was attractive and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the TV, shelves of expensive stuff, and furniture about took quite a bit of time, as Mandy seemed extra persnickety today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was all a part of a plan to seduce you. First you'd get tired, then she and her allies do their stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" You asked, wiping away some sweat from your brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Now it's time for your reward...\" Mandy said as Mindy, Dominque, and Caitlin snuck up behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt someone tap you on the shoulder. So you turned around and saw Mindy, Dominque, and Caitlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy turned around and rubbed her butt against your crotch. Dominque and Caitlin walked over to your sides and hugged your arms into their breasts. Mandy hugged you from behind, making sure you knew that she didn't wear a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you looked at me, my cousin, my friends, and my aunt. You looked us over with your dirty perverted eyes,\" Mindy cooed as she ground her butt against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So agree to become our boyfriend...\" Caitlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or agree to become our boytoy,\" Dominque added as she and Caitlin began to sneak your hands into her pants to make you feel their pussies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, you'd get to enjoy all of us,\" Mindy cooed as Mandy began to feel up your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But refuse...\" Mandy said in a darkly evil tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we'll make you our slave!\" The four women said before letting out a cacophonous laugh.</span></div></div>",

Stella goes to take a seat on a lounge chair, letting you see Gabriella and Carmen walk out after her. Gabriella sporting a blue floral bikini, and Carmen has a yellow one-piece. Gabriella joins Stella on a lounge chair, while Carmen starts strutting her way to the hot tub. \"I thought you ladies were going to swim in the pool?\" You ask in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will. But first we need to prepare a little.\" Stella answers. \"While you're here, how about you give mama a massage? It'll get me all nice and relaxed for my swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Gabriella calls out. \"Why should he give you a massage, I need him to help me apply sunscreen. You wouldn't want me to burn, would you Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Carmen climbed into the hot tub. \"Stella, you don't need a massage, and Gabby, you can sunscreen yourself. Meanwhile, I don't want to sit in here all alone. Will, I want you to join me in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a tough one. Who do you help out first?</span></div></div>",

It's what I'd use,\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam and Alex, you go on a stakeout at apartment complex where the three were most seen, Y/N and I will be checking out the mall where they've been buying and stealing stuff from,\" Clover ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking out?

We need to... like quiz him on spy stuff,\" Alex quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let Y/N decide on who he wants to be with.

The head sported the familiar yellow-glow of the heartless' eyes, but it also had a wet orifice where the mouth would be. And from the back of her head, the darkness seemed to form a head of wavy hair that fell down between her shoulder blades. As a heartless, the being was shadow black, but a pink line ran all over her. It curved over the top of her breasts, around her shoulders and down her back just above her butt. The bottom of the \"dress\" sported similar pink lines. And he remembered pink lines around the mouth-like orifice forming lips. He remembered how the heartless seemed to draw strings from thin air before she pulled back and fired an arrow, its head resembling a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Sora thought about the heartless, the more he realized he knew so little about the mysterious new enemy.

The traveler was sat on his rear, and his legs forcibly spread, fully revealing his unclothed waist to the Beauty, dick nice and rigid. Though, a blush formed on Sora's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you...?\" Sora started. But when he looked up at her, he was greeted with the sight of her dress-covered rear. The dress itself looked thick, consisting of various shades of purple with white lining separating certain sections.

We don't even need hypnosis to beat you. You already want her to do this~\"</b> Sora felt sweat building as he kept on fighting her approaching butt.

You'll get squa~ashed!</b> Parasol Beauty 2 sang. Sora was now shivering from their repeated touches, small tingles of tickling running up his body. He was now huffing and puffing at their attention, and now they were close to his face, almost whispering their song into either ear. And then, he felt the hands on his cheeks go on his chest, before gliding down his trunk and towards his hips... Then, they gently grasped his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-gah!\" Sora shouted. He immediately brought down a hand to defend himself, only to realize the gravity of his mistake after the fact.

Aladdin and Genie were away at the Cave of wonders, clearing it of Heartless. Lucky for Sora, Jasmine was skilled with a sword, thanks to Aladdin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Sora and Jasmine were able to clear the Palace of Heartless, though both could barely stand and were out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...

Both Sora and Jasmine readied themselves for the icy spells of the heartless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all the Heartless did was dance on their crystal balls. Sora found their dancing fairly erotic and attention-grabbing, but didn't recognize the style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Fortunetellers were at the bellyroll moves, Sora asked, \"What sorta dancing are they doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine answered in a  very distracted voice, \"Bellydancing... they're quite good at it...Really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dance continued,  both Sora and Jasmine fell more and more under the Fortunetellers' spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Fortunetellers began to slowly float away, a hypnotized Sora and Jasmine began to follow after them, all the way into a portal to the World That Never Was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, The group of Fortuneteller Heartless split into two and separated Sora and Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the Fortunetellers stopped dancing and the sound of a large metal gate closed, did Sora break free of the spell of the Fortuneteller dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noted that he was surrounded by the heartless, was in a large bedroom that definitely was in the World That Never Was, and was naked for some reason.</span></div></div>",

That.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two heroes hear rumbling behind them, they looked to see that the green ground was rolling up before it stood straight up. Two eyes and a mouth with big red lips appeared on the vertical ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm! I had such a deee-lightful dirt nap. I feel as fresh as a daisy!\" The new face said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! It's that lawn thing that fell in love with me long ago! Where's some sheep when you need them!?\" Darkwing said in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLawn looked down and glared at Darkwing. The group of heartless ran off as she said, \"Oh, you. I oughta grind you to fertilizer fer last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lawn spotted Sora, her expression changed to one of happiness and her pupils changed to hearts. \"But for bringing this perfect hunk, you're forgiven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Sora asked before Lawn sprouted several roots, bound Sora, and picked him up. Lawn drew him near her face and began to shower him with kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,Sora! I'll save you!\" Darkwing called out. Then he muttered, \"I have to. I am a hero, after all. Not only that, Donald would kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora managed to free his hands to hold back Lawn's kisses and said, \"Go stop Bushroot and the heartless! I'll catch up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I won't leave you behind!\" Darkwing said before pulling out his gasgun and fired it at Lawn's face. However, she smacked it away. \"Whoopsies... I hope that doesn't hit anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darkwing! The longer you try to help me, the more time Bushroot and the Heartless have to attack innocent people!\" Sora said before he lost his grip and was rapid-kissed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkwing growled before he said, \"Fine! Have it your way! I'll have Launchpad come by to save you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then ran off in Bushroot's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Darkwing left, Sora felt a vine slither into pants and fondle his dick and balls.</span></div></div>",

This world would get invaded by wicked Heartless, who seemed to be aiding the villians. Among them was a certain chilly duck, an Isis Vanderchill who underwent a transformation to keep her young and beautiful, only for her to be rendered chillingly cold. Now, she's been trying desperately to find ways to keep warm. And it seems certain heartless are willing to help her with that goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Sora and Darkwing Duck would be racing through the city, towards the source of a multitude of Heartless scampering around the ground. The two would each manage to take care of several as they progressed through the city, getting closer and closer to the villainess, the city starting to get coated in gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the Ice Queen's work,\" Darkwing answered. \"She intended to cover this city in gold to reflect the sunlight and heat the place up. She's super chilly, and is seeking any means of keeping up her body heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good!\" Sora declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh!\" Darkwing said. \"Now, if the gold's around here, she might be around here...\" As he spoke, a shadow began to form beneath him, not that he noticed as he stroked his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sir-?\" Sora started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, kid, I'm thinking,\" Darkwing said as he kept on pondering. The shadow, meanwhile, grew. More and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, sir-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thinking-!\" Darkwing declared. However, faster than he could accost him more, he was swiftly silenced as a mass of blue suddenly came down, her rotund form managing to strike Darkwing square on the head and, as quick as a blink, squish him down into the ground, which shook at the impact. Sora stumbled about and used his Keyblade to keep himself lifted up, before looking over the foe. In front of him was a lady in a bright blue dress, pale blue feathers, and an icy cap on top of her head. Not to mention that she was very large, like, maybe 4 times Sora's size. This must've been Isis Vanderchill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to face Sora, still on top of the flattened hero Sora accompanied. She looked over the young hero, her eyes seeming to take in as much of that boy as possible, a curt smile dressing her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm~ I don't think I've seen anything like you before~\" she said. Sora, meanwhile, held his keyblade defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand back, ma'am!\" Sora commanded. \"Those heartless won't get you anywhere!\" Isis, however, smirked and stood up, walking around him while still looking him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I thought that the last guy was something~\" she said. \"However, here you are, muscular, trained...\" She got towards his back, and turned her head to get a \"good angle\". \"Mmm~ And quite the rear~\" Sora blushed and turned around, backing away in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk like that!\" he declared. \"I-I'll stop you already!\" Isis, meanwhile, giggled.</span></div></div>",

She was already giving him some weird vibes, and feared that if he didn't, then she would do something terrible to him. He took up his Keyblade, before swinging it overhead in an attempt to smack it upon her. However, the frosty villain could see his attack coming. She made sure the floor was slippery beneath her, before using the frosty surface to swivel around,  where her rotund backside would face the hero. Sora's Keyblade came down, but was met with a quick rear-strike from Isis, her rump thick enough to absorb the blow and parry the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora yelped and was knocked off balance, stumbling back a little bit. The larger duck spun around, and smirked widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always get what I want~\" she said darkly, before hurling a hand forwards. Sora's eyes widened, and faster than he could react, she grabbed his collar, before yanking him towards her. Sora's back was pinned against her front, the majority of his body being eclipsed by Isis' stomach. His limbs were splayed out, his arms pulled up and around her bust, and his feet reaching down to her thighs. Isis held him tight against her with one forearm, before moving her hand around, clasping his wrists and ankles to practically glue the boy against her torso. Soon, his limbs were frozen into place, Sora wriggling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's cheating!\" he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's game!\" Isis declared. \"And I am the victor! And to the victor... goes the spoils~\" As she spoke, she smiled darkly. Her hands came down, first grasping his chest. Sora grunted and wriggled around as she groped and squeezed, some fingers playing with his nipples while the others playfully poked. After grasping that, her hands would snake down his torso, grasping his sides and squeezing his abdomen, before curling around to hold his hips. All the while, Isis hummed merrily as she lewdly felt Sora up, the boy grunting at each squeeze and poke. He felt an uncomfortable stirring in his body, especially as she got closer to his waistline. She could definitely notice the slight bulge forming, if that dark chuckle was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers teased with his waistband as she contemplated what more to do with this hero.</span></div></div>",

Let me get him somewhere were we can 'recruit' him,\" Jessie said before putting away the walkie-talkie. \"Using her pokeball, she said, \"Return, Ekans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was relieved when the woman took back her pokemon. \"Thanks, lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't thank me. You might wanna put your pikachu back in its pokeball before some thieves try to steal it,\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash put Pikachu back in the pokeball, he asked, \"My name's Ash Ketchum. Can you tell me what's your name, lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie... Uh, Jessilina!\" Jessie answered. \"Since you seem to be really new at being a pokemon trainer, I guess I can help you. I can even catch those female pokemon that try to force themselves on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Ash muttered. \"Can I be able to catch some of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can, that is,\" Jessie answered. \"Now, do you need your have your pokemon checked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have a pikachu, but all they did was climb a tree and follow me here. But I guess getting them looked at is a good idea...\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait here for you cutie!\" Jessie said as Ash headed for a Nurse Joy. Once alone, she took out her walkie-talkie and quickly said, \"Follow me and the twerp out to the fields heading west. If a female pokemon forces herself on him, we'll take the pokemon and the twerp! We'll be rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting away her walkie-talkie, Ash returned and asked, \"Alright. Jessilina. What shall we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let's go get a female pokemon for both of us,\" Jessie said. Seeing Ash's fearful expression, she said, \"Don't worry! If we get one, you can train it to defend you if another female pokemon appears. After all, women can be very territorial. Trust me on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\" Ash muttered as he followed Jessie to Route 22.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in front of a grassy field, Jessie said, \"Now go there and draw out a pokemon. I'll be nearby, ready to send my Ekans out to save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ash walked into the field and wandered about. After a few minutes, A female pokemon appeared and tackled Ash.

She didn't know it was meant to catch pokemon of an opposite gender than your own, she just liked how it had a heart on it. She said, \"Oh, Gardevoir...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardevoir stopped the kiss and glared at Jessie, who merely smirked and replied, \"Save it, Sister.

Pulling rags and towels from their racks, you see the light was a text from a friend from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  'Heads up, boss just hired a new guy.' it read, a sign of warning as new employees often get send for you for help. Taking the time for the shower water to warm, you replied 'Thanks, I'll bring my best suit and tie'. Another reply came but, you were busy undressing for your shower. A thought of answering popped in your head, but was pushed out figuring it could wait...</span></div></div>",

He is happy, and he has every right to be. He is moving in with his new wife, Karen today. You however have little to be happy about. It's only been about year since your mom died and your dad seemed to be out on the dating scene almost immediately. He would always respond with \"your mom would want me to be happy\"' whenever you called him out on it and while you believe this to be true, you think your mom would be raising an eyebrow if she knew her husband had remarried only the months later. To top all that off, you hadn't even got to meet your new step mom before the wedding. All dad would say was that she's a doctor and has kids herself, he never did get around to telling you how they met but if he had you woul dn't have cared. All you know is that you don't like her. The cherry on the cake however comes in the form of both you and your dad uprooting and moving into Karen's house which is a four hour drive away from everyone you have ever known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the passenger wing mirror and see your pouty reflection stare back at you. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=154738874\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.o...</a><br>\r\nYou are Teagan. You're a 17 year old boy, much to the confusion and amusement of most thanks to your remarkably feminine, soft appearance and long hair. You're effeminately slim and you stand at only 5 ft 2 at most. You had been bullied when you were younger but over time, people got used to you and got bored of making fun of the \"sissy boy\" seeking other targets instead. That's something you get to look forward too in this new town, new school, new bullies. Excellent. You have an older sister at college called Sally who thinks its cute that your dad is finding love so fast however, she isn't the one who has to move, she's already independent. It's as if you are the only one who remembers mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad, Steve, is a commercial airline pilot, a well payed job with odd hours. He is away more often than he is at home which is why in his mind it makes sense to move in with Karen since he's hardly around anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and try for one last futile attempt to change his mind. \"Dad, you know how hard it was for me to fit in at school before, at a new school with no friends, I'll have to go through it all again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Teagan. That was a long time ago, people your age should be more understanding.\" you roll your eyes knowing he is not at all aware of the cruelty of high school, \"and besides, you have your step sisters to be friends with you and show you around. Lauren is the same age as you while Molly is just a year younger so there isn't a huge gap between you all. You'll all get on.\" He says confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had seen Molly and Lauren only once at the wedding but never actually met them. From what you can remember, Molly was the typical girly girl type while Lauren seemed pretty average. Molly was about the same size as you while Lauren was taller but both kept to themselves. You aren't sure how they feel about their mom marrying your dad and you moving in but you can't imagine them being anymore thrilled about it than you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are\" Your dad says as you he turns off the road up a driveway leading to a large and very nice house. You can tell Karen is a doctor. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.addspacetoyourlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/BigHouseBlueSky.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.addspacetoyourlife.com/wp-con...</a> \"At least I won't be living in a dump\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad parks in front of the garage, unfastens his belt and steps out of the car. You do the same and while the fresh air and afternoon sun are refreshing after a five hour car drive, it does little to cheer you up. \"Give me a hand with the boxes son.\" your dad calls as he rummages in the back of the car. After a quick stretch, you open the rear door and grab a couple of boxes you know to contain some of the stuff from your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the size of the car and the fact your dad was too cheap to hire a moving van, a lot of stuff was either left or donated to charity. You made it clear however you would not be parting with any of your things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying the box, you follow your dad to the front door which opens as you reach the steps revealing Karen. \"Hi sweetie, how was the drive?\" she asks your dad. He responds by quickly placing his box on top of the one you are carrying and embracing his new wife for a long kiss. Now laden with another box, you struggle to keep balance but thankfully the weight is lifted as Molly appears and takes the top box from you. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you say gratefully and she offers you a friendly smile. She is wearing a pink tank top with with a pair of black leggings, her long blonde hair worn down. You have to admit, your younger step-sister is a hottie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, your dad and step-mom (shudder) have finished kissing and are facing you and Molly. \"Ah already helping your step-brother out are you?\" Your dad says smiling from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly whirls round to face you again with shock on her face. \"Your a boy?\" she asks in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how to respond to this question and just mumble a confused, \"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's eyes widen and then she turns to her mom. \"You didn't say Teagan was a boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Molly, of course I did.\" Karen responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you just said that Steve had two kids, Sally and Teagan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I showed you a picture dear.\" Karen says, getting very conscious of how awkward everything has got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but he looks just like a girl. How was I supposed to know if you didn't tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and glare at your dad. Its started already. The ones who he had so confidently told you would be your friends didn't even know you were a boy. You wonder just how much thought and communication went into this move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Molly!\" Karen snaps, \"You are being very rude to Teagan, apologize at once\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly faces you again, still looking at you a little oddly. \"I'm sorry if I offended you Teagan, I just didn't expect. well.... you.\" Despite the clumsiness of the apology, you can tell she is sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happens all the time.\" you say, working up a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, now that you're both introduced, why don't you show Teagan to his room?\" Karen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom. Follow me.\" she says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her inside the house and are instantly impressed by the interior. She leads you up a set of stairs to top floor and opens one of the three doors revealing a rather girly bedroom. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/17/d0/1a/17d01abe171cab3aa3a636ae9f71becb.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a> Molly chuckles as you cringe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom let me and Lauren decorate for you and like I said, we thought you were a girl so...\" she stifles another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, its bigger than my old room. And its got an en-suite.\" you say, ignoring her laughter and setting down a box on your bed. You open it up and smile down at some of you nic nics from your old house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Molly head back down and continue to unload the car into your room. You don't talk much but you do learn that the other two room on the top floor belong to her and Lauren. As you are bringing in the last box, your dad suddenly emerges from a room carrying a glass of red wine. Not being able to stop, you colide into him and you watch in horror as the wine spills all over you, leaving you soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\" Your dad curses, \"Teagan, watch where you are going.\" He looks around frantically. \"Your lucky, it seems to have all gone on you, we can't be staining the carpet as soon as you get hear. Now go fetch your clothes box from the car and find something clean to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you brought in my clothes.\" you say. You are certain the only clothes box you have brought in belongs to your dad and Molly hasn't taken one either. Your eyes suddenly widen as you remember earlier that day when you dropped off some boxes at the local charity store. Your dad had been in a rush and you were both half asleep so it could be possible that a mistake was made. Sure enough as you frantically open the box you are holding, you find it to contain old toys and board games. Dropping the box, you dash up stairs to your room and tear open each box finding no sign of your clothes anywhere. Desperate now, you run back down stairs to find your dad, you find him and Karen with everyone else in a large living room. You notice Lauren sat on a chair in the corner but go straight for your dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teagan, what did I say, go get changed. Karen and I have an announcement to make to you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't, you've accidentally given the boxes with my clothes in to charity this morning. I don't have anything to wear\" you say frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad's expression doesn't change for a moment before he groans and brings his hand over his eyes. \"Oh no.\" He groans again. Karen places a hand on your dad's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dear. It can happen to the best of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Teagan. I'll give you some money to get some new stuff later.\" He says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Molly and see her fighting laughter again while Lauren is also grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now, we have an announcement.\" your dad says recovering his composure. \"Karen and I have been talking and we know that this is a awkward situation for you all so to try and bring you together...</span></div></div>",

Teagan, you do as they say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why?\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because girls around your age are much more mature and responsible than boys. Besides that, they know the town and the house.\" Karen replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise me you'll do as they say.\" Your dad says, looking you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to both Molly and Lauren who are both beaming in delight then look at your feet. You sigh in defeat. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lad.\" He rummages in his pocket and produces his wallet. After removing a sizable wod of bills, he hands them to Lauren. \"This is the money for Teagan's new clothes. Don't let him waste it on video games or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure he won't.\" Lauren says, looking directly at you still smiling. The girls must be loving this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment is interrupted by the horn of a car outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that must be our taxi.\" Karen says, \"Have you got our bags ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Have you got your passport?\" Your dad replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh, well, I guess we are good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said your flight is tomorrow.\" Molly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is but we don't want to be in a rush so we're staying at an airport hotel overnight. Excuse me.\" Your dad says trying to get to the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you girls know the rules and you'll find the money I left you all on the dresser in my room with a list of phone numbers. Teagan remember to listen to your sisters.\" Karen gathers you all together for a quick hug before she herself dashes out of the front door. \"See you in three weeks. Call if you need anything.\" And with that, she closes the front door leaving you and the girls alone in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to start of as best as possible, you turn to Lauren and extend your hand to shake hers, \"I guess you already know but I'm Teagan.\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren takes your hand in hers. \"Lauren\" she says. She is currently wearing a hoodie with a pair of jeans. While not as feminine as her sister, she is still very attractive, her blonde hair in a loose ponytail however. \"Now let me get one thing clear.\" she says, her voice menacing now. \"I was expecting a girl arriving today not some little sissy so you are going to do whatever Molly and I say, when we say it. If  I say cook us both dinner, you will cook us dinner.\" Her grip on your hand tightens to the point where it is painful. You try to pull away but she is too strong. \"I Molly asks you to clean her room, you will clean her room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp as her grip tightens more and tears start to well in your eyes. \"Let go, what are you doing.\" you try to pull your hand from her again with no success. Your mind is struggling to understand what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?\" Lauren says in a patronizing voice. She lets go of your hand and you yank it back. \"How about you go get cleaned up and we can talk later. We can't have you in dirty clothes can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't have anything else to wear\" You say angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help you with that\" Molly says, patting you on the arm gently and smiling at you sweetly. \"Follow me.\" She heads up stairs and you follow her up. \"Go get out of those dirty clothes in your room, I'll be in a minute with something for you to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure why you are so compliant to her smile, you go into your room and do as she say. You strip down to your boxers and are folding your dirty clothes on your bed when you hear a soft giggle from the doorway. You turn and see Molly gazing at your almost naked form holding a set of clothes. Looking closer you see she is holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
