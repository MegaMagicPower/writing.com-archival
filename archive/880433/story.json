That's not even hinting anything!\"<br>\r\n\"Look she's my girlfriend!...\" Mike started,<br>\r\n\"Oh, so now she's you girlfriend! That's funny, because when you were kissing me, she was your ex! Why can't you just tell her?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna talk about it OK? I'm not even sure I wanna be in a relationship with another guy! Imagine the descrimination we'd suffer!\"<br>\r\n\"The descrimination I already suffer for you!\"<br>\r\n\"Heegh, MAYBE I'M JUST NOT PREPARED TO SUFFER IT FOR YOU!!!\" Mike yelled<br>\r\n\"Don't say that Mike...\" Matt whispered tring hard to cut the quiver from his voice.<br>\r\nThere was suddenly a blare of head lights and a truck's horn blaring...; It was coming towards their parked car, and fast!!!</span></div></div>",

A woman, no, a nurse, approaches him and tells him he will be fine, just a few scrapes and bruises and a broken wrist. She tells him he was lucky to be behind the wheel of the parked car when it was hit by the SUV with the drunken driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he remembers the accident. He and Matt had been talking about their relationship, about Claire, about their very lives. He recalls Matt being turned toward him, trying hard not to cry. He was just about to take him into his arms when he saw the lights beyond the window, coming at them hard and fast. Before he could scream or move, it was upon them. Matt spun his head around to look, just as the truck rammed directly into his side of the car, ramming into them, crushing Matt into Mike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt\", he manages to croak, and the nurse looks away quickly. \"Your girlfriend is here sweetie, would you like to see her? Of course you would, I'll just dash out and get her!\" Mike is frustrated, he wants to know about Matt, why wouldn't the nurse tell him anything? Claire enters the room, smiling tentatively, like she is afraid he is about to die. She comes to the bedside and takes Mikes hand and starts to talk. Mike just croaks \"Matt?\" again. Claire begins to cry. \"Honey, Matt was hurt pretty badly. He is going to live, but his life will probably never be the same again.\" Claire sees the color drain from Mike's face and offers him some water, which he is grateful to have. After drinking deeply, he can speak a little better and he asks Claire, \"What happened to Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire wouldn't answer his question. He grew angry and demanded someone tell him what had happened to his best friend. Finally the doctor came in and explained Matt's injuries to Mike. \"Matt was hit with the full force of the runaway SUV. He has some broken ribs, and a broken leg, all of which will heal. His body being pushed into yours actually prevented you from sustaining any serious injuries yourself. His worst injury though, was to his face. I don't really know how to tell you this, but your friend Matt's face was destroyed in the accident.\" Mike looks at the doctor, \"Destroyed? Like his nose is broken and his skin is all cut up?\" The doctor hangs his head and says \"I mean the radiator of the SUV blew up right in your friend's face, causeing burns so severe that most of his face is literally just...well, gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike began to cry. He remembered holding that beautiful face in his hands just a few hours earlier. He remembered Matt wanting him to make a committment to them exploring becoming a couple. He suddenly knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he loved Matt. They were not just childhood friends, buddies, pals, they were the center of each other's universes, always had been. \"I have to see him.\" Claire and the docotr looked at each other and she said \"I don't think that is a good idea honey, he's really....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a voice that sounded like cold steel Mike said, \"First, I am not your honey. Things have been bad between us for a long time Claire, so stop acting like this is killing your soul. Second, I WILL see Matt, I love him.\" Claire responds with, \"Of course you do honey, he's your best friend and...\" \"And he's the man I am in love with\", Mike interrupts, \"I hate for you to find out like this, but it's true. Now please, take me to him!\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't understand it fully; did it make him gay? Did it mean that his girlfriend would dump him?<br>\r\nAll these questions and more besides were spinning around inside his head as his thoughts were interrupted by a hand tapping on his shoulder. Turning his head slightly, he could see who it was; it was Matt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna finish that?\" Matt asked, indicating the half finished drink that was sitting on the bar top.<br>\r\nMike promptly picked up the drink and downed it in a single gulp<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Matt asked, clearly concerned for his friend.<br>\r\nMike ignored the question and got up to go.<br>\r\n\"Mike, talk to me. We're best mates!\"<br>\r\n\"No Matt!\" Mike said softly, \"We WERE best mates! That all changed this afternoon!\" And he walked out into the street.<br>\r\nMatt shook his head, almost as if he couldn't believe his ears, and hurried after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt ran out into the street, listening for his friend, and he could hear sobbing nearby. Sure enough, in a side alley next to the night club.<br>\r\nMatt walked down it to where Mike was; sitting on a old beer barrel by the fire door.<br>\r\n\"Mind if I sit down?\" asked Matt, and Mike just shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Mike, today was the best day of my life so far. You were so fantastic, it was almost unbelievable....\" said Matt, with emotion.<br>\r\nMike clenched his fists and turned to look into his friend's eyes. Matt could see tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Come here,\" Matt whispered, opening his arms for a hug.<br>\r\nMike hesitated, almost as if he wasn't sure what he should do. Then slowly he leant forwards and hugged Matt.<br>\r\n\"I'm scared Matt\" he whispered, \"What if Claire finds out?\"<br>\r\nMatt thought about it; Claire was Mike's girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"She doesn't have to know mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt took a quick look down the alley and pulled away slightly.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to come back to mine?\"<br>\r\nMike's mind rushed with all kinds of thoughts; good and bad.<br>\r\nWhat was he to do?</span></div></div>",
