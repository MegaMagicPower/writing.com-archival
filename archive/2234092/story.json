A noise from behind her caught her attention; looking back she saw her boyfriend, Kyle, struggling to put the tent back into its bag.  Her two best friends Melissa and Liz were chatting about something nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 2 weeks before Olivia and her friends were due to start their Senior year of High School.  To mark the occasion, they each convinced their families to let them hike a part of the Appalachian trail.  The group was 3 days into their planned 7-day excursion; having hiked just over 75 miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last look at the scenery, Olivia marched back to help Kyle with the tent.  \u201cSeriously babe, it\u2019s not that hard to roll up the tent and place it inside the pack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d Making his voice a little louder, Kyle said, \u201cEspecially when <i>no one else</i> is helping me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat remark caught the attention of Melissa and Liz, who quickly made their way back to the group.  \u201cSorry,\u201d with a wince, Melissa said, \u201cWe were discussing our plans for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone got to work with the tent, Olivia said, \u201cSo what is the plan for today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her work, Liz said, \u201cThere\u2019s a cave system nearby; I thought it would be cool to explore it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of exploring a cave system did sound interesting; until Olivia realized that they didn\u2019t have the equipment for it.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s smart; it\u2019s not like we have rock climbing equipment or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I think we need to add some excitement to this hike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle and Olivia exchanged looks with each other; before Olivia turned and looked back at Liz.  \u201cWe spent two hours yesterday jumping off a waterfall; was that not exciting enough for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz realized the position she\u2019d just gotten herself into, \u201cYeah, that was exciting; but, come on, the idea of exploring caves doesn\u2019t excite you guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked at Melissa and Kyle, the three of them quickly realizing Liz wasn\u2019t going to let up.  Melissa and Kyle both shrugged while Olivia turned back to Liz.  \u201cOkay fine; but if anything happens, we\u2019re blaming you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*********************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 10 minutes to get the tent squared away, and another 25 minutes to reach Liz\u2019s caves.  The girls waited outside as Kyle ventured inside to make sure it was safe.  While they waited, Liz approached Olivia and said, \u201cSo how are things between you and Kyle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Olivia to register what Liz was talking about; a few days before the hike, she\u2019d gotten into a fight with Kyle.  It seemed that he wanted to take their relationship to the next level, but Olivia wasn\u2019t sure she was ready for that yet.  \u201cI guess things are better; he\u2019s brought it up a few times since we started, but eventually he lets it go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry or anything; but is there a reason you don\u2019t want to...you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia\u2019s face turned sour for a moment as she turned to Liz.  \u201cI love Kyle; but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s the one I want to lose my virginity to.\u201d Looking around the area, Olivia said, \u201cI know it sounds corny, but I can\u2019t help but think my soul mate is out there somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it from me, girl; don\u2019t give yourself to the wrong person.\u201d Sighing, wiping a lone tear from her face, Liz said, \u201cI slept with Emilia; the next thing I know she\u2019s ghosting me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Liz mention her ex made Olivia sad; as they'd dated for over a year.  They seemed like a great couple, until they took the next step after their Junior Prom.  One-minute Liz was on cloud nine with her girlfriend, the next her now ex-girlfriend announces she\u2019s moving and refuses to communicate with Liz.  \u201cYou still haven\u2019t heard from her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Sitting on a rock, Liz said, \u201cI don\u2019t get it; I thought we loved each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat next to her friend, Olivia said, \u201cLove can make people do strange things; Emilia was probably scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat conversation continued for a few minutes until Kyle came out of the cave entrance.  Sitting nearby, Melissa said, \u201cIs it safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s safe.\u201d Looking perplexed, Kyle said, \u201cBut there\u2019s something inside I think you should all see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group followed Kyle through the cave\u2019s meandering interior for a few minutes until they came across a small cavern.  The cavern itself was rather uninteresting, a few rock outcroppings here and there.  What drew everyone\u2019s attention was a clearly alien device in the middle \u2013 what looked like an old console connected to a vertical cylinder.  As she approached it, Olivia said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the foggiest idea, O.\u201d coming up beside her, Kyle said, \u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s definitely not from around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer at the machine, Olivia quickly realized that it was incredibly old, telling by the plant life that had grown over a part of the console.  What appeared to be alien writing was barely visible.  Reaching out, Olivia touched a button and jumped back as the cylinder opened nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to step closer to it, Kyle and the others tried to stop her.  \u201cOlivia, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a smart idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her friends, Olivia stepped inside the cylinder only for it to close around her.  Spinning around, looking scared, Olivia started pounding on the glass.  \u201cGuys, get me out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kyle went to try and break the glass, Liz and Melissa focused on the console.  After a few moments, Liz noticed the lights on the console changing.  As a whirring sound started to fill the room, Liz said, \u201cHey guys, I think it\u2019s counting down to something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light started to fill the cylinder as Olivia\u2019s panicked screams could be heard over the noise.  The others stepped back as sparks started flying around them; watching in stunned horror as the machine suddenly exploded.  As the smoke cleared, they could see the device was destroyed; the only thing left was the charred remains of the console and some pieces of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stepped closer, Liz saw something underneath a nearby panel \u2013 what looked like a human hand.  Rushing towards it, Liz said, \u201cGuys, it\u2019s Olivia!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Kyle ran over; only to stop in their tracks when Liz lifted the panel to find all that remained of Olivia was her severed arm.</span></div></div>",

Oh my God!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was followed by Melissa throwing up behind a rock while Liz struggled to keep from doing the same.  While holding Melissa\u2019s hair back, Liz looked at Kyle and said, \u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d fixating on his girlfriend\u2019s severed arm, Kyle said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that just happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining some composure, Melissa wiped her mouth with her arm, \u201cWe have to call the cops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what exactly would we tell them?\u201d pacing around in a circle, Kyle said, \u201cThat some strange machine we found exploded with Olivia inside it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMel\u2019s right, we have to do something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that!\u201d focusing on Liz, Kyle said, \u201cJust give me a minute to think, alright!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group decided it was best to leave the cave while Kyle tried to decide their next course of action.  After a brief period, Kyle walked over and joined the girls by a tree.  \u201cSo, here\u2019s the plan; we\u2019ll call Olivia\u2019s parents and tell them there was an accident.\u201d <br>\r\nCovering his mouth, Kyle said, \u201cOnce that\u2019s over with, we\u2019ll call the authorities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Melissa looked at Kyle and said, \u201cI can tell her folks if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to keep composure, Kyle shook his head and said, \u201cI was her boyfriend, so it\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kyle walked off to get some privacy, Melissa yelled out, \u201cHoller if you need us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle walked for about 50 feet until he could barely see the cave or the others.  Sitting on a downed tree, he dug out his phone and dialed Oliva\u2019s house.  It was 10:00 on a Saturday morning; so, he knew her family would be home.  Olivia\u2019s brother Eric answered after a few rings, \u201cHey Kyle, what\u2019s up?  I thought we weren\u2019t going to hear from you guys until tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Kyle was 2 years older than Eric, the two of them managed to get along.  \u201cHey man; I-I need to talk with your folks.\u201d<br>\r\nSensing the tone of Kyle\u2019s voice, Eric said, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears starting to stream down his face, Kyle said, \u201cJust get your folks, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle listened as Eric put the phone down; he could hear Eric\u2019s voice in the distance as he called out for his folks.  After what seemed like an eternity, Olivia\u2019s dad picked up, \u201cKyle?  Is everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared up into the trees for a moment, trying to figure out what he was going to say next.  \u201cN-No, Mr. Sheppard; everything\u2019s not alright.\u201d Sniffling, Kyle said, \u201cWe were exploring this cave near where we spent the night when there was an accident.  Olivia...she\u2019s dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence on the other end for a moment, until Mr. Sheppard finally said, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely managing to keep it together at this point, Kyle said, \u201cThere was an accident in the cave; I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened.\u201d Pausing to wipe his face, Kyle said, \u201cOne minute she\u2019s fine; the next minute all that\u2019s left is her arm.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The feds were called in once the machine had been discovered.  They took over once that happened and kindly requested that everyone left the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once everyone was back at the station did the Kyle and girls give statements.  If the police had any suspicions that the group was withholding information, they didn\u2019t mention it.  Eventually Olivia\u2019s family arrived in town; where everyone, including the police, expressed their condolences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Southern Pennsylvania<br>\r\nOne Week Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia\u2019s family took a week to make all the arrangements; interspersed with the obligatory expressing of condolences by friends and family.  The service itself was private; with Kyle, Melissa and Liz being the only non-family in attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was standing around the cemetery plot as they waited for the priest to arrive from the church.  Walking up to Kyle, affectionately taking his hand in hers, Melissa said, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout as well as can be expected, under the circumstances.\u201d Looking over towards Eric, Kyle said, \u201cI\u2019m worried about Eric though; he\u2019s hardly said a word to anyone in 5 days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa had noticed that as well; that Eric had basically shut himself off from everyone around him.  Her younger sister Amanda, who was Eric\u2019s best friend, said he\u2019d ignored every attempt she made to contact him.  \u201cI suppose we can\u2019t really blame him, after all he just lost his sister in some freak accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Melissa still holding his hand, Kyle started walking towards the tree Eric was leaning against.  Once he got close enough, he said, \u201cHey man, how are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Eric\u2019s face as he looked at Kyle was fraught with emotion.  There was a moment of silence before Eric finally said, \u201cI just buried my sister, Kyle; how do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never understood why people ask that question in cases like this.\u201d Leaning against the tree, Kyle said, \u201cI know you\u2019re hurting right now; but we\u2019re all here for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiz told me the same thing at the church.\u201d Sighing, Eric continued, \u201cYou guys were Olivia\u2019s friends; why would you be so concerned about her little brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa and Kyle exchanged looks with each other; with Melissa turning her attention back to Eric.  \u201cYou\u2019re our best friend\u2019s brother, Eric; of course we care about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Olivia\u2019s friends were mourning her loss on Earth; an untold distance away two alien figures were entering a small room.  The shorter of the two, a female, looked at the other and said, \u201cHave you been able to find out any more about our patient, Healer D\u2019Pkeni?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Mercy D\u2019Sora; the High Council won\u2019t tell us more than they already have.\u201d Walking over to a console, Healer D\u2019Pkeni said, <br>\r\n\u201cAll we know is that she\u2019s from Earth and approximately 17 years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercy D\u2019Sora looked through the window at their patient; lying in bed with tubes hooked up to her.  She didn't know much about humanity; but from what little she did knew about them, Mercy D\u2019Sora suspected that the patient would have been considered attractive on Earth.  Turning back to Healer D\u2019Pkeni, she said, \u201cHumanity only achieved rudimentary spaceflight 60 years ago; how could they have advanced this far in such a short amount of time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards a nearby door, Healer D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cAccording to what I\u2019ve been told, she arrived from one of our abandoned bases.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the council going to do now?\u201d Following Healer D\u2019Pkeni through the door, Mercy D\u2019Sora said, \u201cCould this mean they\u2019re ready for us to contact them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping next to the bed, Healer D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that decision is above our pay grade.\u201d Reaching to pull the covers off, he said, \u201cRight now our duty is to ensure her body doesn\u2019t reject her replacement arm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the Healer\u2019s shoulder, Mercy D\u2019Sora saw the new arm they\u2019d spent the last three days growing.  It was nothing like the girl\u2019s original arm; however, instead it was identical in appearance to those belonging to Mercy D\u2019Sora and Healer D\u2019Pkeni \u2013 a dark blue color with four fingers instead of five.</span></div></div>",

She had images of strange looking people standing around her, talking in an unfamiliar language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to regain consciousness once again, she could hear what sounded like beeping coming from somewhere nearby.  Slowly opening her eyes, she looked around and found herself in an unfamiliar room \u2013 unlike anything she\u2019d ever seen before in her life.  The room looked like something out of those campy 80s sci-fi movies Eric was always making her watch with him \u2013 smooth, shiny surfaces everywhere.  <i>Where am I?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be anyone around that she could see; she tried to call out but quickly discovered that her voice was gone.  <i>How long was I out?</i>  Reaching to pull off the covers, Olivia sat up in the bed.  Spotting a nearby doorway, Olivia hopped off the bed; stumbling briefly as her legs felt like Jell-O.  Slowly making her way to the doorway, she peeked inside and found herself inside what could have only been a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the sink, Olivia looked at herself in the mirror; the first thought on her mind being that her hair looked like crap.  Reaching up to quickly run a hand through her hair, Olivia froze when she saw her arm in the mirror.  Gasping in shock, she looked down and saw that her entire arm, going just past her shoulder, was a dark shade of blue.  What surprised her even more was the fact that there were only 4 fingers on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice returning at that moment, Olivia screamed as she stared at the alien appendage.  There must\u2019ve been someone nearby when she started screaming, because Olivia could hear footsteps just outside the door.  Thinking everything was going to be alright, she opened the door and came face to face with a blue-skinned alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Olivia saw before fainting was the alien stepping towards her.</span></div></div>",

Getting a good look at them, she noticed they looked pretty similar except for the fact that the female\u2019s head was oddly shaped.  Looking at a device in his hands, the male said, \u201cHow are you feeling, Terran woman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of questions flooded Olivia\u2019s mind; chief among them being how these aliens spoke perfect English.  \u201cThat\u2019s kind of hard to say,\u201d looking around, she said, \u201cPerhaps you can tell me where I am, and what the hell\u2019s wrong with my arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re on our home world, Maltor Prime.\u201d Moving closer, the female with the odd-shaped head said, \u201cYou were sent here through one of abandoned bases; one of many that we\u2019ve used over the centuries to observe your species.  Due to years of disuse the equipment fell into disrepair, which resulted in a malfunction that caused the loss of your arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the female checked something on a nearby display, the male said, \u201cAs for your arm; well we grew one identical to ours to replace the one you lost.\u201d With a smile, he said, \u201cI must say, I think we did a good job; give it a few days and it\u2019ll be as if you\u2019d been born with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so; I just would\u2019ve preferred one that had five fingers and, you know, wasn\u2019t blue.\u201d Looking at them, Olivia said, \u201cBut I <br>\r\nsuppose I shouldn\u2019t be picky; after all, you saved my life.  So, who do I have to thank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on his chest, the male said, \u201cMy name is Healer D\u2019Pkeni; my assistant is Mercy D\u2019Sora.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Oliva had been speaking with Healer D\u2019Pkeni, Mercy D\u2019Sora had been looking at Olivia\u2019s vitals.  Suddenly something peculiar caught her attention.  Moving towards Olivia, she lowered her gown, \u201cHealer, you should take a look at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia and Healer D\u2019Pkeni looked down to see what had caught Mercy D\u2019Sora\u2019s attention, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she\u2019d fainted, only Olivia\u2019s arm had been blue; now the blue coloration was threatening to take over her right breast.  Scanning Olivia was a small device, D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cIt appears the Maltorian DNA in your arm is slowly overriding your human DNA.\u201d Concerned, he said, \u201cIf this continues, you may well find yourself becoming a Maltorian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me you can stop it.\u201d Worried, Olivia said, \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be alive; but I\u2019m not exactly interested in becoming one of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing like this has happened before, but I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Olivia had been hoping for some company, so she was discouraged to see D\u2019Sora leaving.  Seeing the look on Olivia\u2019s face, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly; I have to finish some rounds before my shift ends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was alone in the room, Olivia took the opportunity to process her current situation.  Waking up on an alien world should\u2019ve had her freaking out, but she was surprisingly calm.  It didn\u2019t take much for her to surmise that she\u2019d been injected with something to keep her calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way for Olivia to know how much time had gone by; she was practicing picking things up with her new arm when D\u2019Sora returned with a tray.  Seeing the pile on the floor, D\u2019Sora figured out what Olivia had been doing, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get the hang of it eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d With a weak smile, Olivia said, \u201cWhat\u2019s on the tray?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might be hungry, so I brought you some food.\u201d As she placed the tray on a nearby table, D\u2019Sora said, \u201cI realize it\u2019s not what you\u2019re used to eating, but it\u2019s quite good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia didn\u2019t have much of an appetite at that moment, so she said, \u201cI\u2019ll save that for later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a chair up to the bed, D\u2019Sora said, \u201cI imagine you must have a lot of questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was an understatement to say the least, Olivia\u2019s mind was filled with questions that she wanted to ask.  But she didn\u2019t want to overwhelm D\u2019Sora, so she decided to only pick a few of them.  \u201cWould it be a stretch for me to assume Mercy isn\u2019t your first name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD\u2019Sora chuckled, \u201cNo, that\u2019s my job title; I\u2019m what you would think of as a nurse.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cMy first name is Maiya, what\u2019s yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out with her new arm, Olivia said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Maiya; my name\u2019s Olivia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo began a back and forth between the two as the two of them each asked questions about their respective cultures.  Olivia learned that Maltorians had a planetary government, with each of the 10 nations represented on a ruling council; that Maltorian women received the same rights as men.  Olivia had to pause when she heard that, saying, \u201cWow; women on Earth are still struggling to be treated equally to men.  My mom makes less than her male coworker for working the same job; one, I might add, that she\u2019s had longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur society was like that for a time; but we moved past that about 100 years ago.\u201d With a smile, Maiya explained, \u201cIn Maltorian society, everyone is treated the same regardless of their background or religion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there different religions here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of; they all worship the goddess Chrestus, but each religion takes a different approach to her teachings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued after that, with Olivia asking how the Maltorians discovered Earth.  Maiya went quiet for a moment before she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching your species for close to 5000 years; but I\u2019m afraid the means of discovery has been lost to time.\u201d Looking at Olivia, Maiya said, \u201cEvery Maltorian child has been taught about your world, but there\u2019s still much I didn\u2019t know.  I thank you for filling in the gaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia had been staring at Maiya\u2019s head off and on during their conversation; becoming fixated on its odd shape.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, Maiya; why is your head shaped differently than D\u2019Pkeni\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe shape of my head is a result of sexual maturity; once a female Maltorian reaches puberty, she undergoes changes much like your species would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia surreptitiously brought a hand up to her head, saying, \u201cWhat are the chances that my head will change shape?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to speculate, I\u2019m not a Healer.\u201d Sighing, Maiya said, \u201cIf I had to venture a guess, I\u2019d say you might experience some changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bird landed outside the window; Olivia looked at it and saw its feathers were colors that she\u2019d never seen before.  But the biggest difference she saw was that it had two sets of wings.  Turning her attention back to Maiya, Olivia said, \u201cAm I able to go outside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Getting up, Maiya said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back with a hover-chair.\u201d</span></div></div>",

On the way Olivia noticed people staring at her and murmuring; it wasn\u2019t a stretch for her to assume they\u2019d never seen a human before.  Leaning towards Olivia as they entered an elevator, Maiya said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re not the shy type, Olivia; because word of your arrival has spread across the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the elevator started its journey downward, Olivia said, \u201cWhat does your religion say about people from another planet?\u201d glancing up at Maiya, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in danger, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u201d Smiling, Maiya said, \u201cChrestus teaches us to protect and cherish all forms of life; even a species as primitive as yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Olivia wanted to lash out at Maiya\u2019s remark; until realizing that she was right, \u201cI suppose, compared to your species, Humans are pretty primitive.\u201d Sitting back as the elevator door opened, Olivia continued, \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll reach this level someday, if we don\u2019t kill each other first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing Olivia down another hall, Maiya said, \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, your species has progressed at a much faster rate than we expected over the last 100 years.\u201d Smiling, she said, \u201cIt took our species 200 years to go from primitive flight to spending people into space; whereas your species landed someone on your moon only 66 years later after your first flight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went outside, Olivia said, \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that Humanity is an enigma?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving down a ramp, Maiya said, \u201cPretty much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia took in her surroundings as Maiya guided her towards a small pond nearby.  The scenery was so familiar that Olivia would\u2019ve easily thought it was Earth, had it not been for the aliens.  As they approached the pond, Olivia could see more birds flying around as well as what appeared to be fish in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even took the opportunity to look at the nearby Maltorians, both young and old.  She smiled to herself when she saw a man sitting under a tree with a pregnant woman.  Turning her attention back to Maiya, she said, \u201cI\u2019m curious, Maiya; how many different intelligent species are out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn this sector of space?  Only three; Maltorians, Humanity and a species called the Creel.\u201d Smiling as she parked the hover-chair and moved to sit next to Olivia, Maiya said, \u201cI think you\u2019d like them; they\u2019re similar to the mermaids of Earth mythology.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat idea interested Olivia, who hoped she\u2019d get to see them some day.  As the two of them sat by the pond for a little while, Olivia looked around and saw the other Maltorians nearby.  Turning her attention to Maiya, she said, \u201cWe spent all this time talking about your culture; but I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid my life\u2019s not all that interesting, Olivia.\u201d Sitting on the ground next to the hover-chair, Maiya said, \u201cMy parents were killed during a robbery 8 years ago; leaving me to raise my little sister by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia frowned when she heard that; saddened to hear what Maiya had experienced, while also feeling disappointed that such things would still happen in an advanced society such as this.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I-I didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize, you were a child living on another planet.\u201d Wiping her face, Maiya said, \u201cUnfortunately that wasn\u2019t the end of my tragic life; I lost my fianc\u00e9 two years ago in a shuttle accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, to liven the mood, Maiya asked Olivia about her life; which she was more than happy to discuss.  Looking at Maiya, as she started to feel homesick, Olivia said, \u201cBe honest; what are the chances that I\u2019ll ever see my family again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaiya was about to answer, when she was suddenly interrupted by someone yelling out, \u201cMaiya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaiya and Olivia turned to see a Maltorian girl, around Olivia\u2019s age, running up to them.  Olivia watched as they greeted each other, interlocking the fingers of one hand while touching foreheads.  \u201cHi D\u2019ana, what brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had some free time so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD\u2019ana stopped midsentence when she spotted Olivia sitting next to Maiya; the look on her face was one of shock.  Feeling uneasy, Olivia said, \u201cHi.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking away from her food, to no one in particular, D\u2019ana said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about everything I said last night; I-I was just angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, D\u2019ana.\u201d Taking a seat next to her daughter, Ma\u2019gi said, \u201cYou were right; your father and I should\u2019ve told you the truth years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip of her juice, D\u2019ana said, \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t be too mad at you guys; after all, I\u2019d probably would\u2019ve died had you not done anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from his food, Narek said, \u201cSo does Olivia know the truth yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Narek, she doesn\u2019t know yet.\u201d Staring at his son from across the table, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cYour mother and I agreed that D\u2019ana should be the one who tells her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there\u2019s no pressure then; Olivia\u2019s still reeling from the last major disruption to her life.\u201d Sighing, D\u2019ana continued, \u201cWhy not add to that by telling her that I\u2019m the older sister everyone thought went missing 16 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up to put his dishes away, Q\u2019uris said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to tell her, I\u2019ll be more than willing to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it should come from me; I\u2019ll just have to figure out how to break it to her gently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nD\u2019ana was on the steps of the Medical Center, having been sitting there for the last 15 minutes trying to get the courage to see Olivia.  She\u2019d already decided on what she was going to say, even going so far as to bring the recorded message as proof.<br>\r\nLooking at the time on a nearby clock, D\u2019ana realized she only 20 minutes before Narek and her friends arrived.  Getting to her feet, D\u2019ana said to herself, \u201cMight as well get this done before they get here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the lift onto the Center\u2019s Intensive Care Ward, D\u2019ana showed her ID to the Guard stationed outside the closed unit.  <br>\r\nNormally there wouldn\u2019t be a guard at the door, but the hospital took added security measures once Olivia had arrived.  Arriving outside Olivia\u2019s door, D\u2019ana took a deep breath before knocking, \u201cOlivia, it\u2019s D\u2019ana; can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds passed before D\u2019ana heard Olivia say, \u201cSure, come on in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD\u2019ana opened the door and stepped inside; only to stop when she saw Olivia standing inside the bathroom door.  It seemed the changes had continued over night; with the blue coloration now reaching the bottom of Olivia\u2019s neck.  Closing the door behind her, D\u2019ana said, \u201cI guess the treatments aren\u2019t really helping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but your dad said that was a possibility.\u201d Getting into bed, Olivia said, \u201cHe was here earlier getting samples to make a more effective treatment.  Also said you had something you needed to tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling a chair up to Olivia\u2019s bedside, D\u2019ana said, \u201cYeah I do; and it\u2019s pretty big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at D\u2019ana, an eyebrow raised, Olivia said, \u201cYou mean bigger than slowly turning into an alien?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, much bigger than that.\u201d Taking several deep breaths, D\u2019ana said, \u201cI\u2019m your older sister.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Is that true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was starting to come back to D\u2019ana at that point, \u201cYes sir; I grew jealous of how she got to grow up with our parents on Earth.  When I saw her monopolizing my friends, I thought she was going to take them from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly; you need to realize that Sorain, Asura and your brother would never replace you.\u201d His face turning sad, D\u2019Pkeni said, <br>\r\n\u201cWhile the Sheppards brought you into this world, they\u2019re not your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, D\u2019ana looked at her father and said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the ones who taught you to walk or talk.  They didn\u2019t bandage your knees when you fell off your pedal-mover.  They didn\u2019t teach you about growing up and becoming a woman.  They certainly didn\u2019t let you cry on their shoulders the first time you got your hearts broken.\u201d Placing a hand on D\u2019ana\u2019s shoulder D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cYou may not be our biological child, but that hasn\u2019t stopped your mother and myself from loving you any less than your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbracing her father, D\u2019ana said, \u201cThanks Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, D\u2019ana.\u201d Getting to his feet, D\u2019Pkeni said, \u201cNow before you go check on Olivia, you should know there\u2019s been some developments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, D\u2019ana said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was under a lot of stress during your fight; stress which appears to have sped up her transformation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, D\u2019ana rushed across the hall to Olivia\u2019s room; only stopping once she was inside and could see what her father was talking about \u2013 the right side of Olivia\u2019s face was completely Maltorian now; her skin was blue and her right eye was now dark blue in color.  D\u2019ana also noticed that Olivia\u2019s head was had started to change shape. </span></div></div>",

If it hadn\u2019t been for the alien technology, Oliva figured this house could have been placed on Earth and no one would have noticed the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out onto the back porch, Olivia sat next to Asura on a couch overlooking the rather expansive backyard.  It was only then that Olivia noticed something she hadn\u2019t before \u2013 there were two stars in the sky.  Turning to Asura, she said, \u201cHow did I not notice there was another star?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face me, a smile on her face, Asura said, \u201cYou just happened to venture outside when Uzras, the closer of the two, was eclipsing Ekela.\u201d Pointing towards the two stars, Asura said, \u201cThey eclipse each other once every 15 days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking about at Uzras and Ekela, putting a hand up to shield my eyes, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sure that makes for some pretty incredible sights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce a year our orbit brings us in line with both of them; the result being some pretty intense auroras.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back on the couch, Olivia said, \u201cI know I\u2019ll be going back soon; but I really wish my friends could see this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Olivia, crossing one leg over the other, Asura said, \u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome to take as many images as you want; in case you\u2019re worried they won\u2019t believe you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m turning into an alien, Asura; they\u2019d have to be pretty dense not to believe me at that point.\u201d Her stomach beginning to growl, <br>\r\nOlivia said, \u201cChanging the subject for a moment; do you have anything for me to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the couch, Asura said, \u201cSure do, follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia obliged and followed Asura into the kitchen; watching as she poured a light brown liquid into a glass.  Taking it from Asura, Olivia said, \u201cForgive me, but this doesn\u2019t exactly look very appealing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust try it, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it.\u201d Smiling, Asura said, \u201cI\u2019m told it tastes similar to an Earth mango.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a fondness for mangos, Olivia took a sip of the liquid and realized Asura was right, \u201cWow; that does taste good!\u201d downing the rest of it, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called neshta juice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouring herself another glass, Olivia said, \u201cI could get used to drinking this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to; because your Maltorian digestive system will have trouble digesting human foods.\u201d Seeing the look on Olivia\u2019s face, Asura said, \u201cThe hits just keeping on coming, don\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang before Olivia had a chance to respond; she instead followed Asura down the hall to the front door.  Once Asura opened the door, Olivia could see D\u2019ana standing there with Narek and Sorain.  Upon seeing Narek, Olivia noticed her heart rate increasing \u2013 there was something about him that she found irresistible.</span></div></div>",

The two of them were keeping to themselves when there was a knock at the door, followed by Mrs. Telfani entering, \u201cIt\u2019s time for dinner, girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Olivia was silent on the outside, she was groaning on the inside.  In her brief time among them, Olivia had learned Maltorians had some strange customs.  The one she couldn\u2019t wrap her head around was that every meal was eaten while naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while Asura stripped off her clothes, Olivia hesitated to do so.  She didn\u2019t need a constant reminder that her body was going to look different with each passing meal.  Eventually, with some gentle persuading from Asura, Olivia disrobed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how the blue was now almost to her waist, Olivia sighed.  Coming up behind her, Asura said, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know, Asura; I can\u2019t help but worry that very soon there will be nothing human left of me.\u201d Gesturing to her feet, she said, \u201cLook at my toes; you can see one of them has already started to shrivel up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on Olivia\u2019s shoulder, Asura said, \u201cYou\u2019re worrying too much about something you can\u2019t control.  I\u2019m sure <br>\r\nD\u2019ana\u2019s father is doing everything he can to slow down the changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the door, Olivia said, \u201cYeah, well he better work harder; or it\u2019ll be impossible to prove to anyone on Earth that I am who I say I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing downstairs, Olivia saw that Asura\u2019s parents were already seated at a table \u2013 one similar in design to oriental tables she\u2019d seen on TV.  Once they were all seated, the family offered prayers to the Maltorian goddess, Chrestus.  The fact that the Maltorians worshiped a female was a pleasant change of pace, since most on Earth worshiped male gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Olivia had trouble with was the Maltorian cuisine; in this case something called penghou, similar in appearance to Earth squid.  Olivia didn\u2019t mind that; instead she had trouble with the fact that it was alive, its tentacles exploring her face as she tried eating it.  Olivia knew she didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter; especially if what Asura had said about her digestive system proved to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Mr. Telfani said, \u201cSo girls; is there anything new with either of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking up from her plate, Asura said, \u201cOlivia\u2019s infatuated with someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Telfani looked at Olivia as the latter shot Asura an angry look, \u201cIs this true, Kitling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, realizing she had no choice, Olivia said, \u201cIt\u2019s Narek, one of Asura\u2019s friends; I can\u2019t really explain it but he does something for me.\u201d Absently patting her head, Olivia said, \u201cIs this how that val'shalo starts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my place, dear.\u201d Pausing, Mrs. Telfani said, \u201cHowever I might suggest you stop touching your head like that; at least while at the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Olivia said, \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe head is an erogenous zone for Maltorian females.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia practically sat on her hands.  <i>Chrestus</i>, she thought, <i>give me strength.</i></span></div></div>",

Eventually, Asura said, \u201cIt\u2019s just after 8:00 in the morning, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying back in bed, Olivia said, \u201cNothing major, I was just wondering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she closed her eyes, Olivia wondered what her friends and family were doing at that moment.</span></div></div>",

Therefore,\u201d sighing, the High Minister said, \u201csince Olivia will be one of us soon enough; she\u2019ll be subject to the same laws as any other Maltorian would.  The Council has spoken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the High Minister and the Council members rose as one and left the chamber; signifying that both the discussion, and the audience, had ended.  Healer D'Pkeni remained behind for a moment, his head hung low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had, of course, know this could be the outcome; but he had nevertheless hoped the Council would do the right thing and allow Olivia one last visit to Earth \u2013 even if it was only to say good bye.

It\u2019s their opinion that humans aren't ready yet to know of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD'Ana flung herself at him, hugging him while beating his back with her fists. \"Why? Why, Father, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nD\u2019Pkeni had expected this from his daughter; D\u2019ana was, at times, a very emotional person.  However when he realized Olivia wasn\u2019t doing the same, he looked up to see that she was clutching her sheets with both hands.  Looking at D\u2019Pkeni, she said, \u201cCo-Could I have some time alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow D'Pkeni understood; he\u2019d learned, over the years, that many humans preferred privacy when having their emotional displays. Clearly, Olivia was one of these. \"Come D'Ana; your mother is no doubt waiting for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Olivia was alone, she got up and went to the bathroom to look at her reflection.  Her transformation to a Maltorian had continued unabated.  <i>Guess there\u2019s no point in slowing the changes anymore.</i>  Her right breast was now completely blue, with the skin around the blue showing signs of changing color. <i>How would my boyfriend react</i>, she thought, <i>if he saw me like this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a rare fit of anger, Olivia lashed out and pushed the mirror with her first; causing the glass to the shatter and her hand to become all bloody.</span></div></div>",
