You lost touch during your college and university years, only to be reunited when you were admitted to hospital and she was the attenting nurse....with a few more kilos on her frame.  Tall, blonde, and a belly gainer, with a quiet but gentle personality.  You're on a trip to the south of France for a much needed break.  She hopes she can lose the weight before you notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mia</b><br>\r\nMia is a Spanish girl you met as you took a class in the language for your job.  You hit it off straight away, and you both opened up about having a fat kink.  Shorter than you, with taned skin and jet black hair, she's definitely a bottom-heavy girl, and aiming to get heavier.  She has a confident, flirtacious personality, and will happily show it in publicYou're on a trip to her hometown to see her mother.  Will the homecoming help or hinder her already wide waistline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ashley</b><br>\r\nNerdy, gothic, and busty.  The three best words to descride Ashley.  You met through an online D&amp;D group, and again on an MMO.  You met up, started dating, and eventually got married.  Being a nerdy girl who disliked exercise almost as much as she loved pizza, she was already a hiefer when you met.  And while she doesn't exactly share your infatuation with her size, she has little motivation to lose any of it.  You're making a road trip to have an extended in person D&amp;D campaign with a group member in Scotland.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mia sat fanning herself as you both waited for the taxi, the hot Spanish sun bearing down on her.  At her size, though, it was hardly surprising.  With her massive thighs spread to accommodate her sagging belly, she took up nearly two thirds of the bench she rested on.  Dressed in only a white tank top and denim booty shorts, there was nothing about her flabby, mocha coloured form that was left to the imagination.   Her belly  pushed the shirt up while her large, heavy breasts kept it pinned, nipples showing through the thin fabric.  Her gut strained the front of her high-waisted shorts, causing her to rub the band in discomfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, these shorts are so tight!  I knew we should have gotten a bigger size!\u201d  She complained, looking over to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you remember, there was no bigger size.  I\u2019m certain you said you were going to cut back for our trip so they fit properly.\u201d  You look over at your wife\u2019s body testing the poor button to it\u2019s limits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only response was to smirk seductively at you.  \u201cYou know you love it.  It\u2019s not like you would ever help me do a silly thing like diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.  But if those shorts weren\u2019t so tight I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have got you into the plane seat.\u201d  You recall the flight over in great detail.  From her hips getting wedged in the door, the third seatbelt extender, and the look on the hostess\u2019s face when she realised you were a party of two instead of three.  Most of all, there was the ordeal of getting your overfed wife into the seat.  Had her gut been allowed to hang free, it would never have fit.  Restricted as it was, there was a solid inch of space between it and the back of the seat in front.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still wish they\u2019d served a proper meal in flight\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were only on the plane two hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt takes a lot to keep me full, you know that.\u201d  She rested her hand on top of her belly.  \u201cDo you think we could get the taxi driver to pull through McDonald\u2019s?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can ask him now, I think this is us.\u201d  Case in one hand, you extend the other to help Mia to her feet.  Approaching the car, you notice the driver casually moving the passenger seat forward.  Opening the door for her, you allow Mia to squeeze herself in, suspension noticeably rocking as the weight was put on it.  As you get in the other side, Mia poses the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind swinging by the drive through?  It\u2019s on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His only comment was to ask that you make sure you took all of the waste with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he set off, Mia started on her fries, which lasted her all of a minute.  Handing the empty box to you, she exchanged it for one of her bacon burgers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was a slightly messy eater, and she wasn\u2019t being helped by the motion of the car.  As she took a bite, the sauce began to drip.  And as it went over a speed bump, a rather large drop fell onto her exposed chest.  She wiped it off with a finger, leaving a red smear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was eating her last Big Mac, her white top hand been stained by every burger.  Pushing the last bite in, she looks over to you and shakes her gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, if I was slimmer, all of that would be on the car.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were slimmer, you wouldn\u2019t have had that order.\u201d  You remark, passing her the milkshake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point there.\u201d  She laughs.  Frowning at the stains on her top, she let out a sigh.  \u201cI hope Mama has some spare clothes there.\u201d  Taking the lid off, she began chugging her milkshake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d  The driver remarked from the front, pulling up outside a single storey house close to the beach.  Grabbing the empty takeaway bag, you dart around to the other side to help Mia out.  As she squeezed herself out, the top half of her belly became completely exposed as her top rode all the way up.  You could see how it was bulging over the waistband of her shorts enough that it nearly covered the button.  As you sorted the fare out, she went back to her milkshake<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They both threw their fat arms open for a hug, but as Mia entered the doorway, her hips became predictably stuck.  She grunted and braced her arms on the doorframe, shimmying herself slowly through.  You wait patiently behind her, enjoying the show of her jiggling rump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last spurt of effort, she finally comes unstuck.  Suddenly free, her body ripples with the motion, all of it on full show for you.  Rubbing her hips where the doorframe pinched them, she sighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have that door widened, Mama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should.  It\u2019s not suitable for a well-fed woman now is it?\u201d  Smiling at each other, they embrace, their guts squishing together and keeping their arms from joining behind each other.  When they release, she turns her attention to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is who I\u2019ve got to thank for looking after you then, Mia?  I\u2019m Gabriella.\u201d  She pulls you into a deep hug, your body sinking into her fat in much the same way it did with her daughter.  Releasing you, she ushers you inside.  \u201cI\u2019m making some quesadillas, do you want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, Mia has already agreed enthusiastically.  Noticing your expression, she slaps her belly.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to keep this here if I turn down food am I?\u201d  As she looks down, she remembers the state of her shirt.  \u201cMama, Do you have a shirt I can borrow?  I got sauce on this one.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one hung up in my room.  Be quick, your sister should be home soon.\u201d  Sticking her head through the kitchen door, Gabriella calls to you.  \u201cMake yourself at home in the lounge, dear.\u201d  Following her advice, you drop yourself onto a well-worn armchair.  Listening to the sounds of activity in the kitchen, you feel at home already.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not long before your wife re-emerges from her mother\u2019s room, pulling a blue shirt over her front.  She struggles to button it, giving up on the last two.  \u201cMama, this shirt\u2019s a little small for me.\u201d  Looking at her, you can see the buttons over her belly being pulled apart.  And when she drops herself onto the sofa, three buttons over her belly simply fly apart.  As you share a quiet laugh about it, you hear sounds at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, she\u2019s here!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear a lot of commotion coming from the door.  A lot of straining grunts, heavy breathing, and creaking floorboards.  A woman\u2019s voice pitifully whines out \u201cOh come ooooooonnnn\u2026.\u201d  Looking over to Mia, she gives you an explanation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister is a little heavier than Mama and I.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long minutes, the noises from the door stop and you hear the heavy, laboured breaths and groaning floorboards approach you.  And as they enter the room, you see that \u2018a little heavier\u2019  was an understatement. Mia\u2019s sister was quite possibly the fattest woman you had seen.   Even her wide hips, which seemed to be a family trait, are overshadowed by the size of her gut, hanging below her knees and sticking out far in front.  Encased in a black tank top and knee length skirt that looked to be on their last legs, it was kept relatively still.  With barely a greeting, she collapses on the sofa next to Mia, gasping for air.  You notice that the frame is bowed where she\u2019s sat, obviously warped from the constant abuse of her weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once she had regained her breath did she finally address the two of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sis, Mama told me you were coming today.  I just got held up at work.\u201d  She notices your surprised face.  \u201cWhat, don\u2019t believe I can hold down a job at my weight?\u201d  Acting offended, she keeps up the act long enough to let you start to apologise, before laughing it off.  \u201cIt\u2019s fine.  I don\u2019t think I should be able to either.  But someone has to pay the food bill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, I think Mama\u2019s finished.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, a few seconds later, Gabriella waddled through with two serving platters piled high with cheese stuffed tortillas, with what looked like pulled pork stuffed in as well.  Rather than set them down on the small table between the chairs and sofa, she simply handed them to Mia and her sister, and gave you a small plate with a couple on.  For herself she likewise had a smaller plate, though with several more than you.  In preparation for the meal, you notice Mia\u2019s sister pull her belly out from her skirt, sighing with relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much room for chatter once the two girls started gorging themselves.  You knew how much Mia could eat anyway, but seeing someone match her was something else.  It almost seemed like she was eating faster than usual, trying to compete with her larger sister.  You feel as though your suspicions are confirmed at the end, by the glower she sends her sister as she finishes while Mia still has a quesadilla on her tray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gabriella slowly rises to her feet, you feel obligated to step in and volunteer to wash the dishes.  After a short debate while she tells you to sit yourself down, you head through, leaving the women to catch up over a cup of rich, cream-heavy coffee.  If you listen closely, you catch snippets of their conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Sis.  What are you doing for work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a call centre.  It\u2019s pretty quiet, and I hardly get any calls.  Mostly I just sit on my fat ass and eat pastries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting paid for what you do best, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much.  What about you?  You must have something relaxed, with how much you\u2019ve put on since I saw you last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t work.  I found a man to look after me.  So I do the same as you:  Sit on my fat ass and eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tune out as you remember the countless times you\u2019ve come home to find your wife sprawled on the sofa, surrounded by empty snack wrappers and plates, bloated belly on full display.  The first few times she gave a guilty look, but as she grew fatter she realised how much it appealed to you, and it began to happen more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tune back in to the conversation as you finish up and walk back through to where the bloated women are sat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......And then she had the cheek to say I should cover up more!\u201d  Mia\u2019s sister was saying, a displeased look on her face.  \u201cLike, it\u2019s not my fault my clothes don\u2019t fit properly.  Okay maybe it is, but my point stands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia stifles a yawn, but it doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by her mother.  \u201cI think you two should go ahead and unpack, rest after a long day.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds a plan.\u201d  Mia replies, rocking forward to get the momentum to stand.  As she does, she lays a hand on top of her stuffed gut.  \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy that.\u201d  She quietly grumbles as she waddles ahead of you to the guest bedroom.  Though the doors inside were wider than the front, you see her hips are dangerously close to touching the sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapses onto the bed, springs creaking in protest.  \u201cI feel like I can barely move, I\u2019m that stuffed.  I had forgotten how good Mama\u2019s cooking is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou definitely seemed to be enjoying yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like you weren\u2019t.  I noticed how much you were watching me.  I know you love how much I eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I\u2019m busted then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess you are.  But while you\u2019ve got that tent there ...\u201d  She leans back and spreads her fat thighs.  \u201cHelp me get these shorts off and stuff me the other way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sat just to your right on her towel was Mia, snacking on two ice creams.  Clad in a black string bikini that should have been replaced several kilos ago, she was a gorgeous sight.  Her fat breasts spill out all around the fabric, while the thin strap is nearly completely hidden by her back fat.  Her double rolled belly covers the front and most of the side, while her massive rear quietly claims every bit of material every time she moves.  Although there wasn\u2019t much of a danger with that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Babe?

Looking annoyed, she snatches it off of you and throws it on, showing that it was more obsolete than her bikini.  The low cut made it hardly more decent than her bikini, and her belly took up so much of the material that there was only a small amount of material to cover her front.  More than those, was the fact that her backside had grown to such a size since it was purchased that only the top half was really covered, leaving the rest to sag out of the bottom, jiggling for all to see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia\u2019s family home was visible from the beach.  The route was a nearly straight road for five hundred meters, and down a side street.  The road was on a rather steep hill, and to your lack of surprise, Mia was not enthusiastic about the walk up it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have to be back for that pizza we could just wait for the bus.\u201d  She grumbles as she hauls herself up the path, already sweating.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest of the climb is spent at a crawl, with her using the wall as a guide to try and ease her shaky legs.   By the time you arrive back at Gabriella\u2019s, she\u2019s coated in sweat and wheezing fiercely.  After the regular ordeal of getting her through the door, she drops onto the sofa next to her sister.  (who you now know is called Sofia). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve just run a\u2026\u2026..well, any running really.\u201d  Sofia comments through a mouthful of crisps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2026...am\u2026..never\u2026.*&lt;i&gt;huff&lt;/i&gt;* ...doing that...AGAIN!\u201d  She manages to force out.  Sofia rests a reassuring hand on her shoulder and offers her the family sized back she\u2019s holding.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got pizza on the way\u201d  Mia nonetheless grabs a large handful and shoves them in her mouth.   With both girls eating, it lasts about a minute.  And within five, they were complaining about their hunger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is iiiitt?\u201d  Sofia whines, rubbing her vast belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve hardly eaten today.\u201d Mia chimes in, pouting.  The sundress has come off, and she\u2019s back in her too small bikini.   Quietly, you wonder if the past four hours with an endless supply of ice cream counts as \u2018hardly eating\u2019.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, you\u2019re saved by Gabriella with the pizzas, and the girls are once again kept busy gorging themselves.  To you, it almost seems like the two of them are trying to compete with how quickly they devour their meals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end, the sister are breathing heavily, massaging their bellies as best they can.  That is, until Gabriella says: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you girls want dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come on, these fit when we bought them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve gotten fatter since then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia stops her complaining for a second.  \u201cHave I?\u201d  She looks down at her exposed belly.  \u201cI can\u2019t tell a difference.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have, believe me.  Especially since we came here.  Both you and Sofia have.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we have been eating a lot recently.\u201d  She mused.  With a serious look on her face, she looks at you.  \u201cI know we both like me being a fatass, but am I getting too big now?  Do I need to cut back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no!  I\u2019d never complain about there being more of this!\u201d  You grab her lowest belly roll.  \u201cI just think we\u2019ll need to take a shopping trip soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that means you\u2019d love me more if I was Sofia\u2019s size then.\u201d  Something in her tone sounded irritated, and you knew you needed to choose your words carefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t love you any more, Mia.\u201d  You say, planting a small kiss on her cheek.  \u201cObviously, you being as fat as you are is a massive turn on, and if you keep getting bigger I\u2019ve got no problem with it.  But don\u2019t think you need to be that big for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming satisfied, she returns your kiss, and you use that opportunity to button her capris.  Before they can fly open again, you claps the belt, forcing Mia\u2019s flab to ooze over the top.  A plain white t-shirt follows, the hem just long enough to cover her protruding roll.  You help her to her feet, causing the shirt to ride up.  As she pulls it back down, she inspects her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right, babe.  I must be getting bigger.  This is digging into my arms really bad.\u201d  She holds them out for you to see how her arm fat is being constricted by the short sleeves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both make you way through the house, Mia in front, waving to Gabrialla as you pass the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy yourselves you two!\u201d  She calls, bust over the oven.  By the size of the pot, she\u2019s cooking for herself and Sofia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick your heads in the living room to say goodbye to Sofia, seeing her sprawled in her usual space on the sofa, massive gut covering her lap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye Sis!  And bye to you too, stud!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t seem to tell if the nickname was meant to be comedic or flirty, but you\u2019re saved from thinking too hard about it by Mia loudly exclaiming \u201cOh for God\u2019s sake!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, you see what\u2019s happened.  She\u2019s forgotten the width of the door compared to her incredible hips, and tried to go through forwards instead of sideways like usual.  And predictably, gotten stuck.  She tries bracing herself and wiggling her hips like she did on the first day, but her added poundage means that all this accomplishes is a tidal wave rolling across her backside.  She looks over her shoulder at you pleadingly.  And, never one to pass up a chance to get your hands on her arse, you get behind her and push, squeezing just a little more than you probably need to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your help, she\u2019s out in less than a minute, although with a couple of sore spots on her hips.  Slowly, she eases herself into her mother\u2019s car with not a few grunts of effort.  As you climb in the driver\u2019s side, you notice how her hips are spilling over above the handbrake.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was barely a snack!  Babe, you\u2019re gonna need to go somewhere else, my belly needs food in it, and soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot five minutes later, you were sat at the local Burger King, watching Mia devour four large meals and two cokes.

As taut as her belly looked as she got back in the car, as much discomfort as she showed as you went over a speed bump, you still came back to her home with two empty KFC bags.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drops onto the sofa and unleashes her belly from it\u2019s confines, you start to wonder if there\u2019s something more to her eating than her usual gluttony.

She has some trouble with a second pair of hands.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of how much fatter Mia\u2019s sister is than her, you\u2019re not surprised.  \u201cThat\u2019s not an issue.\u201d  You tell her.  \u201cYou deserve some quality time with your mum.\u201d  Looking her over, you raise an eyebrow.  \u201cYou going out like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia\u2019s outfit was clearly not suited for her current size.  She had on a low cut grey top which barely covered her top belly roll and showed off almost all of her cleavage, and a denim miniskirt which looked painted on over her arse and looked painfully tight across her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?  Afraid someone\u2019s going to try and pick me up?\u201d  She strikes a sexy pose, jutting her hefty breasts out and pouting her lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could pick you up, baby.\u201d  Looking her over again, you can\u2019t help but comment again.  \u201cGod you look so FAT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I might.\u201d  She smirks at you, slapping her belly.  \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget:  it\u2019s your job to keep me this fat, so anything I but today is on you.  Of course, I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d  She says this last as she strokes your erect cock through your jeans, before slipping her hand into your pocket and withdrawing your credit card.  \u201cBye babe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun\u2026\u201d You call after her, mesmerised by her swaying, rippling booty.  Watching her out of the door, you remain stood there until you\u2019re snapped out of it by the sounds of extreme effort from Sofia\u2019s room.  You quickly grab yourself a drink from the kitchen and flop onto the sofa to avoid looking strange, but you needn\u2019t have rushed.  Even with her door being wider than all the others, you still hear her struggle with it.  The steps that come towards you are slow, heavy, and each one accompanied by some gasp or pant.  And as she slowly shuffles into the room, your jaw drops.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia lumbers in almost naked.  The only discernible article of clothing you saw was a crop to over her braless chest, barely keeping her decent.  As she moves slowly past you, a small amount of visible purple fabric betrays that she is indeed wearing underwear.  As she collapses onto the sofa next to you, chest heaving, she notices your eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Stud, what\u2019s up?\u201d  She asks, before looking herself over.  \u201cOh, yeah.  I never thought about that.  I just really don\u2019t like forcing myself into clothes when I don\u2019t have to.\u201d  Reaching to her side, she grabs a jumbo bag of pretzels.  \u201cSo, you gonna put the TV on, or are we going to sit here in silence all day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, being alone with Sofia was strange.  You couldn\u2019t put your finger on if she was just being friendly, or if there was more to it.  And above all, you weren\u2019t quite sure how to react to someone as big as she was.  With everything out in the open, you could really tell the difference in size between Mia and her.  Where Mia was incredibly well endowed in the booty department, Sofia\u2019s, while still huge, seemed deflated by the sheer weight put on it by the rest of her.  Her belly extended all the way to her knees, one single orb instead of Mia\u2019s two jiggling rolls.  And while your wife was nowhere near flat chested, Sofia\u2019s breasts were on another level.  Full, fat, and huge, they stretched her top enough to keep them from sagging too much, and her thick nipples could be seen through the material.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-cks.  Hey!  You listening?\u201d  Your examination is broken off by a fat finger poking you and Sofia giving you an odd look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, miles away.  What did you say?\u201d  You attempt to recover the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said do you want some snacks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, no, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia shrugs, and begins to heave herself up.  Mia took only five minutes to get up from the sofa.  It took her sister fifteen, and she was breathing incredibly harshly from the effort.  As she stands, she throws her ham like arms back, exposing the underside of her breast to you.  You can\u2019t decide if she looked at you by chance after, or if she meant to do that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When she lumbered back with what looked like half the pantry and three litres of cola, you thought that would be it for a while.  How wrong you were.  After less than an hour, she was heaving herself up again, and this time brushed her hip against you as she did it.  A hard certainty was arising in your mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to her third time getting up though, it was clear the effort it was requiring.  This was probably what Mia meant when she said Sofia struggled alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraciously, you volunteer yourself for snack duty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re just a knight in shining armour, aren\u2019t you?\u201d  She laughs, before emptying her cola.  \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say you were trying to seduce me.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the day, you began to see just how much Sofia struggled with even the most basic of tasks.  Even without the need to get up every time she was hungry, there were still problems.  She couldn\u2019t reach the remote because it was under her side fat, and her arms couldn\u2019t bend to grab it.  She knocked her bottle over and almost passed out trying to reach it before you noticed.  When she ordered a fast food delivery, she had to rest the phone on her gut with speaker on because she seemed incapable of keeping her arm up for that long.  And, after she was done eating enough to feed your whole family back home, she seemed completely out of breath.  You watch her pathetic attempts to gather her empty boxes around her girth for a few minutes before coming to help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you drop her off her post-meal cake and two pints of cream, you\u2019re amazed by how fast it goes down.  One pint on the cake before it\u2019s inhaled, with the second being chugged straight down.  She caps her binge off with a loud belch, before slowly massaging what parts of her belly she can reach.  It\u2019s pitiful, really, how she can\u2019t even ease her digestion after a meal because she can\u2019t move her fat arms around the whole of her even fatter belly.  Indeed, it didn\u2019t seem to be helping her any.  All that seemed to be happening was her huge expanse of flesh was rippling, arms wobbling, breasts swinging\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not sure how long it was before Sofia coughed pointedly, and you noticed that while her flab was still moving, the rest of her wasn\u2019t, and she was watching you watch her with a playful smirk on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, are you just going to watch me struggle?  Or are you going to help out and give my poor belly a nice rub?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re completely taken aback.  \u201cI\u2026...What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I know you're a guy that likes a bigger girl.  Surely you want to feel what a &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; fat belly is like.\u201d  She slowly massages again with one hand.  As she does so, she grips and plays with the fat, moving it like fresh dough.  \u201cYou can\u2019t be satisfied with how skinny Sis is right?  Just get it out of your system now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re conflicted.  She is right, you do love your girls as fat as possible, and you\u2019d be lying if you said you never thought about Sofia in that way.  But would it be rude to Mia?  Or could it be a good thing?  Maybe knowing would remove the distraction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to do it.  Kneeling in front of her, as you did with Mia after so many binges, you placed your hands on her belly and firmly rubbed her taut midsection.  Grasping and releasing the expanse, moving your hands down from the top in small circles.  You\u2019re struck by the sheer amount of flesh to work with.  Before now, you would never have referred to Mia\u2019s gut as \u2018small\u2019, but Sofia\u2019s was positively enormous.  You find yourself getting sucked in by it\u2019s pliant size, the hundreds of kilos of excess fat meaning that even when stuffed it was still mostly soft.  And, at the end, your hands find their way to just beneath her heavy breasts, your face level with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on.  One squeeze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey overflow your hands as you grope, nipples hard and tactile even through her top.  Heavy, laden with fat.  It\u2019s an effort to compress them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia breaks you off with a playful slap.  \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure you had more than one, but I\u2019ll let you off.  I\u2019ve got to go and get dressed before Mama and Sis come home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock and knelt on the floor, the sudden change in mood startles you.  \u201cWhat?  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I only dressed like this for your benefit.  Sis might think something\u2019s strange if I\u2019m nearly nude when we\u2019re alone together.\u201d  With great effort, she hefts herself forwards.  \u201cLet\u2019s just keep this a secret, yeah?\u201d  With a peck on the cheek, she lumbers away, and soon you hear grunts of effort and wardrobe doors slamming.  By the time she gets back you\u2019ve recovered a little, and she shows no sign of acknowledging what the two of you did.  And you\u2019re saved the awkwardness by the arrival of you wife and mother in law.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re baaaaack!\u201d  Shouts Mia, leading the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear, I hope you had a high limit on that thing.\u201d  Gabriella sighs, though not really unhappily.  \u201cMia didn\u2019t stop eating all day.\u201d  And as your wife waddles into view, you notice that her skirt is completely open, fat spilling out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me, hot stuff.  There\u2019s plenty of time to get me an appetite before Mama makes dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no objections, and happily follow Mia into your bedroom.  Despite her advanced size, she\u2019s still active in bed, even riding you cowgirl until you cry uncle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s just the tickle at the back of your mind considering how she\u2019d be if she were bigger<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After hours looking, the only things you found that she could justify spending her money on were the numerous food stalls.  And as the afternoon drew in, she grew irritated, and bought the first thing that managed to fit.  It was a pale blue button up dress, which she claimed it was too hot to wear.  So she came home the same way she left: In her bikini top, and the shorts she wore to fly in, not even bothering to try and fasten them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look behind you to watch her struggle with the short walk from the bus stop at the end of the street, you think maybe it wasn\u2019t a total bust after all.  Seeing her completely on show and wobbling around was a pretty sweet deal.  You wait a few minutes for her to get ahead of you at the door, just to watch her beautiful backside jiggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step in, though, Gabriella accosts you with a grim look on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you go in there, you should know:  Sofia got fired today, and she\u2019s seriously upset about it.  Try to be gentle with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull of concern for her sister, Mia bolts through to the living room, despite already being out of breath from her walk.  You follow her, and note the sight as you sit yourself down while Mia tries to get the breath to speak.  There are no less than eight empty litre cartons of ice cream strewn around, with a ninth on it\u2019s way to being added to the pile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sis.  Mama told us what happened.  Wanna talk about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough sniffles, Sofia starts to talk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI went into work like normal this morning, and someone told me the lift wasn\u2019t working.  I just laughed.  People keep telling me that as a joke.  But it really wasn\u2019t.  And when I saw my manager, he just said I\u2019d need to use the stairs.  And I tried, I really did!  But then I...I collapsed after the fifth step and tore the handrail off.  When my manager came to see what the noise was he just told me not to come back!\u201d  With her story told, Sofia turned back to her comfort, eating through the tears.  Mia rests a hand on her shoulder.  In your mind, gears are turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that means you\u2019re classed as unfit to work right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia glares at you.  \u201cYeah, thanks.  Like that\u2019s not the issue here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no!  What I mean is, you don\u2019t have to!  If you\u2019ve had to be let go for a medical condition - which you were - You can get a disability allowance.  They\u2019ll even kit you out with a few things to help you out at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis grabs Sofia\u2019s attention.  \u201cR-Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.  You just need to make the call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, after just a week, Sofia gets delivery of a brand new mobility scooter, as well as getting work paid for to widen the front door, much to Mia\u2019s delight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook babe!  I\u2019m not stuck!\u201d  She shouts with glee from the doorway, gesturing at the 15cm of room either side of her.  Privately, you\u2019re a little sad that you won\u2019t be getting to push her free again.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew it had a large selection of stores that catered to the \u2018curvier\u2019 girl, and were curious to see whether or not Mia could find something that fit.  So far only two stores in and she had a loose dress a size too small and an overloaded tray of Burger King.  Several other patrons were turning their heads to look at your glutton of a wife, packed into the dress she had bought just days ago, already looking tight across her gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next store, she goes in to try on a pair of leggings and a workout top.  As she waddles out, you wonder why workout gear even comes in these sizes.  But, clothes that fit are always a buy.  And of course, waddling to a shop means she needs another pit stop to replenish her energy, this time with donuts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next shop, and it\u2019s a plain shirt and miniskirt that looks painted on.  The gaps in the buttons make it clear it\u2019s not the right size, but after seeing your interest, she buys it without a second thought.  And a couple of crepes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the trip, Mia has eaten a full meal for every one of the thirteen shops you have visited, with one outfit per shop.  Not one fits properly, all of them showing skin or being on the verge of being shredded by her massive frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you get out of the shower, walk into the bedroom, and see her in the tight shirt and skirt from earlier, as well as a stack of pizzas, that really doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue at all\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even the uniform she got a week ago looks stretched.  Behind the counter sits the morbidly obese form of Mia.  No other cahier is sat, but obviously whoever her boss is realised that she would never be able to stand for a shift.  Not that you can see her stool, just the sides of her cheeks sagging over the sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take two whoppers to eat in, and an extra large woman to go.

The movement has already caused her uniform to ride up over her new third roll.  Slowly, she squeezes herself into the booth and starts eating along with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, the best thing about this job is the free food.\u201d  She says through a full mouth.

It\u2019s been a few months since she started work, and the constant supply of free food has done wonders for her figure.  Her three-rolled belly sags nearly to her knees when she stands, slapping against her thighs as she waddles.  Her arse and hips are twice as wide as her shoulders, which themselves are so laden with fat they nearly merge with her neck.  Her arms are thicker than some people\u2019s waists, unable to properly rest at her sides.  Today she has attempted to cover herself in a black tshirt that only covers her topmost roll, and an enormous short denim skirt.  You can see the sweat glistening on her belly as she begs Sofia to slow down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia finally notices her sister\u2019s strained calls and brings her scooter to a stop.  Her bountiful flab wobbles with the change in velocity, ripples cascading across her body.  If Mia had gotten bigger, it was nothing compared to her sister.  With the threat of physical movement removed, Sofia did little else apart from sit in her scooter seat and eat.  As such, it was difficult to get a handle on her real size, but she was definitely one of the fattest people you had ever seen.  Through her thin dress, the only thing that could fit her, you saw her belly sagged between her massive thighs in the middle, and spread across them over her knees.  Her chest had succumbed to the effects of gravity, heavy breasts hanging to the sides of her gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Sis!  It only has one speed you know.\u201d  She looks at the readout and grumbles.  \u201cIt was faster than this before though.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026...it\u2019s\u2026...still\u2026..too...fast!  Right\u2026.Babe?\u201d  Mia leans heavily on a lamppost to try regaining her breath, breathing harshly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, you\u2019re not much better.  Since Mia told you you didn\u2019t need to diet, it was safe to say you let yourself go.  And as such, you\u2019ve managed to cross the line over to \u2018obese\u2019.  Your gut bulges over the waistband of your jeans, no belt needed.  Your chest is even showing signs of developing a nice pair of man-boobs.  And although not as badly as Mia, you find yourself struggling to keep up with the scooter.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even so, nearly forty minutes after setting off, you arrive, gasping for breath and sweating hard.  You can\u2019t seem to help yourself from getting bigger.  Your fat gut hangs low, completely covering your crotch when you stand, legs forcing you into an all-too-familliar waddle.  A definite set of man boobs rest on your chest, causing a crease in your shirt.  Not even having the energy to stand in line, you go to your regular booth and drop into it, with only a little wrangling of your belly to get it under the table.  Wearily, you wave over to Mia at the counter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you, she waves back, although from the puff of air she takes and the way she flops her arm down shows that such exercise is unwanted.  As you watch her, you notice that she seems to be having trouble with the screen.  She\u2019s had to sit too far away to comfortably reach due to the obstruction of her gut.  Her coworkers are serving several times faster than her, and it\u2019s with a slight shake of the head that her manager releases her from her shift.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she manages to make it to your booth, she looks ready to keel over.  No food in her arms, two of the new hires bring the heaping trays over while Mia strains and wriggles her way into the booth.  Eventually getting seated as your third tray is set down, the top roll of her gut bulges over the table.  Struggling to swing her massive arms towards her food, still gasping for air, she makes a truly helpless sight.  Not that you\u2019re in much of a position to talk.

But right now, after all of your exertions, you still feel a gnawing hunger.  Mia evidently feels the same, grabbing her phone and clumsily tapping away at the screen with her fat digits.  And soon, two of her coworkers have come out with more of the same.  She looks at you and shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve gotten an appetite to go with that gut of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re just glad you were there to see it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month after your bedroom mishap, you did your usual trip to see Mia at work.  And score some free burgers.  At Mia\u2019s counter, the line seemed longer than usual.  Stepping to the side, you see the problem.  Her arms weren\u2019t long enough to comfortably reach the screen in front of her, meaning she needed to lean forwards.  And, as well as the strain of keeping that much weight pulled, it caused her belly to block the bottom of the screen.  It was an hour into her shift, and she was sweating despite the A/C.  Breathing heavily, she took a break for a moment to have a milkshake, much to the annoyance of both her manager and the customers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her manager had had enough, and strolled over to her.  Mia sensed the situation, trying to rotate herself on the undersized stoll to face judgement.  And that movement dropped her to the floor as the slim steel legs buckled.  You winced.  It was clear what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Mia took it quite well.  Sat on the sofa, Gabriella on one side and Sofia on the other, they comforted her as she comforted herself with a tray of brownies fresh from her Mama\u2019s oven.  Privately, you marvelled at Gabriella\u2019s attitude.  She was rather encouraging for a woman whose precious daughters had both eaten themselves into such levels of obesity that they could no longer function in society.  As well as your own progress to that end.  You wonder what would happen if she weren\u2019t there to look after you all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could probably manage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was due to the fact that you really couldn\u2019t haul yourself around to make the trips there and back in one go.

The effort to get all three of you out of the sofa.  Arduous trips to the kitchen.  Getting Sofia in and out of the scooter.  Then, as your sizes grew, more surfaced.  One major point was dressing yourself and Mia.  While Sofia was more than happy to wear what was basically a tent cut like a dress, you and Mia tended to prefer real clothes.  It had been a long time since she had been able to dress her own lower half, but now her arms were giving her trouble as well.  To top it off, as you grew, you began to need a hand, as well as your belly and manboobs getting in the way as you dressed your wife.  For Sofia, a real struggle was trying to work any kind of handheld device, fingers robbed of any precision.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s dressed far from conservatively, although with that size you doubt it would make a difference.  Her green silk blouse was as strained as your own shirt, gaps in the buttons.  Through them, you see her bra, with her tits overflowing the cups.  What size they were you had no idea, but they were definitely not one you could buy off the shelf.

And they - you- erm..seem really se-sad to me.\u201d  She tries to give a nervous smile.

Stuff like helping you get around, fetching and doing things you can\u2019t anymore, helping dress you?\u201d  She poses this last as a question, eyeing the size of your gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you progress, things begin to add up.  She makes occasional faux pas when describing your obesity and her reasons for being interested.  And you notice that she seems to be looking at you figure in the same way you\u2019re looking at her full chest.  She all but bites her lip when you pause midway through for a donut.  By the end, you\u2019ve put it all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She\u2019s got a fat fetish</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prudent thing to do would be to tell her that, sorry, she wasn\u2019t fit for the job.

Anything more meant that she would have run the risk of burning calories, and neither of you were comfortable with that. The rush of cheating on your wife, combined with the experience of getting to fuck a woman so big that she was getting caught in doorways, was enough to grant you the energy required to skewer such a hog. She was so much more vocal than Mia, verbally thirsty for you in loud moans and thick cries of pleasured anguish as you slid in and out of her. Mostly out, given all of the padding in her fupa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me.\" Sofia whimpered in her best porn star voice, \"Fuck me fat, you fucking stud\u2014I want to get so fucking huge for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActual insertion into her was no easy task. Sofia was enormous. The kind of stamina required to tackle such a beast didn't come to most men, even the inspired. It took a long, <i>long</i> time. And by the end of it, you were both sweaty and exhausted. You from having to traverse the mountain that was Sofia's super sized figure, and Sofia from just the ambient amount of exercise that all that wiggling and wobbling had given her. As hard as it was for you, it was even moreso for her\u2014she'd been celibate for about a hundred pounds now, and her stamina was nowhere near \"lay down like a sack of potatoes and get fucked\". She needed constant \"nourishment\" lest she get hungry during...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraddling her by the stomach, feeding her leftovers from the fridge, had helped raise her stamina though. She wasn't happy unless she was being pleasured from both mouths. Whenever you weren't eating her out or dicking her down, you had been feeding your fat sister-in-law by hand. Letting her lick your fingers for every stray crumb and calorie to be found, in hopes of it going right to her belly. And when you <i>had</i> been, she'd been feeding herself. Fat arms wobbled and jiggled with your rhythm as she greedily gobbled everything that the two of you had placed within arm's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the end of it, when you'd finally made this fat whale cum, you were so goddamn tired. So. Goddamn Tired. It had taken hours of love making with Sofia, but she had finally creamed mid-bite, ejaculate trickling much further than you would have expected down the sheets. She must have been seriously backed up, but given how sexually forward she'd been, that wasn't exactly a surprise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, in the awkward shuffling from one room to the next, you started to think about just what you'd done. Post-nut clarity hit you hard on this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd actually gone and done it. You'd cheated on your wife. With her sister. Her super-sized, super-sexy, double-wide sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you felt like such a monster. But, but at the end of it... it had felt so <i>good</i> to be with a woman that big. Your deepest desires realized. You had finally fucked a woman so big that she could literally have crushed you at any point during that marathon of fat girl fornication, and you'd survived....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now you wanted more.

Pushing through her blubber day fter day was keeping you in shape, and being fed every day was doing wonders for Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rate of growth was incredible to behold.  You swore you could se her gut inching across her lap day by day.  Every time she moved, though admittedly little, she wobbled and shook even more.  Every step she took left her winded.  Her shirts barely fit, constantly showing inches of soft, caramel flab.  And still you wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to visit her at work, always with something greasy in hand as an offering to your pampered fat goddess.  You would spend her entire lunch break feeding her fried chicken, burgers, fries, anything you grabbed on your way.  And seeing her stuffed into her work uniform, blouse buttons straining to cover her body, black skirt bursting at the seams as her thighs forced it out, not to mention how the arms of her chair pinched her arse, fat spilling around them, well, it only got you going even more.  The open plan of her office meant you couldn't fuck her there and then like you wanted to, but with strategic positioning, you could get some over-the-clothes action in.  You would grope her fat tits, her stifling moans of pleasure, while she stroked your throbbing erection through your jeans. Oe more than one occasion she went to far, and you were left in need of some tactical changing.  But it was so, so worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a whale before, but under your guiding hand, she was growing even fatter.  Burst buttons a weekly occurrence, she was outgrowing clothes on such a regular basis she was buying them in advance.  And you were lowing every extra inch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never wanted this to change.</span></div></div>",

Although it was that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere probably wasn't one thing that got her attention.  The two of you were lacking somewhat in subtlety.  Maybe she caught the lustful looks you would throw between you in the house.  Maybe she didn't believe your excuses for why you would never go shopping with her and her mother, or why you kept going out without her.  It could have been your lack of enthusiasm in your marital sex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suspicious glancs she shot at you made you feel every bit the monster you knew you were.  She had been loyal to you every step of the way, and gotten as fat as you wanted her to, even at the cost of a lot of things in her life.  But you were in too deep to stop, and honestly the guilt just made you fuck the pile of lard that was your sister-in-law even harder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings finally came to a head three months into your affair.  Sofia's ever expanding waistline was giving you trouble when it was time to dress each other.  and you were so focused on trying to pull the leggings up over her enormous thighs that you didn't hear the door.  And Mia could be stealthy for someone over two hundred kilos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou span around, stomach sinking to the floor.  In this posisition, Sofia mostly nude, you in your boxers, there was no room for denial.  The two of you broke down, and confessed the whole bloody thing.  As you spoke, watching the hurt cross Mia's face, you felt sick.  You began to regret every minute of it.  Not wanting to risk looking over to her, you could still tell that Sofia was feeling similar emotions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your stammered explanations, there was a silence.  The most deafening silence in the world, seeming to stretch on for eternity.  You dared not break it, knowing you were to sit and await judgment.  </span></div></div>",

Her massively overfed form was somehow both softened and firmed up by her many layers of lard. Her soft skin felt slightly moist under your touch, likely because this was literally the most physically demanding task she ever did anymore, and she had simply been growing fatter and fatter since your wedding day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she had tried to stay in shape, it's very likely that she'd still be struggling, however. Sometimes you could only stare in silence as you drank in just how truly vast your wife had become. You slid your right hand under her upper belly roll, remembering back to when you could grip it in one hand. That ship had sailed a long time ago, and you gasped as you tried to lift the blubber engorged flesh, feeling the sheer weight of a mere fraction of her overfed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had first met Ashley shortly after 4th edition had dropped. You'd been interested in trying out the new game, but your circle of friends refused to change with the times, eventually moving over to Pathfinder. And so you'd joined up with an online D&amp;D group, and it was there that you first met Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been the DM for that first game, and you'd had the pleasure of playing a multitude of games with her since. Despite 4th not being the most roleplay friendly RPG, she really had a knack for making the world come alive and keeping everyone engaged with the story. That said, she was also <b>very</b> aggressive in combat, and it took a bit of in-universe meta-gaming and A LOT of minmaxing to beat the tougher challenges she'd laid before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the session, all the players had agreed she'd probably gamed the best session they'd ever had. Even \"LazzzerTurkey,\" Power Gamer and Minmaxer extraordinaire, a man with a particular skill for finding and utilizing every exploit a system had and who generally did not give a shit about roleplay or npc's beyond the experience gain, had charged through a battlefield to rescue a child despite there being no in-game reward for doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if getting a guy called \"LazzzerTurkey\" invested in a story isn't an accomplishment, I don't know what is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd played a few more sessions with \"CapriSun,\" as she was calling herself at the time, both as a player and as a DM. The group eventually broke up, however, though you still e-mailed now and again. It was shortly after the end of the group that you started playing Guild Wars 2, and as you were wandering through the starting town came across a character with the name \"CapriSun.\" Sure enough, it was Ashley, and the two of you started questing through the world together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, you were chatting even outside of the game, sometimes for hours at a stretch. You talked about everything under the sun - music, gaming, anime, sci-fi, fantasy. Eventually, you told each other your real names. Feeling a real connection, you tried to schedule a RL meet up. Ashley, however, had been really hesitant, and she was quite evasive as to why. You persisted, and she'd finally agreed to a coffee date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that happened, though, she sent you a photo of herself, saying that if you didn't like what you saw, you should back out now. You were shocked when you opened the file on your screen, as the woman within must of weighed a solid 400 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you sent her a chunk of your porn folder, and told her that her physique was most definitely not a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you started dating almost immediately. Ashley had initially held back during your first couple of dinner dates, but once she knew you were okay with it, she happily stuffed herself like a turkey. As it turned out, she was quite the gluttonous woman, and there was little Ashley loved more then over-stuffing herself with the most decadent, calorific dishes she could lay her hands on. She'd been a chunky girl while growing up, but started to explode in college. She'd been trying to diet on and off for years by this point, but had never once succeeded in keeping the weight off, always ending each year heavier then when it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two years of dating, the two of you moved in together, and Ashley's steady increase in fat began to pick up speed. Their cupboards were perpetually stocked with junk food and pop, and her mealtime portions continued to grow. Even at work, she was eating, being used as the office food disposal by the rest of her coworkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, Ashley's weight became too much for her employer to handle, and she was let go for insurance reasons. Though initially devastated, this event only encouraged her to eat more, not less. Ashley then had the idea to start a gaming channel, playing the latest MMO's for her audience, as well as selling her services as a DM for hire. And her business ideas worked, with her monthly takeaway being higher then your own at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now that she was at home all the time, fully sedentary, and eating more then ever, her weight only continued to grow by leaps and bounds. You hadn't even gone anywhere for your honeymoon. Instead, the two of you took two weeks off work, stayed at home, and kept Ashley perpetually, painfully stuffed full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd had sex, naturally. You know, when it wasn't too painful for her overfilled stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's consumption had never dropped back down in the aftermath, and she had simply blown up since. Where once stood your 400 pound girlfriend, now there was your 798 pound wife, wedged in your doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to stare at her, Ashley interrupted your private viewing. \"Would you stop staring and help me!? My knees are killing me!\"</span></div></div>",
