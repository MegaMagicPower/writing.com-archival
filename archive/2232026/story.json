You lost touch during your college and university years, only to be reunited when you were admitted to hospital and she was the attenting nurse....with a few more kilos on her frame.  Tall, blonde, and a belly gainer, with a quiet but gentle personality.  You're on a trip to the south of France for a much needed break.  She hopes she can lose the weight before you notice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mia</b><br>\r\nMia is a Spanish girl you met as you took a class in the language for your job.  You hit it off straight away, and you both opened up about having a fat kink.  Shorter than you, with taned skin and jet black hair, she's definitely a bottom-heavy girl, and aiming to get heavier.  She has a confident, flirtacious personality, and will happily show it in publicYou're on a trip to her hometown to see her mother.  Will the homecoming help or hinder her already wide waistline?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ashley</b><br>\r\nNerdy, gothic, and busty.  The three best words to descride Ashley.  You met through an online D&amp;D group, and again on an MMO.  You met up, started dating, and eventually got married.  Being a nerdy girl who disliked exercise almost as much as she loved pizza, she was already a hiefer when you met.  And while she doesn't exactly share your infatuation with her size, she has little motivation to lose any of it.  You're making a road trip to have an extended in person D&amp;D campaign with a group member in Scotland.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mia sat fanning herself as you both waited for the taxi, the hot Spanish sun bearing down on her.  At her size, though, it was hardly surprising.  With her massive thighs spread to accommodate her sagging belly, she took up nearly two thirds of the bench she rested on.  Dressed in only a white tank top and denim booty shorts, there was nothing about her flabby, mocha coloured form that was left to the imagination.   Her belly  pushed the shirt up while her large, heavy breasts kept it pinned, nipples showing through the thin fabric.  Her gut strained the front of her high-waisted shorts, causing her to rub the band in discomfort.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, these shorts are so tight!  I knew we should have gotten a bigger size!\u201d  She complained, looking over to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you remember, there was no bigger size.  I\u2019m certain you said you were going to cut back for our trip so they fit properly.\u201d  You look over at your wife\u2019s body testing the poor button to it\u2019s limits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only response was to smirk seductively at you.  \u201cYou know you love it.  It\u2019s not like you would ever help me do a silly thing like diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.  But if those shorts weren\u2019t so tight I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have got you into the plane seat.\u201d  You recall the flight over in great detail.  From her hips getting wedged in the door, the third seatbelt extender, and the look on the hostess\u2019s face when she realised you were a party of two instead of three.  Most of all, there was the ordeal of getting your overfed wife into the seat.  Had her gut been allowed to hang free, it would never have fit.  Restricted as it was, there was a solid inch of space between it and the back of the seat in front.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still wish they\u2019d served a proper meal in flight\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were only on the plane two hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt takes a lot to keep me full, you know that.\u201d  She rested her hand on top of her belly.  \u201cDo you think we could get the taxi driver to pull through McDonald\u2019s?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can ask him now, I think this is us.\u201d  Case in one hand, you extend the other to help Mia to her feet.  Approaching the car, you notice the driver casually moving the passenger seat forward.  Opening the door for her, you allow Mia to squeeze herself in, suspension noticeably rocking as the weight was put on it.  As you get in the other side, Mia poses the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind swinging by the drive through?  It\u2019s on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His only comment was to ask that you make sure you took all of the waste with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he set off, Mia started on her fries, which lasted her all of a minute.  Handing the empty box to you, she exchanged it for one of her bacon burgers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was a slightly messy eater, and she wasn\u2019t being helped by the motion of the car.  As she took a bite, the sauce began to drip.  And as it went over a speed bump, a rather large drop fell onto her exposed chest.  She wiped it off with a finger, leaving a red smear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was eating her last Big Mac, her white top hand been stained by every burger.  Pushing the last bite in, she looks over to you and shakes her gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, if I was slimmer, all of that would be on the car.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you were slimmer, you wouldn\u2019t have had that order.\u201d  You remark, passing her the milkshake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point there.\u201d  She laughs.  Frowning at the stains on her top, she let out a sigh.  \u201cI hope Mama has some spare clothes there.\u201d  Taking the lid off, she began chugging her milkshake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d  The driver remarked from the front, pulling up outside a single storey house close to the beach.  Grabbing the empty takeaway bag, you dart around to the other side to help Mia out.  As she squeezed herself out, the top half of her belly became completely exposed as her top rode all the way up.  You could see how it was bulging over the waistband of her shorts enough that it nearly covered the button.  As you sorted the fare out, she went back to her milkshake<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They both threw their fat arms open for a hug, but as Mia entered the doorway, her hips became predictably stuck.  She grunted and braced her arms on the doorframe, shimmying herself slowly through.  You wait patiently behind her, enjoying the show of her jiggling rump.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last spurt of effort, she finally comes unstuck.  Suddenly free, her body ripples with the motion, all of it on full show for you.  Rubbing her hips where the doorframe pinched them, she sighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should have that door widened, Mama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should.  It\u2019s not suitable for a well-fed woman now is it?\u201d  Smiling at each other, they embrace, their guts squishing together and keeping their arms from joining behind each other.  When they release, she turns her attention to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is who I\u2019ve got to thank for looking after you then, Mia?  I\u2019m Gabriella.\u201d  She pulls you into a deep hug, your body sinking into her fat in much the same way it did with her daughter.  Releasing you, she ushers you inside.  \u201cI\u2019m making some quesadillas, do you want some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, Mia has already agreed enthusiastically.  Noticing your expression, she slaps her belly.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to keep this here if I turn down food am I?\u201d  As she looks down, she remembers the state of her shirt.  \u201cMama, Do you have a shirt I can borrow?  I got sauce on this one.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s one hung up in my room.  Be quick, your sister should be home soon.\u201d  Sticking her head through the kitchen door, Gabriella calls to you.  \u201cMake yourself at home in the lounge, dear.\u201d  Following her advice, you drop yourself onto a well-worn armchair.  Listening to the sounds of activity in the kitchen, you feel at home already.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not long before your wife re-emerges from her mother\u2019s room, pulling a blue shirt over her front.  She struggles to button it, giving up on the last two.  \u201cMama, this shirt\u2019s a little small for me.\u201d  Looking at her, you can see the buttons over her belly being pulled apart.  And when she drops herself onto the sofa, three buttons over her belly simply fly apart.  As you share a quiet laugh about it, you hear sounds at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, she\u2019s here!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hear a lot of commotion coming from the door.  A lot of straining grunts, heavy breathing, and creaking floorboards.  A woman\u2019s voice pitifully whines out \u201cOh come ooooooonnnn\u2026.\u201d  Looking over to Mia, she gives you an explanation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister is a little heavier than Mama and I.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long minutes, the noises from the door stop and you hear the heavy, laboured breaths and groaning floorboards approach you.  And as they enter the room, you see that \u2018a little heavier\u2019  was an understatement. Mia\u2019s sister was quite possibly the fattest woman you had seen.   Even her wide hips, which seemed to be a family trait, are overshadowed by the size of her gut, hanging below her knees and sticking out far in front.  Encased in a black tank top and knee length skirt that looked to be on their last legs, it was kept relatively still.  With barely a greeting, she collapses on the sofa next to Mia, gasping for air.  You notice that the frame is bowed where she\u2019s sat, obviously warped from the constant abuse of her weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once she had regained her breath did she finally address the two of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sis, Mama told me you were coming today.  I just got held up at work.\u201d  She notices your surprised face.  \u201cWhat, don\u2019t believe I can hold down a job at my weight?\u201d  Acting offended, she keeps up the act long enough to let you start to apologise, before laughing it off.  \u201cIt\u2019s fine.  I don\u2019t think I should be able to either.  But someone has to pay the food bill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, I think Mama\u2019s finished.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, a few seconds later, Gabriella waddled through with two serving platters piled high with cheese stuffed tortillas, with what looked like pulled pork stuffed in as well.  Rather than set them down on the small table between the chairs and sofa, she simply handed them to Mia and her sister, and gave you a small plate with a couple on.  For herself she likewise had a smaller plate, though with several more than you.  In preparation for the meal, you notice Mia\u2019s sister pull her belly out from her skirt, sighing with relief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn\u2019t much room for chatter once the two girls started gorging themselves.  You knew how much Mia could eat anyway, but seeing someone match her was something else.  It almost seemed like she was eating faster than usual, trying to compete with her larger sister.  You feel as though your suspicions are confirmed at the end, by the glower she sends her sister as she finishes while Mia still has a quesadilla on her tray.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gabriella slowly rises to her feet, you feel obligated to step in and volunteer to wash the dishes.  After a short debate while she tells you to sit yourself down, you head through, leaving the women to catch up over a cup of rich, cream-heavy coffee.  If you listen closely, you catch snippets of their conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Sis.  What are you doing for work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a call centre.  It\u2019s pretty quiet, and I hardly get any calls.  Mostly I just sit on my fat ass and eat pastries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting paid for what you do best, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much.  What about you?  You must have something relaxed, with how much you\u2019ve put on since I saw you last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t work.  I found a man to look after me.  So I do the same as you:  Sit on my fat ass and eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tune out as you remember the countless times you\u2019ve come home to find your wife sprawled on the sofa, surrounded by empty snack wrappers and plates, bloated belly on full display.  The first few times she gave a guilty look, but as she grew fatter she realised how much it appealed to you, and it began to happen more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tune back in to the conversation as you finish up and walk back through to where the bloated women are sat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......And then she had the cheek to say I should cover up more!\u201d  Mia\u2019s sister was saying, a displeased look on her face.  \u201cLike, it\u2019s not my fault my clothes don\u2019t fit properly.  Okay maybe it is, but my point stands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia stifles a yawn, but it doesn\u2019t go unnoticed by her mother.  \u201cI think you two should go ahead and unpack, rest after a long day.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds a plan.\u201d  Mia replies, rocking forward to get the momentum to stand.  As she does, she lays a hand on top of her stuffed gut.  \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy that.\u201d  She quietly grumbles as she waddles ahead of you to the guest bedroom.  Though the doors inside were wider than the front, you see her hips are dangerously close to touching the sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapses onto the bed, springs creaking in protest.  \u201cI feel like I can barely move, I\u2019m that stuffed.  I had forgotten how good Mama\u2019s cooking is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou definitely seemed to be enjoying yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t act like you weren\u2019t.  I noticed how much you were watching me.  I know you love how much I eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess I\u2019m busted then\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess you are.  But while you\u2019ve got that tent there ...\u201d  She leans back and spreads her fat thighs.  \u201cHelp me get these shorts off and stuff me the other way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sat just to your right on her towel was Mia, snacking on two ice creams.  Clad in a black string bikini that should have been replaced several kilos ago, she was a gorgeous sight.  Her fat breasts spill out all around the fabric, while the thin strap is nearly completely hidden by her back fat.  Her double rolled belly covers the front and most of the side, while her massive rear quietly claims every bit of material every time she moves.  Although there wasn\u2019t much of a danger with that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Babe?

Looking annoyed, she snatches it off of you and throws it on, showing that it was more obsolete than her bikini.  The low cut made it hardly more decent than her bikini, and her belly took up so much of the material that there was only a small amount of material to cover her front.  More than those, was the fact that her backside had grown to such a size since it was purchased that only the top half was really covered, leaving the rest to sag out of the bottom, jiggling for all to see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia\u2019s family home was visible from the beach.  The route was a nearly straight road for five hundred meters, and down a side street.  The road was on a rather steep hill, and to your lack of surprise, Mia was not enthusiastic about the walk up it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have to be back for that pizza we could just wait for the bus.\u201d  She grumbles as she hauls herself up the path, already sweating.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest of the climb is spent at a crawl, with her using the wall as a guide to try and ease her shaky legs.   By the time you arrive back at Gabriella\u2019s, she\u2019s coated in sweat and wheezing fiercely.  After the regular ordeal of getting her through the door, she drops onto the sofa next to her sister.  (who you now know is called Sofia). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve just run a\u2026\u2026..well, any running really.\u201d  Sofia comments through a mouthful of crisps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2026...am\u2026..never\u2026.*&lt;i&gt;huff&lt;/i&gt;* ...doing that...AGAIN!\u201d  She manages to force out.  Sofia rests a reassuring hand on her shoulder and offers her the family sized back she\u2019s holding.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got pizza on the way\u201d  Mia nonetheless grabs a large handful and shoves them in her mouth.   With both girls eating, it lasts about a minute.  And within five, they were complaining about their hunger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is iiiitt?\u201d  Sofia whines, rubbing her vast belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve hardly eaten today.\u201d Mia chimes in, pouting.  The sundress has come off, and she\u2019s back in her too small bikini.   Quietly, you wonder if the past four hours with an endless supply of ice cream counts as \u2018hardly eating\u2019.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, you\u2019re saved by Gabriella with the pizzas, and the girls are once again kept busy gorging themselves.  To you, it almost seems like the two of them are trying to compete with how quickly they devour their meals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end, the sister are breathing heavily, massaging their bellies as best they can.  That is, until Gabriella says: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you girls want dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come on, these fit when we bought them\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve gotten fatter since then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia stops her complaining for a second.  \u201cHave I?\u201d  She looks down at her exposed belly.  \u201cI can\u2019t tell a difference.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have, believe me.  Especially since we came here.  Both you and Sofia have.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we have been eating a lot recently.\u201d  She mused.  With a serious look on her face, she looks at you.  \u201cI know we both like me being a fatass, but am I getting too big now?  Do I need to cut back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no!  I\u2019d never complain about there being more of this!\u201d  You grab her lowest belly roll.  \u201cI just think we\u2019ll need to take a shopping trip soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that means you\u2019d love me more if I was Sofia\u2019s size then.\u201d  Something in her tone sounded irritated, and you knew you needed to choose your words carefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t love you any more, Mia.\u201d  You say, planting a small kiss on her cheek.  \u201cObviously, you being as fat as you are is a massive turn on, and if you keep getting bigger I\u2019ve got no problem with it.  But don\u2019t think you need to be that big for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeming satisfied, she returns your kiss, and you use that opportunity to button her capris.  Before they can fly open again, you claps the belt, forcing Mia\u2019s flab to ooze over the top.  A plain white t-shirt follows, the hem just long enough to cover her protruding roll.  You help her to her feet, causing the shirt to ride up.  As she pulls it back down, she inspects her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re right, babe.  I must be getting bigger.  This is digging into my arms really bad.\u201d  She holds them out for you to see how her arm fat is being constricted by the short sleeves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both make you way through the house, Mia in front, waving to Gabrialla as you pass the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy yourselves you two!\u201d  She calls, bust over the oven.  By the size of the pot, she\u2019s cooking for herself and Sofia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick your heads in the living room to say goodbye to Sofia, seeing her sprawled in her usual space on the sofa, massive gut covering her lap.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye Sis!  And bye to you too, stud!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t seem to tell if the nickname was meant to be comedic or flirty, but you\u2019re saved from thinking too hard about it by Mia loudly exclaiming \u201cOh for God\u2019s sake!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, you see what\u2019s happened.  She\u2019s forgotten the width of the door compared to her incredible hips, and tried to go through forwards instead of sideways like usual.  And predictably, gotten stuck.  She tries bracing herself and wiggling her hips like she did on the first day, but her added poundage means that all this accomplishes is a tidal wave rolling across her backside.  She looks over her shoulder at you pleadingly.  And, never one to pass up a chance to get your hands on her arse, you get behind her and push, squeezing just a little more than you probably need to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your help, she\u2019s out in less than a minute, although with a couple of sore spots on her hips.  Slowly, she eases herself into her mother\u2019s car with not a few grunts of effort.  As you climb in the driver\u2019s side, you notice how her hips are spilling over above the handbrake.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was barely a snack!  Babe, you\u2019re gonna need to go somewhere else, my belly needs food in it, and soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot five minutes later, you were sat at the local Burger King, watching Mia devour four large meals and two cokes.

As taut as her belly looked as she got back in the car, as much discomfort as she showed as you went over a speed bump, you still came back to her home with two empty KFC bags.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drops onto the sofa and unleashes her belly from it\u2019s confines, you start to wonder if there\u2019s something more to her eating than her usual gluttony.

She has some trouble with a second pair of hands.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of how much fatter Mia\u2019s sister is than her, you\u2019re not surprised.  \u201cThat\u2019s not an issue.\u201d  You tell her.  \u201cYou deserve some quality time with your mum.\u201d  Looking her over, you raise an eyebrow.  \u201cYou going out like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia\u2019s outfit was clearly not suited for her current size.  She had on a low cut grey top which barely covered her top belly roll and showed off almost all of her cleavage, and a denim miniskirt which looked painted on over her arse and looked painfully tight across her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?  Afraid someone\u2019s going to try and pick me up?\u201d  She strikes a sexy pose, jutting her hefty breasts out and pouting her lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could pick you up, baby.\u201d  Looking her over again, you can\u2019t help but comment again.  \u201cGod you look so FAT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I might.\u201d  She smirks at you, slapping her belly.  \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget:  it\u2019s your job to keep me this fat, so anything I but today is on you.  Of course, I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d  She says this last as she strokes your erect cock through your jeans, before slipping her hand into your pocket and withdrawing your credit card.  \u201cBye babe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun\u2026\u201d You call after her, mesmerised by her swaying, rippling booty.  Watching her out of the door, you remain stood there until you\u2019re snapped out of it by the sounds of extreme effort from Sofia\u2019s room.  You quickly grab yourself a drink from the kitchen and flop onto the sofa to avoid looking strange, but you needn\u2019t have rushed.  Even with her door being wider than all the others, you still hear her struggle with it.  The steps that come towards you are slow, heavy, and each one accompanied by some gasp or pant.  And as she slowly shuffles into the room, your jaw drops.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia lumbers in almost naked.  The only discernible article of clothing you saw was a crop to over her braless chest, barely keeping her decent.  As she moves slowly past you, a small amount of visible purple fabric betrays that she is indeed wearing underwear.  As she collapses onto the sofa next to you, chest heaving, she notices your eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Stud, what\u2019s up?\u201d  She asks, before looking herself over.  \u201cOh, yeah.  I never thought about that.  I just really don\u2019t like forcing myself into clothes when I don\u2019t have to.\u201d  Reaching to her side, she grabs a jumbo bag of pretzels.  \u201cSo, you gonna put the TV on, or are we going to sit here in silence all day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, being alone with Sofia was strange.  You couldn\u2019t put your finger on if she was just being friendly, or if there was more to it.  And above all, you weren\u2019t quite sure how to react to someone as big as she was.  With everything out in the open, you could really tell the difference in size between Mia and her.  Where Mia was incredibly well endowed in the booty department, Sofia\u2019s, while still huge, seemed deflated by the sheer weight put on it by the rest of her.  Her belly extended all the way to her knees, one single orb instead of Mia\u2019s two jiggling rolls.  And while your wife was nowhere near flat chested, Sofia\u2019s breasts were on another level.  Full, fat, and huge, they stretched her top enough to keep them from sagging too much, and her thick nipples could be seen through the material.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-cks.  Hey!  You listening?\u201d  Your examination is broken off by a fat finger poking you and Sofia giving you an odd look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, miles away.  What did you say?\u201d  You attempt to recover the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said do you want some snacks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, no, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia shrugs, and begins to heave herself up.  Mia took only five minutes to get up from the sofa.  It took her sister fifteen, and she was breathing incredibly harshly from the effort.  As she stands, she throws her ham like arms back, exposing the underside of her breast to you.  You can\u2019t decide if she looked at you by chance after, or if she meant to do that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When she lumbered back with what looked like half the pantry and three litres of cola, you thought that would be it for a while.  How wrong you were.  After less than an hour, she was heaving herself up again, and this time brushed her hip against you as she did it.  A hard certainty was arising in your mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to her third time getting up though, it was clear the effort it was requiring.  This was probably what Mia meant when she said Sofia struggled alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraciously, you volunteer yourself for snack duty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re just a knight in shining armour, aren\u2019t you?\u201d  She laughs, before emptying her cola.  \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say you were trying to seduce me.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the day, you began to see just how much Sofia struggled with even the most basic of tasks.  Even without the need to get up every time she was hungry, there were still problems.  She couldn\u2019t reach the remote because it was under her side fat, and her arms couldn\u2019t bend to grab it.  She knocked her bottle over and almost passed out trying to reach it before you noticed.  When she ordered a fast food delivery, she had to rest the phone on her gut with speaker on because she seemed incapable of keeping her arm up for that long.  And, after she was done eating enough to feed your whole family back home, she seemed completely out of breath.  You watch her pathetic attempts to gather her empty boxes around her girth for a few minutes before coming to help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you drop her off her post-meal cake and two pints of cream, you\u2019re amazed by how fast it goes down.  One pint on the cake before it\u2019s inhaled, with the second being chugged straight down.  She caps her binge off with a loud belch, before slowly massaging what parts of her belly she can reach.  It\u2019s pitiful, really, how she can\u2019t even ease her digestion after a meal because she can\u2019t move her fat arms around the whole of her even fatter belly.  Indeed, it didn\u2019t seem to be helping her any.  All that seemed to be happening was her huge expanse of flesh was rippling, arms wobbling, breasts swinging\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not sure how long it was before Sofia coughed pointedly, and you noticed that while her flab was still moving, the rest of her wasn\u2019t, and she was watching you watch her with a playful smirk on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, are you just going to watch me struggle?  Or are you going to help out and give my poor belly a nice rub?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re completely taken aback.  \u201cI\u2026...What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I know you're a guy that likes a bigger girl.  Surely you want to feel what a &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; fat belly is like.\u201d  She slowly massages again with one hand.  As she does so, she grips and plays with the fat, moving it like fresh dough.  \u201cYou can\u2019t be satisfied with how skinny Sis is right?  Just get it out of your system now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re conflicted.  She is right, you do love your girls as fat as possible, and you\u2019d be lying if you said you never thought about Sofia in that way.  But would it be rude to Mia?  Or could it be a good thing?  Maybe knowing would remove the distraction.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to do it.  Kneeling in front of her, as you did with Mia after so many binges, you placed your hands on her belly and firmly rubbed her taut midsection.  Grasping and releasing the expanse, moving your hands down from the top in small circles.  You\u2019re struck by the sheer amount of flesh to work with.  Before now, you would never have referred to Mia\u2019s gut as \u2018small\u2019, but Sofia\u2019s was positively enormous.  You find yourself getting sucked in by it\u2019s pliant size, the hundreds of kilos of excess fat meaning that even when stuffed it was still mostly soft.  And, at the end, your hands find their way to just beneath her heavy breasts, your face level with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on.  One squeeze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey overflow your hands as you grope, nipples hard and tactile even through her top.  Heavy, laden with fat.  It\u2019s an effort to compress them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia breaks you off with a playful slap.  \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure you had more than one, but I\u2019ll let you off.  I\u2019ve got to go and get dressed before Mama and Sis come home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock and knelt on the floor, the sudden change in mood startles you.  \u201cWhat?  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I only dressed like this for your benefit.  Sis might think something\u2019s strange if I\u2019m nearly nude when we\u2019re alone together.\u201d  With great effort, she hefts herself forwards.  \u201cLet\u2019s just keep this a secret, yeah?\u201d  With a peck on the cheek, she lumbers away, and soon you hear grunts of effort and wardrobe doors slamming.  By the time she gets back you\u2019ve recovered a little, and she shows no sign of acknowledging what the two of you did.  And you\u2019re saved the awkwardness by the arrival of you wife and mother in law.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re baaaaack!\u201d  Shouts Mia, leading the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear, I hope you had a high limit on that thing.\u201d  Gabriella sighs, though not really unhappily.  \u201cMia didn\u2019t stop eating all day.\u201d  And as your wife waddles into view, you notice that her skirt is completely open, fat spilling out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me, hot stuff.  There\u2019s plenty of time to get me an appetite before Mama makes dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no objections, and happily follow Mia into your bedroom.  Despite her advanced size, she\u2019s still active in bed, even riding you cowgirl until you cry uncle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s just the tickle at the back of your mind considering how she\u2019d be if she were bigger<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After hours looking, the only things you found that she could justify spending her money on were the numerous food stalls.  And as the afternoon drew in, she grew irritated, and bought the first thing that managed to fit.  It was a pale blue button up dress, which she claimed it was too hot to wear.  So she came home the same way she left: In her bikini top, and the shorts she wore to fly in, not even bothering to try and fasten them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look behind you to watch her struggle with the short walk from the bus stop at the end of the street, you think maybe it wasn\u2019t a total bust after all.  Seeing her completely on show and wobbling around was a pretty sweet deal.  You wait a few minutes for her to get ahead of you at the door, just to watch her beautiful backside jiggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step in, though, Gabriella accosts you with a grim look on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore you go in there, you should know:  Sofia got fired today, and she\u2019s seriously upset about it.  Try to be gentle with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull of concern for her sister, Mia bolts through to the living room, despite already being out of breath from her walk.  You follow her, and note the sight as you sit yourself down while Mia tries to get the breath to speak.  There are no less than eight empty litre cartons of ice cream strewn around, with a ninth on it\u2019s way to being added to the pile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Sis.  Mama told us what happened.  Wanna talk about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough sniffles, Sofia starts to talk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI went into work like normal this morning, and someone told me the lift wasn\u2019t working.  I just laughed.  People keep telling me that as a joke.  But it really wasn\u2019t.  And when I saw my manager, he just said I\u2019d need to use the stairs.  And I tried, I really did!  But then I...I collapsed after the fifth step and tore the handrail off.  When my manager came to see what the noise was he just told me not to come back!\u201d  With her story told, Sofia turned back to her comfort, eating through the tears.  Mia rests a hand on her shoulder.  In your mind, gears are turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that means you\u2019re classed as unfit to work right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia glares at you.  \u201cYeah, thanks.  Like that\u2019s not the issue here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no!  What I mean is, you don\u2019t have to!  If you\u2019ve had to be let go for a medical condition - which you were - You can get a disability allowance.  They\u2019ll even kit you out with a few things to help you out at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis grabs Sofia\u2019s attention.  \u201cR-Really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.  You just need to make the call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, after just a week, Sofia gets delivery of a brand new mobility scooter, as well as getting work paid for to widen the front door, much to Mia\u2019s delight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook babe!  I\u2019m not stuck!\u201d  She shouts with glee from the doorway, gesturing at the 15cm of room either side of her.  Privately, you\u2019re a little sad that you won\u2019t be getting to push her free again.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew it had a large selection of stores that catered to the \u2018curvier\u2019 girl, and were curious to see whether or not Mia could find something that fit.  So far only two stores in and she had a loose dress a size too small and an overloaded tray of Burger King.  Several other patrons were turning their heads to look at your glutton of a wife, packed into the dress she had bought just days ago, already looking tight across her gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next store, she goes in to try on a pair of leggings and a workout top.  As she waddles out, you wonder why workout gear even comes in these sizes.  But, clothes that fit are always a buy.  And of course, waddling to a shop means she needs another pit stop to replenish her energy, this time with donuts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next shop, and it\u2019s a plain shirt and miniskirt that looks painted on.  The gaps in the buttons make it clear it\u2019s not the right size, but after seeing your interest, she buys it without a second thought.  And a couple of crepes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the trip, Mia has eaten a full meal for every one of the thirteen shops you have visited, with one outfit per shop.  Not one fits properly, all of them showing skin or being on the verge of being shredded by her massive frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when you get out of the shower, walk into the bedroom, and see her in the tight shirt and skirt from earlier, as well as a stack of pizzas, that really doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue at all\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even the uniform she got a week ago looks stretched.  Behind the counter sits the morbidly obese form of Mia.  No other cahier is sat, but obviously whoever her boss is realised that she would never be able to stand for a shift.  Not that you can see her stool, just the sides of her cheeks sagging over the sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take two whoppers to eat in, and an extra large woman to go.

The movement has already caused her uniform to ride up over her new third roll.  Slowly, she squeezes herself into the booth and starts eating along with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, the best thing about this job is the free food.\u201d  She says through a full mouth.

It\u2019s been a few months since she started work, and the constant supply of free food has done wonders for her figure.  Her three-rolled belly sags nearly to her knees when she stands, slapping against her thighs as she waddles.  Her arse and hips are twice as wide as her shoulders, which themselves are so laden with fat they nearly merge with her neck.  Her arms are thicker than some people\u2019s waists, unable to properly rest at her sides.  Today she has attempted to cover herself in a black tshirt that only covers her topmost roll, and an enormous short denim skirt.  You can see the sweat glistening on her belly as she begs Sofia to slow down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia finally notices her sister\u2019s strained calls and brings her scooter to a stop.  Her bountiful flab wobbles with the change in velocity, ripples cascading across her body.  If Mia had gotten bigger, it was nothing compared to her sister.  With the threat of physical movement removed, Sofia did little else apart from sit in her scooter seat and eat.  As such, it was difficult to get a handle on her real size, but she was definitely one of the fattest people you had ever seen.  Through her thin dress, the only thing that could fit her, you saw her belly sagged between her massive thighs in the middle, and spread across them over her knees.  Her chest had succumbed to the effects of gravity, heavy breasts hanging to the sides of her gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Sis!  It only has one speed you know.\u201d  She looks at the readout and grumbles.  \u201cIt was faster than this before though.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026...it\u2019s\u2026...still\u2026..too...fast!  Right\u2026.Babe?\u201d  Mia leans heavily on a lamppost to try regaining her breath, breathing harshly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, you\u2019re not much better.  Since Mia told you you didn\u2019t need to diet, it was safe to say you let yourself go.  And as such, you\u2019ve managed to cross the line over to \u2018obese\u2019.  Your gut bulges over the waistband of your jeans, no belt needed.  Your chest is even showing signs of developing a nice pair of man-boobs.  And although not as badly as Mia, you find yourself struggling to keep up with the scooter.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A voice that was quickly shut out by another banana split.  Brain freeze shook you, but a caramel loaded latte soon solved the issue.  Getting to the levels of obesity you had, you picked up a few tricks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the brief interval whilse you waited for your next serving, you had a chance to watch the two women with you.

Opting to dual-wield two spoons, she shovelled the sugary treats into her mouth with the grace of a drunken elephant.  Melted ice cream ran down her chins and into her valley of cleavage.

Your fat gut hangs low, completely covering your crotch when you stand, legs forcing you into an all-too-familliar waddle.  A definite set of man boobs rest on your chest, causing a crease in your shirt.

Wearily, you wave over to Mia at the counter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing you, she waves back, although from the puff of air she takes and the way she flops her arm down shows that such exercise is unwanted.  As you watch her, you notice that she seems to be having trouble with the screen.  She\u2019s had to sit too far away to comfortably reach due to the obstruction of her gut.  Her coworkers are serving several times faster than her, and it\u2019s with a slight shake of the head that her manager releases her from her shift.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she manages to make it to your booth, she looks ready to keel over.

As you get in, you both make a beeline to your bedroom, safe in the knowledge that Gabriella was making dinner from the smell.  And, as Mia collapses on the bed, frame creaking under her weight, you\u2019re both undressing as fast as your bodies will allow.  Clearly, she\u2019s had the same feeling as you.  Ignoring the much louder noise as you roll yourself on top of her, you lift your gut over hers and thrust forward, only for her to giggle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my belly roll, silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it?  You\u2019re so fat I couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d  You reach through the piles of fat to lift the offending section out of the way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me more about how big I am.\u201d  She moans, cupping a breast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a whale.  It\u2019s so pathetic how you got stuck earlier.\u201d  You pause in your motions.  \u201cHang on, that doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d  You feel around and find your member between both of you thighs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on babe, I\u2019m so horny for you.  You lardass hunk.\u201d  The bed groans again as you move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?  You like how we\u2019re just two fat pigs?\u201d  You try again.  \u201cCan you lift that roll\u2026..No, the other one\u2026..Yeah, and if I get &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;.....\u201d  Finally, you feel your tip enter her for real, and see her expression confirm it.  You thrust\u2026..only to be stopped after less than an inch.  You come to a shocking realisation, and so does she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I think we\u2019re too fat to have sex.\u201d  As she utters that sentence, unhelpfully, you feel yourself getting even harder.  And from the sensation down there, Mia got wetter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe...I need it\u2026..One more try\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you comply, almost throwing yourself into her, making your muscles ache for the prize of getting an extra two inches of give in your soft forms.  Unfortunately, that was too much for the bed frame to handle.  With a colossal boom, you feel yourself drop, impact rolling you off of Mia and onto the floor, closer than it should be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were both still horny.  Mia makes eye contact with you, before saying hopefully:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHandjobs?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re just glad you were there to see it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month after your bedroom mishap, you did your usual trip to see Mia at work.  And score some free burgers.  At Mia\u2019s counter, the line seemed longer than usual.  Stepping to the side, you see the problem.  Her arms weren\u2019t long enough to comfortably reach the screen in front of her, meaning she needed to lean forwards.  And, as well as the strain of keeping that much weight pulled, it caused her belly to block the bottom of the screen.  It was an hour into her shift, and she was sweating despite the A/C.  Breathing heavily, she took a break for a moment to have a milkshake, much to the annoyance of both her manager and the customers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her manager had had enough, and strolled over to her.  Mia sensed the situation, trying to rotate herself on the undersized stoll to face judgement.  And that movement dropped her to the floor as the slim steel legs buckled.  You winced.  It was clear what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Mia took it quite well.  Sat on the sofa, Gabriella on one side and Sofia on the other, they comforted her as she comforted herself with a tray of brownies fresh from her Mama\u2019s oven.  Privately, you marvelled at Gabriella\u2019s attitude.  She was rather encouraging for a woman whose precious daughters had both eaten themselves into such levels of obesity that they could no longer function in society.  As well as your own progress to that end.  You wonder what would happen if she weren\u2019t there to look after you all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could probably manage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gabriella told you all two weeks after Mia\u2019s money was confirmed.  Turned out her old track teammate had a villa out in the carribean and had invited her over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you were more surprised that she was on any kind of sports team.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day before she left, you were asked to go and fetch a couple of things from town for her.  While Mia volunteered to help her pack, you were out with Sofia, her mountains of flab shaking as the scooter pulled her along.  You notice she\u2019s really starting to outgrow the thing, arms barely able to reach past her breasts to steer it, backside hanging over the edges of the seat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely a bag\u2019s worth of items you needed, but the trip took three hours.  This was due to the fact that you really couldn\u2019t haul yourself around to make the trips there and back in one go.  And so you had fallen into Mia\u2019s habit of stopping at every food stall on the way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt your last stop before home, over a couple of pizzas each, Sofia asks you a very pointed question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, is Mia fat enough yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost choke on your slice.  \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a question.

Do you still want her as big as me?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Take a moment to decide.  Do you tell her that yes, you want her bigger?

Mia had asked for a snack before they started.  Then she was too full.  Then it was dinnertime.  Dessert.  Snack.

You tried to be disapproving, but after your conversation with Sofia you couldn\u2019t do it.  The lazier and more gluttonous she was, the hotter she was.

And you began to run into some issues.  One would think that having a carer move out would curb your waistlines, but the opposite happened.  Without her, your diets changed from properly cooked meals to cheap ready meals and takeaway.  The three of you ballooned faster.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, it was small things.  The effort to get all three of you out of the sofa.  Arduous trips to the kitchen.  Getting Sofia in and out of the scooter.  Then, as your sizes grew, more surfaced.  One major point was dressing yourself and Mia.  While Sofia was more than happy to wear what was basically a tent cut like a dress, you and Mia tended to prefer real clothes.  It had been a long time since she had been able to dress her own lower half, but now her arms were giving her trouble as well.  To top it off, as you grew, you began to need a hand, as well as your belly and manboobs getting in the way as you dressed your wife.  For Sofia, a real struggle was trying to work any kind of handheld device, fingers robbed of any precision.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s dressed far from conservatively, although with that size you doubt it would make a difference.  Her green silk blouse was as strained as your own shirt, gaps in the buttons.  Through them, you see her bra, with her tits overflowing the cups.  What size they were you had no idea, but they were definitely not one you could buy off the shelf.  Her blouse was tucked into a black miniskirt, showing off her deliciously plump thighs clad in black tights, and ending in a pair of heeled short boots.

And this really seemed like the career for me.\u201d  She flicks a lock of her long, jet-black hair out of her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but you put yourself forward for this particular assignment.  There\u2019s got to be a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to get more nervous.  \u201cWell, I just know that, fat\u2026.bigger people don\u2019t always have someone to cares- care for them.  And they - you- erm..seem really se-sad to me.\u201d  She tries to give a nervous smile.  You find the answer odd, but carry on with the sheet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, so, you know what this is going to require, yeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!  Stuff like helping you get around, fetching and doing things you can\u2019t anymore, helping dress you?\u201d  She poses this last as a question, eyeing the size of your gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you progress, things begin to add up.  She makes occasional faux pas when describing your obesity and her reasons for being interested.  And you notice that she seems to be looking at you figure in the same way you\u2019re looking at her full chest.  She all but bites her lip when you pause midway through for a donut.  By the end, you\u2019ve put it all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She\u2019s got a fat fetish</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prudent thing to do would be to tell her that, sorry, she wasn\u2019t fit for the job.

The wide smile and flushed cheeks on Rachel Charles\u2019s face as she dove straight past your outstretched, puffy hand to wrap herself around as much of your bloated torso as she could manage. Her chest had pressed into your own significantly less rounded pair of titties, the first time in a while you\u2019d seen anyone besides your wife or Sofia manage to make you look small up top, and had politely chuckled and given her a chaste pat on the back before hurriedly ushered her out the door, promising to explain the details after she'd gathered her things from the local hotel, but mostly so you could stuff yourself with enough food that the aching stiffness buried underneath your gut would subside into the dull, familiar throbbing that came so often of late when you were well and truly stuffed to fullness. You remember wishing as you had digested, sprawled across two chairs at the kitchen table, so full you could barely catch your breath, that maybe getting so fat you couldn\u2019t reach around your own gut to get off was a bit of an annoying thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you always had Mia, right? And just as soon as you could heave yourself up from the creaking chairs, you\u2019d shown more energy and enthusiasm in the bedroom than you\u2019d managed in days. It still left you a panting mess and most of the moving had been your own flab rocking against your wife\u2019s bloated thigh rolls and FUPA, but her moans and the sweaty heap she\u2019d been reduced to after made you believe you\u2019d put on a good enough show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou offered her the unoccupied guest bedroom and she had told you she\u2019d be moved in by that evening. When she had returned, the stains and rip up the side in your shirt told her what you had been up to more than the dishes in the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she\u2019d met Mia, though, her eyes had gone wide. You could practically watch her pupils dilate as they fell across Mia's great, quivering expanse, crumbs littering her barely-covered cleavage. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, Mia!\u201d She\u2019d chirped out after a minute, shaking her hand with sweaty palms from where she lay on the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey actually kicked it off well and, if the way your wife was eyeing her curvy caretaker's chest was any indication, you would guess that she didn\u2019t mind a bit of eyecandy around the house either. \u201cHer\u2019s are almost as big as yours, Gordo!\u201d She had teased later while you both had spread across the bed, digested your gutbuster of a dinner, and talked about your new caretaker after a bout of jiggling sex. You were both covered in sweat, you\u2019d gotten on top and she\u2019d rolled over to rest on her blimp of a gut while you fucked at her bloated, dimpled bottom, your own gut spilling across the shelf of her ass to squish against her ham-like rolls of backfat. You remember rolling your eyes at her as she spoke, \u201cCareful. If she cooks half as good as she looks, soon you\u2019re going to be as big as me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sausage-thick finger had sunk into your stretch-marked siderolls and you swatted her hand away, rolling over slowly so that you pressed against her, and kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had been right, though. When she arrived the next day to start her first shift--you remember it well, largely because of the way that Rachel\u2019s chest had been bouncing up-and-down on your own cellulite coated ass shelf while she\u2019d tugged your pants up past the newly prominent roll of thigh that was swallowing your knees--Rachel turned out to be a magician in the kitchen.<br>\r\nIt took her an hour to whip up enough food to not only leave you, Mia, and <i>even Sofia </i>full, but completely pinned to the chair. You\u2019d even busted through the two that had been straining to support you and been forced to rub at the sides of your turgid gut as it pinned you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you laid there, fuller than you\u2019d been in your life, and too fat to even roll over, you looked over to Mia. She caught your eye, glancing down past her chins to give you a playful, knowing wink as she stuffed the last bite of dinner into her mouth and Rachel hurriedly excused herself to the kitchen with suspicious haste and a bright blush across her cheeks. \u201cTold ya, Gordo~.

But quite soon she started doing more.  It seemed everytime you were alone together, she would stroke you leg, or pull your hands towards her breasts of gut.

She was Latina, she was fat, she was spoiled, and unabashedly comfortable with how fucking enormous she was. With the way that she'd been talking to you and about her body, groping her tummy and begging you to do the same, pillow talking you and whispering naughty little nothings into your ear, even you were surprised that you'd held out this long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one of the nights where Mia and her mother went out to shop, not long after the first one thanks to your mother-in-law's cooking, you finally broke and had fat, sloppy sex with Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her size, she mostly just laid there. Anything more meant that she would have run the risk of burning calories, and neither of you were comfortable with that. The rush of cheating on your wife, combined with the experience of getting to fuck a woman so big that she was getting caught in doorways, was enough to grant you the energy required to skewer such a hog. She was so much more vocal than Mia, verbally thirsty for you in loud moans and thick cries of pleasured anguish as you slid in and out of her. Mostly out, given all of the padding in her fupa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me.\" Sofia whimpered in her best porn star voice, \"Fuck me fat, you fucking stud\u2014I want to get so fucking huge for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActual insertion into her was no easy task. Sofia was enormous. The kind of stamina required to tackle such a beast didn't come to most men, even the inspired. It took a long, <i>long</i> time. And by the end of it, you were both sweaty and exhausted. You from having to traverse the mountain that was Sofia's super sized figure, and Sofia from just the ambient amount of exercise that all that wiggling and wobbling had given her. As hard as it was for you, it was even moreso for her\u2014she'd been celibate for about a hundred pounds now, and her stamina was nowhere near \"lay down like a sack of potatoes and get fucked\". She needed constant \"nourishment\" lest she get hungry during...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraddling her by the stomach, feeding her leftovers from the fridge, had helped raise her stamina though. She wasn't happy unless she was being pleasured from both mouths. Whenever you weren't eating her out or dicking her down, you had been feeding your fat sister-in-law by hand. Letting her lick your fingers for every stray crumb and calorie to be found, in hopes of it going right to her belly. And when you <i>had</i> been, she'd been feeding herself. Fat arms wobbled and jiggled with your rhythm as she greedily gobbled everything that the two of you had placed within arm's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at the end of it, when you'd finally made this fat whale cum, you were so goddamn tired. So. Goddamn Tired. It had taken hours of love making with Sofia, but she had finally creamed mid-bite, ejaculate trickling much further than you would have expected down the sheets. She must have been seriously backed up, but given how sexually forward she'd been, that wasn't exactly a surprise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, in the awkward shuffling from one room to the next, you started to think about just what you'd done. Post-nut clarity hit you hard on this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd actually gone and done it. You'd cheated on your wife. With her sister. Her super-sized, super-sexy, double-wide sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you felt like such a monster. But, but at the end of it... it had felt so <i>good</i> to be with a woman that big. Your deepest desires realized. You had finally fucked a woman so big that she could literally have crushed you at any point during that marathon of fat girl fornication, and you'd survived....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now you wanted more.

No, you had chosen your prized hog.  And you weren't going to let her lose to some up and comer.  Mia was going to grow, and you were just the man for the job.  No sooner had you retreated to the spare bedroom than you were on your phone, checking prices of weight gain supplements.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mia and her mother arrived home, you were ready with a passion unmatched.  At Gabriella's mention that you would be eating in nearly two hours, you suggested that you and Mia borrow the car and go for a coffee.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once at the drive-thru, you ordered more than just a coffee.  Adding on to Mia's already fattening Extra large Caribou with additional cream and added marshmellows, you ordered her a couple of boxes of donuts, muffins, cookies, and buns.  As you loaded up her fat lap with the delicious treats, she gave you a startled look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe?  Is this all for later, or do you expect me to be able to eat it all now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to make sure you don't go hungry, Mia.\"  You say with a smile.  \"But if you wanted to eat it all now....\"  You trail off, rubbing her exposed gut.

She always wanted to go out to eat, and she never held back about ordering appetizers and desserts. Sly little winks flashed your way when she would make an especially big pig of herself, flashes of the future of what was to come. When you had opened up to her about your kink, she had apparently been working up to the same conversation for months. Though, the fact that she'd just cracked 100 kilos beforehand told you a lot without her having to say much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then, she'd been your main squeeze and\u2014barring a big, big slip that you never intended to repeat again\u2014almost eager to stuff herself to her (and your) heart's desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression melted into a sultry stare, aroused by your gentle touch and teasing. She ate into her pre-dinner meal eagerly, already feeling starved from not having eaten since lunch. Living with her mother for the duration of your holiday with her had done wonders to help plunge her into greater depths of appetite. Mia could eat more than ever, and she was happy to let you watch. And touch. And coax. And <i>play</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you made it back to Gabriella's, Mia was waddling arch-backed into the sides of the front door. You had to push her through from behind, your hands sinking into her meaty back fat and squishy cinnamon-colored seat.

For someone like you, it was taxing. For Mia, it was like competing in the Olympics. All that food, squished into the reclined seats while you had eaten her out and fucked her to completion at least three times, and it was no wonder why your fat hog of a wife was more than a little tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella cocked an eyebrow tersely. Your mother-in-law was surprisingly scary when she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go wash up then.\" she finally said, clicking her tongue, \"Your dinner's getting cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Dinner?\" Mia objected, \"Mama, I couldn't possibly\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon babe, don't be like that.\" you purred into her ear, snaking a hand around her stomach and pinching a roll of caramel belly fat between your forefinger and thumb, \"I think I feel some room in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia giggled hoarsely, batting away your hand like a schoolgirl and her first boyfriend; as if to say <i>not in front of mama</i>. But your PDA went unnoticed or, at the very least, unchastized. With your own particular brand of charm, and Mia's weakness for all things edible, you managed to convince her to put away what she could manage of dinner that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe \"managed\" a whole lot more than you thought she would have\u2014getting her back up the stairs and, more importantly, back up to bed was more challenging that night than it had been on any other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut boy was your challenge rewarded.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No wonder they were all huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why so tired stud?\" Sofia piqued as she dunked her slice of meat lover's pizza into the tub of sour cream, \"You and my sister going at it sure keeps me up\u2014I can only imagine what it's like to actually be the ones doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beep beep, Sofia.\" you rolled your eyes and plopped down next to her, grabbing a slice for yourself (and, admittedly, dipping it into the sour cream), \"I don't know, I've just got... a lot on my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and slunk down onto the arm of the couch. Nibbling on your pizza. Trying to get awake. Trying not to think about ways to fatten up your wife after having slept off a heavy lunch. Fuck, <i>you</i> were going to get fat if you stayed here for too long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay with Mia?\" Sofia turned slightly, \"You two... aren't fighting are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're not fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's wrong? I said <i>Mia</i> and you looked like you did when we gave you that pepper sucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that wasn't funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence as you tried to focus, exclusively, on eating your pizza. Sitting next to Sofia wasn't always easy, given how attracted you were to her. On top of being gorgeous, she was literally the fattest woman that you'd ever met in real life. You regularly had to help her through doorways, in and out of cars, and at least on one occasion get dressed. You were <i>very</i> familiar with her body by now, even discounting the fact that the two of you had... <i>engaged</i> in intercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was so big. Sofia was enormous, literally so fat that she took up <i>most</i> of the couch. You couldn't help but steal glances, watching as she stuffed herself like the greedy hog that she was. The unabashed fat pig who weighed more than 260kg, who <i>wasn't</i> your wife, but <i>was</i> everything that you wanted her to be? Seriously she and Sofia already had so much in common... was it so much to ask that this rub off a little too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're doing, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hear that come out of her mouth, you had felt like someone cocked a revolver behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?\" you babbled, \"I-I'm not doing any\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" she swallowed, licking her sausage fingers clean of grease, crumbs, and pizza sauce, \"It's pretty obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not!\" you offered in a high squeaky voice, your boner retreating quietly into a shameful tucked position<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is!\" Sofia ribbed you in the arm  \"You're fattening Mia up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood ran cold at the (rightful) accusation. You'd been trying to do just that ever since your torrid affair with Sofia. The woman who had just called you out on it. After (maybe) knowing that you were thinking about the time that you'd had sex with her... again. The fact that you'd only known this woman for a few weeks, but she knew you so well, was downright alarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, come on. All the food? The rigorous fucking despite these paper-thin walls? The open belly play when you think me and mama aren't watching? Come on.\" Sofia struggled to cross her ham sized arms over each other, panting out a labored breath after managing to accomplish it, \"You've been trying to fatten her up ever since we\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't say it!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... okay. But you and I both know what I mean\" Sofia grabbed your slice of pizza while you were unawares, having emptied the box within her pitiful couchbound reach, \"So... you're trying to fatten her up, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only nod in abashed, morose agreement of Sofia's point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it.\" her round face tightened in satisfaction and amusement, \"I fucking knew it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia...</span></div></div>",

Did she <i>want</i> to get as big as her? Did she know how big you wanted her to get? The questions were endless, rapid-fire, and... a little hard to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, Mia's gonna get so fat.\" Sofia laughed, hands resting comfortably on her belly as she wiggled and jiggled in excitement, \"I can't wait to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's... kind of the thing...\" you continued with trepidation, \"She, um... isn't exactly on board with the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Sofia frowned, \"I mean... are you sure?

You threw your head back against the couch and groaned, your cock throbbing beneath your boxers. Sofia knew what you meant. The sly, seductive smile she flashed you as your hands ran down your face told you everything that you needed to know. She knew that you had become entranced by women of her size, and now that you'd tasted the proverbial blood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want her up to <i>my</i> size?\" Sofia asked, apple cheeks flush with flattery, \"That's so <i>big,</i> hun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sex was really, <i>really</i> good, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell me.\" she purred, kneading her stomach with fat stubby fingers, \"But... that's a lot.

You had once tried to convice her to take up baking.  She had wanted to try it, but the minute you pushed for her to do it, she balked.  She had dug her heels in like a stubborn mule, and refused to touch the oven out of spite.  Of course, that made her put on ten kilos worth of takeaway weight.  Not that either of you complained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are things that can be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up at that.

She loves to cook for people.  Sis can't say no to Mama's cooking.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense. Mia hadn't once passed up a chance to eat Gabriella's home-cooked meals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, I'll get her some discount codes for some of the takeaways around town.  There's no way she would bother thinking twice about usig those.  And third, just keep doing what you've been doing.  Not the surprise force feedings.  But keep on spoiling her.  make sure she doesn't have to get up for anything.  If she protests, just remind her she's on holiday.  Hell, after a while of you running around after her, Mama will get in on the action as well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting your mother-in-law to cook more was about as easy as asking her what color the sky was, or her maiden name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman after your own heart, she showed her love and affection (towards everybody, not just you and her daughters) by keeping them full and fat with authentic Spanish cuisine. Each dish crafted with love and years of expertise, honed by generations of (rather portly) women in the kitchen, Gabriella's cooking was her most efficient and frequent way of making sure that her girls knew just how loved they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Mia, quite literally, ate that shit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her protests and rationalizations, Mia was a total sucker for her mom's cooking. With the way that she carried on, you would have never known that she held any reservations towards \"cooling it\" and trying to curb her weight. Each and every meal was an exercise in futility for your wife's weak willpower, as she found herself bombarded on every side by sights, smells, and tastes that tantalized her with delectable sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but just one more plate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't eat <i>all</i> of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you sure that you don't want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mia was a sucker for her mom's cooking. Even more so than Sofia, who outweighed her by a good 60 kilos or so. Maybe it had been being separated from it for so long, but Mia never walked away from the table with anything less than a nice, taut belly. Perfect for fooling around with, given your mutual proclivities for nice, taut bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could tell <i>mama</i> what I told you.\" she'd say every now and then, \"Maybe she'd back off with all of the cooking if I did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mia, of course, never did. She was too hooked on having her ancestral food on tap. Gabriella knew all of her daughters' favorites, and she was happy to lean the table in favor of Mia's after your little talk. There was no way that Mia would have ever given up on having all of her favorite dishes literally whenever she wanted them, plus takeout now and then. After years of stuffing herself, until she weighed well over 200 kilos, her willpower simply couldn't handle the constant temptation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most important part of your plan, the one to further fatten up your wife, came with a single seven-word sentence:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get that for you, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Most</i> of the time, Mia wasn't too full to get up. After dinners and whatnot, or especially big lunches but before siestas, she barely registered it. You offering to do things for her, as she got bigger, was just sort of the way that things had been for a while now. You'd never really been one to let her exert calories if you could help it, but kicking it into overdrive was the best way to ensure that she got nice and comfortable on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I can do it baby.\" she'd protest weakly, sometimes with a small rock towards a standing position that would (usually) fall flat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, you're on vacation.\" you'd always retort, \"Please, allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was part of the game too. Establishing to her, and to your mother-in-law, that Mia wasn't just a daughter returning home. That she was on <i>holiday</i>. That she should relax, and lay back. Be spoiled a little extra, if only because she's on vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella surely didn't mind\u2014in fact, she was happy to follow in your footsteps. Out of a maternal love and desire to see her daughter completely taken care of, she was happy to keep Mia off of her feet for as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're\u2014<i>rrrrp</i>\u2014spoiling me.\" Mia belched into her chubby fist as she leaned back on the couch, \"Oof... indigestion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a Tums?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were doing your best to ensure that Mia's new place of being\u2014her new default position\u2014was the couch in the living room. If you could help it, she'd hardly move. Of course, the trips out with Gabriella were still rather commonplace, but over the past few weeks your wife had been opting to stay in. Sleep in, is more like it. If Gabriella approved of eating in bedroom areas (or really, anywhere outside of the kitchen and dining room) you would have tried to get her used to the idea of breakfast in bed. But your mother-in-law was not a force to be reckoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, at least you got to see your wife waddle belly-first towards the kitchen table every morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were doing your absolute best to spoil Mia rotten, and keeping her full was hardly an issue with her mother around. The only question was... how successful were you in trying to fatten up your wife?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a gradual process, but one that was working.  Each passing day, Mia resisted less and less, barely even offering to take care of things herself.  Your spirited wife was slowly becoming a lazy butterball, content to laze around on the couch, not moving for anything save her next rich, fattening meal, courtesy of your unwitting partener in crime.  After little more than a week, she had ceased her attempts to get up from her comfortable position to do such menial tasks as clear empty plates away, or fetch a fresh snack.  She had all but ceased going on trips out with her mother, and when she did, she came back with a full belly, one you were only too happy to rub and caress for her.  Your own devoted attention, both in keeping her full, as well as the constant making out and caressing of her hefty breasts, were instrumental in making sure she moved little more than her arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she did stand, she never did it alone.  You were always on hand to heft her out of her seat, usually with a grope to her love handles as her momentum carried her into you, her soft body smothering you.  Not something she was ever averse to, and if you weren't on a mission, you might do something about the hot look you saw in her eyes when you did.  But there were more important things to be done, as much as your little head demanded immediate gratification.  There was only one reason you wanted Mia moving around during the day, and that was bringing her to Gabriella's table, where you could encourage her to glut herself silly.  And when that wasn't enough, Gabriella's disappointed expression when Mia tried to asy she was done worked every time.  Although that phrase was something you were hearing less of.  What replaced it was music to your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, do you have any more?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always did, of course.  There could never be enough for her porcine daughters, even as they struggled to catch their breath from the simple act of demolishing the meal in front of them.  Heaping plates of paella, packed quesadilas, and anything she could put cheese and sour cream on were on tap.  Occasionally you wondered where she got the money and time to concoct everything she made.  But you weren't one to question anything that helped grow Mia's waistline.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was it growing.  On a woman her size, it wasn't immediately noticable.  But there were signs.  Her capris, loose just a few weeks ago, were now skin tight, belly roll bulging over the waistband.  Without even trying, you knew the outfit she had walked in with would never fit her again.  Never one to be modest around family, Mia nonetheless was left with little choice as her tops showed ever increasing inches of soft, tanned flab.  Bras were eschewed for the sake of 'comfort', but you knew what that meant.  You had seen the band almost buried beneath her back rolls last time she had worn one, and the angry red line when you had ripped it off of her and fucked her senseless.  She was outgrowing everything she owned at a rapid pace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grew heavier, she was getting lazier.  She used to be happy dressing herself.  But lately she opted to point out an outfit to you while snacking on the bed, then laying back and letting you slide it over her thick thighs and rippling gut.  Bringing her out of her room would leave her with a light perspiration, as her underworked muscles struggled with her overfed body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, of course, Mia cottoned on.  At a guess, it was your sweating face after you spent hearly ten minutes getting her 'oversized' shorts to button over her bottom belly roll.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?  what's up, baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always been fat.\"  You grabbed her thnder thigh and jiggled it for emphasis.  \"And you know you love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S<i>toooopp iiiitt!</i>\"  She breathed, swatting you hand away.  \"I need to cool it.  Seriously.  Don't forget, we still need to get home after all of this, and you didn't book a cargo plane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden image flashed acrossyour mind of Mia, so fat she needed a literal bulk carrier to make it home.  Of her needing the window taking out to get her into your house.  Shaking your head, you forced yourself to pay attentionto her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I''m telling Mama I need to cut back.  And you're coming to do it with me.\" She stuck her arms out, and you internally celebrated the minor victory that was her no longer attempting to stand under her own power.  Slowly, and with a heavy heart, you followed her through to the kitchen, knowing you couldn't defend your position without Mia knowing you had ignored her wishes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia!  You're early, sweetheart!  Did you want something to snack on?  There's a spare hob, I could make an omlette quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see it took all of Mia's rapidly fading willpower to resist, the combination of her rumbling belly and Gabriella's smiling face nearly overpowering her.  <br>\r\n\"An omlette sounds noce.\"  You said it without thinking.  Mia shot dagges at you, but she nodded along, and withing two minutes you were all sat around the table, Mia chewing on her 'snack' reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama.  I...*urp*  ....I think I need to cut back.\"  Mia stifled a belch, though the soft surface of her gut showed there was still a long way to go before she would be satisfied.  \"I'm blowing up like a parade float.  Could you maybe....please......give me a little...less?\"  Mia's confidence crubled as she slowly got the words out, looking as though she wanted to take them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella breathed in, and exhaled slowly, before giving her response.  </span></div></div>",

M-My wei-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your weight is perfectly fine Mia, and don't you try and tell me different.\"  Gabriella didn't seem to subscribe the the regular notions of a 'fine' weight, considering Mia's belly was close to spilling over the table, and her hips were drooping over the edge of her chair.  \"It has been <i>years</i> since I saw you, Mia.  I am truly sorry that we missed your wedding day.  The least I can do to make it up to you is look after you while you're here.  Please, sweetheart.  Let me mother you a little more, okay?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had absolutely no defense against that, only a weakly muttered \"Sorry, Mama.\" as she looked down at the expanse of flesh below her, double chin bunching up cutely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I've got some beautiful cuts of pork here, got them at the market, you know.  There's this sweet older gentleman......\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia sat defeated as her mother waffled on about her latest trip to the market as a heaping breakfast was plated in front of her, soon joined by Sofia in a breathless state from carrying her bulk through.  Mia eyed her sister's quivering mass between her forkfuls, as if picturing herself in that state, out of breath from the simple act of reaching her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was what you were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next few days, Gabriella was like a woman possessed.  She had stepped it up another gear in spoiling her returning daughter rotten.  Rather than let her snack on cheaply bought crisps or other such nonsense, Mia's spot on the couch was surounded by the much tastier - and much more fattening - results of her oven.  A shower of pastries and home-baked cookies showered Mia.  Even if she wanted to protest, a concept you observed becoming less likely every day, she didn't have an empty mouth long enough to do so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, you must try these cookies!  I added an extra helping of cream, and they turned out so well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart, have you had a muffin?  They're pecan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I baked you a cake, sweetie!  Double chocolate, just the way you like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she still could have argued against her doting mother, had you not quickly stifled such actions by personally feeding her the goodies.  Because, in addition to her own pampering, Gabriella seemed to have taken your side in all matters Mia.  If she caught Mia trying to brush off your affections, to deny a third slice of cake, she was there with an admonishing glare to wilt Mia into submission.  And if MIa brought up her weight, there was a two pronged attack already in place.  First, Gabriella would reassure her it was no problem, that she was at a perfectly normal weight for a married woman.  Then, when she left the room, you were there to tell her how sexy she looked with a couple extra kilos, a gentle stroke of her belly rolls, a slight pinch of the thigh fat to put some emphasis on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked.  Between you, you were keeping Mia perpetually either stuffed or turned on.  Exactly the way Gabriella and you intended.  </span></div></div>",

Not because she couldn't, but because she often didn't have any need to. Between you and your mother-in-law, each and every one of Mia's wants and needs were taken care of. Gabriella, keeping her so full of food that her stomach could barely muster up even the greediest of grumbles, and you helping to coax her along by the chins into the pampered, decadent life of morbid obesity. The days that she left the trifecta of the kitchen, living room, and bedroom were becoming fewer and far between as you continued to do your part in whittling away Mia's sense of self-reliance\u2014which meant that she was <i>very</i> ill-suited for any extensive footwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was a hog panting in heat, her fat tongue lolled out as she struggled against the heft of her legs and the weight of her belly apron. Even with her long honey brown hair tied up to let her neck rolls breathe, she was covered in sweat. In just the walk from the parking lot, she had gotten so winded that you'd had to stop twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know how some things fit you until they are on you, baby.\" Gabriella said from (slightly) up ahead, \"You don't want to be like your sister and just wear those circus tents all day, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia pursed her lips into a petulant pout. Ever prideful, even as her weight continued to rise at an unprecedented rate, you knew that the siren song of being fashionable <i>as well as</i> fat would be all the more reason for her to keep plodding along for at least a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just wear Sofia's hand-me-downs?\" you suggested in a (mostly) earnest attempt to help the situation, \"You know, at least for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not <i>that</i> big.\" Mia swatted your hand as it softly pinched a handful of caramel-brown belly, \"Not yet, anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was no fool\u2014she knew that she was getting fatter at a breakneck pace. She hadn't implicated you in any way, which meant that your plan was working. In your moments alone she would complain about how much she was eating and how fat she was getting, but she had done nothing since her half-hearted confrontation with Gabriella to help curb her appetite or lazy habits. Her will weakened by the day, especially in the mounting presence of her Id going fulfilled at every turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it left little to be desired as far as stamina went. Mia was edging closer and closer to 230kg by the day, with all the physical limitations that might imply. Even when standing, she shifted awkwardly on her fat little feet\u2014ill accustomed to standing on her own for very long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, I need to sit down.\" Mia rasped, \"Babe, walk me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guided your lumbering wife to an extra-wide bench seat near the food court. She had been left breathless by just a few more steps past her last reprieve from the burden of exercise, all her energy sapped by that long long walk from the car. Your wife was becoming more and more helpless by the day as her muscles atrophied, you and your mother-in-law saw to that, and the fact that she had whittled down to a few steps before needing three breathers was insanely hot to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you waited for fifteen minutes. Mia recovered quickly in the mall's AC, but Gabriella was no small woman either, and neither were particularly fond of the idea of lugging their colossal <i>culos</i> around the stores without an adequate amount of rest. In that time, you had made two runs to American Cookie and come back with plenty of replenishment for both women. Soda and cookies were sort of a staple in Mia's diet now, but she could hardly turn down the \"professional\" stuff any easier than she could the junk food that she scarfed from the pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mia, are you ready to get started?\" Gabriella asked as she balled up her napkin, \"The store's only a little bit up the way, and once we get you sized, we can try things on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore important than the stuffing of Mia's stomach was the shrinking of her self-restraint. It hadn't been enough to make Mia fat, you wanted her to be completely helpless in the face of food. A willing queen for you to pamper and spoil. You for sure had done the first part right, but your wife's reply was an insight into how much Mia had changed from the willful and mostly independent woman she was when you started this...</span></div></div>",

Both hands over her belly, she slowly rubbed the expanse under the too small dress you had squeezed her into this morning.  She wasn't lying, either.  You could hear the rumble of her stomach even over the hustle and bustle of the food court.  All this despite the fact that she had her breakfast a mere hour ago.  And probably her daily calorie intake in cookies.  Then again, it wasn't like you were going to turn her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry babe?  What are you wanting?  There's a mcdonald's, a chinese place, fried chicken.....\"  You knew that just by listing the different options you could get a reaction.  You saw her lick her lips in anticipation, chubby cheeks wobbling.  You also knew that she wouldn't be able to make her own decision, and that was why you cut off her noncomittal response with a teasing whisper in her ear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I seem to remember a certain someone saying they wanted to cut back on their eating habits.\"  You poked a finger into her belly folds, still a little surprised at how far your hand sunk in. Louder, leting Gabriella hear, you carried on.  \"Let's just get a table, and I'll pick us something, yeah?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella, for once had a frown on her face.  As though she was starting to have a problem with her demanding daughter.  \"Mia, sweetie? I thought we could try a few places first.  Look, there's a sale on over there......\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamaaaaaa......!\"  Another whine, this one with a perfect puppy dog face.  \"I'm so hungry, Mama.  Please?  Just a little bite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well......I guess that's fine, as well.\"  As expected, Gabriella had no defense against Mia's pleading.  They really were a symbiotic pair.  Mia couldn't resist her mother's pampering, and Gabriella couldn't resist Mia's demands.  And of course, with you as a catalyst, things could only go well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's decided, then!  Come on, babe, let's get you up.\"  You cut off the potential for any more debate.  The food court was a mere few meters away, and with it the chance for Mia to funnel even more empty calories into her ballooning body.  Between you and Gabriella, Mia was soon, albiet reluctantly, on her feet.  Although once she started moving, she rapidly lost the stamina she had recovered, and before you were even spitting distance from the bench she had been resting on, she was back to sweating and panting as she struggled along.  It pained you to see her sweat that way, because it meant she was wasting energy.  And Mia definitely disliked it nearly as much.  You could tell by the look on her face that if the reward for her exertions wasn't something sweet and/or greasy, she would have simply sat with her arms folded on that bench until the end of time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you drew quite a lot of stares as you found yourselves a table.  you were leading the party, inconspicious alone, you couldn't help but wonder what people made of your relation to the two heifers following you.  Next was Mia, in all of her glory. Fat folds spilled out from everywhere, wobbling with every laboured footfall.  And entire roll was exposed hanging over her crotch where the dress no longer reached, blending in with her bare legs, dimpled with cellulite and touching as far as anyone could see.  Her breasts were spilling over the top of the neckline and pressing into her weaty face, jiggling even more than the rest of her.  If ever you had doubts about whether your wife's obesity was worth it, the sheer amount of bare, rippling fat was enough to wash them all away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd bringing up the rear was Gabriella, an overweight woman herself, though at least a properly clothed one, and bearing a resembalnce through the obscuring flab that clearly outed her as the behemoth's mother, helping her along and accomodating her, how much of a pushover must she look to others?  How irresponsible to let her daughter get to such levels of morbid obesity?  And what would they think if they knew there was another daughter, one too heavy to even make this trip?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Mia was safely sat on a creaking chair, she was so winded that she couldn't even give you an order.  It was up to you to make the decision.  Leaving Gabriella to try and fan her off, you set off to grab the orders.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fact of the matter was that you'd have been a damn fool to refuse Mia anything that she could have possibly wanted. McDonalds was just the easiest of her many desires, and you were all about flipping as many \"easy\" switches for Mia as you could these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou urged your mother in law to sit down with her daughter and keep her company while you waited for your truly enormous order to be filled. There was only so much that heat lamps and griddles could do, after all. Mia prattled on an order longer than you could have written on your arm and adding on a little more for yourself and Gabriella meant that you were going to be waiting upwards of twenty minutes for your order to be filled. Not that you, in particular minded but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babyyyyy\u2014\" Mia whined, \"I'm... I'm so hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were loving how dependent Mia had become on you, ever since you'd started working against the better interest of her autonomy. Being so big, so fat, and now so lazy meant that she was almost completely reliant on you and Gabriella for food. Gone were the days of your 200kg wife managing to wriggle her way to a standing position and fixing herself something to eat. No, you and her mother had pampered her to the point where she was much more willing to complain about her lack of food than she was to get up and do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the way that you liked her. The less that Mia moved, the less calories that she burned. All you wanted for her was to sit in utter bliss, devouring everything that you placed in front of her. And even if her <i>concious</i> desires went against that wish, her greedy guts guided her towards everything that you knew she could be. Deep down, Mia was every inch as gluttonous as you knew her to be, perhaps even more. Waiting for her takeout was like torture to your super-sized wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if you'll wait just a few more minutes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry <i>nowwww</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was becoming increasingly demanding as you worked yourself to the bone to serve her hand and foot. Gabriella too was equally guilty in her transformation. Having spent so long away from her, she had hardly ingested the idea of her coming home with you, her husband, than she had the idea that Mia could go without her most immediate desires. Your wife was getting spoiled rotten from every angle, and it was all that you could do to keep yourself from blowing your cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you wanted was for Mia to be treated liked te queen that she deserved to be treated as\u2014one McDonalds meal at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time.\" Mia puffed breathlessly as you returned with her tray of food to be devoured, \"I could have sworn that you ordered the beef to be fresh\u2014mmph, hand me the ketchup packets, Mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella indulged her youngest daughter without much forethought, it having become second nature over the course of your vacation with your wife. Though, perhaps, you guessed that it may have come from living with Sofia. Your wife and your sister-in-law were around the same size now. How much of her growth was your own doing and how much of it was your mother-in-law's pampering was up in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact of the matter was though, that Mia was getting fatter\u2014seemingly by the day. You could hardly contain yourself in the idea that she would soon outweigh Sofia herself. With how much she ate, there was no telling how much longer she would remain under the weight limit set by your one-time extra-marital affair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you kept spoiling her, it was clear that Mia could easily adapt to the pressure...</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, you stayed behind with Mia, taking the chance to give her rolls a squeeze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, baby, stop it.  You know I'm trying to cut back.\"  You raised your eyebrow at that.  \"Okay, okay, maybe I'm not doing too well.  But I'll start tomorrow.  Really.\"  The rumble from deep within her fat middle told you everything you needed to know about the reality of that statement.  Mia would not be cutting back on anything save for walking.  Deep down, you thought Mia knew that as well.  Her remark about cutting back quickly gave way to more complaining about how long the food was taking to get to her.  She pleaded with you to get her snacks from the vending machine.  Which of course you happily did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gabriella came back, the table had collected a respectable pile of chocolate wrappers.  Your glutton of a wife was able to seamlessly transition from sweets to burgers without even allowing her mouth to become empty.  Meanwhile, Gabriella fussed over her, even going so far as to unwrap her meal in preparation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, sweetie.  Sorry to keep you waiting for so long.  Just tell me if you want anything else, alright?\"  From just her tone, you would think she was talking to an underfed child, rather than a comically obese twenty-something.  Of course, Mia had little reaction to this other than to make a happy grunt through her full mouth.  She had already eaten a normal person's daily intake in her last meal, but the tray Gabriella had brought looked enough to feed a normal family for a day.  You felt a sense of pride at that.  Your wife being such a gluttonous hog that she out-ate entire groups of people so casually.  You saw a group of teen girls, somewhat chubby, staring at her and pointing.  A glance at their own meals told you what they were saying.  And it was exactly what you wanted to be hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That has to be the fattest woman I've ever seen\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the only response to such remarks was to pass said woamn the mayonaise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, you had been at the mall for nearly two hours.  You had moved maybe a hundred meters, and spent an unreasonable amount of money on junk food.  The result of which was that Mia was finally full for the moment, leaning back on her creaking chairs and letting Gabriella massage her aching tummy.  Her dress had rode up over her lowest belly roll and her backside, showing an indecent amount of soft fat off.  A fat hand weakly tugged at the material in a vain effort to try and hide it, but it was no use.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was fianlly time to get her some clothes that fit?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your wife had been propped up on not one, but two of the food court's stools. An absolute necessity, given the overall width and size of Mia's enormous ass, but one that she had come to live with over the course of the years it had taken to blow her up to 200kg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly wasn't something that was a new development. In fact, some years back, you two had <i>celebrated</i> her graduation to needing two chairs in the best possible way that you two could have imagined. Looking at Mia now, it was almost strange to think how <i>much</i> of her could be held up by two chairs. Even two stools from some cheap mall's food court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been eclipsing the poor things from every direction, even before it had happened. Your wife's ass had become so colossal that the meaty overhang of her cellulite-ridden cheek meat hung low enough to totally obscure everything but the seat's suspension. Her stomach pressed hard against the table as she leaned in, steadily working her way back as it grew fuller and fuller with every bite. Her saddlebag thighs even swaddled the lower back support that crested over the flat opening designed for a normal person's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere once upon a time, Mia's overly plumped rump might have perfectly conformed to two stools, now she was positively exploding out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting undue pressure on a structure that just wasn't equipped to handle how fat she was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creaking and groaning that you'd heard had been pretty common in all things unfortunate enough (except yourself) to get caught under Mia's fat ass. You had never thought that not everything would be as resilient as your mother-in-law's furniture, or that Mia might simply be getting too heavy to be out and about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving way to the weight of Mia's enormousness, she all of the sudden seemed to bend backwards - a loud metallic screech sounding beneath her as the suspension that supported the stools bowed to break right underneath her canyonous crack! Spread apart on a wide base, Mia's center of balance was thrown off, meaning that the stools she'd been suffocating were suddenly bent just too far back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you or Gabriella knew what was happening, Mia was laying flat on her back in the middle of the mall food court, covered in food. Spread eagle and buried under fries, crumbs, and the occasional splatter of sauce, Mia's heart was pounding in her chest, a belated and belabored squeal sounding her confusion just as easily as your erection sounded yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe!\" she panted, \"M-Mama, I - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were forced to help Mia to a sitting position. Not an easy task when your wife was as heavy as she was. Mia had gotten so out of shape that even that had left her winded, and she hadn't lifted so much as one cheek off of the ground. Examining her to make sure that she hadn't been hurt, and talking to the mall security guards, had given her enough time to try to brave standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia cursed in Spanish as you and her mother helped her to her feet, breathless and exhausted with a slight limp as she dealt with whatever damage the fall had given her. You suspected that it was minimal, given the amount of impact padding that Mia was sporting, but you were willing to indulge her if she felt that she was a little hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm getting too heavy...\" Mia wheezed in the heat as Gabriella helped fasten her seat belt back in the van, \"You've... you've got to help me lose some weight, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your wife's triply-chinned face frown so tightly, you knew that she was serious about wanting to slim down. Just as serious as she had been for the past few months. Or right up until she was begging for more food from the mall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as serious when she silently agreed to your pestering for Gabriella to stop over for Dairy Queen on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no new clothes and at least one meal richer, you managed to get Mia back in through the front door before she agreed silently that perhaps shopping online was a better option... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I lose some weight, of course.\" Mia added hastily, chocolate sauce still dotting the corners of her mouth...</span></div></div>",

But maybe Gabriella would let something slip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, has she always been so, y'know...?\"  You leave the question hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?  Oh yes, ever since she was a child.  I keep my children properly fed.  Not like those other mothers.\"  Gabriella chuckled to herself as she slid her cake in the oven.  \"Always telling their daughters to diet.  A girl shouldn't starve herself to get a man, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amen to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd agree.  Come on through, I've got an old photo album somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her through to the living room, where you both sat next to each other on the couch, Gabriella with and old binder in hand.  She opened it, and flicked forwards a couple of pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's Mia's first class photo.  Can you spot her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could, of course.  Second from the right, middle row.  She was a portly kid sure.  But, to your surprise, not even the biggest kid there.  There were at least two bigger than her.  And, as Gabriella flicked through, it was the same story.  Fat, yes.  But the comparative whale she was now?  Not a chance.  Although you noticed Sofia had always been the fattest kid in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that aside, you allowed Gabriella to waffle on about her memories with her daughters, going through their childhood one page at a time.  It was nice, and you were happy to know more about the love of your life, but it wasn't what you were looking for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat came in her third year of secondary school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast to the years before, you had no trouble picking out your future wife.  She was easily fatter than anyone else there.  In the next year, fatter again, her uniform struggling to contain her.  You tuned back in to Gabriella's story.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....and then she got dropped a set in maths, but she didn't let that stop her.\"  Gabriella turned to the next page, this one of Mia age fifteen in a country park, spilling out of her blouse, ice cream cone in hand.  \"I think secondary school hit her a little hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit her hard?  How do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, when she moved up, she had to learn how to study for a change.  Please don't think I'm insulting her, because I never would, but neither of my daughters have ever been born academics.  when she started having tests, and failing them, little Mia studied like her life depended on it.\"  Another photo, this one a candid of a teen Mia hunched over her desk, still in an undersized school uniform.  And, in the background, several family sized bags of chocolate.  Pieces began to fall together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so proud of her when she graduted top of her class in English.  All her hard work paying off.\"  The next photo, the Mia you knew and loved was coming into focus, as an incredibly obese young woman smiled out of the frame, certificate in hand.  The next images started to confirm things.  Her home from university, swelling as the pressure of exams got to her and she gorged on treats while studying.  And the plateau she hit when the exams were over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mia was stressed, she ate, and gained.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wasn't that fun?\"  Gabriella closed the album.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.  Thanks, Gabriella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, any time.  And I told you you can call me Mama if you want,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked her again, standing up to leave.  As you did, one final question entered you mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGa- Mama?\" You hesitated.  \"What do you think of how fat your daughters are?\"</span></div></div>",

You waited in anticipation.  \"Yeah, I want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....You want it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not planning on going back to work then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might.  But I'll tell you this.\"  She grabbed her rolls and shook her vast belly.  \"If I do, I'll be the fattest teacher there has ever been.\"  She rolled onto her back, caressing every inch of her massive body.  \"Feed me.  I want you to make me so fucking fat I can't even move.  I'm not being the skinny sister anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nThe scales never stood a chance before yours and Mia's combined motivation.  If motivation was the right word for sitting on her fat ass all day, eating everyhing in sight, Mia had it by the barrel.  From the moment she woke up to you shoving muffins into her face, until she went to bed with a late night ice cream binge, Mia was non stop eating.  She would stay in bed, getting hand fed by you, until Gabriella called her for breakfast.  You helped her dress herself to the bare minimum, walked her ever-increasing mass downstairs to the dining table, and watched her inhale everything Gabriella put on the table.  After her breakfast, she waddled to the sofa, to sit and continue eating anything and everything you brought her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she polished off boxes of donuts after her main meals, you were out getting her fast food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she couldn't reach her next fattening treat, you were there to prevent her from exerting herself too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she literally could not eat a single extra bite, there were litres of milkshakes at the ready, along with seductive belly rubs to ease the pain of being stuffed like a hog.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was working exactly as intended.  Mia was ballooning in size.  You swore you could actually see her gut creeping across her lap as she ate and ate and ate.  Her arse, always a prominent feature, looked to stay that way, as it grew it's way our of every set of legwear she possessed.  You had been ordering leggings on a weekly basis, as those huge, cellulite-covered orbs ripped them at the seams, her thighs flowing through the gaps that opened up under the strain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the house was a thing of the past.  Hell, if Gabriella didn't insist on everyone eating round the table when she cooked, so would leaving the sofa.  As she grew bigger, you felt every kilo of it as you hauled her to her feet every day, watching her massive caboose ripple as she waddled her way through to fatten it some more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs were becoming a serious issue.  Mia had struggled with them before you started your gaining adventure, always reaching the top red in the face.  But now, they were even more of an issue.  When she finally made it to your bed chambers, a little over a month since you started, she was sweating buckets, gasping and wheezing for breath as she collapsed onto the bed, weakly reaching for the tub of ice cream on the bedside table.  You would be lying if you said the struggle wasn't a joy to behold, but you could tell it couldn't continue.  If nothng else, Mia was burning far too many calories making the trek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, Mia felt the same way.  Two days later, she gasped her way into the dining room, struggling to catch her breath as Gabriella plated up her meal.  It had been an exhausting task, getting her downstairs, with her being unable to see past her fat tits and fatter belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama....\"  She addressed her mother weakly as she ate her bacon.  \"I can't keep doing this.  The stairs, they're too much.\"  Mia pawed at her blubber with the hand she wasn't eating with.  \"We've got another guest room downstairs, right?  We'll move into that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day was the busiest one yet, as you alternated between moving furniture and waiting on your barely mobile wife.  And, evidently, you weren't fast enough at the latter, judging by how many times she ordered pizza.  But it made it all worth it when you took her there in the evening, where the cloeness of the kitchen let you in for a night of feeding and fucking, the both of you so turned on by Mia's stuffing that you kept going for several rounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you owed Gabriella a big apology for clearing out her kitchen.  And a bigger one to Mia for delaying her breakfast.  </span></div></div>",

Even so, as you wife grew, her arse began to roll over the sides, and you could hear creaking whenever she sat down.  The moans grew louder every day, ominously worsening as Mia struggled to lean forwards for another helping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that evening, that was different.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mia had spent the day in your bedroom, you only leaving to meet the delivery guy.  And Mia had packed away kilos of food into her soft, fat belly.  And it still wasn't enough.  You were beginning to wonder if it was possible to have an appetite beyond the means to sate it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella had outdone herself with the feast you were presented with.  Of course, you yourself had precious little of it.  Your plate was merely a safe haven for Mia's portions, less her glutton of a sister take them.  You swore Sofia had been giving you ugly looks as you funnelled food away from her and towards her sister.  But Mia still had to spoon more onto her plate herself.  And every time she dropped back in her seat after leaning forwards, those agonised creaks were heard.  And something else, as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that sounded like splintering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her fourth heaping helping of Gabriella's paella, The doting mother looked over, puzzled look on her face.  Mia had stopped moving, but the splintering sound had not ceased.  In fact, it was getting louder.  She cupped her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo seconds later, you all did.  With a final, deafening <i>CRACK</i>, the back legs gave way, splaying beneath the seat.  Nearly three hundred kilos dragged Mia to the floor with a loud THUMP, leaving her on her back, taut belly rising above her like a mountain.  You sprang to your feet to help.  Gabriella followed suit.  Sofia stayed anchored to her chair, the task of quickly leaving it out of reach for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia in the <i>same chair that Mia had crushed</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetheart, are you alright?\"  Gabriella cried, concern for her whale of a daughter all over her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, babe, how are you?\"  Your question came from a place of.....slightly less wholesome origins.  Seeing proof of just how fat and helpless Mia was, you felt yourself grow hard beneath your trousers.  And Mia definitely had the same mindset.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm absolutely.......<i>fine</i>.\" She said, giving you a knowing smirk.  \"I think...<i>oof</i>...I need a hand up, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of yours and Gabriella's strength to haul Mia to her shaking legs.  But when Gabriella made to steer her towards the living room, Mia stopped her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Mama, I think i need a lie down.  You coming, darling?\"  You didn't need to be asked twice.  Hurriedly bidding your in-laws goodnight, you helped Mia onto the bed.  With the door closed, you could finally both let loose.  No sooner were you fondling her fat rolls than her hand was on you crotch, rubbing you through the material.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get these fucking clothes off of me and get in me!\"  Mia commanded, as though you ha other ideas.  The struggle to peel the tortured leggings down her bloated legs only served as a welcome foreplay.  As you stripped her, Mia groped every roll she could reach.  \"Oh Lord....I'm the fattest......I'm fatter than her..........So.....Fucking.....Huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight you are.\" You grunted as you ripped her top off, exposing her flabby melons, each bigger than your head.  \"You're to fucking fat for the chairs.  Those specially made, high rating chairs....\"  You trailed off as you motorboated her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia grabbed a cake from the bedside table.  \"And I'm going to get even fatter, aren't I?\" She moaned in pleasure as her nipples grew sensetive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you are, sweetheart.  Oh so huge, like a prized hog.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe writhed in pleasure at your words, stuffing another cake into her waiting maw.  She grabbed your ass with her free hand, squeezing it with what little strength he had left.  \"And it's all thanks to you.  Now dear God hurry up and take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were always happy to obey her majesty</span></div></div>",

The furniture had been bought for someone upwards of Sofia's size in mind, but Mia's quick climb up the scale meant that just about everything in Gabriella's house was being called into question. The integrity of the sofa, the bed frames, and certainly every chair had to be analyzed, tested and more often than not, replaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we wouldn't want that.\" you joked as you spoonfed your wife from the refrigerated flan you'd thawed out for post-breakfast dessert, \"You laying around in bed all day, getting fat and lazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatter and lazier.\" Mia let out a low 'mmmm' as the silver spoon slid out of her mouth, \"I haven't had breakfast in bed since I was a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn light of the circumstances, Gabriella had recanted her staunch stance on family meals around the dinner table. You and her were now the only people in the house light enough to enjoy a meal without having to worry about busting a chair beneath you. As Sofia had continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace, and the creaking began to follow her around much the same way that it had her sister, neither of her daughters could be trusted not to break every piece of furniture that they collapsed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good practice, you know.\" you palmed her saucer-sized areola and tweaked her stiff nipple, \"For when you actually <i>can't</i> get out of bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmm</i>\" she licked her lips, \"Stooooop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do you think that'll be? Four hundred kilos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hmmph</i>\" she whimpered as her eating took up a more hurried pace, \"F-Five hundred?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better shoot for six hundred, just to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were now allowed to eat in their rooms for the first time in years, and without even being sick! Their mother would load up trays and enlist you in helping to deliver her enormous meals to her equally enormous daughters, taking Sofia duty while you tended to your wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffectively, now that you had some privacy, every meal was becoming a display in decadence for the two of you. Food now lead immediately to sex, without having to tease her under the table or think about your mother in order to cool down at the dinner table. Feeding her and watching her eat just copious amounts of food was so much better when you could lock the door and do it pantsless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get me some more. You can't get me all worked up like that when I'm running low.\" Mia commanded you as your cock slipped out of her mouth, \"So unless you <i>want</i> me to bite your dick off next time...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed your butt with one hand while stuffing her face with the other, winking and giving you a sly belly-jiggle as incentive to hurry you back. With the proper motivation, you could slip into your pants, tuck your dick in the waistband, and load back up like nothing had happened before returning to do it all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this went on for a while\u2014it took a lot of time to find, order, and have made special furniture that could handle these women. Thanks to the new reality that you found yourself in, in where they were so big that they were crushing specially reinforced furniture, you and Gabriella did your best to ensure that their every need was tended to. It hadn't happened so far, the couch wasn't crushed and the bedframes were holding, but Gabriella had turned over a new, even more indulgent leaf in automatically assuming that these changes needed to be happen right away, less her daughters be uncomfortable or embarassed. Besides, why break good furniture if you could help it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Sofia both were treated like queens, barely lifting a finger as they were pampered and doted over by you and Gabriella like invalids for the better part of a month, until the special bariatric equipment was delivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you were torn. On the one hand, it was really hot that your wife and sister-in-law were getting too fat for regular furniture. But on the other, you didn't really want to afford them the chance to use it. The idea of Mia just staying in bed, getting bigger and fatter as the days melted away into more soft supple fat to hang off and widen her figure was an alluring one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day though, it wasn't what <i>you</i> wanted. It was Gabriella's house\u2014and the matriarch of this family had final say in when and where anyone ate. If she didn't want her daughters to eat in their rooms, there wasn't much you could say about it...</span></div></div>",

Grabbing for a treat, she found nothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more food in here.  You heard you mum.\"  You remind her.  Despite Gabriella sympathetic attitude towards her daughters approaching levels of obesity generally reserved for reality television, she had rules.  And while the girls could still walk, the were damn well going to follow them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you need to be out of here so the new bed can be brought in.  Or do you want it to break under us when we....\"  That was really the wrong choice of words, as your dick became rigid at the mere thought.  Mia squirmed in her own way, face flushing.  \"Okay, yeah, fuck that would be hot, but.....\" You broke off as Gabriella shouted through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIA!  You better not be being stubborn!  Get in here or there's no breakfast.  Sofia's already moving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i> was the motivation she needed.   The threat of withheld food spurred her on like nothing else, and she extended her arms to you, allowing you to help her scoot to the edge of the creaking bed.  You fished out a pair of leggings with more X's in the tag than they knew what to do with, and slowly forced them up Mia's legs.  You could hear popping seams as you fought against the flab, unable to resist giving her thigh a squeeze under her belly roll, making her groan in pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohhhh....don't.......need food....\" Mia listlessly cooed.  With a white tank to than barely covered her top roll thrown over her burgeoning breasts, and a quick pinch of the nipple earning you another moan and the world's weakest slap, you began to heave your bloated sow to her unsteady feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahhhhh, nonono, it hurts baby!  Baby, please let me stay in bed, please!\"  Mia cried again, gasping for air at the most exercise she had done in weeks.  Lukily for you, Gabriella was on hand to motivate her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia!  Come on, Sofia's already here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of fear crossed her face, as she envisioned Sofia eating her share of the delicious aroma wafting through the house.  on her shaky legs, she took a couple of steps forwards, leaning on both you and the wall for support.  Every meter or so, she stopped, panting, as her underworked muscles struggled to move her overfed body.  It took you two solid minutes to exit the room.  You couldn't help but notice how close Mia's hips were to the specially widened doorframe as she passed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining table had changed.  Instead of the four chairs around the square table, it was now set up like a viking longhouse, with a long table, and two benches either side.  The chairs stayed at the end, for yourself and Gabriella, but seeing Sofia sat on one bench, and covering most of it, proved they were a necessity.  As you inched closer, you could read the tag on the sturdy metal frame, proclaiming a safe working load of 500kg.  It seemed to be true, as Mia unceremoniously dropped her full weight onto it with nary a squeak from the thing.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea why there were chairs set for you and Gabriella.  The two humongous hotties required so much attention that you never sat down once.  The chairs may now have been rated for the heaviest humanity had to offer, but, in the absence of automated grabbers, they couldn't help much with the laziest.  Mia couldn't reach much past her expanding middle, same for Sofia, but neither of them were making much of an effort to test that.  Instead, they moved nothing other than their arms, as the two of you plated everything on the table up in front of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trend continued after the 'main' meal was over, and you had gotten them sat comfortably on the reinforced couches.  As the furniture company moved the new beds in, installing handles and rails to further assist the morbidly obese, you were ran ragged, fetching snack after snack, collecting fast food orders, and cleaning away their rubbish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one other side effect of moving into full view of everyone.  Namely, yours and Mia's libido.  Mia had been getting used to associating stuffed her face with getting fucked, and it was something that she would struggle to shake.  You could see it in the way she breathlessly savoured her mouthfuls, clawing and her belly apron, long since robbed of the athletisism to reach her throbbing privates.  She would look over at you lustfully, before catching her mother's eye, and attempting to satiate herself with her other hole being filled to the brim.  For your part, watching her gluttony was turning you on, and it was difficult moving around so much with a constant erection.  You eyed the new bed through the door as you passed Mia her bucket of fried chicken.  The thing had better be ready for some punishment when you got your wife back into it.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that your wife was more serious about gaining weight now, more than ever, was an understatement. Despite moving her <i>out</i> of the bedroom, her weight gain had seen a surprising spike that had left you both <i>increasingly</i> aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had your own theories as to why Mia was gaining faster now than when she was literally barely moving. Most of them were fueled by the hungry, glassy eyes that hid behind swaddling fat cheeks as she binged on everything placed within arm's reach. She was literally incapable of not stuffing herself at every opportunity. Either through libido or appetite, Mia was now an unstoppable machine when it came to stuffing her face full of food\u2014though you weren't entirely willing to discount \"libido\" taking a large chunk of that percentage, given her dedication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama!\" Mia's voice was a constant in the household now as she beached herself on the bariatric couch, \"I want something sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark horse candidate for Mia's continued growth had been her proximity to Gabriella. Always an eager people-pleaser and a constant passive enabler, Gabriella had done everything since you'd walked through the door to keep Mia so well fed that she could barely waddle to bed some nights. The fact that Mia needed more and more each day barely seemed to phase her, like the woman was built to serve the super-sized. Her daughters could have blown up to literal tonnes and you doubted that Gabriella would have missed a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm. The thought of Mia at a tonne of weight? It was enough to put a pep in your step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Baby, I'm hungryyyyy</i>!\" was a similar war cry in the household, often alternating between the one meant for her mother, \"Why are you so cruel to your wife when all she wants is something to snack on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been put to task in caring for Mia and, to a lesser extent, Sofia. She had completely given up the ghost as far as taking care of herself went, having apparently gotten quite a taste for stuffing herself without a care or worry in the world. You had known, going into this, that Mia's appetite would increase. But her near-constant desire for something edible to be placed within her grasp was enough to leave even you, her most dedicated supporter, sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a fat pig, Mia.\" Sofia would often snort over her own copious amounts of accommodation, \"I can't believe that you were ever my skinny baby sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much of it was Sofia you weren't sure, but she had definitely played a part in Mia's exponential growth. They fed off of one another, like symbiosis. Sofia had spent most of her life as an indulgent hog, and was more than happy to continue doing so. Mia, naturally, saw food and wanted more, thus kindling a sort of rivalry (if you could call it that) between them. Mia almost always won, due to her weight advantage and a direct link towards her weight, libido, size, and appetite. But Sofia could bring out the pig in her sister\u2014in ways that neither you or your mother-in-law could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, you wouldn't know until you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, of course you did. At some point between pre-supper snack and post-snack pre-supper, you walked into Mia dick-first and began to rub her stomach. It was one of the rare occasions that Sofia was out of the house (a date, a job, you didn't know) and Gabriella was in the kitchen and thus out of earshot. With the steaming of the pots and the hum of the A/C unit that had to be run no constant meat-locker temperatures for your fat wife and her sister-in-law, you were certain that Gabriella would never hear you discussing your fetish with her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten <i>into</i> you lately, baby?\" you asked her, hand-feeding her a little something sweet, \"You're such a hog lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I though?\" she answered proudly, grabbing a handful of her belly fat, \"<i>Gru\u00f1ir</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, Mia.\" you asked, still full-mast and wishing that you could manage a fuckable position out of your couch-blob wife, \"What's got you going so crazy lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia bit her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly?\" she started with a wry, wanting smile,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn't exactly say you were shocked by her announcement.  After all, you had done everything you could to errode any and all desire she had to remain active.  Still, you needed to take a second to process.  Absent-mindedly, you fed Mia another snack, repeating what she said under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to get too fat to move.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing yourself say it solidified it in you mind.  Mia's grinning, seductive face told you she wasn't lying.  At this point, you thought your cock couldn't get any harder.  Futilely, you tried to figure out a way to fuck her there and then.  Mia herself wasn't helping the situation, groping your arse whilst she stuffed her face.  For once, it was you who was struggling with your libido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia.....Stop that....\"  You whisper in her ear half-heartedly.  Truthfully, you didn't want her to, not really.  But if you were going to be put through this, Mia would be too.  You grabbed one of her bulging, unrestrained tits under her top, massaging and caressing the nipple, feeling it stiffen beneath your touch.  A sharp intake of breath told you your plan was working.  Not content yet, you began to kiss the flab where her neck should be, pulling yourself closer and burying your body in her soft form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnn.....That's not fair....\"  She breathed, momentarily pausing in her feast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you were going to let that go unnoticed.  You grabbed a box of donuts from the table, resting them on her expanse of fat as you hand fed her one.  \"Too fat to move?  What are you now then?  'Cause I don't see much movement now.\"  Another donut stopped her from responding, already round cheeks filled to the brim.  \"Just you wait, though.  You want to be fatter?  Graduate from hippo to whale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled \"Yes!\"  was heard as you jiggled her middle roll, bouncing it into the two above and below.  With just that small movement, her entire body was soon in motion, smacking against itself quietly.  Bending down, pressing your erect member into her, you whispered in her ear.  \"Feel that?  That the only movement you want to feel?  You're going to lie in bed all day, too fat and lazy to even feed yourself?\"  \"Eve-\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke off, quickly dropping to Mia's side as you heard the footsteps coming from the next room, signalling Gabriella's arrival.  There was nothing you could do about Mia's breathlessness, save for hope her mother didn't comment on it.  Which of course, she did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look tired, sweetie.  You need a little something to pep you up?  I've got some chocolate through here if you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....Chocolate.....sounds great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\nKnowing that you had your wife's full support behind her growing into a bedbound glutton did wonders for you both.  Especially in the bedroom.  Often you would roleplay the scenario, Mia dramatically making a show of being unable to sit up by herself, her arms being too heavy to feed herself the fattening treats you always kept on standby.  You were both loving it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with all the vigour you were putting into reaching that goal, Mia didn't really need to act much to convince you.  Even before, she wsn't attempting to lift herself without your help, and as she got fatter, more and more effort was needed on your part to move her to her meals.  More and more, she would look across the dining table at you, a pleading look in her eyes, as she struggled with the constant motion of her arms.  Such looks were your cue to hand feed her, trying between you to pass it off as simple flirting, rather than expose Gabriella to the fact that her daughter was becoming increasingly helpless.  An act that got harder to manage as the looks came earlier and earlier in her feasting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella, of course, was always happy for her daughter to eat her out of house and home, continuing to dote on her even as she grew by the day.  As Mia's great belly forced her further and further away from the table, past the reach of her unwieldy arms, she kept the plates close, and kept them full.  The both of you were run ragged, looking after the super-sized Sofia and the megaton-sized Mia.  But it was a task you both took to with your own respective prides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, something would change eventually</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at it, your back was being put under a lot of strain by your wife's gluttony.  Leaning over to feed her, the sheer effort of fucking her through her flab, helping her to her feet.  Walking her through to the dining room was becoming torturous, as your role became less guiding and more suppport for your over three hundred kilogram wife.  It was a hot torture, as her heavy breathing and rippling body reminded you of how far you had brought her towards your shared ideal.  But it was all slowly building up as flashes of pain shot through the small of your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tipping point came in the morning, after an hour of fucking and feeding.  Your muscles were sore all over from pushing and pulling the rolls of fat into the best postition for you to enter, which probably masked the real pain.  You slowly threw a top of Mia, forcing it over her heaving chest, as you grabbed her arms and pulled.  She barely lifed an inch from the matress when it happened.  The muscle gave out, and a bolt of pain sent you to the floor as Mia dropped back down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't lift me baby?  Too fat for.....Baby?\"  You heard Mia's voice slowly change from playful to concerned.  As you could only lie there grimacing against the pain, it rose in pitch.  \"Baby!  Talk to me, please!\"  It sounded like she was on the verge of tears.  Slowly, carefully, all the while being subjected to the throbbing agony in your back, you turned to face her.  Still exactly where you left her, she was rocking backwards and forwards, helplessly trying to lift herself.  But she couldn't do it.  The combined efforts of the household had left her too heavy and too pampered to accomplish this simple task alone.  Still struggling, she did what you had been coaching her to do in any and all situations.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAMA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank heavens you were already dressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella was an angel, expertly helping first you, then her daughter to your feet.  With the concern only a mother could show, she laid you on the spare couch with a painkiller, all the while tending to her daughter's hungry bellies at your own insistence.  Mercifully, she wasn't asking what caused it.  Although, looking at the situation, there was only one thing it could be.  From your spot, you could just about see Mia, pigging out like an animal.  Not out of libido, for once.  No, you could see in the looks she kept throwing you it was to drown out the feeling welling up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gabriella helped her into the bedroom, graciously allowing the two of you to take food there in light of the exceptional situation, you were finally alone together again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby?  Are you going to be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting as you shifted, the painkillers doing wonders, you planted a kiss on her fat cheek. \"Me?  I'll be fine, Mia.  Just need to sleep it off.  Come tomorrow, I'll be perfectly fine.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turned out, you weren't perfectly fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that you had slipped a disc, as well as having strained your back muscles, thanks to your constant struggles against Mia's escalating tonnage. It's not like you'd had a break for quite awhile. Even before you came here, you did everything you could to keep Mia as well fed and lazy as possible, and that process had only accelerated since your arrival. Between trying to help your bloated heifer of a wife to her feet or to walk down the hall; lifting her increasingly heavy rolls and scrubbing between them while she sat on her shower stool; heaving up her enormous, crushing belly and forcing yourself past her blubbery thunder thighs when the two of you were feeling amorous; then, once you add in the endless trips for vast quantities of food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it was frankly a miracle that nothing had happened before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Gabriella's help, you'd gone to the local hospital, and they'd patched you up as best they could. Some of the damage, however, would take time to heal, and there was little they could do except provide you with painkillers to ease the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contacted work to tell them what happened, and they were thankfully rather understanding. One positive about the nature of your work was that you were free to work from home, so once you started feeling up to it, you could start working on various projects on your laptop. Before this had happened, you'd even debated talking with Mia about moving here, whether with Gabriella and Sofia or into a place nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, you would have preferred your own place, close enough that your mother-in-law could check on Mia when life required you to be out, while still giving you your own space. Your back, however, had adjusted plans slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the physical pain you in, it was clear this was bothering Mia on a much deeper level. She'd been a feedee since you two had met, but never before had her doughy desires hurt someone she cared about. Adding insult to injury, she couldn't even look after you during your convalescence. She'd attempted to on the first day, but it had been nothing short of a joke. It had taken Mia almost five minutes of rocking back and forth to gain the momentum to stand, then to take a few slow, wobbling, staggering steps towards the door. She was leaning against the frame, panting heavily, when Gabriella entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd promptly forced her daughter back to her bed, insisting that she could hurt herself if she wasn't careful, and she was more then capable of looking after you. Mia was rather insistent that she at least be allowed to stay with you, even if she couldn't nurse you back to health at all, taking her meals once more in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, that's how the two of you spent the next few weeks- you, stretched out of a double bed, taking the occasional pill; Mia, eating everything in arms' reach; and Gabriella, bringing in cartload after cartload of chow for Mia's ever-hungry maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite, or perhaps because of, her utter and growing helplessness in light of her gargantuan gain, Mia was eating more then ever before. Even Gabriella was having trouble keeping pace with Mia's boundless appetite, and your wife had taken to placing massive fast food orders, scarfing them down between courses of her Mom's homemade delicacies. She'd even taken to devouring a mountain of delivery pizza just before bed, and refused to sleep until her belly was packed painfully full. She refused to drink anything that wasn't a milkshake or a soda, and you'd even woken up to sounds of her snacking through out the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving like a pet rock and inhaling tens of thousands of calories a day could only have one result, and your shockingly obese wife was growing by leaps and bounds. She was outgrowing her clothes so frequently that she spent most days nude, hiding her naughty bits under a blanket (which honestly covered less by the day). Where before she'd been playing up her uselessness, now it seemed she was rapidly approaching that level, only now in a strange form of punishment as opposed to her own desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Five weeks.  It was a long time, especially when you couldn't move around.  As both you and Mia knew.  Although your reasons for motionlessness differed, the end result remained the same.  But that time was just about over.  As you slowly got to your feet, you could tell your back was almost healed.  As you walked to the wardrobe and dressed yourself, you revelled in the freedom, the independance, things you hadn't had for an annoyingly long time.  You stretched, and rather than the shooting pain from before, there was only a satisfying crackle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an almost heavy heart, you turned to face her.  The cause of your temporary immobility, though one helped by your own hand.  She lay on the bed, exposed fat rolls wobbling with just her breathing, flabby neck straining to look at you with her round face.  Though your time confined to the bed seemed to be at an end, the question was:  was Mia's?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instictively, you made to grab her arms, to help her into a sitting position.  It took her literally swatting them away to remind you of the ordeal you just went through.  And the dilema only got worse from there.  Mia had to get sat up, and you couldn't help her.  And so, she had no choice but to do it herself.  Scrunching up her face in a show of effort, she weakly kicked and pawed at the bed to try and get some motion.  Even these simple acts were making her breathless, and there was little result.  After too short of an attempt, she gave up, huffing and puffing, face flushed.  Your heart ached as you watched her struggle, but you couldn't risk relieving her flabby burden.  And Mia knew this, which was why she redoubled her efforts, this time shimmying her massive backside from left to right.  Like a pile of ballistic gel under machine gun fire, her body wobbled and shook, as she slowly inche her way up.  The struggle Mia needed to right herself was pathetic.  You could see that, you knew it wasn't sustainable.  And despite that, you felt yourself grow rigid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by the time she was sat up, your libido had faded.  She was a mess, less than an hour after waking.  Gasping for breath, she was sweating like a stuck pig, the liquid glistening on her caramel flesh.  She had one fat hand over her chest as it heaved, no doubt trying to calm her heart rate down.  This was exactly what you were looking for when you both set out on this mission, but now.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you needed to have another chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia?  Baby?  I think we need to talk.  About....well, about all of<i> this</i>.\"  You shook a fat roll, as you had done playfully so often before, but it did little to dissapate the heavy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia spent a solid minute catching her breath, mustering the strength to speak.  When she did, her voice was small.  Weak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.....Yeah we do.\" A pause, more rasping breaths.  \"Baby, I'm so sorry!  I....I hurt you!  Because I'm so fat!  And then I couldn't do anything for you!  I just sat here and ate and ate and ate, like a useless hog!\"  She burst out in tears, emotion overcoming her.  \"And the worst bit?  I'm still so fucking hungry!  I don't know if I can stop anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your arms around her as she sobbed, stroking her hair.  \"It's okay, Mia.\"  You spoke softly to her, patting her back and feeling it undulate across her body.  \"It's my fault, too.  You couldn't get this big without me.\"  Pulling back, you looked her in the eyes, red and pufffy as the rest of her face.  \"But what do we do from here?  I'm not going to be lifting you for a while yet, if ever again.  So, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I don't know.\"  Mia bit her lip.  \"Mama would let us stay here, so we might not have to load me onto a plane again.  But she's not young enough to deal with <i>this</i>, as well as look after Sofia.\"  She was right there.  You weren't exactly a powerlifter, but you were in decent shape.  And Gabriella was looking seriously ragged this past week.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia took a deep breath.  \"I know I said I couldn't stop, but......baby, if you need me to, I'll......I'll try and lose some.  I am not hurting you like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, of course.  Any sane person would have put Mia on a diet a hundred kilos ago.  But you?  You were thinking of other options.  Hiring a carer, installing some slings, all to keep you wife pinned and helpless.  But ultimately, this time, you had to look out for Mia.  What was truly the best choice for her?</span></div></div>",

Seriously, you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's what any normal, sane, right-thinking person would have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what normal, sane, right-thinking person would have helped their spouse put on 200 kilos? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, after throwing out your back attempting to move such an amorphous blob, what kind of normal, sane, right-thinking person would have watched that same person pile on another fifty or seventy kilos while they laid there, painfully hard erection crushed into the couch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as you stood there, trying to think what was best for Mia, your eyes were inevitably drawn to your wife's overfed and vastly overgrown body. Her body had become something of a paradox, you supposed. There was just so much of her to see, and yet it was simultaneously nearly impossible to see her under all her extraneous flesh. It was simply impossible to drink all of Mia's enormity at once, and your eyes slowly danced over her, taking her vastness in one piece at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ungodly, bed-conquering ass, spreading from one side of the mattress to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer barrel round legs, hindering even the most basic of movements from their sheer girth, and leaving her bigger around the <i>calf</i> then you were around the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gargantuan, crushing belly, bedecked with blubbery rolls, dimpled with cellulite, and all the firmness of warmed Crisco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enormous breasts, many times the size of her head, sagging under the twin powers of gravity and their sheer, fatty volume, shuddering with each shaky breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms, so laden with lard that her bat wings never left her side, regardless of how much she moved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands, so plump her greasy digits were now having trouble gripping on to things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her face, crowned with cheeks like softballs, a double chin in permanent contact with her chest, and a jaw that never stopped chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all Mia was good for now, isn't it? Just eating more and getting fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like you always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just like <u>we</u> always wanted,\"</i> you forcefully reminded yourself before you entered a spiral of guilt. Mia loved eating, and especially <b>loved</b> getting fatter, and both of you had fantasized about this day many times over the years. And now here you stood on the precipice, yet now you were consumed by doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, scratch that. You <i><u>both</u></i> were consumed by doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne accident was all it took, and the single greatest object of both your desires had become something loathsome. Something to be avoided. Something to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know my answer, Mia,\" you began. \"But before I tell you, I need to hear you say it. What do you want? Not what you're afraid of, not what you feel guilty for, just the simple, honest, truth. Can you do that for me, my lovely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia sniffed loudly, her eyes still wet from her old tears, and threatening to bring forth another deluge. \"Do... do you promise not to hate me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never hate you, but I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sniff. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia hesitated for a long time. So long, in fact, that you were on the cusp of asking again when she quietly answered. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">No</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to eat less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">No</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exercise more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started rubbing your hand on her soft, gelatinous belly. The thought that the rolls you were now touching were so far from her core that Mia herself had no hope of reaching them excited you to the very centre of your being. \"So you don't want to exercise at all? Eat even a mouthful less? Lose a single gram.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had never caught her breath from her strenuous exercise of sitting up, but was now beginning to breath harder. Her rolls, already wet with sweat, were beginning to dampen further, and from the blush forming on her cheeks, you could tell she was getting aroused. \"No, not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, bass rumble sounded from her utterly bottomless stomach, demanding another influx of calories to convert to precious, wobbling fat. Mia giggled, then answered. \"I want to keep getting fatter. I can barely move as it is, but I want to keep eating until I can't even walk. Then I want to keep eating until I can't even sit up, and then until I can't move my arms, and need to be fed. I'm already so fucking huge, but I want to get bigger and bigger, until all I can see is my own blubbery flesh. Trapped in my own vast empire of fat, a sea of lard composed only of me. I need to touch myself, but I can't, because I'm so big and helpless; and every day, I'm even bigger and even more helpless, and I need to touch myself even more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupted Mia's speech by wrapping her lips with your own. You slid your tongue past her plump lips, groping one of her grossly overinflated tits as you did so. Mia moaned into your mouth, wrapping her fleshy arms around your torso as best she could, squishing you into her jiggly, mountainous form. You felt her doughy cheeks pressing into your face, and as her belly rumbled once again, you could feel her smile into your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we're agreed, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure which of you said it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you both did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia reached over to a nearby cart that her mother had prepared for her earlier. She'd already eaten most of its contents, but there was still a handful of pastries left, and Mia helped herself to a large, gooey cinnamon bun. She moaned as she devoured the sweet treat in three messy bites, using her finger to make sure not a speck of cream cheese failed to enter her belly. She sucked her pudgy finger clean seductively, then let out a giggle which seemed amusingly high pitched when coming from a woman as planetary as Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she said, slapping the side of her belly. You were briefly mesmerized by the rippling wobble passing through her loose, jiggly rolls as she continued, \"what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first, we need to get you some more permanent help. I'll look up some caretakers today, and see what I can find. I also need to contact work, and tell them I'm relocating. Have you contacted the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of.\" Mia's blush was entering into the infrared, and at your insistent hand gestures, she continued. \"I... <i>may</i> have been fired after disappearing for several weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't exactly been a surprise, given how long the two of you had been at Gabriella's. \"Ah, that's a shame. I was hoping you could teach at least one more class, just so we could officially say you are indeed the fattest teacher on record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia giggled at your pronouncement, and ate another pastry. As she chewed, you went on. \"Well, at your size, it should be pretty easy for you to get on disability. Failing that, between work and my patents, we'll be fairly well off regardless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should al-UUUUURRRRPPP! Um, excuse me. We should also get a scale, sooner rather then later. Even with Mom's help, it's getting really hard to get up, and I really want to know how much I weigh before I'm too big to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that too, baby. Care to guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. Honestly, I'm so big, it's hard to tell. Sofia's almost 300 kilos, but she looks so small next to me, now. I'm going to guess... over 400, maybe even 425.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a low whistle, and pinched a roll so big around, you couldn't even fit your hand around it. \"You are a big girl, Mia, but that might be you being a little more hopeful then realistic. Still, goals to shoot for. Do you want anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia smiled the same cherubic smile she'd had since the first day you met her. \"Bring me some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cock an eyebrow, then gesture towards the nearly empty cart. \"And what, pray tell, was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pre-first-breakfast snack. Obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. How silly of me.\" You leaned across her acres and acres of fat to whisper in her ear, feeling her warm, excited breath on your shoulder. \"You're just a greedy pig, aren't you, Mia? Just a fat, hungry, useless sow. All you can do is eat and grow, you. Fat. Fucking. Thing. Do you think there's ever been as greedy and fat a pig as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia groaned into your ear before whispering, \"Not a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you think so, do you? Well, I'll tell you what. I'm <b>NOT</b> going to get your breakfast. Instead, I'm going to get you another pre-first-breakfast snack. You've been slacking off, my not-so-little piggie, and we're going to change that.\" Mia whimpered excitedly, then you asked her, \"Now, my good little porker, would you like anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia once more wrapped her flabby arms around your shoulders, then planted a soft, sweet kiss on your cheek. She then whispered her desire into your ear. </span></div></div>",

And there was more to it.  \"I mean it.  I don't want to even have any doubts that I'm the fattest woman in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled back, gazing into her excited face.  \"So you're saying....what?  The world record?\"  She nodded slightly, the buched up flab around her neck lmiting the movement.  \"That's....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hundred and fourty-four kilograms.\"  Mia rattled off proudly.  \"Yeah, I looked it up.  And I want all of that and more.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the perfect goal for the two of you, and who were you to refuse her?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you think you've got it in you to take what I've got?  Because you've made me all hot and bothered, and there's no way my poor, fat little arms can do anything about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping a painkiller from the last packet remaining, you answered that question with an unmatched enthusiasm.  Through it all, the phrase <i>fattest woman ever </i>echoed through your mind.  You couldn't wait to see it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, though, you needed to make sure she was going to be cared for.  You had a heated battle with Gabriella, against her insistence that she needed no help looking after her mammoth spawn, as well as her smaller hippo sized one.  It took you asking her to try lifting Mia by herself, a task that left all involved parties defeated and gasping for air, that she fianlly relented, and allowed you to contact a housekeeping/caring service.  One who didn't mind the exact details as to why their client needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI the meantime, thanks to the disability application, social workers were busy installing handrails, slings, and ramps, all to service Mia's rapidly dwindling ability to move around the house.  Doorways were widened, much to the appreciation of the two other women in the house, both of their wide backsides having fallen victim to the pinch of timber on a regualr basis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole process took a week, and through it all Mia did what she did best.  The only thing she could really still do.  And that was eat.  All day, every day.  After the failed attempt at lifting her out of bed, Gabriella had grudgingly relented on the issue of food in the bedroom for a little loonger, on the condition that Mia sit with the family again once all of the necessary provisions were in place.  Mia had protested, but a glare from her mother had stopped it.  Once she was out of earshot, though, you patted her on the shoulder, and whispered some encouragement in her ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be back in the bed soon enough, babe.  Those slings and benches have got an upper weight limit, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned lustfully at that, stuffing another crepe into her maw.  Become too heavy for bariatric equipment was a thought that got her going.  And when she was horny, she wanted food.  And you were happy to make sure she got it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween you and Gabriella, the day before your new housekeeper started, you managed to haul Mia onto the high-capacity scale in the corner of her room.  It was a mere two meters away from her bed, but from the way she gasped for air you would have thought it was kilometers.  Even lifting her vast, rippling leg high enough to clear the measely few centimeters to mount the scale nearly sent her tumbling to the floor, and was followed by a simply pathetic bout of wheezing and sweating.  AS her full weight bore down on the metal, the numbers raced up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe.....what.....does.....it.....say?\" Mia barely managed to get the words out.  \"Hurry......legs.....hurt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see now.\"  You said, bending down to look at the readout, dangerously putting your head beneath her rippling gut.  The bottom roll alone probably weighed more than you.  \"It says.....three hundred and twenty-five kilograms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia could only gasp with a mixture of exertion and arousal at the number.  That was reality-show fat.  She was obscenely fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the rest of the day was spent in a flurry of the most fattening foods you could find.  She was ridiculously fat, yes.  but that wasn't enough.  Not by a long shot.  </span></div></div>",

Gorging on three times the calorie density per bite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had been happily putting away everything you and Gabriella put in front of her, but that just wasn't enough.  At her weight, she needed a lot of intake to bump her weight up.  Lukily, science was your friend.  And, two weeks later, you were replacing Mia's favourite toppings with supplement laden substitutes.  Gabriella's kitchen supplies got some changes too.  Not ones she would notice, of course.  You didn't want to know what she's do to you if you were caught meddling in her kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw results quickly.  After just a week on the new diet, Mia was already getting fatter. The capris she had srtuggled into when you went for your coffee had their button burst off at the dinner table, to only mild annoyance by the girls, and great pleasure for you, as your wife's belly flowed out across her lap.  Later on, as she dropped herself onto your bed, you heard a definite increase in the volume of the groans coming from the frame.  As you fucked her senseless, you were sure that it would give out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Mia had any concerns about the rate of her gain, she was slow in showing them.  She certainly didn't bring it up with you, and she most definitely did not eat any less.  In fact, she was eating more.  She was on the fast track to Sofia's size, and you were there for it, every step of the way.</span></div></div>",

More than that, you couldn't afford to be sloppy. <i>Everything</i> had to be replaced, lest Gabriella get suspicious or she accidentally use the \"wrong\" spices, toppings, or powders in Mia's recipes. And since Mia's recipes were no different than what everyone else was eating, that meant that you were essentially doping everyone at the dinner table with weight gain supplements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch is ready!\" Gabriella called into the house, nibbling on the business end of a tamale, \"No running in my halls, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the amount of time that she spent on her feet, doting and waiting on her daughters, Gabriella had never been a small woman. Thanks to her own ample appetite and penchant for snacking from the pan, she maintained her matronly figure with ease. The fact that you had replaced some key ingredients with highly caloric, fat-building alternatives meant that she was essentially snacking three times as much as far as fat content meant, and you weren't ashamed to admit that you rather liked the places that it wound up on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother-in-law's cheeks were fuller and her chin hung lower, the creases of age lessening around the eyes as she inflated outwards. Her hips were wide, but were now fat enough around that she had finally begun seeing issue with the \"narrowness\" of the doors in her house. Thick squishy stomach fat had built her into a more barrel-built woman, thickening around the waist and bottom excessively with the exception of her face and arms. She was getting just as chubby as her daughters were, but was often too focused on her motherly responsibilities when home to notice her own added padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia and Mia were two pigs in a trough as ever, having only grown even larger since you started doping their food. Sofia and her belly-heavy build were at odds with Mia's more even gain, but the gap between them maintained a steady level. As Sofia grew bigger and bigger, pushing past 250kg with ease, Mia crept up behind her. They could no longer sit on the same couch together, despite its great width, and now sat at opposite ends of the dinner table so as to minimize intruding on one another's increasingly bulbous personal bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem that you could see in this picture-perfect scene of familial gorging, growing, and girthiness was that you weren't exactly immune from it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't eat as much as your in-laws or you wife, but the extra weight was creeping on. Mia hadn't said anything (Sofia had, but it wasn't <i>bad</i>) but you knew that if you were going to continue down this route, your own figure would more than likely become caught in the crossfire in your quest to fatten up your wife...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas having a fat wife, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law worth becoming Mia's chubby hubby?</span></div></div>",

Some days, you barely even had time to nut inside her and get your trousers buckled than you heard Mia and her mother pulling up outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Sofia became ever more demanding of you.  It was no longer just a case of fucking each other, she wouldn't be hapy unless you had eaten her out, and made sure she never went more than a few minutes without something to gorge on.  She never did more than lie there, though at her size there wasn't much of an option.  Pushing through her blubber day fter day was keeping you in shape, and being fed every day was doing wonders for Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rate of growth was incredible to behold.  You swore you could se her gut inching across her lap day by day.  Every time she moved, though admittedly little, she wobbled and shook even more.  Every step she took left her winded.  Her shirts barely fit, constantly showing inches of soft, caramel flab.  And still you wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were beginning to visit her at work, always with something greasy in hand as an offering to your pampered fat goddess.  You would spend her entire lunch break feeding her fried chicken, burgers, fries, anything you grabbed on your way.  And seeing her stuffed into her work uniform, blouse buttons straining to cover her body, black skirt bursting at the seams as her thighs forced it out, not to mention how the arms of her chair pinched her arse, fat spilling around them, well, it only got you going even more.  The open plan of her office meant you couldn't fuck her there and then like you wanted to, but with strategic positioning, you could get some over-the-clothes action in.  You would grope her fat tits, her stifling moans of pleasure, while she stroked your throbbing erection through your jeans. Oe more than one occasion she went to far, and you were left in need of some tactical changing.  But it was so, so worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a whale before, but under your guiding hand, she was growing even fatter.  Burst buttons a weekly occurrence, she was outgrowing clothes on such a regular basis she was buying them in advance.

Being sent packing wouldn't have worked out well for you, so the fact that she was graciously allowing you to stay in their familial home was more than you probably deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she listened calmly and patiently your joint case. The two of you babbled incoherently about what had been going on between you, occasionally slipping an accusatory finger at the other as you both scrambled to find some scrap of innocence. You said that Sofia came onto you and Sofia said that she didn't want to go through with it... the passionate fucking that you'd been enjoying had given way to desperately trying to throw one another under the bus. It got kind of ugly, but by the end of it all, none of it mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Mia held up her hands to silence both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>C\u00e1llate</i>, both of you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you'd fucked up when she started swearing in Spanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear another word out of you.\" she whipped around to point a thick finger at her sister, just as Sofia voiced an objection, \"Or <i>you</i>, homewrecker\u2014it's my turn to fucking talk and it's your turn to fucking listen. So both of you shut the fuck up, <i>comprendes?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you and Sofia could do was nod. Despite having kicked off from your love affair into a hasty scramble for innocence, neither of you were stupid enough to object to Mia's call for silence. You knew from personal experience that she was meaner than just about anyone else you'd ever met when she wanted to be, and the fact that you weren't nursing a bloodied nose right now was testament to just <i>how much</i> she loved you. Which made you feel sick inside when you stopped to think about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you'd fucked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia composed herself as much as possible by closing her eyes and taking several deep breaths. You'd seen her do it plenty of times before over little things and spats between the two of you, but it had never seemed so ominous before. Whatever was going to come next, you were just praying that it wasn't a divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing's first, you two are never going to be in the same fucking room together.\" Mia spat angrily, her brown eyes opening with all the intensity of a snake about to pounce, \"At least not alone. You two have royally screwed that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sofia mumbled placating understandings of Mia's argument. Exchanging brief glances, you almost held a small conversation amongst yourselves without so much as a word. You were both clearly going to miss the sex. What Sofia was thinking, you didn't know. But you suspected that she was just as upset as you were that the <i>amazing</i> sex you two had been sharing was now off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number two, we are taking Mama's offer, and we are moving in here.\" Mia jabbed a rightfully accusatory finger into your chest, \"She talked to me about it while we were at the store last week, but I didn't know that you two were bopping at the time and said no. We are selling the house, and <i>you</i> can sleep in the guest bedroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch. Understandable. But ouch. You doubted that it would be a long, <i>long</i> time before you and Mia were on good enough terms to share a bedroom for a while. Hell, you doubted you two would be able to be in the same <i>room</i> for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to tell Mama, Sofia, so stop crying like you ain't done nothing wrong.\" Mia whipped around to stare daggers at her snivelling sister, who had started to whimper and whine as the emotions caught up with her, \"The fact that all this happened under her own roof would kill her. You know how much she loves this fucking <i>pendejo</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat stung especially hard. Here you and Sofia were, fucking around, and Mia was willing to keep it a secret? That certainly did wonders about making you feel about a centimeter tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three?\" Mia turned back to you, jabbing three fingers into your chest, \"I am going to get so fucking fat, you won't fucking recognize me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the third condition, both you and Sofia did a double-take. It seemed like so far out of left field, all things considered. If anything, you expected Mia to try and start losing weight to spite you. She said it in all seriousness too\u2014not in the facetious way that she said in bed when you two were enjoying maritals. Despite how big she was, Mia had never been actively trying to gain any weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the situation was different, you might have been excited about it. But the way that she'd said it... it sounded like a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you heard me.\" Mia put her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest, \"You're gonna wait on me hand and foot, that money that we get from the house is all going right here\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe slapped her stomach, sending the doubly-tiered sack of caramel-colored belly fat shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014and you're not gonna get to touch an inch of it. From now on, you two go to work, and I stay at home. I am not going to do <i>shit</i>, least of all fuck <i>you</i>, and if I so much as hear Sofia's bedsprings creak I'm filing for divorce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were... dumbstruck. The emotions at play here were running wild. You were still feeling hung from getting caught fucking around with your wife's sister. Your head was pounding, your heartbeat blasting in your ear drums even as you struggled to understand that this wasn't just some surreal, horrible dream. You'd been cheating on your wife, with your sister-in-law, and now she was standing there, telling you that she was going to gain as much weight as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, in another situation, this wouldn't have been so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want fat, buddy boy?\" Mia snarled, \"I'll give you fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hip-checked you on the way out the door, pushing you a full step to the side with her already enormous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you more than you'll ever get to handle again.\"</span></div></div>",

Somehow you doubted that Gabriella would still be singing your praises and hoping for the best if she knew you'd plowed her other daughter, and under her own roof no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was right about one thing at least\u2014time apart was what the two of you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back to your home, the one that you'd built with Mia together, was surreal. You had never been in it without knowing she'd be coming home soon. You'd bought it together. About half of the furniture pieces that were inside were joint purchases. You'd picked out the color of the walls, the couch, your bedroom set...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't care about any of that stuff.\" chew, munch gulp, \"Either sell it or throw it out, we're not crowding up mama's house with our junk.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had barked at you one day over breakfast, enjoying a hearty second helping of everything that Gabriella could plate up for her. Ever since the discovery, Mia looked to be doing her level best at making good on her promise. Threat? It still felt like a threat. Watching her shovel down food, stuffing herself every day since then to the point of max capacity, had been something you'd gotten lots of conflicted pleasure in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had moved into the house your wife was just over 90kg, pleasantly plump but practically paltry by the time of her most recent weigh-in. There were a lot of memories built into the place, most of which left you feeling like the scum of the Earth. Your Christmases and Easters, the talks about the future, her telling you how much you'd love her family, (well, you guess she was right there), and uncountable amounts of mornings you'd woken up to have coffee and just talk about nothing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all you could think about, for at least the first few days, was what Mia had said to you that night she'd caught you cheating:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am going to get so fucking fat, you won't fucking recognize me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna wait on me hand and foot, that money that we get from the house is all going right here\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, you two go to work, and I stay at home.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt more than 200kg already, there was plenty of your wife to admire. For a normal person, even someone who liked their wives on the larger end of plus-sized, Mia should have been big enough. But being with Sofia, who had to have had at least 50kg on her sister, had shown you that you had no upper limit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs conflicted as it made you feel, as horrible and awful as it sounded, and even though she had sworn that you'd never get to touch any of it again... you were sort of looking forward to seeing the end results.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first step was to contact a realtor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained everything (well, everything pertinent) regarding your situation. Your wife was at the new house, and you were hanging back so as to make sure everything was handled appropriately. Judging by the wedding band on your realtor's finger, leaving out the fact that you'd been caught fucking your sister-in-law may have been for the best. Add into the fact that your realtor had a photogenically slim figure for a woman her age, you decided to leave out just about everything else about your married life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as she knew you were a committed husband, doing the hard work so that his wife wouldn't have to worry or strain herself with travel. It was kind of nice being in a place where those things were still true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to work was abysmal, even though you'd liked your job a lot before all of this had happened. Having used up all of your vacation, personal, and sick days meant that you'd been gone for months with no career to keep you busy, so coming back to it anyway would have been rather dull. Having to deal with the jokes wasn't all that great either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know, for a guy who went on a months-long vacation, you sure don't look well-rested!\"</i>\u2014Ugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was that, instead of having to turn in your notice, you were able to talk to your boss about transferring to a branch closer to your new home. It was an hour's commute, but at least you got to keep your job instead of having to start over from scratch. In the long run, it was probably better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So, you and Mia moving in with her Mom? That's nice.\"</i> your boss said, <i>\"How is Mia these days?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't know for sure, but the answer was probably equal parts pissed and hungry. The two of you spoke rarely on the phone, in light of everything that had happened, but she seemed to be eating most of the times you had. When you did, it was usually to discuss matters of the house and some mild pleasantries. Anything more than that, and she'd cut you off, a far cry from her warm and vibrant attitude towards you before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, before you fucked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed at work a lot while you were in the process of moving. And when you weren't there, you were either keeping busy by trying to sell some of the larger and more awkward pieces in your house or distracting yourself by going out with a few old friends. Sometimes your friends and their wives, but that never ended well for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the time, you spent your time trying to focus on all of the ways that you could fix things with Mia. Dedicating yourself to being a better husband, more attentive, more caring, and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot fucking her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, that was really shitty, what you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife seemed to slow to a crawl all throughout the process of your uprooting. You were all alone for the first time in years, your wife was mad at you, and you couldn't even tell anybody what happened! To make it worse, the only sexual release that you were getting was guilty masturbatory sessions fueled by your wife's promise to fatten herself up out of spite and, semi-frequently, the memories of what it was like to fuck super-sized Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour realtor had told you that selling a house was a lengthy process, and she quoted you around three to six months before you'd be able to get back to Gabriella's and see your wife...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long did it wind up taking?</span></div></div>",

Like a divorce, but not\u2014Diet Divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably the only \"diet\" anything that you or Mia would ever want to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam, your agent, had told you plenty of times that you could have gone ahead and went to see your wife, and towards the end she'd started saying that she could take care of pretty much everything from here on out. But the truth was... you weren't ready to go home. You couldn't, anyway. Mia had made that very clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No no, you don't get on that plane until you've sold our house.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had said that plenty of times. You'd been talking to her more, which was nice. You two had had a few long talks that hadn't ended with her screaming at you or crying, so that was a marked improvement. You'd learned early on in your exile to never ask how Sofia was doing. Stay away from how she was feeling. Ask her about happy things, stay away from the bad... you were learning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pam had told you that they'd found a buyer, your jaw almost hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young couple, with rich parents on either side, expressed interest in the place. Of course it had come after you'd nearly emptied the place out of everything that had made it yours and Mia's. He was an artist and she was a social media influencer. The Allisons. If they hadn't been buying your house, you doubted that you would have liked them much. But these yuppies were your best chance at sealing up the cracks that had formed in your relationship with Mia, so they may as well have descended from the sky bathed in golden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey paid a fair bit over asking price for the place. After Pam took her fee and you paid all of the necessary expenses, you were left with a tidy sum to live on. Enough to have bought another place, that much was for sure. But somehow you doubted Mia was going to use it for that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're gonna wait on me hand and foot, that money that we get from the house is all going right here\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe slapped her stomach, sending the doubly-tiered sack of caramel-colored belly fat shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014and you're not gonna get to touch an inch of it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you certainly had enough money to have what you were keeping shipped to Gabriella's house. Well, your new home. Buying a plane ticket (just the one this time) deepened the small dent you'd made, but even that was inconsequential with that much money in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had called Mia and told her that you'd be coming home soon. It was a bit hard to tell over the phone, but you could have sworn that she sounded excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've missed you too.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as happy as you were to hear that, there was something else that you'd been looking forward to. Something that you were ashamed of even having obsessed over while your marriage was potentially crumbling apart. The part of you that had compelled you to cheat on Mia in the first place with a fatter woman. The little bit of gray matter that couldn't shake the sensation of getting to fuck Sofia so hard she made the bed frame groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much fatter was Mia now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question burned in the back of your mind for the entire trip. The car ride up to the airport (you'd sold yours) had been spent nursing half-cocked morning wood over the idea of Mia's flabby arm wings and fleshy face. In the airport terminal, you'd started thinking about how big her belly was the last time you'd seen it, stuffed full of Gabriella's home cooking as her fat sausage fingers nursed it with tight circular rubs. The plane ride down, you'd seen a fat woman on the movie you were watching and it made you think of Mia. And the taxi ride to your mother-in-law's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were more than a little consumed with the idea of how much bigger Mia had gotten in your time apart. It had been six months. And while you were still a little afraid to show your face, already cringing at how awkward it was going to be to try and get back to \"normal\" with your wife and her family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had butterflies in your stomach as you knocked on the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming, coming!\" you heard Gabriella's voice as footsteps sounded behind the door, \"I was in the kitchen, I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was...</span></div></div>",

But the shorter hairstyle and the signs of age that had managed to creep to the surface level of her fat face had been enough to snap you back to attention. Gabriella was the woman in the doorway, albeit she took up more of it these days. In the six months that you'd been gone, she looked to have put on 20kg\u2014bumping her up to around the size that Mia had been when she'd first squeezed her way through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come inside, come inside!\" your mother-in-law said excitedly, \"Oh, it's so good to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accepted her offer for a hug heartily, the most affection you'd received from a woman in six months. That greedy part of you that drank in her added padding welcomed the warmth of a fat woman pressed up against you, and urged you to linger a little longer. Given the circumstances, Gabriella was happy to oblige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just in time for lunch.\" she finally said, breaking away from the hug, \"I'm making quesadillas\u2014the girls will be so happy to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the quesadillas?\" you joked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fat belly rippled with laughter as she turned back into the house, towards the archway that led to the kitchen. The door had been removed in your absence, and you couldn't help but wonder if it had been to make it easier to pass through without hip-checking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't get it out of your mind that Gabriella hadn't stepped outside to greet you, either\u2014no doubt she hadn't been able to take Mia's advice on getting that doorway widened.

At least, the one leading to the kitchen was. Gabriella's bottom-heavy body wobbled and thundered loudly against the floors as she announced your presence to the house. Walking behind her surprisingly swift pace (for a woman of her size), you entered the kitchen and then the dining room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who's here!\" she announced jovially to her daughters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of your six months away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you walked through the opening and into the kitchen, you braced yourself for anything and everything. 6 months gone is a very long time and you had no idea what to expect. The last time you had spoken with Mia she had seemed to hate you, although, maybe a little less? Being optimistic never hurt and you literally had nothing left to lose. You had sold the very house that you and Mia had made together, quit your job, and basically uprooted your life, all for a shot of winning Mia's fat enormous ass back. Almost all of the money you had made during your time apart had gone directly into your wife's bank account, and from what it sounded like every time you had the rare chance of speaking with her, all that money had gone toward food. Every time you had contact with her she was either chewing, slurping, or gobbling something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most vivid conversation you could remember as recent was regarding you picking up a part time job in addition to the one you already had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The *smack* food bill here is *chew* getting extensive. Mama's already *smack* got her work cut out for her, so you *swallow* need to pick up some more hours or get another *Uuuurp* Job.\" Mia had stated matter of factly, as you listened to her devour another sacrifice to her seemingly endless appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had complied by picking up a few shifts at a restaurant chain. That way, Mia and her family could reap the membership benefits that came with your new job in addition to the increase in money that you sent her way. <br>\r\nAnd while you were excited and fully committed to mending your relationship, you could not help but think about the effect that all that food would have on your already gigantic wife. As you entered the kitchen, the smell of quesadillas wafting through the air, you noticed the chairs had been replaced with benches, large sturdy wood things, large enough to comfortably seat 3 people. One of them being occupied by Sofia in all her erudite glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like she had packed on just about as much as Gabriella had, putting her at a staggering 270 kilos. Her eyes darted to you and then to Mia and then down at her quesadillas you walked in, hoping food would be a way to distract her from the awkwardness of the current situation. She had stuffed herself into an ill fitting blue top that did nothing to conceal her titanic tummy that pooled onto her her barrel sized thighs. You could see how poor fabric was digging into her arms and clung to her generous chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your eyes traveled from Sofia to Mia, you found them widening, as you took in her form for the 1st time in 6 months. No matter how big Sofia and Gabriella had grown, Mia had them both beat. Hell she even looked a bit bigger than Sofia.  Enormous was an understatement. Mia had taken her promise very seriously as it looked like she had done nothing but sleep and eat for the time you were a part. She was clad in a yellow sun dress that hugged her exceptionally tight, showing off every curve, bulge and roll her body had to offer. Due to her size, the dress rode up to about the middle of her chunky thighs. Her hair was longer than before and tickled the top of bulbous bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nails were manicured and her wrists were adorned with golden bracelets that clung tightly to her chubby rests. Said chubby wrists were currently funneling the mountain of quesadillas, dripping with sauce and grease that stained her plump lips. Her arms wobbled violently like jelly filled hams as they moved food from plate to mouth. Her already large breasts had exploded into enormous ripe watermelons currently pushing up into her chins and creating a foot long canyon of cleavage, her nipples noticeably stiffened against her industrial sized bra. Her heavy tits rested atop her belly which spread her thick luscious legs apart drooping ever closer to the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was segmented into 2 thick caramel skinned rolls, the top one comfortably laying atop the table. It seemed to surge forward against her dress with every bite she took. Why it was apparent that all the weight that Mia had put on was generally distributed evenly her enormous ass had once again claimed the title of biggest. While Sofia's seemed to comfortably fit on her bench, Mia's enormous derriere occupied the entirety of the bench and then some. Loud groans and creaks could be heard from the bench as Mia continued to stuff her face. She appeared taller than normal due being raised by all the flesh beneath her. It gently wobbled as she moved causing ripples to travel down to her tree trunk thighs. As Mia scarfed down her food, she never broke eye contact with you, as if she was looking for your reaction at her obvious growth. Her sharp brown eyes boring into like a spear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia paused her consumption and for what felt like an eternity, the only sound that could be heard was Gabriella, working away in the kitchen. <br>\r\n\"Its good to see you\" she finally said in a low husky voice. <br>\r\n\"You too\" <br>\r\n\"Come on now its been too long, give each other a hug!\" Gabriella insisted from the stove.<br>\r\nYou looked at Mia, pleading with your eyes. After another long pause Mia replies, \"come here honey\" with what looked like the hint of a smile!<br>\r\nYou almost skipped over to her, over joyed to get your hands on Mia, to feel the love of your life in your arms again(and maybe cop a feel of her newly added poundage).<br>\r\nMia did not attempt to stand, most likely due to the process of standing taking more out of her than ever. <br>\r\n\"I missed you so much\" you whispered into her ear as you hugged her from the side, your fingers traced the surface of her stomach, your hands not even coming half way around her circumference. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I'm done meet me in the guest bedroom\" <br>\r\nshe whispered while she returned the hug, her meaty arms smothering you and drawing you closer. She smelled like perfume, daffodils, masked with scent of steak and cheese quesadillas. <br>\r\nI reluctantly released my grip of my bovine wife and looked at her ponderously. She then broke her gaze and refocused back on her meal. I decided that this was better than what I had expected and prepared for, so with one last glance, I grabbed by bags and soldiered on to the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest room appeared to have undergone some changes as well.<br>\r\nThe bedroom had undergone some changes as well. You noticed that your bed had been moved from the top floor to the bottom. On the night stand next to the bed there was an entire tray filled with cakes and little goodies that Mia most likely snacked on whenever her hunger caused her to wake.. As you inspected the bed you noticed a large Mia shaped divot in the middle leading you to believe that this must be where Mia spent most of her time besides the kitchen. <br>\r\nAs you finished settling yourself into the room, you heard the door open behind you. In waddled Mia, looking even more massive now that she was standing upright. Her belly swung low against her thighs as she squeezed her way through the doorframe. Mia was eating the last of the quesadillas, and as she finished it she let out a guttural belch. As you drank in her form for 2nd time you saw that upon her face was a\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Have you been eating alright?\" You quickly realized that she was feigning concern. \"I've been eating <b>very</b> well if you couldn't tell.\" She slapped her gut for emphasis. Her sundress had ridden up as she moved, causing it to snag just bellow the bottom of her belly, the abused fabric barely containing all of her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you have the check from the house?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" You stuttered as you fumbled through your pockets, finally retrieving the folded slip of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia held out her chubby hand as you placed the check in her palm. Mia inspected it through squinted eyes. When she saw the number and all the 0's, her face broke out into a devilish grin. \"Looks like you <i>are</i> good for something\" she laughed as she stuffed the check into her heaving cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good boy\"As Mia secured her bounty, she lumbered around you, her massive hips brushing against you as she found her way to the bed. The floorboards creaked and groaned with every labored step she took, the short walk leaving her winded and panting. As she collapsed onto the bed you thought you could hear one of the columns supporting the mattress splinter. As Mia grunted and rolled herself into a more comfortable position you could feel yourself getting hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, this was a lot to take in: the sheer amount of weight Mia had put on, how out of breath she was from just a quick walk across the room. You even found her new bold attitude extremely enticing. As Mia eventually settled herself in the middle of the bed, she noticed you trying to hide the bulge in your pants. She cocked an eyebrow and looked at you almost lovingly. \"Do you like what you see <i>papi</i>? I bet you wish you could squeeze, hold and caress <i>alllllll</i> of this delicious fluff don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I do\" you stammered. This was like a dream come true!

This situation was overstimulating you brain and you couldn't think straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wanna feed me, stuff me, and fuck me. I can tell you want to lay your pipe into my tight, chubby pussy.\" She said as she beckoned you with a perfectly manicured finger and a suggestive grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to be told twice. You felt like you were floating as you made your way to the side of the bed. Mia gave you a wink and gestured for you to come closer until your ear was mere inches away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Tough luck pendejo\" She whispered as she suddenly shoved you back with her meaty left arm. You stumbled back and lost your balance, your butt touching down on the carpeted floor. Mia giggled as you picked yourself up from the floor your mind racing. <br>\r\n\"You haven't changed, always thinking with your dick, She chuckled. Do you remember what I told you when I caught you baby?\" She asked in sarcastic sweetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get so fucking fat you won't fucking recognize me. I told you, you would wait on me hand and foot, and every cent that you make is going to go towards feeding this fat fucking gut.\" She spat. You could tell she was riling herself up. \"I am not going to lift a goddamn finger for anything. After what you put me through its the very least you can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was stand there and take the verbal abuse from the massive blob taking up almost the entire queen sized bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what's gonna happen. First: When we are around mama you're going to act like everything is just peachy. I don't want to cause her more stress. She has enough on her plate with me and Sofia.\" You almost smiled at her little pun but dared not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two: she held up her first and second pudgy digits. When I said i wasn't going to lift a finger I mean it. You are to help mama with anything she needs. You are going to pick up as many jobs as it takes to feed this family.\" She almost shouted, her body quivering from her chubby cheeks and breasts all the way down to her fat cankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a lot to keep me, Sofia and mama satisfied. It's way past time to pull your weight. You will continue to work your restaurant jobs. Everything you make will go directly into my bank account.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had more or less expected that. You were living free room and board the entire time you had been staying at Gabriella's so that part of the arrangement you could completely understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Three, she stated. You're deluded if you think you're going to sleep in this bed. Since I want to give mama the impression that everything is gravy, you can sleep in this room but only on the floor. If we put a couch in here she would get suspicious.\" she reasoned. \"There's a twin mattress that you can take out of the addict and stow under the bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And four: You're gonna watch my fat ass get bigger and juicier until it crushes this bed and you aren't going to lay a finger on any of this.\" She gestured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You finally managed to find your voice. \"Why do you want to get bigger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why to torture you darling.\" She said seductively. She slowly began to lift the sundress above the apex of her stomach. The caramel colored flesh pouring out of its confinement and flopping heavily onto the bed. She should began to caress and need her folds she continued. \"I know what you like mi amor. I know that all of this is irresistible to you. I know that your fantasy is watching all of this grow. You may look and you may fantasize but you may never touch. Unless you prove to me that you've changed and that you can be faithful only to me. You will never feel the warmth of this body again. However, I must admit, I have grown to enjoy indulgence. I feel like a Queen sitting on a throne. It's about time I was treated as such, no? I think that this new lifestyle will suit me well.\" She purred as she reached for a snack cake from the tray on the night stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time I weighed myself I was about as heavy as Sophia. But I want more. I need more. So you will provide. Or you will get the hell out of this house. The choice is entirely up to your...\" she said with a final smack of her belly her other hand shoving the entire party into her maw.<br>\r\n\"Now go help mama, *chew, smack, gulp* I'm feeling famished.\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slunk out of the bedroom towards the kitchen to help Gabriella. You knew that this was potentially what could happen but you never expected Mia to still be so bitter and resentful even considering after all you had done. It made you feel even more terrible knowing the fact that Mia was going out of her way to make you miserable. There was however a silver lining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said that if I proved to her that I can change\" you whispered to yourself.  You had no idea how long that would take or what it entailed but you definitely knew where to start. As you trudged to the kitchen, fantasized about how large Mia was going to get now with you back in the house, the potential for her growth unknown. How much more could she possibly grow?</span></div></div>",

Clearly, she trusted both of your guilty concience to keep you in line until Gabriella was home and you began to play happy families.  And the instand the bedroom door slammed, Sofia turned to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHAT was out of the blue.  not two seconds ago she had been shivelling under Mia's glare, and now she was plotting a mutiny.  At first, you thought she was joking, to lighten the mood.  But the cunning, sly look on her face told you different.  She genuinely thought this was an acceptable idea.  To just......leave. To pile more hurt onto Mia's wounded heart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, Sofia saw your disbelief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking that if we do what Sis tells us to, everything will be fine.  You and her will get back together, you'll move back home, and nobody will ever find out.\"  She took a deep breath.  \"Sorry, stud, but that's not happening.  You think she's going to let you off the hook?  And I mean EVER?  No way.  Not a chance in hell.  And when she tells Mama - and she will tell her, sonner or later - We do not want to be anywhere within even the same city.  You thought Sis was scary?  Mama is worse.  A thousand times more worse.  A real <i>diablo</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sofia spoke, you felt a pit opening up in your stomach.  She was making sense.  Did you really think you could still recover your marriage?  After all of this?  It seemed less likely by the second.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But even so, we can't just leave, can we?  Where the hell would we go?  Not to put too fine a point on it, but you're not exactly the most maneuverable of people.  Or employable.\"  You desperately pulled reasons from your mind, anything to stop the awful sense Sofia was making.  And dear God why did you mention her weight?  With her enormity on full display, and the endorphins coursing through your system, Sofia's lack of agility was the last thing you needed to focus on.  How she barely fit in the shitbox car the four of you were sharing, her slow, thudding footsteps.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head to try and clear it, but from the slight smile on Sofia's face, she obviously had similar thoughts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\"  Sofia started again.  \"I can make arrangements on my end.  You'llbe seeling your house, that's fine.  We can send some to Mia and Mama.  Tell them you sold short.  And then, I'll use what you don't send to get us a place.  We can both work-in a fashion-we'll be fine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustle of shopping bags outside alerted the two of you to Gabriella's imment return.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we need to decide now.  We're not going to get any alone time to plan from here on out.  \"Sofia hissed desperately, as floorboards creaked under Mia's srtide towards the door.  \"Are we doing this?  Or not?\"</span></div></div>",

Despite her forwardness with how attracted she was to a married man, Sofia could be surprisingly tender when she wanted to be. Buried behind the fleshy features of her face, her brown eyes twinkled as the corners of her mouth tugged happily into chubby dimples. It was this shy, almost passive look of admiration that you'd only seen once or twice since the two of you had started sleeping around. It had totally clashed with her outward personality of a big, greedy bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her tug at your hand with the plump sausages of her own, brushing your pinky against hers in a flirtatious affirmation of your silent pact to run away together. As Mia's stomping stride neared the door and the knob began to turn, she quickly jerked her hand away. No reason to give her any other reasons to yell, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that had stopped her, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had plenty of good reasons to be mad at the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sofia took every lump that Mia had it in her to dish out. And she delivered those lumps in a calm, cold fury. You two sat there for hours, just absorbing all of the well-earned hatred that you had managed to pull out from her. It was a look that you'd never seen on your wife's face before. One that, even as you faded in and out of the argument, made you feel the shame and scorn that she had in you for cheating on her with another woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister, for Christ's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring it all, your thoughts often drifted towards the logistics of your plan with Sofia. While Mia was outlining her feelings and struggling to maintain her tone, avoid bursting into tears or erupting in righteous fury, your mind couldn't help but wander\u2014and, despite the intense shame and disgust that you felt with yourself, your mind wandered towards Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should have felt horrible. You <i>did</i> feel horrible. About all of it. The life that you and Mia had built together was, in that night, irreparably ruined without question. Things would never be the same between you, even if you <i>didn't</i> get a divorce. Which was a word floated around quite a few times, always with more anger than sadness to your wife's voice. Not that you were particularly shocked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it had happened in Sofia's bedroom, it was you and Mia who had to shuffle out awkwardly. After having stood there well into the early hours of the morning in nothing but your boxers, your sister-in-law exploding out of nothing but leggings and a bra, you were more than ready for this all to be over. The fight, the hurt, the hate... not likely that any of those would ever be well and truly any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slunk into the guest bedroom, trying to make sure that you were quiet enough that you didn't wake Gabriella, you heard your phone vibrate against the wood of the ornate dresser in the outside hall. Sticking your naked arm out and snaking it around the corner, you palmed your boxy, heavy-duty case and hushed it to vibrate mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 missed calls from Mia, timestamped about five minutes and one minute respectively before she'd busted you busting into her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 new text message from Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are we... still doing this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou typed out your response:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You bet your big fat ass we are.\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had been sleeping the guest room for a week before you got on the plane home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had told Gabriella that you two had gotten into a big fight as a way to explain why you were suddenly occupying the tiny room instead of sleeping in the same bed with her, but nothing could really explain the nastiness behind her jabs at both you and Sofia. Gabriella would often come to her other daughter's rescue, chiding Mia for lashing out at her <i>familia</i> for something that her husband did. Mia would just snort derisively, offer an apology to placate their mother, and ask for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the fight, your vibrant and lovely wife had done fuck all else except for eat. No surprise, given that comfort eating seemed to be a genetic trait in her household, but Mia looked to be making good on her promise to fatten herself up out of spite for you. Not out of love for you, love for food, or even a mutual appreciation for her fattening physique, like it had been in the years since you'd gotten married. It was clear that she was doing this just to spite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing herself suggestively, moaning in a put-on bliss, and cradling her stomach. Making a show of it, just to get you hard. To torture you for your infidelity, with your biggest fantasy. Knowing that you'd never, ever get to touch her again. Neither in a million years or a million kilos would you get to feed, stroke, or caress so much as a pound of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkwardness of Gabriella's house (for everyone involved, not just you) made it an easy choice to go back home and settle selling the house as you and Mia had \"discussed\" that night. Some months away from Mia, as she grew increasingly hostile towards you and everyone around her, was a sorely needed vacation from this holiday with your fat wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back home to your old house had been awkward, despite the relative lack of audience. You couldn't have gotten a realtor on the phone fast enough. Being in that place reminded you so much of Mia and how things used to be. The way that you used to feel for one another, and how much things had changed... how small she'd been when the two of you had started dating\u2014just 93 kilos, less than half of her current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd almost a third the size of the size that Sofia was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of your exile in what had once been your home, you'd talked to Sofia almost every day. Sending each other flirty messages had evolved into checking in, making sure that everything was okay, and that they were there for one another. Genuine conversations began to blossom in the space where fervent and passionate fucking used to take place, thanks to the distance apart, and you found yourself feeling closer and closer to your sister-in-law by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that a shitty thing for you to do? Absolutely. You had never felt so conflicted in your life, nor more convinced of the fact that you were a horrible fucking person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were lacking a closeness in your life that you'd had for years, and it was your sister-in-law who rose to the challenge to fill the slot that had been left empty. Sofia was there, she knew what you were going through, and she seemed to genuinely care about more than just how far your dick could get inside of her. You both loved Mia in your own ways, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, something more than just the two of you boinking each other's brains out managed to come out of this horrible debacle of cheating, lies, and tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sexy pics definitely helped. Guilty masturbatory sessions were the only sexual activity that you were going to be recieving for quite a while, and you had never been more attracted to Sofia in the short time that you'd known her. The fact that you two would spend hours on the phone, even talking innocuously, and she could be eating through all of it drove you wild. Sometimes she would talk in low, hushed tones about how fat she was going to get for you, and teased you with the thought of having to rescue her with a wrecking ball to get her out of her mama's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversely, the only times you had talked to Mia were out of necessity. Five times over the course of your four months away, and not a one of them were pleasant. Not that you blamed her, even as she seemed to sour more and more with each pained session. Every phone call ended in tears, screaming, and a lot of talk of separating permanently. But it was clear by the way that she, similar to the sister that she had begun to loathe so much, could keep up a meal throughout the entire phone call. If nothing else, at least she was eating her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that you had returned to Gabriella's home, just over a third of the year later, the only one who looked any thinner was Gabriella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye.\" she cursed under her breath, \"Mia, your <i>tramposo</i> is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Mia had caved, just as Sofia had said she would, and told her mother just why the two of you had fallen out so hard. She had managed to sheath her disdain for the two of you long enough to keep Sofia's name out of it, but the chilly greeting that you received told you everything that you needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, to contrast her mother, Mia looked much larger than she'd been when you left. With the way that she ate, you were hardly surprised. Her belly hung lower, her hips spread wider, and the fat of her neck had started to creep ever downwards, helping to round her face out into a more circular shape. Dressed in comfy flop clothes, she looked to have made good on her promise to \"do nothing but eat\". Her bedhead was messily pulled back and her fat feet shoeless\u2014ironically, she looked more like Sofia now than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" Mia cocked her eyebrow daringly at you, \"Because I sure don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. Signing the divorce papers was just one step closer to the rest of your life\u2014post-Mia.</span></div></div>",

Of course it wasn't, not when your partner in crime weighed more than a baby elephant and needed copious amounts of grunting and wheezing to leave the couch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were smart.  And pissed.  Over the course of your return, Mia and Gabriella had been putting the screws to you.  Your guilt was being replaced by a not-quite-righteous anger.  Sure, you did something shitty.  But did you deserve this?  Being ordered around all day, berated, cans thrown at you?  You wouldn't even remeember you had a name if not for Sofia.  Not with the oh so sweet nicknames like Slimeball, Limp Dick, or, your personal favourite, <i>Mama Guevo</i>.  You had to ask Sofia to translate that opne for you.  It meant \"cocksucker.\"  Sort of the opposite of what you actually did to earn the title, but it wasn't like you could say anything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when Sofia told you she had found a ground floor apartment in a town fifty kilometers inland, you set the gears turning in you head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you scoped it out.  Found an office close to the place and put in an application.  Next, you filled it with everything you would need:  clothes, furniture, some personal effects of yours and Sofia's you could smuggle out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when you were accepted, you sent Sofia one message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Friday</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, Sofia was bundled into her car by Gabriella, who was only marginally less friendly to her fatter daughter than she was to you.  Except, she didn't go to work.  She went to the new place.  And, when you were again tasked with fetching Mia's fast food order, so did you, leaving behind only a short note for them to find.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd.....success!  You had done it.  You were through with Mia, through with the hate and vitrol.  Now there was you, and your seductive, lusty, loving, beached whale.  And nobody to interrupt you.  When you walked through the door, and saw her, already sprawled on the couch,even fatter than when she first tempted you, you couldn't be happier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a homecoming it was.  Just because you didn't get fast food for Mia didn't mean you were empty handed.  And as big as Mia was growing her appetite, her elder sibling was still queen.  In both hands you had an assortment of burgers, shakes, sides, desserts and soda. All for the woman who looked as though she couldn't grow any fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were going to prove that wrong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hours upon hours on passionate, mind bending sex.  You fed her throught he entire thing, never letting her mouth go empty for even a minute.  You gave and recieved oral so many times you lost count, you fighting your way through her enormous fupa and thighs to eat her out, her trying to take your cock and eat at the same time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou railed her, time and time again, barely tiring, even with all of the extra effort it took just to enter her.  But it was worth it.  Her fat pussy clenched your member tight, sucking you dry.  Even when you second hand counch buckled under the impacts, you never stopped, instead pushing harder, faster.  When you came together, her cries of lust shook the walls, and gave you the stamina to go for another round with their pure eroticism.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would slap her huge belly, watching it quiver, while demanding you fill it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on, you wild Stud!  Make me fatter!  Make me huge!  Fill me up every way you can, because I'll never be full!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally lay, casping for breath, on your collapsed, three day old couch, you fell asleep to the gurgle of your mistress's stomach converting everything she had consumed into delicious, soft flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a way to greet the neighbours!</span></div></div>",

Thankfully at least one of them was vacant; the one to your right had been one of the suites shown to you by the super before you'd moved in. But that still left two units who you would no doubt be seeing a lot of. It would be the courteous thing to greet them, after all. Especially after you'd probably kept them up all night for the past three days you and Sofia had moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to show off your prized pig.\" Sofia purred, jiggling her belly as you helped her get dressed, \"You want everyone to gawk and stare at how fucking huge I am, and whisper about me behind my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slink your arms around your massive mistress as far as they could go, and grab handfuls of spare tire as you suckled on her neck rolls. Her already shallow breathing quickened, her fat little toes curling as far as they could as you got her hot and bothered. She pulled you in for a deep kiss, guiding your hands deep into her stomach fat. Squishing and pressing every which way, she only broke away when she felt your dick harden against her ample backfat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I do.\" she finally said, flicking your erection like a taut harp string, \"Help me get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia was too large to do most things by herself. Years of living with her mother, an excessively passive enabler, had left her with neither the figure nor the willpower to do things like bend over or exert herself for very long. Sofia was as spoiled as she was round, and even if she <i>hadn't</i> weighed 273 kilos (having been weighed like cattle just this morning, and that was <i>pre-breakfast</i> weight!) you doubted that she would let you slide on you helping her get dressed, or laying around the house, or taking advantage of your extremely <i>dedicated</i> nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was, you didn't expect her to see much of the neighbors. Neither did Sofia. Her applying for disability after being terminated due to her weight meant that she had almost no reason to leave your new apartment. You didn't expect her to do much of that either, given how hard it was getting her moved in. The space wasn't exactly small, but Sofia being the largest fixture in any of the five rooms of your apartment meant that it seemed a lot smaller than it really was. You'd picked this place for comfort as well as cost\u2014your half of the money from the divorce plus your new job meant that you could afford the rent and (most) of the food, plus utilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, it would feel a lot bigger until the new couch arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trotted Sofia out into the hall, draped in a big white sundress that left her hammy arms and baked-bread shoulders out for all to see. Her poundcake breasts were crowded by the pearly white ruffles along the top, but billowed over the sides in a caramel-brown show of immodesty. Sofia's fat, crowded features had been made up to perfection. Laying around all day watching makeup tutorials on her phone, among other things to keep her occupied when not snacking, had taught her how to be quite stylish when she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickling at an especially thick roll of back fat with your finger, Sofia licked her lips in exhaustion of the brief walk from your bed to the door across the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stoppppp...\" she whispered, \"You're gonna get me all hot and bothered in front of our neighbors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always get me hot and bothered.\" you purr seductively, \"Like, everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're my boyfriend. You better be hard all the time with all this to come home to\u2014.\" Sofia spoke quietly as she rubbed her belly with a free hand, \"\u2014you filthy fucking\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" a voice called out from inside, \"Sorry, didn't hear you knock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe residents of the apartment from across the hall were...</span></div></div>",

You watched his face change from cheery curiosity, to friendly welcome as he saw you, to abject disbelief as he took in Sofia's girth.  Not wanting to interrupt, you patiently waited for him to formulate a sentence in front of what what possibly the heaviest creature he had seen in his life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You are?  Who are you?\"  He managed to stutter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we just moved in across the hall, thought we should introduce ourselves.\"  You extented a hand in greeting, naming yourself and Sofia, not mentioning the relationship you were in.  \"What should we call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could answer, a female voice called from inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlos?  Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, your neighbour Carlos called back:  \"I-It's the new couple, Henrietta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenrietta herself came to the door, and went through almost a mirror of her husband's reaction.  A friendly smile, quickly turned disbelief at the woman alongside you.  She recovered quicker than her husband, who was still staring slack jawed at Sofia's belly, straining at the dress she was stuffed into.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Henrietta, and you've met my husdand Carlos.  welcome to the building!\"  A forced cheery attitude in the face of utter gluttony, she extended a hand.  You noted the mild shock on her face as she griped Sofia's digits, fingers sinking in even on her hand fat.  Looking to the side, she elbowed her husband.  \"Honey!  You're being rude!\"  she hissed at him, before smiling oh-so-sweetly at the two of you.  Hypocritically, she was staring at Sofia's heaving chest just as much as her husband stared at her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence fell over the group as the couple struggled to find something to say without mentioning the almost literal elephant in the room, and the two of you tried to hide your pleasure at the impact you had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried Ernesto's?  They do a great piz-OW!\"  Another elbow stopped Carlos mid sentence, but you knew what he was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, They really do!  We must have ordered from them five times already, right, Stud?\"  Sofia spoke up for the first time, rubbing her belly at the mere mention of food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six.\"  You corrected, ready to observe the nice, normal couple figure out how you would order six pizza takeaways in three days.  Luckily, Sofia chimed in to help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's best to order ten large, then you get free delivery.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia was rubbing ehr gut more now, which you knew meant she was getting hungry.  And the red flush on her face wasn't totally the exertion of standing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nice to meet you, hope to see you around!\"  You ended the conversation, turning to walk away.  As they closed the door, you heard them whispering.<br>\r\n<i>\"Did you ssee how fat she was?  Dear lord, that is not normal!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop being rude!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't say it wasn't insane, you were looking as well!\"</i><br>\r\n***<br>\r\nBack in your apartment, Sofia dropped herself on the destoyed couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip me!  No, feed me!  Wait, fuck me!  Oh, just do all three!\"  She gasped, pointlessly trying to reach her pussy past her gut.  \"Did you see how they looked at me?  Like a barn animal!\"  She stopped and pointed at you.  \"I want that ernesto's place again!  ten, - twenty of them!  And something covered in whipped cream to keep me while they arrive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought up the app and placed your orer.  And, then you made your way back to her, wipped cream in one, rock hard member in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you get all the cream now, you fat fucking sow!\"</span></div></div>",

She would squeal and cry out in loud, exaggerated moans that had elicited angry knocks in the middle of the night, begging you two to keep it down. Sofia was just as hooked on everyone else's eyes being locked onto her as she was yours, a shameless Spanish planet who needed to be seen to be believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, nobody could really understand why you were with her. She wasn't that pleasant to be around (to everyone else, naturally) and she was quite literally so fat that it was a mystery how you two had so much fucking sex. But what they didn't know was that you liked your women demanding, and that you were just <i>that</i> good at cunnilingus. Every time she met someone else in your building (and it wasn't often) she would show out and be the biggest bitch that anyone had ever seen, either via her attitude or her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you wouldn't have had it any other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, you had still yet to make the acquaintanceship of your other neighbors. Carlos and Henrietta were the most innocuous of the bunch, but the ones in the other vacant apartment hadn't yet witnessed the gloriousness that was your fat, exhibitionist former sister-in-law. And it had been driving her crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they stare at my ass more than you do.\" Sofia said in a breathy voice, struggling to get her momentum going, \"I think that they'll see me and their eyes will pop out of their heads in like the cartoons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting hotly at the idea, Sofia made biscuits with her fluffy brown belly fat as she munched her bottom lip. Lightly damp from perspiration, a side-effect from getting her enormous self up and moving for the first time in two days, she was already in fine fabulous form. It was too early to really tell (and frankly, she was so big that it would have been impossible to guesstimate) but you could only guess that she'd already put on a little weight since you moved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait.\" Sofia flashed a winded smile as she struggled to catch her breath, \"Knock on the door, I need to sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The anticipation must be killing you.\" You laughed, knocking on the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really, <i>really</i> is.\" Sofia purred, \"I swear to God, I forgot how much I <i>love</i> being gawked at like... like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're the fattest person in the room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Stop it</i>, unless you want to walk me back to the apartment.\" Sofia panted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we still have any cake left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough for you to stick your dick into and feed it to m\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish her sentence, the door handle began to wiggle as the sound of footsteps approaching from inside began to grow louder...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sofia was, apparently, not the only fat woman in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this wasn't exactly a shocker. Plenty of people were fat, and the woman behind the door was no larger than your average overweight person. Given how long you had been with women of some substantial size, it was almost disappointing that she was fat, but not <i>really</i> fat. Fucking Sofia and Mia for the past years of your life had really warped your perspective on just what constituted someone being heavyset. But in another life, you would have considered this woman more than a little plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to Sofia, more than twice the size of her, the woman behind the threshold of the door seemed positively dwarfed by your girlfriend's superior size. The disappointment was almost palpable as soon as the older woman opened the door, Sofia's expectations of someone who would dig their heels into her while commenting about her size had been crushed by a woman who couldn't have weighed more than 120 kilos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell-o!\" the older woman said in a slightly broken dialect, \"Can we help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yes!\" you smiled, extending a friendly and welcoming hand to shake, \"We're your new neighbors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave yours and Sofia's names to the woman in the doorway. She looked to be, around your estimation, Gabriella's age\u2014though perhaps a little younger. The added weight to your former (and perhaps, soon-to-be) mother in law's face that filled in her wrinkles made it difficult to tell. This woman, however, was in her mid-forties, and just as Hispanic as everyone else seemed to be in the apartment. Your mind's eye couldn't help but picture what she might look like with a few more kilos added onto her already portly shape to bring her \"up to speed\" so to speak, but that was neither here nor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I heard that we had new neighbors!\" she said with a smile, \"Come in, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know...\" Sofia panted, \"I've been having <i>so</i> much trouble squeezing through these teeny-tiny doorways lately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling.\" the woman laughed, her belly quivering with mirth, \"Inez says the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe introduced herself as Gloria, with no last name. She was an incredibly friendly woman, who offered you and your fat girlfriend a place to sit while she readied snacks from the kitchen. Her wide bottom wobbled when she walked and her fat belly intrigued you, a meaty muffin-top that rolled over the high waist of her jeans. Sofia was happy to have a place to sit down, but she could see your wandering eye from a mile away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we aren't any trouble.\" Sofia said with a pat of her stomach, clearly hoping to bait your neighbor into remarking on her size, \"I can take up a lot of room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense.\" the older woman tut-tutted as she brought out fatty, full-course meals as appetizers\u2014all in the name of hospitality, \"I am always happy to meet new neighbors. Especially since it has been so long since we have had company. Carlos and Henrietta (do you know them? They stopped by!) told me that you might be coming any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia, again, was visibly disappointed. She wanted nothing more than to be told, by complete strangers, what a fat fucking hog she was. For them to recoil in horror and rejection of how huge she had gotten thanks to her atrocious eating habits. All she wanted in life was to be railed verbally over how fucking enormous she was, but the kindly woman tending to your snacking needs was far from the person to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed your hand, silently giving you the signal to depart.</span></div></div>",

Gloria's quesadillas were, in fact, sublime, and she had been nothing but the perfect hostess since you'd gotten to meet her. All she seemed to want to do was get to know you. In fact, you were surprised that Sofia <i>didn't</i> want to stuff herself on the entree-sized snacks that she had laid out for you and your super-sized girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are such a cute couple.\" she said in a matronly sort of way, a lot like Gabriella before she had turned against you, \"I see you and... <i>ugh</i>, my heart soars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hands against her flabby chest. What you wouldn't have given to be those hands. Her fat breasts flopped to either side, her chubby palms spread wide against her tanned, caramel-colored skin. Her soft brown features melted in the face of the love you held for Sofia (and her stupidly sized figure) as she helped herself to a cheesy hor d'eouvre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been together?\" she asked, clearly living vicariously through your mutual love and affection for one another, \"The love I feel between you... it's so strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a few weeks, I'm afraid.\" Sofia patted your hand, \"There's a long story behind it but, we just couldn't keep our hands off of one-another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. Your thoughts of Mia and Gabriella had been fading more and more as your time with Sofia set them aside. You were fucking and feeding more than ever, with a woman so large that she was more or less dependent on you for just about everything, so your life \"before\" was rapidly falling into distant memory. Had it only been a few weeks since you'd begun this whole affair? A few months for sure, given your separation, but part of your cover story as new lovers still rung true. It was hard to believe that you were onto this new chapter of your life already. And with someone so suited to your needs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The newly-wed phase\u2014I'm well acquainted.\" Gloria laughed, steadying her jiggling belly with a chubby outspread set of fingers, \"My first husband, he was a lot like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first husband must have liked them big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all I want for my daughter, Inez, to find something so wonderful in life.\" Gloria continued to wax poetically, \"I clean houses, I do what I can to make sure that she has a decent life. But at the end of the day, what do I get? Nothing. No man who loves me, no daughter who appreciates me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe cleared her throat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sofia, you are a lucky woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm well aware.\" she chuckled seductively, \"And I wouldn't' settle for anything less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I wish my daughter was more like you.\" Gloria said to Sophia, \"Unwilling to settle. Comfortable with herself. Proud and strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia's ego, already twice the size of her ass, was tickled by the older woman's flattery. She suddenly felt right at home with your neighbors, regardless of the fact that they weren't going to call her out on what a huge fucking hog she was. Reclining against the second-hand sofa, making the poor thing groan in response, she drummed the taut surface of her belly while drinking in the adoration that Gloria offered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I consider myself lucky.\" she said with another squeeze of your hand, \"Not many people find what they're <i>really</i> looking for in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria laughed, that belly wobbling again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree\u2014you have quite the partner there.\" she said with a chubby-cheeked smile, \"I only wish that my daughter was so lucky. I see so many couples in my line of work, and none of them were as in love as you two are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many jokes at your expense (\"You don't have a brother, do you?\") and a few moments of genuine bonding between you and your neighbors. Leave it to you and Sofia to make friends with the second-fattest woman on the floor, after having made such spectacles of yourself. You couldn't help but think that, in another lifetime, you would have welcomed having such a pleasantly plump neighbor, ready to gawk at whenever you wanted. Gloria was right out of your fantasy\u2014a fat, Spanish woman who doted endlessly on whomever walked through her doorway. Gabriella would have had a lot in common with her, except for the fact that Gloria seemed to like you, so far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you do?\" you asked your hostess of the evening, \"Besides make killer quesadillas, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too kind.\" she smiled warmly, offering another plate between the two of you, \"I clean houses. There are many clients, but they all pay reasonably well\u2014well enough for me to provide for my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inez, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" she answered warmly, \"She is my heart and soul\u2014but she's so shy. Right now she's holed up in her room, playing on her computer games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, kids will be kids.\" Sofia answered with a shrug of her meaty shoulders, \"I remember when I was in school\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Inez is out of school.\" Gloria corrected, \"She is just between jobs right now. Here, I call her, I call her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could so much as object, Gloria had cupped her hand around her mouth and called out in Spanish for her daughter to come and join the festivities. Smiling at you and Sofia, Gloria assured you that she would be in the room momentarily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Gloria was merely plump, Inez...</span></div></div>",

And when she finally entered the room, you saw that she had definitely indulged herself on her mother's cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't as fat as Sofia.  At this stage, you doubted anybody was as fat as the blb sitting next to you.  But she was seriously overweight by anybdy else's standards.  Under dressed in a pair of black leggings a few sizes too small, and a black tank top that left half of her smooth orb of a belly exposed, you could see everything clearly.  Her gut was one smooth orb the colour of milky coffee, wobbling with every step of her flabby thighs, slapping against them as it hung down.  Her breasts, small for her girth, hung unrestrained.  Cleary, she had no intent to make herself up, as evidenced by her dishevelled, but clean and short, jet-black hair.  You conservatively put her weight at around two hundred kilos.  And none of it muscle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez stopped as she saw you and Sofia.  Looking between the two of you and her mother, she raised her eyebrow in a silent question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inez, sweetie, our new neighbours are here.  Come say hi.\"  Gloria patted the seat next to her.  Whether she didn't notice, or just didn't care about Inez's state of dress was unclear.  Either was, the fat girl flumped down onto the seat offered, a creaking sound all too familliar to your ears ringing out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi, I guess.  I'm Inez\"  Gloria wasn't kidding about her being shy.  Even just saying that simple greeting made her shrink back into her seat.  She grabbed a quesadila, perhaps hoping that having a snack would get her out of the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo dice, not on Gloria's watch.  \"How's the job search going, sweetie?\"  She asked, forcing her daughter into the conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Ma, I told you, I'm not getting some entry level job when I can do better staying here.\"  Inez answered grumpily.  She stuffed the rest of the quesadila into her mouth and grabbed a second.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, there's not need for you to get a job aleady, hun.\"  Sofia said, chuckling.  \"How old are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm twenty next week.  See, Ma?  she's doing alright for herself.\"  Finishing her snack, she found the tray was empty.  Shooting an accusatory glare at Sofia, who shugged unrepentantly, she turned to Gloria.  \"Ma, there's no more snacks here.  I want some cookies or something.\"  No please or thanks.  Just a demand.  Even Gabriella expected that much from her massive daughters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot Gloria, evidently, as she immediately bustled through to the kitchen to rustle something up for her obese spawn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mother out of earshot, she leant forward, whispering to Sofia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I want to ask you something....\"</span></div></div>",

Something told you that Inez wasn't the most sociable person to begin with, ill-adjusted to having to talk when she didn't want to, and with strangers no less. The question posed was innocent enough, when you thought about it. Certainly an odd way to make a conversational debut, but not entirely out of the question when the person next to you left the furniture groaning beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yes?\" you laughed a little, lowering your voice to a similar whisper, \"What gave it away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sofia shared a knowing glance, her lips pursed into a tight awkward smile as she held back laughter. At this moment, Gloria came back into the room with a package of Oreos. She was as happy as could be, completely oblivious to the fact that her daughter had just asked if you were a fat fetishist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do we still have Cheetos?\" Inez asked quickly, before her mother had even put down the package, \"I want Cheetos too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she entered, Gloria retreated back into the kitchen to search for yet more snacks to satisfy her daughter's bratty appetite.

Like you were the first people that she'd ever seen to be in on some big secret she'd spent her whole life knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And, you know... you two, like... do it or whatever?\" she asked, getting red-faced and either excited or embarrassed, \"Like... like a lot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>lot</i>.\" Sofia said proudly as she grabbed her belly by the flanks, \"Of course, I just kind of lie there. He mostly does all of the heavy lifting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you fought back snorting laughter like schoolkids. Inez had clearly appreciated the answer, a tight smile on her round face even as her mother waddled back into the room with puffy Cheetos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These aren't the right kind.\" she said in a curt, abrupt tone, \"Just forget it... get some of those ice cream sandwiches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria rolled her eyes and muttered something under her breath in Spanish, but left the room again. By the time she had turned her wide tail back towards you, Inez was looking at you and Sofia like you had descended into their apartment with rings of light around you. She could barely contain the wide, eager smile that she had normally sheathed in the face of company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can I like... borrow him sometime?\" Inez turned towards Sofia, laughing awkwardly as she began to fumble with the bag of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surprisingly flat reception from Sofia to the concept, Inez backed up immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just joking, I promise.\" she scarfed down multiples of the little treats, her soft hands already covered in cookie crumbs, \"It's just, you know, it's <i>hard</i> finding guys who... you know... like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find someone, sweetie.\" Sofia offered with a sour kind of placation, \"Oh look, it's your <i>mommyyyyyy</i>, coming back with treats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension was thick in the air when Gloria returned for the final time, plopping down in the worn armchair that sat next to her daughter on the loveseat opposite yours. She handed Inez three ice cream sandwiches, claimed some cookies for herself, and breathlessly began to reintegrate herself back into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, the two of you, so quiet!\" she said with a little laugh, \"Please, help yourself\u2014I just got back from the market, there's plenty! Eat, eat!\"</span></div></div>",

That being said, Sofia was obviously perturbed by Inez's line of questioning, and occasionally shot you dirty looks when she thought you were drinking in her size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, to be fair, you kind of were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until recently, Mia had been the biggest woman that you'd ever seen in person. But ever since you'd come down to her hometown, you'd come face to face with no less than three ladies of similarly large size! It was hard <i>not</i> to stare... you didn't want to cheat on Sofia (or on anyone, ever again) and certainly not with someone so young. But you had to admit that you had some difficulty understanding why Inez was having trouble finding people who appreciated her for her beauty, if not for her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is just me and my baby girl.\" Gloria repeated at some point during the conversation, \"I look at her, and I think that I should give her everything that I never had when I was her age. We were so poor, and we had nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll give her something.</i> you could practically hear Sofia's thoughts as she scarfed down dish after dish of neighborly concessions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you clean houses for a living?\" you asked, trying to steer the conversation away from Inez, \"Does that pay well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria nodded happily, explaining the finer details of her line of work. She was like a car salesman, breaking out all of the bells and whistles to impress a potential buyer. With the flick of a switch, this had gone from friendly neighborhood get-together to a commercial for <i>Las Gloriosas Casas de Gloria</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not just clean houses, I make them shine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I offer full-time services, cleaning and cooking, authentic cuisine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take care of my customers and their homes as well as I take care of my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia sniffed at that, but you couldn't help but get to thinking about the logistics of taking care of Sofia.

You still had to make enough money to please your fat mistress\u2014keeping her fed, clothed, and well-taken care of was not something to be done on the cheap. And while you made a considerable sum at your place of employment, you were looking to cut costs where you could. Gloria offered the perfect solution for both of you, and certainly promised results as far as Sofia's satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving right across the hall from your housekeeper was <i>amazing</i>, because she would literally bring food over all of the time. It felt like everything that came out of her oven, you got a taste of. Sofia was constantly hungry, which meant that her \"snacks\" were more than welcome. Even if they amounted to more than platters full of food. Inez's girth was hardly a mystery after just one of her impromptu deliveries, made out of gratification for your hiring of her services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pan of chicken that Gloria had brought over hadn't even lasted the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, you just want me to lay around and get fatter all day, don't you?\" Sofia moaned to you mid-coitus, \"That's why you hired her, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just gonna feed me all day while you got to work, \" Sofia panted as your dick struggled to stay inside, \"And then you're gonna come home and feed me more and more, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fat slut of a daughter is gonna starve while I take up all of her mama's time\u2014\" Sofia gasped sensually as she struggled to catch her breath, riding her hard as your wrestled against her fupa, \"I'm just gonna eat and eat and eat all day and get so fucking fat for you, baby~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Sofia wanted to do was get fatter. For you, for her, and just in general. She was a woman of simple, yet incredibly complex pleasures and eventually came around to the idea of having someone almost exactly like her mother to boss around. In fact, she took to it almost too well. Sofia became more and more demanding of Gloria and to you, her appetite increasing her weight and ability to do absolutely nothing all day. Her disability meant that she didn't have a job, and as far as she was concerned, her position in the house was horizontal and full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether horizontal meant sex or just generally laying around the house, you were correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, it's about time you got home.\" she'd say most of the time, \"Did you bring me dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria was helping Sofia's size swell and swell like never before, providing (almost) mother-in-law quality stuffing three days out of the week without any of the bunk about you being a cheater and a monster. Sofia was becoming increasingly contented with the idea of being waited on hand and foot, and you were getting literally the best sex of your life out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour days blurred into a fog of food, sex, and fat very quickly. Days became weeks, and then months as you lost yourself in the new routine that was your new life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until...</span></div></div>",

Standing and stretching, you extended a hand to Gloria.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's time we were off.  Thanks for the snacks.  From both of us, right honey?\"  As Sofia remained silent, you gave a pained look.  Softening a but, she muttered out a \"Thanks\", pouting as she did so. You shook Gloria's hand, nearly offered you hand to Inez before catching Sofia's murderous expression and meekly waving, and grabbed Sofia's waiting arms.  You swore she put less effort in than usual as you lifted her.  and it was never much to begin with.  Your back would be sore tonight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia was unusuallly silent as she squeezed her bulk through the doors, not even giving her usual moans of arousal at the reminders of her size.  You knew what it was.  But in case you didn't, it was spelled out for yoou by Sofia herself.  Collapsing on the still broken couch, red-faced and panting, she pointed a fat finger at you even as she took your offered pastries.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!  Are not!  To go over there!  EVER!\"  She spat at you, somehow managing to give off an intimidating aura despite her soft features and the fact that she could physically do very little to enforce her words.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what gives?  She was just a kid having a joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  I'm the one who got you, and it's staying that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you think I was trying to flirt with that kid?

It was a tense rest of the day.  You heard the sounds of struggling as she took in her own orders for possibly the fist time in her adult life.  And, for the first night since you moved in, you did not have sex with your masive lover.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up the next morning to her snores, you started thinking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over a restless night, you had mulled the situation over.  Was Sofia being jealous, and a little unreasonable?  Possibly, and your shared history didn't exactly stand you in good stead as far as trusting you to be faithful went.  .  But you wanted her to be happy, and really, it wasn't as though you wanted to sleep with Inez, right?  She was a few kilos short of your kind of woman.   Speaking of, Sofia began to stir.  Quickly grabbing a box of donuts from the bedside table, you had them waiting for her when she awoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...Morning...\"  Sofia slurred, sounding barely concious, something that changed when you offered her a treat.  Her eyes looked at you suspiciously as she took it, but it wasn't like she was capable of turning down any sort of goodie.  Watching her struggle to sit up, all the while reaching for more food reminded you why you two had eloped together.  Your dick twitched at he sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, baby.  About yesterday.  You're right, I won't be visiting them.  Not when I've got all of <i>this</i>,\"  you grabbed her thigh under the covers, pressing your cock into her hip.  \"right here with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suspicious look relaxed, and an expression that was a lot more lover-like replaced it.  She looked at you with tender, remorseful eyes.  \"I'm sorry as well, stud.  I....I shouldn't be flipping out at you like that.  Not when you're doing so much for me.  With me.\"  She put her massive arm around you, with some grunting of effort, pulling you closer.  \"I know what you like, anyway, and it's not skinny little bitches like her, is it?  You want a big, fat, queen, like me.\"  She slapped her massive gut, wobbling her fat against you in her closest approximation of a sexy dance.  But it did wonders for you.  Your sleepy morning wood stood at full mast at the rippling of her soft fat against it.  \"Come on, you.  We missed something last night, and I expect you to make up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd did you ever.  You ran to the fridge, pulling out everything you could get your hands on, all for the pampered queen laid on your bed.  Your obese, spoiled, lazy queen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm, that's it!  Feed me more and tell me how fat I am!\"  She moaned, just before you shoved a slice of cake into her mouth.  She barely had time to chew it before something else was coming her way.  \"I'm so much bigger than her, aren't I?  She's barely even fucking <i>chubby</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whipped cream covered sausage stopped her dirty talk, one she sucked like a champ.  You had given her lots of practice, after all.  As she slapped you ass weakly, you took that as the signal to squirt more into her mouth.  Who knew dairy products made such good lube?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat morning would have gone on for hours, had you not run out of sweet treats.  At least it gave you a chance to regain your stamina.  Although, as you followed her through to her spot on the couch where she would spend the rest of the day, you very nearly stuck it in her bare, wobbling ass there and then.  Only the knowledge that you would almost surely make her lose her poor balace stopped you, instead limiting yourself to some heavy groping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly ten in the morning, and only one takeaway in, when there came a knock at the door.  The two of you frowned at each other in confusion.  You hadn't yet ordered Sofia's next one, although yyou would be soon, if her current rate of consumption was anything to go by.  Curiously, you opened the door.</span></div></div>",

Stood in the door way was the shut in girl who had caused you all that grief yesterday.  Clearly, Sofia felt the same way, from the daggers she was glaring at the her, as if daring her to make a move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless you were polite in greeting her, inviting her to tstep in, but stopping short of offering her a seat or refreshments.  She clearly sensed the lingering resentment, seeing how she wilted under Sofia's gaze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I brought a cake!\"  Awkwardly extending her arms past her barely contained gut, she placed quite a large box on the kitchen counter.  Though you tried not to, you couldn't help but look at the way her shirt and jeans combo were on their last legs containing their hefy owner.  She probably didn't have much call to buy new.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Sofia's response was cold and short.  The only reason she gave one at all was the aroma of the cake wafting through and softening her mood.  She sat with her arms droseed across her meaty breasts, pushing them up towards her face.  You knew that pose.  She was showing off her impressive rack, while at the same time pulling her top up to expose more of the overfed body beneath.  She wanted to show the young pretender that she was queen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's up, Inez?\"  You tired to diffuse the tension.  After all, there was no reason to be ruse to the girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might have caused......maybe some friction between you guys yesterday.  I wanted to clear something up.\"  She breathed deeply.  \"I.....have a boyfriend.  Ma doesn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Sofia looked at each other, and you could see her mistrust begin to fade.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez continued.  \"I've seen him a couple of times now, but, we, uh, haven't really....gone very far.\"  She looked embarrassed, and you couldn't blame her.  She was talking about her sex life to a pair of total strangers.  \"So, when I saw you guys, I thought, maybe you could tell me what it was like?  To do it when you're bigger?  How to know if he's......<i>into it</i>.  You feel me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know how to answer.  How did you tell?  You had never really stopped to think about if you gave off hints of it before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia however, was more than happy to talk about it.  You could see her opening up, now that she knew Inez posed no threat to her lifestyle.  \"Oh, hun, is that all?  You want to know if your boy likes some meat on his girls.\"  She laughed, slapping her gut and wobbling it.  Your eyes were immediately drawn to it, like hypnotism.  All of her flab rippling, slapping against itself.  You repressed the desire to sink your hands into it there and then.  Looking up, you saw a grin across her face.  \"First off, if you see him look at you belly in the way this horny devil just looked at mine, you know he's going to be into it.  And if you're making out, he grabs you on the gut, or a roll, he did it on purpose, no matter whether he claims it's the light or not.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really that obvious?\"  You ask, puting a little.  You thought you were a little more subtle than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, big time.  You really know how to make a girl feel like a whale.\"  She chuckled.  \"Good thing I like it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez was standing in rapt attention to Sofia's words.  If she had a notepad you imagine she would be scribbling furiously.  \"Really?  It's that easy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's that easy.  What you need to look out for, is how big he likes them.  Otherwise, you'll end up like me.  I wouldn't give up being this fat and sexy for anything, but it's not something you want to just jump into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez was nodding vigourously.  \"I get it, I get it.\"  She fingered her own flabby belly.  You could tell what she was thinking, you had seen it before.  <i>Do I want to get fatter?</i>  A question you never wanted answered in the negative.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJus then, you heard Gloria's voice from across the hall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inez!  Where are you?  We're going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, gotta go.  Ma's dragging me to some shitty job fair.\"  She started towards the door, and looked over her shoulder.  \"Can I, I dunno, come over here sometimes?  To chat?  About guys and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, hun.  anytime.\"  Sofia was definitely warming up to Inez.  Waving your goodbyes, you closed the door.  Faintly, you could hear Inez whining at her mother, begging to go bak to her videogames.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe I was wrong about her.\"  Sofia mused, grabbing her last portion of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just like her because she brought you a cake.  As though you need to get any fatter.\"  You teased, opening the box<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I definiely do.  Look at me, I'm wating away!\"  She rubbed her vast apron in mock distress.  \"Look at me, stud, I'm so thin!  I need that cake, or I'll starve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With extra cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inez and Sofia were very similar women\u2014both ruled by equal parts libido and appetite, and neither modest in either respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou supposed, vaguely, that this sort of explained the initial friction between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after Inez brought over cake, it was all over. Sofia's appetite was so all-consuming and her ego just as large that the modest offering of something sweet had left her with a good taste in her mouth as far as Inez was concerned. From then on, Sofia had only the nicest things to say about your neighbor, and frequently invited her over while you were away at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she was younger than either of you. But at the same time, Sofia didn't really <i>talk</i> to a lot of people now that she'd more or less given up on having a regular job. She and Inez had enough in common that there was almost never a lull in their conversations, at least not one that wasn't caused by snacking, and the two of them together was... quite a sight, if you were being honest with yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez was a large woman, now distinctly larger than you remembered Mia being. Mostly belly-built, she was a barely-legal heifer who was just as lazy and spoiled as the woman whom you so often came home to find her sitting next to. More naive and sheltered than your big fat mistress, she was clearly ill-adjusted to actual socialization outside of her computer screens, and often found herself falling into the pattern set by Sofia. In the time that they'd spent hanging out, Inez had visibly put on some weight, somehow managing to put away even more calories now that she had a binging buddy in the form of your former sister-in-law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia was this absolute behemoth of a woman\u2014a dollop of caramel-brown dough, crammed into increasingly ill-fitting clothes. Her face set deep into a puddle of chins and cheeks, Sofia looked less like a woman and more like a blob with every passing day. Her stomach spread her legs wide as her ass and thigh fat pooled around her, effectively pinning her to the sofa until you (or, on rare occasions, Inez) would help her up. Her fat arms resting uselessly on the armrest or her fluffy belly fat, Sofia was about as self-reliant as a housecat with a quarter of the motivation. All she wanted to do was eat and fuck, eat and fuck. Not that you were opposed to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, it was a little strange that Sofia went from hating Inez to absolutely loving her in the span of one cake-fueled appetizer. But you'd done little to discourage the idea of having a friend for her to talk to. You had to start going to work more regularly now, having run out of vacation and sick days, and your girlfriend having someone to pass the time with (while still pounding back food like nobody's business) was the ideal solution to her being lonely without you there to keep her company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stud\u2014\" Sofia said with a swat of your right ass cheek, \"\u2014would you mind making a bakery run for me and Inez?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>and</i> Inez?\" you quipped, \"Is there a bakery big enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia chuckled thickly, wantingly, as she jiggled her belly by the handful. Inez had gotten used to these displays of affection between you, having become... <i>enamored</i> with the idea that you two were so open about your preferences. It was clearly something that she wasn't used to, despite her relationship with her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she wanted it for herself?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It came out of the blue one ordinary Wednesday afternoon.  It had been hours of feasting for the two girls, and a binge of trashy reality television.  But you were never interested in whatever garbage Sofia chose, not whaen she had those huge, rippling, double rolls on display, and she was busy making sure they were getting even bigger.  You had been perched on the armrest of the sofa, still broken, after you balked at the cost of a properly reinforced one.  Keeping Sofia going with some gentle squeezing of her love handles, and occaisionally a not-so-gentle squeeze of her massive tits, barely constrained by the shirt you had squeezed her into.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this day, however, you had found your eyes increasingly drawn to the younger, smaller girl.  Or rather, every time you looked, she had been looking at you.  Sometimes, when you made eye contact, she would take an extra big bitte of whateer she was currently hold, and rub her own generous paunch through her black top.  Sofia was oblivious to it, but you were sure that her new friendship would be in ruins of she noticed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, when Inez was (mostly) full, and Sofia was set up with her light snack of an entire cake, you walked Inez across the hall.  And, when you were outside the door, you blocked it, and spoke in a low voice to the short girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inez, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked in mock innocence.  \"Doing?  What do you mean, Mr Neighbour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb.  You've been doing exactly what Sofia does.  All that....that....touching yourself!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez sighed, stepping closer.  \"Come on, Mr Neighbour. Isn't it obvious?\"  She grabbed you hand and forced it onto her taut belly.  \"I'm seducing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're-...But....Your boyfriend?\"  Your mind reeled, comflicting emotions running through it.  Pride, shock, lust, disgust.  You didn't know what was more prevalent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him?  Dumped about a day after I told you about him.  Started telling me I needed to <i>diet</i>, that I was <i>obese</i>.  'Too fat to fuck', were his words.  Hah!  If I'm too fat, then what about her?\"  She jerked a thumb at your door.  \"I needed someone like you, who can appreciate a bigger girl.  And, you're exactly my type, handsome.\"  She took another step towards you, pressing herself into your body.  \"What do you say you step in?  Ma's out, we can do all those things Sofia's gotten too heavy to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those feelings in your head, and which one comes to the surface?</span></div></div>",

The fact that you'd decided to lug her out of bed had been enough to make it downright labored. She was in such poor shape, so ill-equipped to move herself, that she had gotten out of breath by the very idea of moving herself from the bedroom had left her winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren't one to do anything with half-measures. You were all-in on the idea that Sofia would live up to your dreams of having this immobile princess to dote upon, and you were happy to watch her struggle to waddle towards the special scale that you had ordered. All you wanted was for her to break the fucking thing, but for so long it had seemed to be such a far-off goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cracking of the plastic casing sent your member twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...\" her puddle face rippled when she spoke, \"I think I'm too fucking fat for this thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat couldn't have been right. You'd ordered this thing on a farming website. Meant for cattle, sent to the slaughterhouse. No way that your mistress weighed more than the average livestock. The idea was tempting, for sure, but you had your doubts. Plenty of products had let you down before. Why should you believe one scale?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind the fact that Sofia was effectively bedbound. Having Inez around had only increased her gluttony\u2014if such a thing were possible. Another, smaller woman with just as much appetite meant that she'd found an unparalleled binging buddy. The weight that she'd gained from having her pudgy protegy around couldn't have possibly meant that she'd outgrown the scale that you'd bought specifically for her enormous weight... could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, baby...\" she panted hotly, \"I'm... I'm too fucking fat for this thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Sofia up on her feet was a rare sight in and of itself. She had become so increasingly spherical that the very notion of her standing on her own two feet had become ridiculous. Even now she was out of breath. Not from standing, not from walking, but from the exertion of being raised to her own two feet. Her hammy triple-tiered stomach raised up and down, up and down as she panted herself back into a semblance of stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that?\" she asked, \"It says<i> ERROR</i>.\" she wheezed, \"That means... that means that I'm too fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her stomach eagerly, ecstatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck fuck <i>fuck</i> I'm too fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed herself against you, pinning you against the wall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, baby...\" Sofia panted in her best porn-star voice, \"I'm literally the fattest fucking thing on Earth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she wanted, these days especially, was a good feed and fucking. It was what sustained her. Word had gotten around the apartment complex about your fuckable waterbed, and she couldn't have been happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the exception of just one thing...</span></div></div>",

Not that you could particularly blame her. She'd been treating you like crap ever since Mia let it slip that you had been cheating on her, but her stance had softened slightly once she figured out just <i>who</i> it was with. Sofia was still her daughter, so she was still inclined by her motherly instinct to cut you some slack... if only for Sofia's sake. Thus her helping you move your double-wide girlfriend out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, the glare that she gave you when you opened the door was hard enough to make your blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama?\" Sofia asked from the couch, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to see you.\" she said, looking past you and into the apartment, \"See how you're holding up with... <i>this one</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the apartment fully with a big-girl step, pushing you aside with her broad belly. The place felt small enough with Sofia and you alone, but adding in an extra 200 kilos or so of woman meant that the apartment felt that much more cramped. Where her daughter was mostly belly, Gabriella's wide hips felt that much more confined in your average-sized flat. You couldn't even offer her a place to sit down\u2014at least, not one that could hold her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, come in.\" Sofia said to her mama as she fought against the same instinctive fear that you felt in Gabriella's presence after separation, \"C-Can we get you something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have something to eat?\" she laughed, \"I'm shocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia squirmed uncomfortably in her seat on the couch. She suddenly looked very small, almost child-like in the face of her angry mother. While it was clear that Gabriella had come here to check in, the fact that she could cut down even Sofia like that didn't bode well for you. And so casually! Sofia had always had the heart (and appetite) of a lion\u2014you just hoped that Gabriella was here to make peace, not war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, things could get ugly...</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry...\" she apologized with a sigh, \"I came here to check in on you... not make you feel any worse than you probably already do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be clear, Gabriella absolutely only extended that sentiment to Sofia. She didn't give much of a shit as to how you felt. Her dealing with her daughter's divorce could have only been complicated by the fact that her <i>other</i> daughter was the woman who had brought it on. In a lot of ways, you felt for the poor woman. This couldn't have been easy for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, stupid?\" Gabriella snapped at you, \"Get me something to drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were in no position to not oblige. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short time that the two of you had made a break for it and run away to start your new life, Gabriella seemed to have adjusted well enough to having Mia around full-time. It couldn't have been too terribly different than having Sofia around, you mused, but you were still impressed with her resilience. The fact that she could take all of this in such a stride and still visit her daughter (even if it <i>was</i> while insulting you pretty much non-stop) showed true character. Reconciling all of this must have been very difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is he keeping you well-fed?\" Gabriella asked, \"You're not starving in this little apartment, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mama, I'm <i>very</i> well taken care of.\" Sofia's tone was the least commanding that you had ever heard it be, \"He does everything for me and I'm so, so happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... that makes one of us.\" she snatched the glass out of your hand, \"And out of three, those are pretty shitty odds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella was a large woman. If she wanted to get physical, there wasn't much you could do about it. The fact that Sofia could barely move, let alone throw a punch, did little to ease the tenseness that you felt in your jaw. Like it was waiting to get a set of knuckles knocked across it. Gabriella was a frightening, frightening woman, and every minute that you could keep her happy was a minute well spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fact was, you really didn't think that she came here to start anything. She was worried about her daughters. As in, plural. Mia may have just lost a husband, but Sofia was living away from home for (apparently) the first time. Family was so important to Gabriella, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, think about that for too long, and you'd realize that you were the direct reason for both of her biggest concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat never ended well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said...\" Gabriella took a shot of whiskey, \"Sofia, you are still my daughter. And <i>you</i>... well, you're probably going to be my son-in-law again if you keep this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a second shot of whiskey, right off the bat. It was clear that this was difficult for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at the end of the day, you both are still family.\" she finally sighed, \"And I will do what I can to make sure that you are taken care of. I know that Sofia can be a handful, but that's your own fucking fault. If you need money, you should ask me very nicely. I do not like you. And I'm honestly not too crazy about her right now. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, sharp aroma of alcohol on her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do my best to take care of you.\" she said, \"Just like I always have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mama.\" Sofia said with a sad, but appreciative smile, \"I know that was hard for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right it was.\" Gabriella sniffed, \"I have never prayed so hard in my life over anything, Sofia. What were you thinking, running off with your sister's husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wasn't.\" Sofia smiled softly, \"It's love, Mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, love.\" she sniffed, taking a <i>third</i> shot, \"You're all just babies anyway. And <i>you</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you, sausage finger sharp and intimidating<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had left my Mia for anyone other than my Sofia, I would have strung you up by your little toes.\" she said with frightening, raised eyebrows, \"Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes ma'am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella sighed and leaned against the wall. Your sense of danger had not yet evaporated, but at the same time things were getting quiet. You felt the need to break the tension...</span></div></div>",

Since you broke my youngest's heart, or since you dragged her sister all the way out to the sticks and left us both in pieces?\" She gave a harsh laugh, one that made you flinch.  \"Oh we've been fine! Just peachy, really. Mia's been sobbing over an ice cream tub every evening, and I'm still cleaning your clothes, Sofia. Couldn't be better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room hung silent after her little rant, neither you nor Sofia sure of what to say. Knowing you had to say <i>something</i>, however, you soldiered on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mia's not causing you trouble, then?\" As soon as the words left you mouth you regretted them, as Gabriella looked as though she were about to go back on her promise not to start trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia probably felt it as well, forcing her to speak up. \"Mama, please. He's trying to be polite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he'd better be.\" Gabriella said with a growl, holding her glower for another few seconds before sighing and slumping her shoulders.  \"You're right, yes. I do understand that this is probably a little difficult on your part as well.\" She tapped her empty glass, which you refilled, deciding against warning her about drink driving. \"Mia's no trouble. She's on her own now, actually. You did a better job keeping her independent than I did with Sofia.\" Sofia herself started to protest at that, stopped by a withering look from her mother. \"Please, Sofia. It was a nightmare getting you to look after yourself since well before he entered the picture.\" She jerked her thumb at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to process that.  You realised Mia had always been pretty damn stalwart about not wanting to rely on you, even as her weight escalated.  \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.good to hear.\u201d  You couldn\u2019t find anything else to say.  How could you?  You couldn\u2019t ask Gabriella any of the burning questions about her younger daughter that were on your mind.  You could only imagine her reaction if you asked if Mia was seriously trying to gain, or said how much you missed her.  Instead, you took a different line.  \u201cDo you need anything, Gabriella?  I know we\u2019ve\u2026....I\u2019ve fucked things up royally in your life as well as Mia\u2019s.  So if there\u2019s anything you need me to do, anything to help you out.  The offer\u2019s there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what Gabriella was thinking as she looked at you.   <i>I want my daughters back, and you out of their lives</i>.  But she didn\u2019t say that.  Probably more for Sofia\u2019s benefit than yours.  Instead, she told you something that twisted the knife just a little bit harder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust promise me you\u2019ll do better by Sofia than you did Mia.  Because you made sure I can\u2019t look after her myself anymore.\u201d  Finishing her drink, she grimaced as the taste hit her.  \u201cI should be off.\u201d  Bending down, she embraced her barely mobile daughter, sinking into her pillowy body.  \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll come home sometime?  I miss you.  I\u2019ll even let you bring that asshole with you, if you keep him behaved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSofia nodded, tearing up a little.  \u201cI will, Mama.  And, I\u2019m sorry.  I love you.  Mia too.  Tell her from me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, sweetheart.\u201d  Straightening up, she walked towards the door, allowing you to open it for you.  As you did she stretched her arm out to you.  It looked as though she was willing to try and make nice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she grabbed the back of your neck and dragged your head down to her level, faces an inch apart.  The strength in her arm was significant for a woman of her age and stature.  You couldn\u2019t have broken free if you had tried.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me, and listen well.  If you ever, and I mean <i>ever</i>, hurt Sofia in any way, you\u2019ll be very sorry indeed.  If you lie to her, betray her, hell, if I hear she missed her dinner, I shall be back, and by the time I\u2019m done with you, you will not be in a state to do the same to any other woman unfortunate enough to catch your eye.  <i>Comprende</i>?\u201d  You could only nod.  Satisfied you understood, she waved cheerily to the shocked Sofia before leaving.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But upon opening the door, she went completely silent.  The quiet gave you a good long look at her.  You could only describe this woman as 'powerful'.  About as tall as you, the slinky top and tight leggings she wore showed toned muscle, going well with her sharp, fierce facial features.  Another thing the top showed off was a seriously hhefty set of tits.  Nowhere near Sofia's, hers having been big even with her quest to become a living pile of blubber, but big enough for her frame that you couldn't help but stare for a moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLukily, this woman seemed oblivious to that, staring slack jawed at Sofia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>*huff* </i> Hi!  We're....phew....your new neighbours!\"  Sofia took over the introduction, the grin on her face telling of her satisfaction at the attention.  The woman continued to stare as Sofia breathlessly waited for a response.  She shifted on her feet, flab wobbling with just that slight motion.  \"Um, d'you mind if we come in?  My feet.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  My.  God.\"  The woman finally broke her silence, eyes still glued to the jiggling mass before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?  Is there something wrong?\"  You asked her innocently.  Your question seemed to finally alert her to your presence, as she turned her stare to you.  She looked between you a couple of times, before finally making eye contact with Sofia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New neighbours?  You mean <i>this</i> is who's been moaning all night this past week?  This fucking fatass?\"  She gave Sofia another look over.  \"How does that even work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia squirmed at the comments.  You might mistake it for embarrassment if you didn't know her.  You decided to let her trade words with your neighbour.  You knew Sofia could be a bitch in her own right, so you figured you would be in for a show.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like somene's jealous, lightweight.\"  Sofia massaged her gut smugly.  \"Noticed we haven't heard anything from over here since we moved in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get so high and mighty because you trapped some helpless sap under your fat fucking ass for a few nights.  There's no way any normal person would screw a woman too fat to reach her own crotch willingly.  What did you trick him with?  Blackmail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for tricks when you look this good, honey.\"  Sofia was building up a sweat now, both from the excitement of the barbs and the exertion of standing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't go unnoticed by the woman in the doorway.  \"Are you sweating?  From standing around and talking?  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  That's too good!  You should be embarrasssed of yourself, you fucking lardass!  Can you do anything other than eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia let out a low moan, just loud enough for you to hear.  Y-Yeah....I can....*haah*.....out fuck you, twiggy.  Bet you spend all that time in the gym waiting for a guy to look twice at you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I get guys, you stupid whale.  See, I can actually move around to meet them.  I didn't have to f<i>orce</i> a man to sleep with me.\"  She turned her attention to you.  \"You're a decent looking guy.  What's she got on you that keeps you around?  You don't really want to be with this obese bitch, do you?\"</span></div></div>",

ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBabe?\u201d you call again before a reply is forthcoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sh...huff...shut up\u201d came the voice from upstairs, more specifically, your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you the charmer\u201d you mock as you bound up the stairs with ease, grunting and panting becoming louder as you close distance between you and your wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m nearly...done...\u201d came the laboured reply as you manoeuvre the top of the stairs, positioning yourself in the doorway to the bedroom where you come face to face with your wife\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStood before you clearly fumbling with her black jeans, Ashley continued to pant heavily whilst quietly cussing under her breath before finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell about time, let\u2019s...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cButton?\u201d you ask with a smug grin spreading, rather confident in your prediction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cButton\u201d Ashley relented as she slowly turned to face you, a thick roll of belly bulging out of her jeans making it clear why the garment had given up on her, not to mention the jiggling love handles that had been on display upon your arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had always been a big girl since the day you had met but ever since spending most of your wedding night double fisting cake between her lips to the point you\u2019d had to peel her black dress from her engorged frame, her weight had begun to climb at an exponential rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at 5\u20197, her signature boobs were straining her T-shirt tightly to the point her lacy cups were visibly biting into the top of her full breasts, whilst said T-shirt rode noticeably above her waistband so much so that had her jeans stayed closed a pale slither of pudge would still be exposed to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst the jeans had succumbed to the girth of her stomach, Ashley possessed a set of thick thighs that had worn the insides of the denim legs thin and grey from the constant chafing whilst a wide peachy rump and hips stretched the material even tighter.<br>\r\nThe poor strained waistband was further punished by the thick love handles that were squeezing free of their denim prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopping off the look though was, as you referred to it, Ashley\u2019s \u2018wife belly\u2019 that was segmented into two thick rolls roughly where her waist once was.<br>\r\nEven as she futilely attempted to pull the two flaps of denim together around her full figured middle, a great bulge of fat squeezed out between them indicating the useless nature of her exertions.<br>\r\nAside from clearly being too big for the jeans, an angry red mark hugged the circumference of her soft belly where the denim had briefly squeezed Ashley tight before the brass button had hurtled free of her fattened waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watched over the scene as sweat began to bead on Ashley\u2019s forehead, you couldn\u2019t help but reflect on the last time your wife had begrudgingly stepped on the scales to reveal a hefty 287lbs with a sly realisation that the now buttonless jeans had fit snuggly just moments after that display.<br>\r\nNot so much now of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to break it to you babe but that won\u2019t work now\u201d you muse, still watching Ashley struggle on with her dark hair cascading over her face as she continued to tug on the denim that squeezed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know but...if they get close...enough...\u201d grunted Ashley awkwardly \u201cmy belt can...hold them closed...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, about that\u201d you reply, deftly grabbing up said belt before spinning your wife around playfully until she was facing the full length mirror with you stood behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, I\u2019m trying to...ooph that\u2019s cold, what is that?!\u201d complained Ashley as a coldness radiated against her exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat dear is your belt\u201d you declare with a smile as you press the large silver buckle against your wife\u2019s soft middle where it and the leather strap end framed her belly button with a clear gap even wider than the one between her jean flaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez...\u201d groaned Ashley as she let go of her jeans in defeat, slumping slightly in your arms as she eyed just how pathetically small the fashion belt looked around her pale girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think you look beautiful still\u201d you compliment, planting a warm kiss on your wife\u2019s chubby cheek between the strands of dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would say that\u201d growled Ashley taking aim at your less than subtle preferences towards fatness and her own unbridled appetite which had become so prominent in your relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom lavish wining and dining where Ashley dressed as glamorously as her gothic exterior allowed to weekends of takeaway binges whilst gaming it was a wonder she wasn\u2019t bigger, not that that wasn\u2019t for a lack of fantasising.<br>\r\nOf course Ashley\u2019s insatiable appetite had eventually snuck into the bedroom too which, combined with her inherent laziness and \u2018goddess of darkness\u2019 act, had only served to increase her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, whilst reluctant to actively gain, Ashley was greedy to a fault and twice as lazy as that so the pounds literally took care of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can diet whenever you want sweetie\u201d you tease, placing your hands on Ashley\u2019s plump middle \u201cstep one, no more pizza\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed in defeat again.<br>\r\nFor her the nerd adverse to exercise was more than just a cliche and the rate at which she ordered food of a less than healthy nature was uncanny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, may I suggest the pleated skirt instead?\u201d you offer, whipping the pointless jeans down as far as you could whilst you stepped away to grab said skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh fine\u201d relented Ashley as she kicked off her jeans \u201cget my fishnets too\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t I lucky\u201d you tease as you toss the requested clothes over to your wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u201d grumbled Ashley as she awkwardly bent over, hooking her black painted toe nails into the nets before pulling them up over her thighs and eventually her plump ass.<br>\r\n\u2018That just keeps getting better\u2019\u2019 you thought as you recall Ashley\u2019s increasingly larger fishnets over the years, this particular pair probably not far from retirement as squishy diamonds of thigh fat bulged through the netting from hip to knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright perv, let\u2019s go\u201d snarked Ashley with a wry smile having now donned her pleated skirt with the extra stretchy waist that accommodated as much belly as she could fit in there \u201cyou better have a good breakfast planned for this one\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you bet\u201d you respond with a smile allowing your wife to pass you before you paddle her bulging rear firmly, an action that earned you a withering if not slightly aroused stare.</span></div></div>",

Her massively overfed form was somehow both softened and firmed up by her many layers of lard. Her soft skin felt slightly moist under your touch, likely because this was literally the most physically demanding task she ever did anymore, and she had simply been growing fatter and fatter since your wedding day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she had tried to stay in shape, it's very likely that she'd still be struggling, however. Sometimes you could only stare in silence as you drank in just how truly vast your wife had become. You slid your right hand under her upper belly roll, remembering back to when you could grip it in one hand. That ship had sailed a long time ago, and you gasped as you tried to lift the blubber engorged flesh, feeling the sheer weight of a mere fraction of her overfed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had first met Ashley shortly after 4th edition had dropped. You'd been interested in trying out the new game, but your circle of friends refused to change with the times, eventually moving over to Pathfinder. And so you'd joined up with an online D&amp;D group, and it was there that you first met Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been the DM for that first game, and you'd had the pleasure of playing a multitude of games with her since. Despite 4th not being the most roleplay friendly RPG, she really had a knack for making the world come alive and keeping everyone engaged with the story. That said, she was also <b>very</b> aggressive in combat, and it took a bit of in-universe meta-gaming and A LOT of minmaxing to beat the tougher challenges she'd laid before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the session, all the players had agreed she'd probably gamed the best session they'd ever had. Even \"LazzzerTurkey,\" Power Gamer and Minmaxer extraordinaire, a man with a particular skill for finding and utilizing every exploit a system had and who generally did not give a shit about roleplay or npc's beyond the experience gain, had charged through a battlefield to rescue a child despite there being no in-game reward for doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if getting a guy called \"LazzzerTurkey\" invested in a story isn't an accomplishment, I don't know what is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd played a few more sessions with \"CapriSun,\" as she was calling herself at the time, both as a player and as a DM. The group eventually broke up, however, though you still e-mailed now and again. It was shortly after the end of the group that you started playing Guild Wars 2, and as you were wandering through the starting town came across a character with the name \"CapriSun.\" Sure enough, it was Ashley, and the two of you started questing through the world together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, you were chatting even outside of the game, sometimes for hours at a stretch. You talked about everything under the sun - music, gaming, anime, sci-fi, fantasy. Eventually, you told each other your real names. Feeling a real connection, you tried to schedule a RL meet up. Ashley, however, had been really hesitant, and she was quite evasive as to why. You persisted, and she'd finally agreed to a coffee date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that happened, though, she sent you a photo of herself, saying that if you didn't like what you saw, you should back out now. You were shocked when you opened the file on your screen, as the woman within must of weighed a solid 400 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, you sent her a chunk of your porn folder, and told her that her physique was most definitely not a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you started dating almost immediately. Ashley had initially held back during your first couple of dinner dates, but once she knew you were okay with it, she happily stuffed herself like a turkey. As it turned out, she was quite the gluttonous woman, and there was little Ashley loved more then over-stuffing herself with the most decadent, calorific dishes she could lay her hands on. She'd been a chunky girl while growing up, but started to explode in college. She'd been trying to diet on and off for years by this point, but had never once succeeded in keeping the weight off, always ending each year heavier then when it started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two years of dating, the two of you moved in together, and Ashley's steady increase in fat began to pick up speed. Their cupboards were perpetually stocked with junk food and pop, and her mealtime portions continued to grow. Even at work, she was eating, being used as the office food disposal by the rest of her coworkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, Ashley's weight became too much for her employer to handle, and she was let go for insurance reasons. Though initially devastated, this event only encouraged her to eat more, not less. Ashley then had the idea to start a gaming channel, playing the latest MMO's for her audience, as well as selling her services as a DM for hire. And her business ideas worked, with her monthly takeaway being higher then your own at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now that she was at home all the time, fully sedentary, and eating more then ever, her weight only continued to grow by leaps and bounds. You hadn't even gone anywhere for your honeymoon. Instead, the two of you took two weeks off work, stayed at home, and kept Ashley perpetually, painfully stuffed full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd had sex, naturally. You know, when it wasn't too painful for her overfilled stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** *** ***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's consumption had never dropped back down in the aftermath, and she had simply blown up since. Where once stood your 400 pound girlfriend, now there was your 798 pound wife, wedged in your doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to stare at her, Ashley interrupted your private viewing. \"Would you stop staring and help me!? My knees are killing me!\"</span></div></div>",

Although, you suspect that, as little as it is in comparison, yours is doing the bulk of the work.  Slowly, Ashley begins to ooze out of the doorframe.  As she does, you can see the red mark on her belly where the offending frame has pinched her.  As she was gradually released, a slight ammount of creaking could be heard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final heave, she was free.  For a second, she seemed to lose her balance, and you were almost confronted with the reality of an almost eight hundred pound woman crushing you against the concrete.  You guessed it wouldn't be as pleasurable as in the bedroom.  Luckily for the both of you, she didn't fall, and instead took a tottering step towards the car.  Taking a moment to collect herself, she gave a loud huff before getting herself moving.  At a pace generously described as glacial, she inched closer to the vehicle.  As she lumbered forwards, you were treated to the sight of all of that fat rippling and shaking as she moved.  A rare sight to be sure.  Her round face, already flushed from her doorway aordeal, was growing beet red with the exertion of waddling.  Beads of sweat ran down her chins to soak her shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no wonder that when she got to the car, she simply leant back on it, gasping and panting for breath, more of her belly being exposed, smooth and pale as snow.  You had often joked that you should do a joint halloween costume, with you as a werewolf and her as the moon.  Such remarks were always met with a hlaf-hearted slap, as she failed to fully remove her attention from either her game, or her food.  Or both.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you did not have a repeat of the doorway incident loading her up.  When you bought your new wheels, she had scoffed at you, mokingly asking why you bought a big, dumb, American car.  But now at double her original weight, Nothing else would do.  And you would need every bit of horsepower the engine could manage on Scotland's hilly roads.  Although, taking note of how close her gut was to the dashboard, maybe it was time you thought about retiring it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting Ashley's seatbelt extender fitted, you set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow was the drive?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That is, how quickly a girl of Ashley's size got hungry.  And how much that slowed travel down.  You must have stopped at every fast food place along the way.  You probably did more walking than driving, carrying endless bags to your glutton of a wife.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, for her part, moved not an inch.  Aside from munching on fries and burgers, she gamed on her phone, thick fingers clumsily tapping at tiny on screen controls.  In the limited space not taken up by her immense thighs, a pile of wrappers was building, making you wonder why you bothered to clean the car in the first place.  But that was Ashley.  When you first saw her room, back when you started dating, it wasn't exactly clean.  And as she got fatter, she got lazier.  And even less tidy.  That was your fault for always picking up after her, probably.  But when she was laid back, pouting and rubbing her obese form in a food coma, how could you say no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrease and sauce were gradually coating her jowls and chins as she gorged through the hours of driving.  Droplets stained her already sweat-soaked t shirt.  Somewhere along the drive, she had unzipped her jeans, and you dreaded the task of fastening them up at the other end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings didn't even slow down when you travelled through the highlands.  In the absence of McDonald's or KFC, she turned her attention to the bags of treats in the boot with your cases.  You were nagged into pulling over on a country trail, all to get a bag bursting at the seams with chocolate for your wife who couldn't do it herself for love nor money.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, exhausted and half an hour later than your ETA, you pulled up at the surprisingly large house that was your destination.  Switching the engine off, you inspect Ashley's state of undress as she dabbed at her mouth with a paper towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ash?

And, when the thin shirt was thrown over the top, you could still see how her tits spilled over the cups.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you tackled her jeans.  Forcing her to swing her legs out of the car so you could reach around her belly,  you pushed and kneaded the flab anywhere you could in an effort to get the zipped closed.

Everyone's here, the table''s set, All we're missing is you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you help Ashley through the door, you heard Penny from the other room calling to your fellow players<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, our final guests are here, so lets get aquainted and get this show on the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the living room you saw your party consisted of.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were shocked to say the least.  Ashley was one thing, you had seen to her own weight increase personally.  But aside from Penny, you were the only person under four hundred pounds.  The group lounged in recliners and the sofa, looking up as Penny entered the room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, we're all here!  Let's just do a few quick self introductions, and we'll get started!  I'm Penny, A.K.A. Durga, and I'll be your Dugeon Master for this adventure.  As well as I'm sure the perfect host for those of you staying with me!\"  She smiiled at you and another player as she closed out.  \"Okay, next we'll have......Eeny meeny minee...Oh, Ted's going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up from a recliner was a mountain of a man, heavy, but in a way that you could tell there was some serious strength beneath the fat, and standing at well over two meters tall.  He puffed as he stood, huge mustache blowing.  \"I'm Ted, you know me as Grizzly Overlord, and, as she no doubt omitted on purpose, I'm Penny's husband.\"  He put his arm around her, making the already apparent size difference seem comical.  \"So no funny business, capisce?\"  Despite the warning, his broad grin reassured you all he was joking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, a belly-heavy girl waved from her spot sprawled out on the sofa.  Her bright blue hair framed chubby, fair cheeks, an undersized white t-shirt failing to cover her gut, black leggings working overtime over her gelatinous thighs.  \"Yo!  I'm Charlie.  Aqua's Pet Kraken.  Resident healslut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a bellowing laugh from behind you.  Turning around, you were met with a surprisingly slim guy with the rosy complexion of a long-time alcoholic.  \"Always a character, Kraken is.  What's up? I'm Greg.  You know me as Hair of the Dogmeat.  I'm just here while my bar's being refurbished.  Pleasure.\"  He shook both yours and Ash's hands, before strolling through to the next room.  The clinking of bottles told you he was getting a drink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was the turn of the girl in the corner.  And dear lord, she was nearly as big as your wife.  PLae as a ghost, hiding her body on an enormous black sweater and sweatpants, you hadn't noticed her until Penny pointed her out.  Nervously, she stammered out an intro.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi!  I-'m, erm, Wraith-Becca!  N-Nice to meet you!\"  By the end of that speech, she was red-faced, no doubt unused to speaking in person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, chipper as ever, paid it no mind, clapping her hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, great to meet you all in the flesh, hope you're all excited!  If you'll follow me, I've got something special set up for us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led you through to the adjacent, yourself and Ash following just behind Ted, where you saw what she meant.  In there was a rough carved long table, two benches along each side, with an ornate chair at the head, which Penny plopped herself down into.  She looked even more diminutive sat down, especially due to the thrione she was perched on.  Ted sat to her right, noting your impressed expression.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a caprenter by trade.  Made this little thing from work leftovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work, honestly.\"  You praised, taking a seat next to Ashley as the other players arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three people to a bench.  Who sits next to you?</span></div></div>",

Why did I even marry a disgusting pig like you? Oh that's right, you've let yourself go...ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dick already hardening at the derision, it gets harder as she slams the door and walks around the front of the car, your eyes glued to the taut denim of her cut off shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, she's right you're fat. 290 on a 6' frame, your old high school and college track, cross country and swimming athletic bod has gone softer than butter since you got married right out of college, a good seventy pounds of blubber settling on you while parked behind a data analyst desk all day. You've got three chins, you've got tits bigger than any of the girls you'd dated bar one and a gross, hairless beer belly spilling all over your lap, fuck with all the estrogen your dough boy body generates, you've even lost a couple inches on You Jr. Your lucky your shoulders and arms are beefy from the weight set down stairs and your legs are strong from long walks, otherwise you'd be a complete blob. Already your doctors are saying shit about your blood pressure, you helped move a new couch up the stairs last week and felt like you'd have a heart attack and you're only 34.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as your wife, turns profile, you think about the one girl who did have a rack that can rival yours now. Katie Hawkins. Blue eyed blonde, Katie Hawkins, 6 feet and 1 inches of the bests athlete the state ever produced Katie Hawkins. A+ grade point average and DD cup bra size, put herself through college stripping and modeling Katie Hawkins. Ambitious, smart as hell, could out drink, out fight and out think anyone in school, campus and the firm Katie Hawkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour domineering, man eating, boss Katie Hawkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hot as fuck wife Katie Hawkins who's got the best ass you've ever seen still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie Hawkins who is wearing the same daisy duke get up she wore in high school and is very much not the same size she was in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's ass is pretty much unchanged in perkiness, her yoga, jujitsu and squats have kept it perky but the weight she's put on lately has made that thing fucking grow. Half her tan cheeks are hanging out of it with a pretty soft bounce and the ultra high cut shorts, cut high enough the pockets hang out past the denim, is now showing off a pair of thick, soft legs that meet in the middle, her high heels not lending them any tone anymore. A six pack of soda a day and way too many sugary, creamy starbucks coffee breaks have turned her actual six pack into a squishy mom gut complete with thick muffin top, stretch marks and love handles all displayed by her crop top. Half of each one of her head sized tits are hanging out of that cut off white T, both from sheer size and because Katie's not so perky at 34 years old and 220 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at something fat boy?\" Katie grunts as she pulled herself into the driver's seat, sucking in her gut to get the seat belt done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just a sloppy fat chick who thinks she's got the same body she did in high school,\" you shrug, rolling your head with the slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never talk about my body again, man boobs,\" she hisses, then lunges forwards, kissing you hard, running a hand under your gut to get at the cock pressed tight against your shorts, \"Keep going you fucking stud, fuck I'm going to come in five minutes you keep pointing that out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were high school rivals, who threw in plenty of hate fucks in between racing for records and medals. That kept up in college where a knee injury gave you the start of your gut and drew Katie's real attention. The domineering psycho bitch turned out to be a feeder galore, introducing you to the fetish and thus losing you your scholarship, replaced by a gift from the rich girl for being her fattened play thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got married at her insistence right out of graduation, your ass still hurting at the tattoo saying you were her personal property. Your diet and exercise program were dictated by her. Your job was dictated by her. When you got to masturbate and when you got to fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll told it was a pretty good deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie might be a domineering, sadistic bitch who made you do monthly weigh ins and pictures but she takes care of her property. Her rise through corporate has been pretty fast and pretty extreme, from intern to data analyst to department head to chief financial officer. She's richer than her already rich parents now, a millionaire thanks to good investments and stock options. Your house is great, you've got the free money and time to do whatever you want thanks to Katie hiring a maid and you fuck every single day. Its hot and its passionate and Katie is fucking nuts in the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah you're fat, yeah you pant going up the stairs and aren't allowed to run or do a sit up but hey, not a big problem. Katie's pretty good at the whole feeder thing and while you're an obese lardass who's just been put on a blood pressure med, you're pretty healthy for a fat boy and she's kept your gain long and slow over the past decade, only breaking you up to 400lbs a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big change with her though is a lot faster and a lot more recent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's always been proud of her crazy hot body: long and lean, curvy and mean. Unlike you she's a health nut and an exercise junky: a life long vegetarian at every meal, she never touched soda or alcohol. In terms of exercise? Holy shit, girl ran a 10K every day, had a weight session, hot yoga classes three days a week and jujitsu on the weekends, she earned her black belt around the time you first got a beer gut. And she flaunted what she'd earned: short skirts and tight blouses at work, when off it she always dressed like a slutty college girl and most of those outfits were from her college days, to the point that she still goes and strips on some weekends despite making a 7 figure salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a year ago Katie decided she wanted to get pregnant and after several months of nothing but orgasms to show for it it turned out she needed fertility meds and you needed to loose weight. And you did, Katie put you on a pretty hard workout regimen and you dropped a full hundred pounds. But all the weight you lost, those fertility meds helped Katie find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer metabolism is wrecked and she's got stretch marks and cellulite all over her perfect ass. The weird hormones have made her already big boobs fucking gigantic, she can't find bras for them and they've even started sagging. She's got two extra chins now and they never stop wiggling, she was a vegetarian until she started the meds but she got such cravings for fried meat and candy that diet got dumped. You don't think she's eaten anything green besides the St. Patricks shakes at McDonald last month. At her last doctor's appointment she got told she was 220lbs and now she was the one needed to loose weight. When she got home from that was the first time Katie had you feed her and she's put on twenty pounds since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what a fat pig I'm turning into,\" she orders, tossing the bags of sugary, salty snacks into the back seat of her sports car and putting the convertible's top up, \"tell me how I'm loosing my looks, tell me I can't pull off this outfit anymore, tell me I'm a fat ugly slut losing the looks I got by on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie clambers into what's left of your lap, giving more than a few fat girl grunts and causing the exposed threads of her distressed cut offs to pop and strain. She stopped working out a couple months ago and is rapidly losing her muscle tone, wind and flexibility. She plans on going back after she finally gets pregnant and has the baby, not to loose weight but just to humiliate herself further, she'd already been having you spank her for being the fattest one in her classes before she quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blonde wife gets her knees on the floor board, barely enough room for her corpulent body, and pulls your shorts down. You're ready for her lips, you might not have the biggest shaft on the block anymore but that just helps get more in her mouth. For the next five minutes she works the shaft and cradles the balls, sucking like a vaccuum, forehead on your still pretty hefty beer belly. You get a few glances from people walking by but your focus is on the massive tits in your lap and her big, jiggling ass pressed against the dashboard. Right when you think your heart is gonna give out, you fire a fucking magnum load. She keeps your dick in her mouth as it softens, pulling her head back and looking you in the eye as she swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie didn't used to swallow. Hell she didn't use to ever suck you off. But ever since she started getting fatter, ever since she stopped being perfect, its like a switch flipped. Suddenly she's into segregation, suddenly she's into being spanked and punished, suddenly she's all about pleasing you. Part of the tight outfits now is to see the reactions people have at a genuine fat girl wearing such skimpy clothes. If she didn't like being rich so much she'd let her work slip, she's mentioned weird humiliation fantasies about winding up homeless and sucking cock for a dollar on the street, but thankfully doubling in size is good enough now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially with the doctor confirming she's at last knocked up, all that fucking finally paying off with twins under her beer gut. The only downside is she wants you to get in shape and step up as the bread winner so she can laze around as a stay at home mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, you fat pig it took you long enough,\" she grunts as she crawls back into the drive seat, \"grab me a soda and a bag of chips from the bags, we need to get going to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew Katie was kind of kinky when you first hooked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer perfect physique grinding into you, still very fit but with a slight beer belly from not being able to run due to your knee. You'd expected some sucking and grinding and humping, but she started stuffing you with donuts out of nowhere, cackling and taunting you for your starter stomach. From then on  you were hooked and were a full on fat boy by the end of quarter. You were the frat's fat guy by graduation and nearly busted your tux getting married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew Katie was well, more than just kinky when you both started at the same company in the same finance department. On starting you were the fattest one there by a hundred pounds and most of the young women in the department had a build similar to your fitness fanatic wife, if not quite as perfect. A year later and while you'd gained thirty pounds, your weight was now middle of the pack and falling. As seams stretched and buttons burst, the thin attractive 20 somethings ballooning into uncontrollable fatties before your eyes, you knew your wife was dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't until a decade later, when she started the fertility hormones you knew she was cuckoo for cocoa puffs crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I flash tit in the next board meeting? Or don't do the work and offer to suck the bosses' clit in front of everyone?\" the lunatic CFO asks you, blue eyes shining with self destructive insanity while she sucks down her third milkshake of the trip, \"Oh I know, how about embezzlement? That'll ruin us financially, especially if I start a crack habit and do hooking on the weekends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether this is a new permanent kink or a temporary switch due to the hormones is hard to tell. Honestly you think it'd be pretty funny if old, vain, self important Katie emerges from progesterone fog in a year and finds herself an immobile sow living in a trailer but fucking crazy as she is, Katie's been good to you. Yeah she made you fat, but you liked being a pampered, 390 lb pet who still got fucked two or three times a day by a playboy center fold level babe and the amount of money she'd brought in made every luxury available despite you still being stuck in an entry level position years later. Plus, well she was pregnant with your kid, so it was your job to limit her lunacy's impact which was why you'd banned her from drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no sex with other people and no theft and no getting fired. And absolutely no drugs or whoring,\" you order her, munching on some celery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to diet is fucking killing you, but Katie has said she wants you buff again and Katie gets what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, if I want to fuck myself up I will,\" she hisses, slapping your still substantial beer gut, \"what are you going to do to stop me, lardass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response you reach over and pinch the thick layer of fat that's grown over her thigh muscles. Katie squeals, eyes rolling back into her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get to make choices any more, you fucking psych patient,\" you tell her, keeping one eye on the gravel road, \"you're too damn loony to make choices because you're knocked up and pregnant. Remember that you aren't fucking badass hot chick Katie anymore, now you're just pregnant fatty dumbass Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's eyes roll back into her head and her nipples pop through the fabric of her shirt, \"Fuck yes, talk dirty to me like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God you're at the Lake House, because once she's started like this Katie cums. She parks the car and grabs your dick, squeezing tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk dirty to you bitch? Fuck no, you've gotta earn it. You've gotta feel how far you've already fallen,\" you growl at her, squeezing tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've fucked three times on this two hour drive. Turns out you like dominating Katie almost as much as you like getting dominated by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, tell me what to do,\" she moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance at the Lake House. Its isolated, nothing but water and evergreen trees for miles around its two story brick and log bulk. It has an immense deck all the way around the lower level, leading out to a dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta do eight laps of the deck at full sprint you tell her, that's about four  hundred meters\" eyes on the hard wood and on her thick, soft legs, \"if you lose, no more bras save for wearing bikinis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, only four? You forget who your dealing with fat boy?\" she laughs, \"I set the state record for four hundred meters in college and I improved on it more than a year ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh back, \"And you've gained a hundred pounds since then porky. Even better, you quit working out about three months ago. The only exercise you do anymore is fucking and getting snacks, now quit your bitching and run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, giving her orders is already making you hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you roll out of the car at about the same time. You're fatter but you're doing low impact exercises and Katie's starting to turn into a couch potato. She struts over to the porch in her gucci heels, shaking her ass and making you almost cum. It turns out you like fat girls too, surprise, but Katie would still mostly count as thick. She's just got a bit of a gut starting to form and her boobs, hips, butt and thighs soaked up a lot of it, being tall helps too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she bends down to touch her toes, her shorts cut into her stuffed belly and she gives a fat girl grunt on not quite reaching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No stretching bitch, off with the heels and start running,\" you tell her and she glares back at you, stepping out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe illusion of muscle tone on her thick legs vanishes with the heels. She starts running, jiggles shooting up and down her body. She disappears around the corner and you park your ass on a bench, hearing the thumps of her steps as she circles the house. A moment later she's back around, her breathing good even though her massive tatas have flopped out of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing fine fat boy, I can sprint this all day,\" Katie insists, although there's a bit of forced cheer in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lap two she's sweating when she taunts you, slapping her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lap three she's breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lap four, Katie is panting and starting to slow down, one arm pressing her tits to her chest to stop them from bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lap five, she's sort of jogging instead of sprinting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lap six she's going a little over walking speed, her inner thighs red and sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lap seven she's quit, collapsing panting on the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself from the chair, not quite waddling over to taunt her, \"Look at you! You couldn't even run a hundred yards. Your pathetic, your worthless, you're a fucking fat whore who's lost the only thing special about her. Fuck, if I sat on you, could you even get me off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plop yourself down on her upper thighs, she gasps as your gut brushes hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking Katie Hawkins, the bitch who grabbed life by the horns can't even run,\" you chuckle, \"good thing I like you sloppy because with out a bra, these tits you've been so proud of are gonna fucking sag as they grow. I'm betting they're at your belly by the time you're due...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie starts writhing beneath you, moaning and starting to come. You start to say more but her ankles are suddenly on your shoulders and she flips you flat on your back. The fat girl sort of springs up and starts pulling off her shorts, while you follow with your own clothes. You've never gotten over losing your jacked body but the thrill of seeing that Katie isn't that much smaller than you makes you as hard as shame did. In a heart beat your still mid sized dick is in her sopping pussy, your bellies pressing against each other as she rides you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, fucking piece of peaked in college loser,\" she moans, \"I got you your job and kept you there even though you spend all day eating and looking at my perfect ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your perfect ass has cellulite,\" you moan back, \"and you're starting to fuck up figures because you're getting baby brain. I've been covering for you since the hormones made you nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you've lost weight, your man boobs look fucking droopy,\" she insults, playing with her own tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't pass for a high school senior anymore,\" you dig at her, \"you can get all the lip fillers you want, but those tits are sagging and you're getting some spider veins on your thighs. You might be able to pass as a college senior, you fat psycho slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, fuck fuck fuck fuck!\" she screams, coming hard on top of you, still pretty strong thighs pressing tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come hard into her too, a tidal wave of hot jizz straight into her, despite the three blow jobs she'd given you on the road. You're gonna be sore tomorrow but fuck is this hot. Katie collapses onto you, your tits and guts smacking together with a wet thud. For a while you lay there, naked and fat and visible if any boats came by but thankfully no one does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, I love going down,\" she moans, rolling off your shrinking dick, \"Go get the bags inside, I need to lose more muscle tone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the naked pscyho, slide your fat ass into your shorts and start unloading the car. As you carry suitcase after suitcase in, you think about the point of the trip. Katie's taken a health leave of absence for the rest of her pregnancy and you're telecommuting. The whole point is to let Katie live out her low class, fat slut fantasy in relative comfort and safety while you get stronger and fitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Greasy Spoon</b> She's trading her executive job for cooking greasy burgers and fries at a local buffet...where part of the pay is free meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stripper</b> Katie spends each Friday evening swinging on a pole...or did until she got too fat for the ritzy burlesque she'd danced in. Now she's gonna start at a local strip club until she's too fat for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stay at Home Mom</b> No more working outside the home for Katie, shes a domesticated woman now, focused just on cooking and cleaning. Narrator and Wife both gain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the saying goes, if you got it, flaunt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie had it and so she flaunted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong, shapely legs just shy of muscular. A trim, tapered waist that usually had a firm set of girl abs. Round, pert tits and an ass you could bounce a quarter off of. She'd shown it off since it had grown in with tight, stylish clothes that stopped just short of an HR violation during the day, early in her twenties she'd modeled professionally a few times as well, she'd still done nude modeling at art classes up until a year ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, the stripping. Under the name Cat-Girl69, Katie had had a place at the most high end burlesque show in the city every Saturday night. A mask covering her identity in case someone from work showed up to see the rest of her nude, she made more money shaking her ass on stage, spinning around a pole and giving lap dances and frequently working bachelor parties than you did in a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the fertility hormones started fattening her up and she got fired when she hit 160 and the clients started complaining about her cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this Club isn't exactly the ritz carlton,\" Katie complains, pausing her packing to suck down her third bottle of coke that afternoon, \"I'm only going to get paid minimum wage plus tips. I made five grand a weekend back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt, painfully doing crunches on the floor. Don't get it wrong, you wouldn't mind being ripped again but doing exercise fucking sucks. The one good note is that Katie looks even hotter fattened up than she did when she was skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and you're not exactly a perfect 10 anymore either,\" you say as you flop on the ground, wiping sweat from your forehead, \"you'd probably fit into that place pretty well though, given what we saw when we drove by on the way in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife glares at you, blue eyes unchanged and powerful. Involuntarily you flinch, fearing a spanking but then you remember she's handed the reins over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that supposed to mean, fat boy?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let yourself go, you're losing your looks,\" you point out to her, rising with a grunt and driving a finger into her gut, \"face it Katie, you're getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you fat boy, its ten pounds,\" she hisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie is wearing underwear, see through mesh panties three sizes too small. A muffin top folds over their top and runs are starting over her lumpy ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe per month lardass,\" you say, pinching and fondling, her eyes rolling back in her head in pleasure, \"Your thighs touch when you walk, your fat ass is big enough to see from the front, you've got side rolls and love handles, your guts almost at your boobs already. And those boobs are drooping I will add, you'd fail the pencil test pretty hard and they're only going to get lower as you get older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's pretty much panting by then, so you toss her onto the bed and start ripping her panties off. You decided a few months ago that she couldn't buy underwear anymore, so she's running out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yes, fuck me,\" she grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully get on her, rock hard dick sliding in quick, \"And you're really starting to look your age. Remember last year when you could pass for a college freshman? Ha, since you stopped getting the botox shots after we started trying to knock you up, your face has started falling girl. You've gone some fine lines coming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, yes, yes,\" Katie groans, wrapping her thick, still strong legs around you as you hammer home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tits flop and bounce, given the illusion of her old perk by lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna breast feed and those things are gonna plunge, they're gonna be pointing straight down. No one but me is ever gonna want to suck em again,\" you taunt her, sucking on them hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come into her with an explosion, gasping at the effort and only slowly sliding out. Rolling off with a grunt, you gently knock the hand rubbing her throbing clit away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you don't have time for that. You've got to get to work lardass,\" you taunt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie obeys with a groan, fat rolls forming across her paunch and begins getting dressed for her stripping shift...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month after Katy's awful jogging performance and you're trying to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKey word there is on trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbing data on the screen seems designed to make your mind slide off of it and onto the pile of cookies by your keyboard. Really you shouldn't be eating them, half the point of this whole trip was getting you back into alpha male shape so Katie can have her fat girl/fit guy contrast. Instead you've been fattening right back up, already you're over three hundred pounds of blubber again. You've been stuffed to the brim every day, so painfully full you can't even dream of working out. The snug XXL pants you'd been wearing can't even get over your feminine hips anymore, much less button about your drooping beer belly and you've been in zoom meetings visible only from the top up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've got to get a handle on it and diet, but you're already out of cookies. A glance shows you've cleaned the plate cleanly and your jowls flush at how piggish you are. The shock and shame sends your reduced shaft to full mast, a little over half your college length thanks to your high estrogen diet. Right on cue, Katie strut waddles into the room with another bowl of freshly frosted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my little oinker needed some more food,\" your wife smiles, eyes psychotically affectionate as they settle on the small bulge under your gut, \"and a BJ!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie please, I've got a meeting in two minutes...and I'm more than fat enough!\" you say as your mouth starts watering and your dick gets even harder as Katie starts taking off her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour intelligent, business woman, ball busting wife made the conscious yet insane decision she wanted to be a 50s housewife. She vacuums in heels, she dusts in pearls and she'd bake in an authentic 50s style dress if there had been women who were 6 feet tall and 280lbs back in the 50s. Instead she's in a plus sized reproduction of a skin tight red dress straight out of madmen, showing off her immense boobs, the escalating bulge of her gut and the wobbling jiggle of her mommy hips Its brand new and about to give up the ghost in the face of 10lbs a week. She unzips it and starts undoing the zeppelin bra for her floppy udders, having started wearing them again due to back pain after she lost all of her perk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat enough? No no,\" Katie grins, \"I thought that once but no, I want us both fatter. I want us both huge, I want us in matching his and hers mobility scooters. So start sucking down those cookies fat boy, I'm gonna start sucking you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month ago, Katie still looked like a plus size model due to her height and shape. A month of 9K calories a day in this secluded cabin and she's popped on another 40 pounds, looking fat and sloppy. She's for sure preggo but her belly is loose and droopy, its love handles and rolls hanging over her hips, she's growing a third chin and cellulite is expanding rapidly across her once perfect ass. Once perfect boobs are swollen pendulums that sway as she walks and her cellulite covered ass is so big you can see it from the front, while she's getting a fat roll in the middle of her flabby thighs. You get a great view of her ass as she goes down on hands and knees and starts sucking you off. Her whole body gets into it, thrusting back and forth, her floppy tits swinging like metronomes and her ample ass fat jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPure sexual pleasure shoots through you, as well as some embarassment when Katie's forehead keeps hitting the lower bulge of your paunch. Your once mighty dick might be bite size now but you've got plenty of stamina, so you set up your head phones, chow down on a cookie and start the meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, um hi everyone, if you could all, um, if everyone could just look at the screen!\" Assistant begins, growing increasingly flustered, \"Um, hey everyone please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's department is known as the pig pen. Its the least efficient branch in the company in terms of worker productivity and by far the fattest. Katie keeps her job because she's blown the entire board and black mailed them to keep the job, get way over paid and get regular injections of fit and eager young workers to transform into lazy, unfocused, obese slobs. You've seen a lot come in as fit thin young women staring at your piggish form, amazed your a hottie like Katie's husband only to waddle out into unemployment as immense, dull eyed cows who make you look tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we need to start, so if everyone could stop eating....,\" Assistant asks, near tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at Angelina, a brown sphere of a woman who could have been a runway model ten years ago and now works autonomously because she's too fat to leave the house. She's eating cookie dough from the roll like a candy bar, she's the fattest person who's still done any form of work. Next to her is Britney, struggling to keep her kids out of frame. She was an ambitious blonde go getter 8 years ago threatening Katie's position, coming closest to unseating her. Your wife swapped her birth control out one day and Britney became a single mom to pentuplets. Her hair's gone prematurely grey from the stress and she weighs close to 500lbs, between stress eating and Katie setting her up with a feeder with an additional breeding fetish. Next to her is Barbara, a red head who'd been a sorority president coasting by on head of accounting daddy's money and her instagram model body while looking for a sugar daddy. Katie got her hooked to gambling around the same time she got her hooked to feeding, getting her too plump to turn to modeling when Katie got her dad arrested for embezzlement. Fortunately the casino mogul had a gaining fetish, as long as Barbara pays off her interest rate with ever increasing gains the lights will stay on her in her trailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, we've got a lot of work due!\" Assistant sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery year Katie gets a new assistant and every year she fattens them up faster and faster. This one is new, brand new to the point she never new Katie was skinny and when you were in the office last time her clothes hadn't started whiskering. She was placed in charge of the empty office, most of them are too fat to work from the office anonymously, Katie having preferred her fatties fatter yet as she inflated. This one still looks thin, with no Katie to feed her she looks gaunter if anything, but she's clearly past her limit trying to get any work out of this group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie makes eye contact with you, sucking and sucking. Her tongue is on your shaft, working you towards eruption and her boobs and gut are hanging towards the floor. Thinking that pretty soon they'll make contact makes you come and Katie swallows it like she does everything else. She slides her lips off you and steals your cookies, shoveling them into her mouth two handed. Katie crab walks over to her dress, puffing by the time her out of shape physique gets there and struggles back into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssistant is still near tears when a clothed Katie walks back over to the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a pleasure to see you everyone,\" your fattened wife grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still has a wolfish smile, it puts the fear of God into her obese workers even though she's none too light herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be expecting those reports sent in to Emma by this evening,\" Katie smiles, the lardasses wobbling as they begin to work for the first time she's been gone, \"and Emma, I'm relocating you. The Pregnancy is harder on me than I thought, I'll be needing your help personally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ends the meeting without another word, sliding the dress back off, \"Fuck me on your desk. As hard as you can fat boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, already reinflating as she spreads her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your game?\" you ask, bellies smacking together as you enter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game? I don't have a game,\" she says, \"are you in yet? I think you're shrinking again fat boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the insult in stride, \"Yeah and your tits almost touched the floor today, why are you bringing Emma to our little fuck cottage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins at you, \"Because...because my back hurts from my tits, my thighs chafe from rubbing together and some kids laughed at how fat my ass was at the store today. I want to be a fat and vapid house wife and that means...unngggg, there you go, that means I want to turn sweet little Emma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
