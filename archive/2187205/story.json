She was known far and wide as \"the girl who never refused a dare\", and this was completely true. No matter how outlandish or embarrassing, Louise refused to turn down any dare whatsoever. Well, as long as it was physically possible, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us to the present day, as a few of the girl's friends tried to find a dare she wouldn't do. It was going exceptionally poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you really ate seven bean burritos...\" her friend Kris complained. \"How does your stomach even work...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other friend, Anthony, had a contemplative look on his face. \"Aha! I think I've got something that'll be too much, even for her! Louise, I dare you to stop using the toilet from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris gave him a weird look. \"Um, she's still human. She can't just stop her bodily functions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not asking her to.\" He replied. \"She can still... do her business, anywhere <i>but</i> the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on.\" The response from the until-now quiet Louise startled the both of them. \"Wait, really?\" the two asked simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise just nodded. Even if it was gross, a dare was a dare.</span></div></div>",

He said anywhere, so it's most convenient to just stay where I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris's follow-up statement about privacy was cut off by a grunt and a loud fart as Louise started to do her business. Kris and Anthony found themselves unable to look away as their petite friend dropped the largest, goopiest load either of them had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise gave a genuine smile as she pulled her pants back up. \"Much better. I think I like this dare. In fact...\" A mischievous smirk worked its way onto her lips. \"I dare you guys to join me.\"</span></div></div>",
