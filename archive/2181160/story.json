Their whole team push bot in and end up winning before Caitlyn could respawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the game showed the defeat sign, instead of clicking continue, Tyler was too busy freaking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHERFUCKIN RANDOMS AND TRASH ADC, ALL I WANT IS TO WIN A GOD DAMN GAME, IF I WAS THE TEAM, IF I COULD CONTROL ANY CHARACTER, I WOULD WIN EVERY SINGLE FUCKING GAME!\" Tyler yells out before taking his fist and punching right through his monitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his fist stuck, there was a sudden glow followed by a electric burst and all of the sudden Tyler blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tyler came too, he wasn't in his house anymore. All around him was pitch black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I, a-am I dead?\" Tyler wondered freaking out on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you see a little shine off in the distance. The tiny light was slowly getting bigger every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that,\" Tyler reaches out in curiosity not being able to get closer to it but waiting for it to come to him. As the item approached he would make out what looked like a glove of some sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it got close enough he grabbed it to take a closer look at it. It looked like an artifact made of gold, with black and red out lining all across it. A giant eye right on the palm of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok what fuck is going on ri-\" before Tyler can say anything else the glove forces itself on Tyler's left hand. <br>\r\n\"What the, I cant get it off.\"<br>\r\nThe glove looked like it started to melt and assimilate with Tyler's hand.<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh shitbags why does it hurt so much, its melting my fucking hand with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, what was darkness became an alley, Tyler standing right in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I now, looks to be some sort of city,\" Tyler says as we walks toward the light at the end of the alley. When he reached the end, his jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe his eyes. It looked like some sort of merchant city but what really made his eyes pop was there wasn't just humans. There were many different looking creatures and just by looking at them he new he was in the world of league of legends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Tyler mouthed, no sounding coming out cause he was in complete awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back down at his left hand and staring into the eye on his palm, he knew he had a power. A power to breach the soul, the body and the mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler scraped up a few used cloths and made some raggedy clothes. Once he wasn't in just his underwear he went out into the world of runeterra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
