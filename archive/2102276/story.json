            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Thursday, the 23rd of May, someone worried about how he would get into his house after realizing he left his keys on the dining room table. Someone else feared they wouldn't pass their school exam, another worried that she may have put too much sugar in his morning espresso, and a fourth person wondered if a particular girl like liked them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's likely that for one brief second, someone might have thought the world was going to end that day. Though they probably thought it would be from Global Warming, a bleak political climate, human error, or even zombies. Everyone likes to think about zombies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ultimately, nobody could've known what was going to happen on the 23rd of March. Known that life in the small town of Little Brook, the quiet little existence that the population had long taken for granted, would be torn from its roots, and ground by teeth made of fear and madness. Known about the plague that would turn citizen against citizen in the most bizarre and perverse way imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep that in mind as you read the tragic story of:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Little Brook High</b>: On this day, the most prominent high school in town has become a hotbed of conflicting emotions. Some are excited to see the big basketball game between the Little Brook Hunters and the Sunville Sentinels, while other students - and even some teachers - dreading an entire day of final exams. Students and teachers alike, weary from a sleepless night of studying and grading, have resorted to drinking coffee to get them through the day...garnished with dairy creamer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Papyrus Solutions.</b>: An office building for an ironically-named computer software company. Outside of the popularity and quality of their products, it's just an average office. Working there isn't too bad, but employees often find themselves watching the clock, counting down to the second they can go home. Fortunately for them, someone's having a birthday, and that means there's going to be an office party. Even though \"party\" just means that everyone is going to groan \"happy birthday\" until they're allowed to take food back to their offices and cubicles, that doesn't mean it's not appreciated. After all, who could hate free cake and ice cream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Little Brook Mall</b>: <i>If you've got nothing to do, have we got something for you!</i> That's the motto of Little Brook Mall, usually accompanied with a charming little jingle. Like the slogan implies, the mall is a popular hang-out destination for much of the town's youth; particularly the ones ditching school. It's also where most of the town shops for designer clothes, electronics, furniture and various other amenities. Then after a long day of shopping, guests can sit down and treat themselves a movie, ride the massive indoor roller-coaster, or dig into a wonderful meal provided by over a dozen restaurants, vendors, and the food court; all featuring produce supplied my Little Brook's own local farms. Just one of many innovative ways Little Brook Mall is giving back to the community. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Greenlake Village</b>: A beautifully quiet lakeside community on the outskirts of Little Brook. A fine place to raise families, live with delightful neighbors and get far away from the noise and nonsense of the city. Although, not too far away to make the work commute to and from Little Brook unfeasible. It's also conveniently located near Greenlake Acres, where residents can buy produce straight from the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the outbreak wasn't confined to only these four location. There are plenty more places where it occurred...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Incidentally, the 23rd of May is Students' Day in Mexico. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough depending who you ask, today is and isn't a very good day for the students of Little Brook. Today, most of the school dons their sports jerseys, their face paint, and their plaid wool hunter's hats. Heated discussion, the<i> Little Brook Hunters</i>' anthem, and the occasional blare of some guy's airhorn fills the hallways as students eagerly await the evening's game. Every so often, the halls explode with cheers that rival the airhorn whenever one of the team's players passes by. Then a faculty member will appear to scold everyone for being loud, and the student settle down for a good minute or so before giving into their excitement again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of student body is a lot less lively. They slowly trudge through the hallways; weighed down by the exhaustion and misery hanging out of the bags under their reddened eyes. Each one of them practitioners of the reckless ritual known as the \"all-nighter\". Today is the day of the last final exams for teachers who, for whatever reason, decided to wait until the last moment to give their tests. The fraction of students that are cheering in the halls are the lucky majority that got their exams done earlier in the week. The ones that didn't are left to be tortured both by merciless testing, and their peer's aggravating frivolity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters:</b><br>\r\n <br>\r\n<b>Mason Briggs</b>: Star player of the <i>Hunters'</i> team. He's an alright guy, but sometimes his popularity gets to his head. He gets a lot of attention from the girls at school, but he doesn't have a girlfriend yet. Even though he's confident in his own skills, he's secretly a bit wary about the outcome of tonight's game against the undefeated Sentinels. That's why he's putting in a few extra hours of practice before the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jason Trent</b>: He might have a mountain of exams due today, but that's the least of Jason's worries. After five years of being friends, he's decided that by the end of the day, he'll ask Katelyn if she wants to be his girlfriend. Jason's scared as hell, but he's determined to get a straight answer from her. Sure, asking her might spoil their friendship, and Katelyn might not want to speak to him again but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what? On second thought, there's always tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Veronica Trenchwood</b>: The student's think they have it hard? They've got nothing on Ms. Trenchwood. After an...incident at her university job, the forty-something-year-old was forced to move out of the school district to Little Brook; where the only job she could get was as a substitute teacher. During a job at LB High, the regular teacher went missing right before finals week, leaving Veronica to grade exam papers and essays for five different classes for a fraction of what the real teacher made; which was already not that much. If that wasn't enough, she has to deal with those shit kids hollering in the halls while she does it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Rita plans to head straight home and spend the weekend reminiscing with her best friend, Captain Morgan, about days that could've been.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's a quiet, misty morning in Greenlake Village; much of the town is still fast asleep, dreaming of better things than what awaits them on this day. All down the rows of houses only a few people are just waking up to start their mornings. They're only thinking about getting ready for work or for school, or what yard work to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll different kinds of people live in Greenlake living all different kinds of lives. Many of the families have kids attending Little Brook High, or even college age kids home from the recently ended semester. Some work in town, others are content to stay at home and keep the house tidied up. But none of them had today in their plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Jamisons</b>: Your standard nuclear family of four, living in the first house in the row. Diane is the mother, keeping house and tending to anybody that gets sick. Her husband Jack brings home the bacon working at the tech company, but he tries to help do his share of the housework when he can. Their daughter Jenna is the star of the school volleyball team, bringing back trophy after trophy with her teammates all last season. Her brother Mike, in comparison, is a computer whiz, and aspires to work alongside his Dad once he's done with school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The DeSantas</b>: A smaller family of three, they live right in the middle of the street. Sonia, the matron of the house, talks loud and always commands the attention in a room no matter where she is. Her husband Stephan works as an electrician on local jobs around Greenlake, and has come to learn that his wife's word is law. Their one child, Javier, is a senior at the school; like any rebellious teenager, he often gets into spats with his commanding mother, which more often than not end with her putting him in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Mastersons</b>: A combination of bad judgment, poor choices and miscalculation have left Lana Masterson with the title of \"single mother of three\". Working two jobs while trying to raise three daughters, she's not always very happy, but coffee and soap operas keep her going. Her youngest, Gina, always comes home from school with gossip to share with her sisters in an attempt to impress them. Emily, the middle child, loves the gossip, at least when she's not engrossed in texting her boyfriend, which might as well be 24/7. Wendy, the oldest and a recent college graduate, refuses to take part in \"immature\" things like gossiping, and tries her best to help her mom keep the family afloat, even if her jobs are only part time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Aunt\" Desiree Willis</b>: Desiree might live alone in her big house in Greenlake, but she never gets lonely. In her mid fifties, she's big, loud, and proud (although a whole lot nicer than Sonia DeSanta), and will happily help anyone who needs it. Most people around consider her their \"aunt\" due to her unending hospitality; she doesn't mind in the slightest if kids play in her yard, and she never lets a guest leave hungry. Most people just walk right into her house to visit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich home will we watch the plague descend upon? Or are there more houses to introduce first?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><div align=\"center\">Before we start with the rules and guidelines, I want to reiterate that this interactive focuses on Futanari. In other words, girls with both penis' and vaginas. If that isn't something you like, turn back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor potential writers, know that this will narrate the actions of multiple characters in multiple locations in the small city of Little Brook during a viral outbreak that transforms women into aggressive nymphomanic hermaphrodites. When you write about it think of it less of a comedy, and more of a horror story...not to say you can't insert some black humor. Just don't make the story overly goofy. Also, when writing for a character, imagine your writing a chapter for \"World War Z\", but in the third person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChapters should be at least 1000 characters long. Also, when adding a new character and writing their description, don't just write about their hair color and bust size. Think about who the character is, their role at the given location, and what they are doing before the virus turns their seemingly average day into a nightmare. I also encourage you to use other created characters in your story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen making choices for future chapters, write about the action that will take the character to the event rather than the event itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor instance instead of writing <i>\"Suddenly get humped int the butt\"</i>, write something like <i>\"Bend down to pick up a quarter\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow since you're going to be writing about a town being torn apart by a fictitious virus, I should probably tell you about the characteristics of said virus:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden Male Genitalia Growth Syndrome, or SMGG, is a virus of unknown origin that was discovered only after it struck Little Brook. The virus was distributed through a tainted batch of meat and milk from Greenlake Acres - the local farm- and infected a quarter of the female population. The virus remains dormant until the infected individual becomes sexually aroused. It is unknown what effects if any, the virus has on males, but female carriers have displayed the following symptoms over the course of 15-20 minutes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>*Spontaneous development of a penis averaging 12 to 22 inches in length.<br>\r\n*Spontaneous growth of testes of varying size.<br>\r\n*Stature Growth to about 7 to 8 feet in height<br>\r\n*Significant increase in bust and hip size<br>\r\n*A vast increase in libido and aggression<br>\r\n*Strong sexual urges<br>\r\n*Above average semen production</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some cases, carriers may display:<br>\r\n<u><i>*Varying degrees of unpleasant body odor <br>\r\nLactation<br>\r\n*Moderate amount of weight gain</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is possible there could be other side-effects/mutations that have yet to be seen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus can be spread by ingesting any bodily secretion shed by the infected individual; primarily semen. The virus can also be spread through physical contact with discharge, although it must be through constant exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fetishes go, the following kinks are not allowed to appear in this story:<br>\r\n*Overly excessive weight gain. BBW is fine, but don't go overboard.<br>\r\n*Furries<br>\r\n*Characters under 16 years old<br>\r\n*Shrinking (we've already got hundreds of interactives devoted to that.)<br>\r\n*Diapers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you think something in your chapter may contain a fetish that may be skirting the line of what is acceptable, message me, and I'll let you know for sure. Otherwise, go nuts.</div></td>",
