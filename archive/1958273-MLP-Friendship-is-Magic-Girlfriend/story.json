            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had been walking down the street, contemplating the world around you. As you walked, your short black hair gently pushed by a calming breeze and your t-shirt flapping a bit, you take in the sounds of the city of Canterlot. For the most part, Canterlot was a nice, upper-class town, somewhat secluded from the rest of Equestria. Like all big cities, though, it had its fair share of crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crane your head to look upon the buildings in Canterlot, their ornate construction reminding you of various high-class buildings in other places. Some of the marble in the city semi-illuminated your human form. Standing at a height of 5' 11'', you were of modest height and a not too terrible build, not too skinny but still not a drop of fat on your person whatsoever. The warm night in the city of Canterlot coerced you to wear a  greenish pair of shorts along with a grey t-shirt. Kicking a can at random, your sneakers, grey-laced white shoes which had seen better days, stepped with light thuds on the cobble.Again, you smell the crisp, warm air of Canterlot. All seemed quiet, but you soon remember that it is at this quiet hour that the ne'er-do-wells and criminals do their dirty deeds on any given night. Tonight happened to be one of those nights. All of a sudden, trash cans rattled and clattered in a nearby alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scoundrels! Do you not know who I am?\" a feminine voice yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pretty princess in need of a lesson!\" another voice shouted, this time masculine and gruff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so shut up and do what we tell you, or you'll be so broken the street sweepers won't know what to do with you!\" yet another voice called out, masculine like the second but a bit lighter and more raspy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? I will not submit to the likes of you!\" the feminine voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... we tried the easy way but you didn't listen,\" the first male said. \"Willy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Swift?\" Willy, the second male asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold her,\" Swift said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a sound of magic charging up was heard, and then it stopped. \"Release me at once!\" the female voice yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you can defend yourself without a horn, you bitch!\" Swift shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a second later, there was a loud snap, followed by a scream of pain. A sound like a piece of hollow wood hitting the ground soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still got some fight!\" Willy called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you made your approach to see what was going on. What you would see shocked you beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo rough-and-tumble stallions had pinned a mare, and the larger one, the one who you assumed was Swift, had his left hoof on the mare's left wing. The mare also had what was left of a horn, the other half of which was lying on the ground and had a bit of blood on it. The mare, a black Alicorn with a flowing purple and blue mane, cyan cat-like eyes, and a moon surrounded by purple for her cutie mark, was pinned between the cold stone ground and Swift's partner-in-crime, blood dripping down her face and purple eyeshadow running a bit because of her tears of pain. She looked at the open end of the alley, hoping to jump up and take the rapists by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold her, Willy!\" Swift called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilly did his best to keep the mare under him pinned. All of a sudden, Swift himself raised his hoof and slammed it down on the black Alicorn's left wing base with a sickening crunch. The mare's head went up and she howled out in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwift, not even bothering to grant the black Alicorn mercy, stomped on the mare's other wing base, causing the mare to wail, burning pain shooting across her back and rendering her flightless and without magic. She had only two options - let the brutes Swift and Willy have their way with her, or hold out on that last little bit of hope, praying that somepony (or someone in your case) would heed her call. She threw up her head and, as loud as she could, yelled out two words that rang throughout Canterlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP MEEEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is your course of action?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't ignore this a second longer! This fight wasn't fair at all. And you, as a man and fighter, couldn't let this go on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hey, you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs turned to see  who had interrupted their fun. Nightmare was curious so she turned her head as well, thinking, hoping, that it was someone that would help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Hmm?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"Who's there?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then stepped out of the shadow that the light post created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Oh? A human, huh?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"What do you want here, you hairless ape? Can't you see were busy? Or are you blind besides being ugly?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began to laugh loudly. Thinking that their mockery and insults were funny and that they would make you leave them alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"You know, I may be going a bit blind. Because right now, all I see infront of me are two foolish and cowardly brutes who are worthy of nothing but pity.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"What did you say?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh? Are you deaf? Then let me make this celar and simple for you, fools. Leave that mare alone <b>NOW</b>! Or else you'll suffer!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare didn't knew what to say. She was thankful that you were trying to help but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cnavy\">*Oh dear, I hope I didn't made a mistake calling for help. I don't want another one suffering because of me!*</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Ha! Hear that, Swift? This moron thinks he can beat us!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"Yeah! Let's show him how wrong he is. But first!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwift's horn began to glow and suddenly chains emerged from the ground and wall and tied Nightmare Moon to the same wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"There we go. Now you won't be able to escape, bitch!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Let her go now!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Make us!\"</span>, said Willy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilly then charged and tryed to deliver a hook punch to your face. You dedged it simply by mooving your face to the left. Then you triped him and elbowed him on the bach of his neck, sending him to the ground and knocking him out cold. Nightmare was impressed with how easy you had taken care of Willy. Swit of the other hoof, was quite pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"You bastard!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hmph. Such rudeness. Didn't your mother taught you manners?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"Shut up!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Swif that charged. However, he jumped to the sky. Once he reached the jump's full arc, he teleported behind you, trying to take you by surprise. However, you knew this manouever. It was one of the first tricks you learned at school of \"Fighting Classes 101\" back a few years. There, they taught techniques to fight of any species. Be it human, earth pony, unicorn, pegasi, changeling, etc... Thus, you were prepared. You ducked, avoiding the punch he tried to delicer to your head, then you launghed yourself back with impulse, making both of you fall to the ground. Next, you used both of your elbows to hit both of Swit's sides with all of the strenght you could muster in that position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"Ugh!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next noise that was heard were the soundof ribs breaking. That in turn made Swift cough a bit of blood. You then stood up. With Willy knocked out and Swift imobilized, you went to Nightmare Moon's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hey there. How are you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'll be fine. Just a few brui-!\"</span>, she was cut short when she tried to move and felt a shot of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I'll take that as a \"Not feeling well\". Can you walk?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"N-not really.\"</span>, she admitted begrudgingly. She was a proud mare. She knew it. And she wasn't used to get help from anyone. Not that she thought she deserved it. She had done horrible things, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*sigh* Alright then.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouched and took a position that would allow Nightmare Moon to place her are around your neck, so she could support herself on you. She did so. You then roose, picking up her honr on the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Here,I think this belongs to you.\"</span>, you said with a calm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it gladly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Thank you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then moved it to where it was supposed to stay. And, to your utter surprise, dark blue magic tendrils came out of the horn's base and enveloped the detached part. Once that was done, both parts attached themselfves ot the other and the horn lookd as good as new. As if never left it's place on Nightmare Moon's head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Wow. I didnt knew that was possible.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Only Alicorn's can do it. Or a <b>VERY</b> powerful Unicorn.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I see. Well then, can you use your magic to carry this idiots?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I can but, why?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Because that way we can turn them over to the police an they'll be arrested for assault and disturbing the peace. That should get them 2 to 5 years of prison.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightmare smiled at that. Happy that justice would be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Alright.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did just that. Moon disguised herself as white coated and straight pink maned Pegasi and you took the thugs to the nearest delegacy, Once they had been taken into custody and the guards confirmed the story (there was no way to deny it in the first place. After all, no one breaks their own wings on purpose), the thugs were officially arrested and you and Nightmare got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Where to now?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Do you have a place to stay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"No. I have been wandering the streets and sleeping on roof tops.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*gasp* Uncaeptable! You can stay at my place for a while until we figure sothing to help you out. Got it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I- I don't want to impose-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Nonsense! And you wouldn't be imposing at al. It no problem really. I insist.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"*blush* A-alright. Thank you. Lead the way, please.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"No problem.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you a good ten minutes walk but you weren't trouble at all. After arriving, you tended to Nightmare Moon's wounds and bandaged her broked wings. You decided that she was going to the hospital first thing tomorrow and she reluctantly agreed. Aince she wasn't used to be trated kindly, like you did. Once that was done, you gave her some of your sister's left over clothes (fortunately she had forgoten them when she moved a couple of years back) and lended her the bed, while you slept on the couch. You were about to exit the room whaen she called out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"W-wait!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Yes? What is it, miss Moon?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"P-please. Just Moon will suffice. And can yo usleep with me tonight? I-I don't mean it in that sense!!! I just-...\"</span> She interrupted herself. Thinking she had said something stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hey. It's okay. I get it, you had a terrifying experience, need comfort and you don't want to be alone, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. You then picked your pijamas and changed on the bathroom of the suite. Next you got under the covers and laid besides Nightmare, She scooted closer to you and hugged you, relifhing and sigging happily at your warmth. You simpley smiled, turned of the lights and let sleep took you both.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, so you're not going for the choices in the previous chapter, hmm? That's fine, everyone has their own preferences. Anyway, back to business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as how there are a whole lot of different choices in powers to choose from, here are a few of my personal favorites. Starting off this list is the Power of Smoke Manipulation! Yes yes, I know that inFAMOUS: Second Son already took that idea and made it uniquely interesting, but for those who don't know what exactly this type of power can do other the name implies, then allow me to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke Manipulation (aka ) is, basically, the power to use and manipulate smoke and ember at the palm of your hands. Delsin Rowe, the main protagonist of the PS4 game inFAMOUS: Second Son, is a great example on the use of this form of superpower. After all, you get the powers of Smoke Manipulation very early on in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ahem* Sorry, getting back on topic, ladies &amp; gents. With the powers of Smoke Manipulation, you can shoot out burning embers of smoke from your hands, or even transform into smoke and quickly travel around any city through the use of air ducts. And don't worry, you can reassemble yourself back into your original solid form when you exit an air duct. However, with this unique power, you don't just shoot smoke from your hands and turn into smoke, you can also throw smoke grenades, which, shortly after exploding, can cover any affected enemies nearest to the smoke grenade and stun them for either to an open attack or to incapacitate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Delsin uses an industrial chain around his arm as a whip, imbuing it with burning ash for additional melee damage, you can choose whatever melee weapon you want. And speaking of turning into smoke, that ability is called Smoke Dash, due to giving the user of this power heightened motion and produce horizontal propulsion for a short while via another ability called Smoke Thrusters, which allows the user of this power to glide over a great distance by shooting smoke and fire out of the user's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for how the Smoke Dash ability can be useful in a combat situation, you can use Smoke Dash to dodge incoming attacks and/or dash through an enemy, rematerialize behind them, and deliver a choke-slam them to the ground in the process. However, like the game itself, if you use up too much of your smoke abilities, you'll eventually run out of smoke and ash to use, so you will have to recharge your abilities via absorbing smoke from specific places near you, like smokestacks, chimneys, anywhere where smoke can be coming out of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for those who want to unleash a powerful blast to wipe out a bunch of enemies in one fell swoop, you can use a powerful ability known only as the Orbital Drop. Unlike the other smoke abilities in your arsenal like Cinder Blast and Cinder Missile, Orbital Drop needs time to build up it's destructive force, but when it's ready and you use it, you dematerialize into 3 flaming balls of smoke, as you are violently launched upwards around a hundred feet or so. Upon reaching that height, you rematerialize and rapidly fall down toward the ground like a meteor, exploding into smoke and embers upon impact with the surface in a violent fashion, turning yourself into a smoke and ember-induced bomb. So yeah, you can cause a lot of destruction with this ability. Unfortunately, you can't use Orbital Drop inside a building unless it has a ceiling that exceeds a hundred feet, so a friendly word of advice: don't use Orbital Drop inside a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, for the second power to choose from this chapter, Ice Manipulation, also known as Cryokinesis! As for those who aren't familiar with this superpower, Cryokinesis is simply the ability to manipulate ice and anything that's physically cold. Like Typhokinesis is a variation of Pyrokinesis (aka Fire Manipulation), Cryokinesis is a variation of Water Manipulation aka Hydrokinesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn using this power, you can create, shape, and manipulate ice, make water into a frozen, more solidified state, appearing naturally in the various forms of snow, hail, icicles, ice spikes &amp; candles, glaciers, pack ice, frost, polar ice caps, and cold by reducing the kinetic energy of atoms and thus making things colder, for various effects and combinations. In English, it basically means that you can freeze almost anything solid, it just depends on your creativity and how you use it is all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for which characters can use Cryokinesis, let's just say that there's a WHOLE LOT of Cryokinetic users, ranging from video game characters to comic book characters. For example, the female villain Icy from the Winx Club, Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat, Elsa from the Disney movie Frozen, Iceman &amp; Storm from Marvel Comics' X-Men, Danny Phantom from the Nick cartoon Danny Phantom, the Waterbenders &amp; the Avatar from Avatar: the Last Airbender &amp; The Legend of Korra, Princess Snow Kaguya from the anime Sailor Moon S, Killer Frost from DC Comics, and last but not least, the Batman villain known only as MR. FREEZE. So....yeah, that's a lot of characters, and (pun intended) that is just the tip of the iceberg! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what you can do with Cryokinesis, you can freeze the air around you, create, generate, and/or increase the volume of ice, create Cryokinetic Constructs, including weapons, barriers, armor, and/or allies/servants, move/lift ice at nearly any speed whether in/on surface, air, or water. You can even do this in the lethal vacuum of space if you found a way to survive in that type of environment. As for superpower travel, you can either go with creating a surfboard made of ice and do what I would call \"Cryokinetic Surfing\", or doing Elemental Flight using ice to slide around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, like Typhokinesis, Cryokinesis has it's own share of limitations and weaknesses. The easiest to answer being intolerant to extreme heat, not to mention being weak to someone or something able to use any form of Pyrokinesis. Along with weakness to extreme amounts of heat, creating ice will be much more difficult or completely impossible within a very dry area, so basically no water or moisture, no ice. Also, if you can freeze vibrations, that's just as hard as creating ice in a dry environment, as the vibrations can cause anything frozen to shatter, making sound-based abilities like Audiokinesis &amp; Echokinesis users like Musa from the Winx Club and Black Canary from DC Comics capable of defending and countering against Cryokinetic users.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there you have it, Typhokinesis and Cryokinesis, ladies and gentlemen! So, do you want to be able to shoot smoke and embers from your hands with Typhokinesis? Or do you want to be capable of making almost anything covered in ice at the snap of your fingers with the chilling power of Cryokinesis? </span></div></div>",

So, I'll allow the main character to have sex with up to 3 (three) females at the same time, AT MOST. Or, simplifying, M/F/F/F;<br>\r\n4.1-Write a warning chapter before adding a chapter with sexual content. Also, specify what the chapter will have (be it sex, nudity, lesbianism, etc...);<br>\r\n4.2-Types of sexual activities allowed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Blowjob;<br>\r\n-Handjob;<br>\r\n-Titfuck;<br>\r\n-Rimjob;<br>\r\n-Regular sex;<br>\r\n-69;<br>\r\n-Anal Sex;<br>\r\n-Horn/Mane fuck (the Horn fuck and the Mane fuck can only be done by Unicorns/Alicorns. The horn fuck consists on the usage of the horns to fuck somepony else's ass/pussy. And the mane fuck can only be done by the members of royaly (Celestia, Luna, Nightmare Moon, Cadence and Twilight, since either, their manes are pure magic in Clestia's, Luna's and Nightmare Moon's cases, or they can use magic to kake their manes move as they please, in Twilight's and Cadence's cases and it consists on using their manes to jerk/fuck somepony else's ass/pussy/cock/horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A LITTLE bit of bondage (only the females can do it. Also try to write about it as little as you can);<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5-Transgender (Only with the main character. Also, it must wear off in 3 to 5 chapters TOP. And I'm only allowing this because I think it could \"spice\" the \"fun\" and that it would add a funny touch to the story);<br>\r\n6-Blood (only from wounds of battles. Also, if you think the fight scene is going to be a little too gory (like tearing limbs), don't be too descriptive).<br>\r\n7-Transformation: If the mare(s) of your choice are regular ponies or can change from regular to anthro, then the main character can do it as well. You choose how he looks and if he/she is an Earth Pony/Unicorn/Pegasus/Alicorn/Changeling/Draconequs/Human or whatever species your OCs are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate 02/03/2016: 8-This are the fetishes allowed: Shrinking, Giantess, Butt Crush (Non-lethal), Breast Crush (Non-lethal), All kinds of regular Vore ((Oral Soft vore, Anal vore, Unbirth, Breast vore, Herm Cock vore, Absorption and Slime Pony (regular or anthro) vore) and minor scat (mentioned only).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCAN'T DO:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-NO FEET//HOOVES. You can mention them but THAT'S IT;<br>\r\n2-Males (they can be mentioned and can talk/be talked to but that's as far as it goes;<br>\r\n3-NO watersport in this story;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1-Do NOT write like a caveman or use internet language like \"U R N00B.\" or something like that.<br>\r\n2-Keep the characters accordingly to their personalities (a character can't be good and suddenly turn bad. It needs a plot. Like when Fluttershy became Cruelshy because of Discord's influence).<br>\r\n3-ANY chapter with bad writing/grammar, WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT NOTICE!!!<br>\r\n4-Only the main character can use weapons and even then, they MUST be either, magical (staff, scepter) or swords. But the usage of weapons is only allowed if the main character is human or in human form.<br>\r\n5-Underage: If you choose foals characters, like Applebloom, they instantly become adult ponies. Sorry but no underage action here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I think that more rules need to be added, I'll change this. If not, I'll leave it as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, HAVE FUN!!!</td>",
