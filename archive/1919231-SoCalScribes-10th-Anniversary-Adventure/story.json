As everyone knows, February 14th is also Valentine's Day, so in addition to all of his planning and preparation for the festivities on the 15th, he also has to make sure that he does V-Day right for his wife. Unfortunately, he has to work on Valentine's Day. Thoughtful as always, he arranged to have flowers delivered to his wife during the day, and plans on taking her out to dinner at her favorite classy seafood restaurant when he gets home from work.

His alarm goes off in the morning and he gets up to complete his morning ablutions just like any other day.  Today there is a small twinkle in his eyes that speaks of mischief afoot, but he makes it to the bathroom before his wife gets a chance to see, or wonder about that brightness.  A secret smile curves his lips as he works his fingers though his hair, massaging the scalp and shaking away the last lingering fog of sleep.  Today will be a busy one, and there are still plans to finalize.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finishes getting ready for the day, he gets the excitement under control and is able to go down to the breakfast nook without giving himself away.  His wife is already there, her beauty makes him pause as the morning sunlight twines though her hair.  She hasn\u2019t seen him yet, her eyes dance over the text of the book she\u2019s nearly finished and he feels his love rumble in his chest, a content lion curled around his heart.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day was one she would never forget.  There isn\u2019t time for him to linger over breakfast like he normally would, not if he wants to get everything in order.  \u201cI\u2019m off my love, there\u2019s a report due by the end of the day and I want to get it out of the way.  I\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks past, she reaches out and snags his hand.  With a fond smile, she brushes his knuckles against her cheek. \u201cTonight.\u201d She agrees, even as he pulls her hand back and lays a soft kiss against the back of her hand.  No more words need to be said, whole conversations are shared in the tilt of a head, the curve of familiar well-loved lips and expressive eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knows she suspects.  But, even she won\u2019t be able to guess his plans this time.  Not after all the work he\u2019s put into keeping it secret.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first destination is the little flower shop tucked between a massive grocery store and strip mall.  He\u2019d found the shop a few years back, and while it was small, it had the best roses he\u2019s ever seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst task, set up delivery of seven roses, each leading to the next destination.  Once his wife finishes with one romantic task, another rose would be delivered directing her to the next.  He has planned out the entire day, seven activities to show his love for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell chimes as he enters the shop and he is almost knocked over by the full bodied fragrance of roses.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you look hot as ever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSocal shuffled on his feet in discomfort and mentally told her wife, \"See, how much I have to suffer for your sake.\" <br>\r\nHe turned towards the roses. They were shining in the recently splattered water-droplets, as if hoping to attract more customers with their dewy freshness. He found seven perfect buds of flowers from the crowd of flowers-- a white, yellow, red, orange, peach, pale pink, and at the last, he picked up an orchid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany other customers have entered and left the shop while he was deliberating over that perfect bud.
