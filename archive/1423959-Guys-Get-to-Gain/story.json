He stopped by the kitchen to grab his usual after-school snack: some crackers and a glass of milk. Matt got his food and headed upstairs to do his homework and watch some TV before supper. That had been his routine for the past decade and a half, and it wasn't about to change anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupper was, as usual, nothing much. A chicken breast, some vegetables...Matt sighed. He had eaten the same stuff, day in and day out, for 15 years now. And he was tired of it. Bland, boring, \"good for you\" food wasn't what he wanted. But, unfortunately, that was really his only option. He didn't have the money to go buy himself whatever he wanted, and in the end, his mother could still take it away. Being 15 sucks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt went upstairs to his room and flopped on his bed. What could he possibly do for some fun? Sure, he had video games and TV and stuff. But what he really wanted was food, and lots of it. He had seen...well, he had found some magazines under his friend's dad's bed. It showed people eating more than Matt thought possible. And they really seemed to enjoy it. Matt wanted to try it, see what it was like. But who really wants to stuff themselves full of carrots or graham crackers? Matt knew right then and there that it had to be junk food. But how could he pull off getting that kind of stuff with his parents always watching him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just then, he knew how he could do it. The same way every kid in movies does-tell his parents he's going to a friend's house, have the friend vouch for him, and he's good. But wait-why not actually use one of his friends in this devious plan? His buddy Jack was always up for a fun plan. Plus, Jack's parents let him do practically anything. Matt picked up the phone.</span></div></div>",

He quickly heard a \"woohoo\" from downstairs, as well. Running down, he saw his parents jumping up and down in a circle, arms together and screaming.<br>\r\n\"Why are you so excited?\"<br>\r\n\"WE WON A VACATION!\"<br>\r\n\"Really?!

He also got personal aides on standby, as well as a fake ID so he could drive around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of those preparations made him hungry! He drove down the local McDonny's and asked for three Big Whacks, all supersized. He immediately began to eat. Biting down, Matt realized he'd never eaten something so good in his life! Nothing he'd ever imagined tasted like this, oh it was glorious. He managed to eat half of the first one before he felt as if he'd explode. He brought the rest home and took a nap on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, his stomach had stretched and emptied. He ate the rest of the first one and all of the fries that came with it, loving each bite as it slid down his throat. Again, however, he was full. His parents made good on their promise and he had a whole new system with an ensemble of games. He slid in Grand Theft Auto and went to town. All of a sudden his stomach growled. \"That was fast,\" he thought out loud. This time he managed to polish off the rest of the food entirely, patting his belly as he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't put on much weight as it were, but now his stomach understood that it had to hold it all. The stomach knew it was about to face war.</span></div></div>",

He swore he wouldn't stop eating today until he'd popped at least one button. Once again he drove out to the McDonny's. In the mirror he noticed he was pretty much the same size. Matt couldn't stand for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEN BIG WHACKS!\" He barked at the poor cashier. \"Er, sorry. I'd like ten big whacks, please.\" The cashier looked him over and wondered why such a skinny boy was buying such a fat order, but he didn't get paid to judge. They came quickly and Matt took them to his table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ravenously bit down on the first, and with new hunger, devoured it in seconds. He licked his fingers while the other hand brought the second to his face. \"These are so good.\" he mumbled through bites, gorging down two more before slowing down and admiring the damage. \"Man I feel full, but I swore to myself I wouldn't stop!\" Still, he couldn't stomach another for the time being and instead ordered five large chocolate milkshakes. The cashier was watching as Matt guzzled them down, one by one. \"Oh man that's good, five more please!\" On the final milkshake he felt a large belch coming up. He burped (a new sensation) and felt like his stomach was once again empty. Down the hatch went the rest of the burgers and the accompanying fries. \"Oh man, this is awesome, twenty more Big Whacks and shakes, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the kitchen staff was preparing he noticed that the shirt felt much tighter than it did when he arrived. Peeking through his collar, he noticed a considerable bulge where his flat stomach used to be. \"Progress!\" he whispered to the flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food arrived, the cashier still utterly perplexed. Eyes glazed over by gluttony, he ate and ate and ate. He slowly filled the shirt more and more until at last, a button popped. It was at the 18th burger and 11th shake. He sighed with relief that his self-inflicted force-feeding was over and relaxed for the rest of this part of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twentieth of each went down his maw, a second button popped. \"Whoa!\" Matt exclaimed as a new challenge entered into his head. \"What if I can remove the whole shirt with food?! 30 MORE SHAKES AND BURGERS, PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier was alone no longer in his staring, part of the kitchen staff had come out to see the \"starving skinny guy\" and other patrons of the restaurant couldn't unglue their eyes either. Matt didn't notice, he was too busy daydreaming about how fat he could get by the end of the two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the kitchen came the food and Matt began his binge. He gorged on burgers and fries until he couldn't stomach any more, then he chugged down milkshakes until he made more room. Burgers, shakes, burgers, shakes. He popped four buttons this time, leaving only four more. His stomach wasn't just peeking out from under his shirt now, it was a mass that sat on his thighs and jiggled with every twitch, every breath. He had love handles that pushed the shirt to his back. He had a second chin forming, as well. Today was a lovely start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forty more of... oh you get it!\" Down his gullet went the greasy, half-pound burgers. Into his maw went gallon after gallon of milkshake. Handful after handful he shoved fries into his mouth, gargling down ketchup as they went. \"Victory!\" he cried as he noticed his shirt had completely opened, revealing his new manboobs. He stood up from the table with a bit of trouble, his bare skin grazed the plastic. He walked up to the counter and asked for whatever they had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... that was it.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"You ate all of it.\"<br>\r\n\"All of your burgers?\"<br>\r\n\"The milkshakes, too.\"<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that,\"<br>\r\n\"Neither can I. Besides, as much as I like to watch you eat, I'm not allowed, no shirt, no shoes, you see,\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, well in that case I best be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive belly in tow, he waddled out the front door giddy with how much weight he put on in one day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matt made it home at 5:00. Tired from all that food, he sat on the couch to watch some TV. As he did, his jeans blew their button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I can really pack it away, now,\" he said as he slapped his belly. It wobbled and quivered excessively. He watched for around 30 minutes before a commercial came on advertising a new buffet downtown. He'd never been to one before, but the idea of \"all you can eat\" appealed to him at the moment. As the food flashed across the screen he became hungry again. He changed into a much more loose shirt, still with buttons. Matt planned to ruin this one as well. Before he changed, however, he called one of his aides and told him to bring back the entire Hostess aisle from the supermarket to his house. When he'd finished putting on new clothes, he went to the kitchen and saw the plethora of cakes. Twinkles, Dong-Dings, and a thousand miscellaneous knock-offs and whatnot were now in his kitchen. He told the aide to unwrap them all and (after sanitizing) put them all in the living room in massive piles.<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir. After we get the rest unloaded from the truck.\"<br>\r\n\"The truck?\"<br>\r\n\"You didn't specify which supermarket, so we got them all.\"<br>\r\nAmazed, he left for the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived and was sat down quickly. He was told he could get as much food as he liked from the counters, but the waiters would refill his drink. He went up to the counters and, my, oh, my. It was overwhelming. Never before had he seen so much food in such a small area. He grabbed a plate and piled it on. Fried steak, fried chicken, fried fish, even fried ice cream. French fries, burgers, everything he'd dreamed of. He piled a foot or so of food on a total of four plates and brought them back to the booth. He didn't find silverware, so he just shoveled in into his maw with his hands. How he could eat! Mounds of food went down as a mound of fat went up. Still, even after his thirds and fourths, his shirt was only starting to look like it fit him. He got his fifths, sixths, and sevenths, no luck. The shirt only got a little bit tight. He guzzled down gallons of soft drinks he'd never tasted before, no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was when he saw the dessert bar. It was the largest thing in the store. He remembered the words \"dessert buffet\" from the commercial and realized he'd been eating their \"appetizers\" this whole time. He stood up (with some difficulty) and went over. He piled on 10 pies on three plates and a whole 4-layer cake on another. He got six tubs of chocolate ice cream covered in caramel and chocolate syrup. Matt began to scoop the desserts into his mouth. He ate the apple pie first, then the cherry, then two of the chocolate mousse ones, and then a layer from the cake, then he drank down a gallon of ice cream. At last a button popped. He finished this course of dessert and two more snapped. He went up for more and more and even after his shirt exploded off of him he kept eating. Matt was addicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glutton was finally full. He had three chins and his massive stomach hung off all sides of his legs. He was considering cleaning the place out when the waiting staff had the courage to tell him to go home. No shirt, no shoes, you see. He grabbed one of their three-layer cakes for the ride home and was off.</span></div></div>",

If he coughed the horn would go off and the car would veer slightly in either direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing\" he continued to mutter to himself as he went over bumps and saw himself jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the glutton was hungry before he was even halfway home, and by the time was, it was more ravenous and insane with greed than actual hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello sir! Back from the buffet, I presume?\" greeted the servant.<br>\r\n\"Wha - why are you still here?\"<br>\r\n\"We're still unloading all the snack cakes.\"<br>\r\n\"For two hours?!

The door is wider and the cakes aren't as numerous there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile what the servant said was true, after Matt opened the door, he was still knee deep in snack cakes. He closed the door and waddled through to the living room, where he couldn't get in there was so much food. This was when an idea struck - the entire house is somewhat tilted all towards the basement. He waddled as quickly as he could down there, shoveling cake into his maw as he went. The basement was filled entirely, so Matt dug it all out with his stomach. He dove in jaws mindlessly opening and closing. More and more preservative-enhanced food went down his throat and his gut certainly showed. It distended out feet in front of him and on his sides. His pants exploded off of him with the remainder of his shirt as hundreds of Hostess muffins, cakes, frostings and fillings went down his gaping mouth. </span></div></div>",

His temper had grown significantly with his frustration since he had been put into the leg cast nearly a week before. He had been immediately kicked off the football team since he couldn't play, and considering the time he would be recovering, he wouldn't be able to play basketball either. This efficiently brought the school's star jock's sports career to a screeching halt.<br>\r\nDan's social life was left in metaphorical ruins. His girlfriend had dumped him in favor of a more capable jock, and most of the girls that would cluster and giggle while looking at him lustfully had moved on. Most of his friends no longer wanted to hang out with him, since his injury would 'hold them back' from most forms of entertainment. The only times Dan socialized now was across the internet and at small gatherings between his friends to play video games. He was only at those because he, being rich, had the best and latest games that the gang wanted to play.<br>\r\nIn addition to Dan's now socially depraved life, his personal life was also in shambles. He could no longer work out-not only was it impractical with his leg, but both the school and his doctor forbade it. That given, he would no longer be able to qualify for any sports scholarships. He would need one too, since his grades had never been the greatest and his performance had declined since the accident.<br>\r\nDan was now in a worse position than he had ever been in before, and it was only the beginning of the year! Since it was his senior year, he wouldn't have a next year to fall back on and regain his status.

In fact if his parents hadn't bought his car most people would have thought he was poor without seeing his house, which also wasn't extravagant.<br>\r\nDan earned nearly seven dollars an hour by now and put thirty percent of each dollar into a savings account.

There were these two guys- business men from the look of them- enjoying a brandy after some social event. They were friends - or at least acquantences- but as they talked longer, clearly not so close.  There was some rivelry over a woman, I think.  One claimed that the other was interfering with his attempt to get close to the lady and the other answered that she didn't like him at all and over time the discussion became more heated.  They had another round and the men more hostile.  It was likely that I might have a fight on my hands without some intervention.<br>\r\n\"Parden me,\" I interrupted the argument. \"perhaps you two gentelmen can help me.\" I continued.<br>\r\nThey looked up annoyed to have their focus distracted but still maintaining civility.<br>\r\n\"You see,\" I said. \"I'm having a problem with stocking the bar.

I presented two glasses for each and paused expectantly.<br>\r\nSuddenly the two men dropped their petty argument.  I had complemented their judgement and they were focused on living up to that judgement. They got busy swirling the brandy, smelling the araomas and making justments.  It took two rounds before they conculded the best brandy and they left arm in arm.\"<br>\r\n\"Interesting story.\"  Dan said. \"So you think that a bar man should have some ability to stand patrons for free drinks?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't say that this should be under the table.  Keep track of it but give the staff some tools to keep the ship running.\"<br>\r\n\"Let me buy you a drink.\"  Roger said. \"It's almost closing time and it's nice to have some company while I'm closing.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Past his youth and showing the years, he wasn't getting much attention at the clubs.  Then he'd given up on even attempting to control his weight and stay in shape.  He had settled into a inconspicuous drab competence that ensured his continued employment but failed to satisfy.  Now with this young suckup smartass feeling so un-threatened at the task at hand.<br>\r\nRoger picked up a bacon strip and took a bite.<br>\r\n\"Bon appetite.\" he smiled.<br>\r\nDan dug in manfully.  Roger ate slowly and with pleasure.  <br>\r\n\"Take your time.\" he said.  <br>\r\nDan nodded.  He was half-way finished with the omelette.  He paused and attached the potatoes, alternating bites with bacon and sausage. Smiling he finished the omelette, potatoes and meats and pushed the plate aside.<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" he said.  \"I ate it all.\"<br>\r\n\"Not surprising.\"  Roger replied.  He was still savoring the eggs.  \"Young guys like you are always hungry.  I'll bet you still have plenty of room.  Me, I have to pace myself.  You probably can finish those pancakes before I get the rest of this omelette down.\"<br>\r\nRoger could see that the young man was eager to continue.  He pulled the pancakes close and spread them with butter before drowning them in syrup.  He began to eat, slower than before but with determination.  While Roger finished the omelette Dan plowed through the pancakes.<br>\r\n\"I envy your youthfull appetite.\"  Roger said.  \"I used to enjoy packing my belly full but these days I have to go slow and steady.  Tell you what.  Let's both dig into the biscuits and gravy together.  You set the pace and I'll do my best to keep up.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\nDan was challenged by Roger's suggestion.  Accustomed to leading he charged ahead to help the old man eat those biscuits hardly aware of the bloated gut bulging over his now tight pants.  Roger continued to eat methodically and slowly, pausing to stop and loosen his belt before continuing.  <br>\r\nDan shoveled the last bite and sighed contentedly.  Roger was still working on the biscuits.<br>\r\n\"You sure showed me.\"<br>\r\nDan grinned, pleased with himself and happy to have bested the old guy.  Without thinking he couldn't help massaging the hard ball of his stuffed belly.  <br>\r\nRoger was still only half way finished with the biscuits.  He smiled at the cocky young pup.  \"Tell you what.\" he said pushing his untouched pancakes over to Dan, \"You eat these while I finish.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm stuffed.\"  Dan said quickly.  He was almost in pain from the stuffing but, inspite of being fuller than he had ever been, he was driving with the desire to show off for Roger.<br>\r\n\"Let your belt out a notch.\"  Roger urged.  \"That should give you room.\"<br>\r\n\"It's already in the last notch.\"<br>\r\n\"Then unbuckle it and unbutton your pants.\"<br>\r\nMinutes later the two men sipped coffee while the waitress cleared away the dishes.  Roger was smiling while Dan was breathing heavily and looking dazed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With one hand Carter steered as he held on to his abs. He just hoped that it didn't do that while he was with Samantha. He couldn't believe how hungry he was! He had made sure to have his at home meal and he had almost another entire meal right after precisely to avoid being too hungry and looking like a hog in front of Samantha. It was almsot as if his belly had a mind of its own, when it knew it could get food it wanted more food. A lot of food if it was available.<br>\r\nwhen his stomach growled again, this time with Samantha in the car. She looked to him smiling and said,\"You hungry, baby? Don't worry, we'll get some food for my big man.\" She was always so sweet when she knew he was hungry, but he could never shake the feeling she was judging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled in to the parking lot of Ry Keba's, a small restaurant in the outskirts of town. Ry Keba's was a nice little restaurant that wasn't too expensive with a strange blend of french, chinese, spanish, and italian design but served classic all-american food, gourmet style.<br>\r\nIt was relatively quiet in the resaurant with only a few other patrons here and there. Something Dan suspected was written by Bach was playing in the background. The waiter soon arrived to take their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan denied his hunger and went for a relatively modest meal of 'Hama de Burg' which included two gourmet style hamburgers, a large amount of french fries, Coke to drink with refills, and he asked for a dessert of keylime pie once he was done. Oddly enough Samantha ordered the same thing, except with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat and ate while exchanging small talk. Dan quickly finished off both his burgers and most of his fries before Samantha even finished one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! These are so big! I won't be able to eat all of this!\" She said after finally finishing the first one. Dan's stomach growled in response</span></div></div>",

He reached down to loosen his belt a few extra notches, it had already begun to feel restricting. Three meals in one night, a fourth to go, along with dessert was pushing his stomach out pretty far. Even having eaten three meals prior Dan had little trouble finishing off Samantha's food and the two slices, big slices, of pie.<br>\r\nAfter paying the bill the two walked together.

In fact, it was because he had gained a lot of weight during summer but he didn't know it, he was oblivious of his weight gain. During all summer, he had worn sweatpants and nothing other than that so he didn't see the results of him always eating and never doing something physical. Right now, he was trying to put on his favorite pair of pants but they just didn't pass over his thighs and butt. After about fifteen minutes, he was sweating like crazy because he tried to jump to pull his pants up but there was nothing to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got up to go search a bigger pair of pants ans as he did that, he saw his reflection in the mirror. He was not the skinny boy he was before. His belly was all flabby and it was accompagnied by a pair of little love handles. His pecs were not hard like before: they were now sagging a little bit. Even his thighs and his butt looked way fleshier than he remembered. Jack had now a very surprised look on his face. He started taking his belly in his hands and he jiggled it a little, impressed and confused at the same time at how soft it was. In a hurry, he went in the bathroom and got the scale out. He went on it and he read the number 170. That was thirty pounds more than at the beginning of summer. He was astonished. He looked at his body again and really saw the damage of his weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went back in his chamber and took the largest pair of pants he owned. He put them on and he starts jumping to make them pass his thighs and his butt, making his belly wobble in the process. He finally puts them on and he tries to button them. He suceeds and now takes a t-shirt wich fits him, but the outline of his belly and man boobs are clearly visible and the t-shirt rolls up pretty often so he always need to put it back down. He then goes and remembers that he starts his school day with natation. He takes his bathing suit and puts it in his bag, hopping it will fit better than his pants.</span></div></div>",

Then he gave Jack a credit card so he could take care of emergency stuff.  When he got home at night, Jack's dad wasn't into making sure that the two guys got a balanced, healthy meal.  They would rummage the freezer or just order out pizza and top it all off with big dishes of ice cream.<br>\r\nJack's one restriction was that he couldn't have friends over when he was alone in the house.  it wasn't bad because he could still interact with Sam on the internet and even compete on-line.  <br>\r\nIt was boring though after the first day or so and Jack filled the time by taking advantage of the well stocked refrigerator. Without his mother to monitor, Jack let his appetite run wild.  He was a growing boy and his appetite was big enough to support his recent growth spurt.  With no constraints Jack indulged.  He adjusted the order to stock his favorites and gradually he discovered that those servings were just not big enough.  He was getting annoyed at waiting and he started cooking two at a time.  He developed a pattern of eating and gaming during the day and then followed it up with eating and watching TV with his Dad at night.  <br>\r\n Jack's Dad was enjoying all the time with Jack.  He felt that all their time together was good for their relationship.  The good life though was having consequences on his weight.  His pants were getting tight.  <br>\r\nIt was time for a decision.

My metabolism just doesn't burn it all off these days.  I've gained twenty pounds in the last two weeks.  At this rate, I'll be a blimp by the time your mother gets back.\"<br>\r\nJack was understanding to a point.  Yeah he could see that having to buy new clothes was a drag but what was the point of life if you couldn't enjoy youself.<br>\r\n\"It's ok, Dad.  We can still watch TV and play games.  But you gotta eat something.  Tell you what.  Don't go crazy and diet on me by not eating.  Just cut back and eat slow.  That way we will still be spending time together and sharing the same experience.  Maybe I'll even help you out and steal some of your food when you aren't looking.\"<br>\r\nDad laughed.  \"Skinny guy like you could probably eat for both of us and not get fat. Yeah, that will work for me.   It would be really strange for you to be enjoying food and me not eating.\"<br>\r\nJack and his Dad continued their nightly bachelor parties with Dad cutting back and Jack picking up the slack.  Dad hardly noticed because Jack would take food from Dad's plate as well as his own.  During the days, Jack was very lazy, sleeping late and lounging in front of the TV with generous amounts of food within reach.  Over time Jack noticed that his favorite jeans got tight.  He started to spend the day in his boxers and elastic waist shorts when he needed to go out.  Jack's Dad mellowed out and got used to the extra weight.  Both of them were oblivious to Jack's changes.  All that inactivity and food was starting to show on the lean Jack.<br>\r\nEven the elastic waist shorts were snug these days but Jack didn't seem to notice as he dressed to meet Sam for a gaming session.<br>\r\n\"Hey , fat guy. Long time no see.\"  Jack was happy to see his friend Sam.  It got kind of lonesome just bumming around the house all week.  It was good to finally see some friends on the weekend.<br>\r\n\"Hey yourself, stretch.\"  Sam replied giving his lean friend a long look.  Well maybe Jack wasn't as lean as Sam remembered.  He was looking a bit puffy in the face and Sam thought he could see a bulge under his oversized T-shirt.  Was Jack getting fat?  Sam had always been fat and when Jack and Sam were younger, they had been about the sam- pudgy little kids.  Jacks growth spurt had turned him into a beanpole and Sam's had made him downright fat.  Then Jack had started ribbing Sam about being fat.  Sam was ok with being fat but it got old when your best friend just wouldn't stop making comments and poking your belly.  As if being a cadaverous beanpole was ideal.  Still, Sam liked the idea that Jack was getting fat. Still, maybe he should keep quiet and let nature take it's course.

He'd adjusted to losing the anorexic look although in his head he was still the skinny boy.  He hadn't adjusted to being pudgy.  He was still in denial as his 28 inch jeans had been replaced with larger sizes and the 34's he was squeezing into created a soft muffin top which he'd taken to wearing loose shirts to cover.  <br>\r\nMeanwhile, pudgy Sam had been seriously dieting and training on the side.  He;d been firming his flabby body, losing fat and gaining muscle in his chest.  His clothes were fitting loosely these days making the pair more like twins to anyone seeing them together.  Still Jack thought of himself as the skinny boy he had been with Sam as his fat friend.<br>\r\n\"You eat it.\"  Sam shoved the last piece of pizza over to Jack.  Without thinking Jack grinned and stuffed it down.  Gradually Sam had eaten less at their get togethers and Jack had taken up the slack just as he had with his Dad.  Without realizing it Jack had become a serious chow hound while recognizing that reality.  And something seemed to have happened to Jack metabolism beecause once those pounds started sticking to his waist and butt they just kept accumulating.  Meanwhile Sam had become much more muscular and his fat was melting away so that he was beginning to look ripped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack belched and rubbed his belly.  He was still hungry. \"Man,\" he told Sam.  \"I could eat another pizza. How about you?\"<br>\r\nSam looked over at his fromerly skinny friend.  Over the past months Jack had fattened up seemingly without being aware of the change.  Over the same period Sam had gone from a 43 inch waist down to a 32 and his 46 inch chest had gone from flabby to firm.<br>\r\n\"Sure, fatboy, let's do it.\"  Sam called in to order a pizza.  He'd watch his newly fat friend chow down with satisfaction.<br>\r\nJack was thinking when he got back.  <br>\r\n\"Who are you calling fatboy, fatboy.\" he smirked poking Sam in the gut, or where he expected to find a gut under the baggy shirt Sam was wearing.  Instead of soft fat, his finger hit firm muscle.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" he called out. \"What happened to your belly?\"<br>\r\nSam took off his shirt and exposed his new muscle.<br>\r\n\"Been working out.\" he said. \"Not pigging out. Let's see your six pack.\"<br>\r\n\"Never had a six pack.\"  Jack stammered.  Then Sam wrestled Jack's shirt off to expose his fat belly.<br>\r\n\"Like I said, fatboy.\"  Sam was grinning, \"Who's the fatboy now?\"<br>\r\nSam strutted off proud of his new muscle to answer the door and returned with the pizza.<br>\r\n\"Now, eat up, fatboy.\"  <br>\r\nJack was stunned at this new reality.

He had given in to indulgence and now he was only holding on to his healty lifestyle and lean body by supreme effot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, on the other hand, had become the committed jock and with each day he got more defined.  He had leaned down at first so that Jack and Sam looked very similar after losing his pudge.  But as Jack maintained his weight, Sam began to build muscle.  His chest bulged with muscle and his abs became a well-defined six pack.  Now he'd begun to eat more because he was liking the muscle and wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had been happy in the old days when he was the skinny guy with a fat friend.  His world had turned upside when the tables turned and Sam got skinny while Jack got fat.  Even after Sam showed his friendship by helping Jack get skinny again, it didn't make things right- at least not in Jack's mind.  Nothing would be right until all was back as it had started.  He knew that he should want Sam to be happy but in his mind Sam had always been happy and if he had been fat and happy, there was nothing wrong in helping him to be fat and happy again.  He becan to think of ways to help Sam become the fat friend once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had helped Jack get skinny by making sure that he and Jack ate together.  Jack had lost his sense of moderation around food and only with Sam's leadership was he able to lose weight.  Jack had begun to supplement his meals with a gainer shake. high in protein to support muscle growth.  Jack decided that he would doctor the protein powder with carbs.  Sam didn't seem to notice the difference. Jack watched eagerly for the return of his fat friend.</span></div></div>",

Since he had slimmed down, built up his muscles and become a stud, Sam was a constant reminder to Jack that his days as the skinny guy were gone forever.  With Sam's help Jack had gone from fat to stocky and he knew that only a starvation diet would keep him there.  Although he was grateful to Sam for the help, what Jack really wanted was for Sam to be the fat friend once more.  And if Jack was destined to be fat, then Sam had to become fatter.  Now as the effects of changing his protein supplement to carbs were beginning to show, Jack wxpressed his admination for Sam's big (though sofstening chest) and ignoring the softness around his waist.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\"  Sam grinned.  \"The bulking is working but soon I'm going to have to get cut.\"<br>\r\n\"Plenty of time for that.\"  Jack answered.  \"Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\nSam, however, did worry.  He'd been unhappy at the fit of his workout clothes lately.  His chest and arms had bulked but there was a definite belly where he wanted a sixpack.  Transforming from a fat guy to a stud had been long and hard but what he thought was a permanent change just now was seeming to be another stage.  If he wasnt careful he'd become a pot bellied exjock and he wasn't ready for that. He began increasing his workouts and stopped taking the supplements.  He  became very conscious of his diet.<br>\r\nAll the while Jack watched with concern as Sam went from 15% body fat to 5%.  Even worse Sam was so focused on his training that Jack drifted away from his healthy ways.  Jack blubbered up while Sam got cut once more.  They both weighed 250 pounds but Sam was all muscle and Jack was soft and fat.</span></div></div>",

Ashamed at his loss of self control in eating and once fatter friend Sam, he did not know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked down to the kitchen to find a snack to forget about his problems but bumped into his dad, who had been rigorous on healthy eating ever since his pants started feeling tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jack, we need to talk.\"</i> Jack's father had a stern look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Lemme get this pint of ice cream first, I-\",</i> Jack got cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, Jack you need to watch what your eating.

His 40 inch sweat pants were so tight on him they started to slide down his hips and legs to find room for slimmer body parts. His medium shirt revealed a giant layer of pudge hanging over his waist, and his sides were starting to gain curves do to the love handles continually growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Son, you're delusional!\"</i> his dad stammered. <i>\"I was in a dark place too, but look at me now, I'm at the high school 30 inch waist that I dreamed to have for life!

He called up Sam to beg for help on losing weight again, calling him the best personal trainer ever and telling him how sorry he was calling him fatboy. (Jack merely wants to cheat again and rig all of Sam's meals to make him simply fatter than his own weight by comparison)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam agrees to help, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) does he simply help out as a sincere trainer to get Jack back to the glory days of 130 lbs and less?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) does he plan to turn the tables on Jack more by rigging all of his food and drinks with supplements that will make him fatter (after suspecting Jack was do so to him, hindering his own body to perfection)</span></div></div>",

No more rushing, no more school, not until September.  A few minutes later, he rolled out of bed, pulled on shorts and a t-shirt, and padded down the hallway to the kitchen, where his mother had left him breakfast:  sticky buns, sausage in the warming oven, yogurt and fruit salad.  Grabbing a pan, Carlos set about frying some eggs to go with it, as he stuffed chunks of sticky bun into his cheeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he been paying attention when he put on his shorts, he would have noticed that they were tighter than they had been last week, for the last day of school.  But Carlos is not paying attention to anything, except his appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, even for a sixteen year old male, is, well, 'generous'.  On the edge of 'enormous'. But, up until now, his metabolism has taken care of anything he cared to stuff in his mouth.  In fact, the arrival of male hormones a few years ago meant that he suddenly had nice muscles to go with his skinny frame and enormous appetite.  But....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Carlos has a car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo summer job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenerous parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA love of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, his hormones are no longer growing him \"upwards\".  Which means he may begin to grow \"outwards\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, none of this is on his mind as he eats a breakfast that would suit two, maybe three grown-up guys.  In fact, he's proud of how much he can eat - as soon as he's finished breakfast he's heading off to Maria's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere, in an hour or two, Maria's mother will make them lunch....lots of lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it won't be Maria eating most of it, no.  Carlos will.

Brett didn't appreciate the gesture while he was drunk but every morning he'd be happy about the little token of friendship since he rarely would have had a proper meal otherwise. At least not one he hadn't simply barfed back out.<br>\r\nThis night his roomate Andrew had left him nearly an entire pizza. He had a tendency to cook WAY too much food. In fact sometimes Brett couldn't finish it off. With Brett at a massive height and weight of over 6 feet and about 224 pounds of lean mass along with a great metabolism, that was a feat.<br>\r\nBrett finished off the brownies and the pizza before blacking out on the couch, the brownie plate still in hand.<br>\r\nThe next day.......</span></div></div>",

If you will please turn your attention now to the platters on the table you will see a presumptuous piling of pancakes, a full and newly bought bottle of PURE maple syrup, along with a benevolently given mound of butter.\"<br>\r\nFor most people those declarations would be pure exaggeration. With Andrew, however, they became understatements. On top of the table was at least fifty pancakes, ten sticks of butter, and the bottle of pure maple syrup. Andrew had expressed his hatred of common syrup and would often follow up on how good pure syrup is and a lament of how expensive it is.<br>\r\n\"Now I've already eaten so this is all for you.\" Andrew continued,\"So enjoy! I need to get to class, busy, busy, busy.\"<br>\r\nAndrew left the dorm room without another word to attend the first of his many classes before Brett could even begin to protest. Brett knew that, as always, Andrew expected him to eat most, if not all, of the food. It had been like that every day. Almost every meal too, ever since the first offer by Andrew to cook. Andrew had slowly begun to cook more and more as he realized that Brett could eat more. Recently it had become a chore for Brett to eat so much despite his size. However since he was in football and Brett was in peak condition he ate. Most of it, if not all would become muscle and besides the food was better than anything else he had ever eaten he reasoned.<br>\r\nBrett put several of the huge pancakes a plate lathered them generously with the insane amount of butter and covered them with a decent amount of syrup.....</span></div></div>",

Without a shirt on, and with his pants restriction, Brett was able to fully enjoy his state of gluttony, the product of which was on display.<br>\r\nThe elastic of Brett's underwear was stretched taught around his bloated stomach. The whole of it gave Brett the look of being pregnant. As Brett finished off the last pancake with relative ease, though it still hurt just a little, he let out a tremendous belch. Such massive meals, or 'feeds' as Andrew said having a slight accent from his mother who was born in New Zealand, were everyday routine at this point. Andrew had started it all off just by offering to cook once in a while. That once in a while quickly became every day and now almost every meal.<br>\r\nNaturally Brett knew that such habits were not healthy, but the food was just too good and besides Andrew liked cooking for him, he couldn't deny him that could he? Instead of feeling guilt over such gluttonous behavior Brett actually felt a twisted manly pride at being able to consume such insane proportions and stay fit. Brett wasn't sure that he wouldn't just drop football and his workouts all-together, though, if it came to a decision between it and Andrew's cooking. Of course that would never happen.

A huge size that is, each seemed to be at least ten inches across. Besides that Brett counted the pancakes. It came out to be fifty-two of the monstrous, fluffy, delicious, and fattening pancakes.<br>\r\nNevertheless Brett felt like he owed it to Andrew to eat as much as he could. He actually did a good job of it. He managed to eat about forty-three of the huge pancakes. Each one lathered in butter and coated with that amazingly tasty pure syrup that Andrew raved about.<br>\r\nWith each pancake that disappeared one by one into the gaping maw that Brett's mouth became his stomach grew. Brett's shear size made the difference slight, but a deiference there was. Slowly Brett's pants grew tighter, which he always bought tight to show how toned his muscles were. On the twelfth pancake he had to unbutton them, he promptly followed by taking them off completely since they were the pair he had worn the night before. His belly continued to grow poking out from under his shirt, which he took off on the twentieth. His bare belly broadened, making the thick trail of hair leading down his navel appear thin. Soon his underwear became stretched to its limit as Brett's massive, and rapidly growing due to his new feedings from Andrew, appetite took pancake after pancake along with a large amount of orange juice and water. Before Brett maxed out, feeling a bit sick and in pain from the bloat, he even took off his extra-durable boxers, not wanting to push them too far.<br>\r\nBrett sat there in the apartment at the table naked for nearly twenty minutes taking in labored breathes and rubbing his painfully swollen paunch. His skin was stretched taut over its hard, basketball-like contour. Still Brett felt a bit disappointed in himself for not being able to eat all of the pancakes. They were a gift (as Brett saw it) from Andrew and they were absolutely fantastic. It was a shame he couldn't fully appreciate it and eat them all. Once Brett's body broke down the components in his belly and the swelling decreased enough that it wasn't painful he got up and went to the bathroom for some much needed relief. Afterwords Brett took a shower to clean off all the syrup that was sticking to his hands and all over his belly from being rubbed. By the time he finished his huge frame had taken away most of the swelling though he still felt stuffed. He put on a fresh pair of clothes, though he couldn't quite button his size 32 jeans yet.<br>\r\nwhile waiting for his body to take down the swelling enough that he could fit his stomach into his tight pants his sat on the couch and admired his muscles. He knew that if it weren't for his muscles and his fast metabolism provided by them, that he would still be quite bloated and that all the food Andrew fed him would have probably put  quite a bit of heft to his frame. As it was Brett thought that he noticed a slight increase in the thickness of his skin. He obsessed about his fitness. His face looked as if all fat had been burned away and his huge ripped arms and strong pecs along with his toned, powerful legs were a tribute to his persistent dedication to fitness. Maybe if he didn't spend so much time eating and being a bit bloated he would notice that his abs were beginning to fade.......</span></div></div>",

That meant an entire day of booze, food and partying to anyone's content. Brett planned on doing just that.<br>\r\neverything and everything you could think of at a college party was there on site just about a quarter of a mile off campus which was in the middle of the countryside.<br>\r\nPeople were driving rented fourwheelers and dirtbikes around the huge site, large enough to hold even the infamous Ozzfest.

There wre hunfreds of activities, rock-climbing, driving, and things most people would never think of. all paid for by the collected funds of the students.

It was as if the guy had no personal needs. Whenever he saw him he was helping somebody. Tutoring, working in soup kitchens, cleaning up the classroom so the janitors didn't have so much trouble, he was obsessed with being nice.

What he had expected, maybe even have secretly hoped for, was an outcry against piling on the pounds and for Andrew to have talked him out of bulking and just telling him to take it slow and healthy.  With a sigh Brett heaved himself to his feet and headed for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom, as shiny porcelain white as it had been the first day, was nothing spectacular. A toilet, shower-tub, and washbasin with a complementing mirror made the only decorations in the otherwise plain white room. Even the tiling was white. At least it was big enough that Brett could maneuver easily.Before weighing himself Brett took care of more natural functions that had been waiting several hours. He washed his hands quickly and air-dried them by waving them around. After pulling out the scales from behind the sink Brett stripped down to his boxers to have the most accurate reading of his weight. Before weighing himself he made a mental note that when he weighed himself right before football practice started he had still been at 224, and that had been only three weeks ago. Taking a final sigh Brett stepped onto the digital platform and immediately the numbers went rocketing up and stopped just as suddenly as they had began at.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tBrett was a little disappointed when the scale read out at 224. He had been diligently training and pushing himself to the limits at practice and yet here was evidence that he still hadn't improved. He had already been in peak fitness so he couldn't take excuse saying he had just gotten more toned. Not even a single pound gained  At least he was still in shape though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking in the mirror Brett took comfort and confidence in his hard tone. Eying his body up and down he found nary a trace of fat on his frame. That would probably change soon, it would have to change soon. If Brett's bulking would be any use to the team, and therefore qualify him to not get kicked off, it would have to be soon. The coach knew he was a great player for a freshman but once it came around to sophomore year he would just be average and beyond that he would be more of a handicap. That was why the coach pushed even the best players, anyone who would not improve was given the allegorical boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDespite all the logic Brett found himself reluctant to bulk. He did not wish to part with his sculpted abs, he wanted to be able to show rippling muscles perfectly and flawlessly. Brett wanted everything on him to stay the same from his chiseled chin to the thickness of his toes and for his perfect pecs to stay erect and not to sag with fat. He sighed again hoping he would keep most of his figure but at the speed he needed to bulk it would probably be impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tResigned to his fate he went back to the kitchen where he knew Andrew would be cooking. Despite his reluctance he was horribly hungry, he hadn't eaten since lunch and that now seemed so long ago. Also despite his expectations he was not prepared for the plethora of scents that assailed him when he opened the door. In the kitchen Andrew had all four spots on the stove occupied by skillet, pot, pan, and kettle. Two cutting boards were covered in chopped up vegetables, it seemed that something was in the deep frier, and to top it all off Andrew was putting something in the oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Just sit down at the table Brett.\" Andrew said without turning around. \"I won't keep you waiting long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAstonished by all Andrew had managed to accomplish while he had been in the bathroom weighing himself, Brett went to the table and sat down in one of the oak chairs without a word of protest or argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There are nuts in the bowl to tide you over a few minutes.\" Andrew's voice came lofting in from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRealizing that Andrew was already preparing a massive amount of food Brett found the idea of something to 'tide him over' ridiculous and yet he ofund that the nuts came to hand rather readily and into his mouth even more so. Quicker than Brett realized he was looking regretfully into the bottom of the bowl hoping Andrew would bring something in soon. Over the span of the next few minutes Andrew began toting a variety of platters that Brett couldn't even guess what half of them were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"For a first night this will make an excellent start. I'm assuming you had another one of you tiny lunches and have been starving yourself ever since.\" Andrew rolled his eyes. Brett was bothered by the accuracy of the statement. \"Anyways this should make up the difference in how much you should have eaten throughout the day. Just normal meals mind you, we'll start boosting calories tomorrow. In the meantime I'll go do some research into dietary planning and go to the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBrett was amazed at the proportions of food in front of him.  Was his lunch really so small to call for this? Upon reflection Brett believed perhaps it was so. Considering his size and the fact that at lunch he ate less than most that were fifty pounds his inferior. Turning to say something to Andrew he was surprised to find that he had already left. A brief thought asked what the world would be like if everyone was as productive as Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Brett turned to the mammoth meal he finally realized for the first time that he hadn't bothered to redress after weighing himself. It was for the best as his tight-fitting clothes (chosen to show off his muscles) would only constrict him and serve as a reminder that he would need a new wardrobe soon enough. Setting his legs apart Brett picked up his fork and dug into the food lain before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough Brett found that he wasn't starving anymore. A few minutes later he found that he wasn't even that hungry. As Brett reached for the third dish he concluded that he was nearly full and Andrew had prepared five. Slowing down he found that by savoring the flavor of each mouthful it seemed that there was always enough room for another bite. Halfway through the platter Brett rubbed his belly absentmindedly. It was already notably bigger than normal making the hair seem slightly more spread out.It almost tickled him to feel his own hand gliding across its expanse. Ever so slowly and yet all too soon the third and then fourth dishes were clered from the table. brett was now feeling thoroughly stuffed and tired from the food but he pulled the final plate towards him..It was piled high with another strange dish that Brett could not name though it smelt wondrous even after all the time it had waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRaising the fork once more Brett started on the overly generous piling before him. It tasted even better than it smelled which spurred him on raising his fork again and again. Some small part of Brett wondered if you could die from overeating.at a single sitting. as it was the skin on Brett's stomach was painfully stretched taut and made a sharp contrast to the rest of his figure. through the dullness of his food high Brett felt a stitch in his side that was growing ever stronger. Brett tried to massage the pain away with one hand while he laboriously worked the other into the food and back to his mouth. He felt huge and a quick glance down confirmed that his bloated paunch hid the band of his boxer's from his sight, which by his senses had benn pushed down by his filling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt seemed hours had passed when Brett finally finished the fifth plate after starting the first and indeed it had been. Brett's breathing was feeling shallow and slightly forced as the meal he had just consumed pushed in every direction against his body. The only thought that passed through his mind was,'I wonder how much weight these chairs can hold,' before he passed out with his head on the table.</span></div></div>",

He remembered one project in particular that could help Brett with his weight gain. In light of the deficiency of efficiency in the human digestion and food products, Andrew had made an attempt in crating a hundred percent efficient dietary supplement. This meant a substance that humans would actively digest and use the entire sum thereof rather than letting any become unused refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a pale and aged manila folder, Andrew finally found what remained of the project. He hesitated for a brief second before opening it. it wasn't for his own good but for Brett's after all. Brett could decide whether he wanted to use it or not. Andrew quickly scanned through to check the ingredients and make sure he remembered everything listed.  The ingredients were actually very simple, to the point that it was downright ludicrous. Then again, addition was simple and yet a fundamental necessity to mathematics. Why could a similar principal not be applied to his works?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew would make sure that he would get the components when he went to the store. Though it would be a moot point if Brett decided not to take it. Andrew hoped he would but he would naturally tell Brett of the bad side of it before he chose, probably at least. Before he put the folder down read the bottom where he wrote down the results of his testing on various animals which were very similar to humans saying.............</span></div></div>",

Admittedly he had been looking at it all morning, it bothered him, the soft lump was so foriegn and cushy, supressing these thoughts he looked back up just as Andrew yelled something about being back later, or at least thats what Brett assumed. He wondered what the diet included thinking back to earlier with all of Andrew's caution, was it really necessary? His stomach growled loudly, interrupting his thoughts. How was that even possible? Brett asked himself, he had just scarfed down two oversized bowls of icecream. Oh well, guess I should get used to it he said, opening the freezer and taking out the rest of it and grabbing a big spoon, before lumbering over to the couch and sprawling out, turning on the television, and changing the station from Andrew's cooking shows, to football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took Andrew half the time he said it would to return with the ingredients for the diet, smirking as he passed sleeping Brett, who had eaten all of the icecream and left the container, empty, with the spoon still inside to prove it. Andrew continued into the kitchen, but then came back out to retrieve Brett's dish. Kneeling beside the couch he carefully slipped the icecream from beside the couch and over- but he was cut off, Brett's huge arm reached out and pulled Andrew next to him on the couch. Andrew was wary of this, he wasn't sure of Brett's orientation, but Brett hadn't really dated anyone and Andrew could tell easily he was starving for attention, and in an unconcious state would pull Andrew in and spoon him like a teddy bear. Andrew didn't enjoy this very much, but he could do little aginst Brett's strength. Andrew gave Brett some time to drift back to sleep before slipping out of his grasp and darting back into the kitchen, without the dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett woke up to the sizzling and popping of something cooking on the stove. How long was I out? He thought to himself, all he remembered was finishing the tub of icecream, feeling guilty, and then falling asleep to the drowned out voices on the television. He knew he would have to sit for a little bit, due to the fact that he had morning-wood and he was still in the same boxers he had been wearing yesterday. I need to change, Brett thought to himself, eyeing the door to his bedroom longingly. He waited and relaxed for a couple of minutes and then proceeded to grumbling and moved toward his room before lookinging at himself in the mirror, he hadn't shaved and his stubble was beginning to form a beard. His muscles looked the same, placed perfectly on his body as always.  His greenish eyes stared back at him worriedly through the mirror, and he knew why. It was because, if at all possible, the bulge on his stomach seemed larger, it had now taken over two off his abs, leaving four barely noticable traces of what used to be his amazing six-pack. Brett placed a hand over the buldge, squeezing and poking the alien addition to his frame, he changed into new boxers, and some jeans he had bought up a sized just in case he ever needed them, and they were brand new, never used until now. Brett continued to stare at the mirror, unable to get over his new shape, and that it would only get worse, ugh, Brett thought to himself. He decided not to wear a shirt, because it felt good and Andrew didn't mind. His stomach growled again announcing to Brett that he needed to eat again. Brett sighed and walked out of his room to see what smelled so good that Andrew was cooking.</span></div></div>",

He put it on the counter while he looked for chocolate syrup.  Soon he transferred the ice cream to a mixing bowl and poured the jar of syrup over the top.  Back to the table he sat down and shoveled the sundae down his throat enjoying the smooth creaminess as it flowed down his throat and filled his gut.  His skintight clothes were showing distress and he unfastened his belt and unbuttoned his khakis.  <br>\r\nWhen he got up, the pants slipped down around his ankles and he kicked them off.<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" he thought cupping th unfamiliar bulge pushing down his boxers and stressing his muscle shirt.

This showed that Brett was all too willing to adopt new habits. The fact that he seemed to have a monstrous talent for recovering from binge eating was only icing on the cake. Instead of stopping Brett, Andrew left the room to finish his other morning obligations. Since it was Saturday he could afford to let Brett have an extended breakfast before his real meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time Andrew walked in Brett was leaning against the counter. Still in nothing but his boxers, Brett stood relaxed with one hand over his bulging stomach. He was guessing but Andrew guessed Brett had eaten the mass equivalent of another one, maybe two, of his over sized sundaes. Brett's physique was rock hard as ever across his muscled frame but his stomach pushed out forming a small mound which was temporary, though not for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for breakfast yet?\" Andrew asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I just ate.\" Brett asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew's smile broadened,\"Admittedly I'm surprised eating so ravenously so soon after last night's binge. It seemed to me that you had gone to your limit. Your recovery surprises me. You didn't wake up thinking it was all a dream did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett shifted uncomfortably, Andrew always was a bit too accurate. So it wasn't a dream, and he really did eat what must have been thousands of calories the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go clean up? It should give you time to process your snack while I make your real breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett didn't particularly like the way Andrew emphasized real and snack. Nevertheless he decided to take his roommate's advice and headed to the shower. Andrew watched him leave and took the opportunity to size him up. Brett's frame was comparable to that which was envied and hailed by the old time greek gods of myth. Tall and supremely muscled Brett had an approximate thirty-two waist normally and by the measurement taken the previous night while he was asleep, he had tried to wake him first but to no avail, up to thirty-nine at the roundest point while engorged. Noting the cut and pattern of both his boxers and beater, both of which had an almost comical way of his bloated belly, Andrew made a final note in his shopping list. With the parameters as such, it would be easy.</span></div></div>",

Tall, blonde, and incredibly sexy, Nate not only was his high school's soccer star, but he was also a 4.0 student.  Now that he had graduated, he shifted through the multitude of college acceptance letters piled on his bedside table.  However would he choose, he thought.  Quickly tiring of that daunting task, he placed his hands behind his head and lounged back on his bed, taking a moment to reminisce about all the wonderful high school memories he was leaving behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his stomach growled ferociously.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNate had forgotten that he\u2019d woken up later than usual, enjoying his summer break, and he realized the last thing he had to eat was some popcorn during a move late last night.  Getting up from his bed, Nate caught his reflection in the floor length mirror secured to the back of his bedroom door.  Always the narcissist, Nate admired his perfectly proportioned features and brilliant white smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot more than a minute later, his belly groaned again, reminding him of his original task.  Nevertheless, his stomach was something to behold, so he decided to make sure his summer slacking wasn\u2019t getting the best of him.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nLifting the hem of his shirt to just below his carved pecs, six clearly pronounced cobble stones surrounded by deep valleys came into view, flanked generously by two sharply ridged oblique muscles that pointed down into a perfect \u201cV\u201d, disappearing into the elastic band of his white Calvin Klein underwear.  His lower set of abs, below his navel, were also visible, separated by a faint line, giving him the sought after eight pack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his abs and slowly traced the further defined contours of the muscles, admiring all of the hard work he had put into developing his rock hard stomach.  Then, without warning, his mind flashed to an image of his tan stomach all bloated, his six pack stretched out over the curve, and in a flash the image was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate blinked, confused, but noticed he was aroused.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe turned sideways and placed his hand on top of his abs.  Slowly, sucking in as much air as possible, he pushed the unyielding wall of his washboard stomach as far out as possible, giving him the appearance of being pregnant or drinking too much beer.  He allowed his hand to follow the curve, starting from just below his chiseled chest and swooping down until he reached the waist of his jeans, which he had pulled down low enough to allow for the materialized girth.  He noticed the ridges of his abs were still visible despite the puffed out appearance, and the hem of his shirt had no trouble staying put as it rested on the ledge created by his distended gut.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNo longer able to hold his breath, he laughed, forcing his fatless abs back to the surface, but he wondered just how much he would have to eat in order to make them disappear, temporarily, at least.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After scanning the coupon flyer he received in the mail, Nate decided to order the special:  Two extra-large, one-topping pizzas and a 2-liter bottle of Coke for only fifteen bucks.  He took a double take at the price before placing his order.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be about thirty minutes for delivery, sir.\u201d The friendly voice on the phone said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Nate responded and hung up the phone.  He busied himself listening to music and lifting a set of twenty pound dumbbells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it there was a knock at his front door.  Excitedly, Nate raced down the stairs to pay for his food.  When he opened the door Nate was greeted by an extremely good-looking, buff young man.  Nate noticed how his gleaming, white smile stood out prominently against his flawless, tan skin and how his bulging biceps tugged at the sleeves of his form-fitting polo.   Although Nate dated girls, he was secretly gay.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smiling pizza delivery boy handed Nate the pizza and soda.  \u201cThat\u2019ll be fifteen dollars, sir.\u201d He said, as cheerful as ever.  Nate handed him the money plus a five dollar tip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I know you from somewhere?\u201d Nate said with a slightly confused look on his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza delivery boy hesitated, but maintained his smile.  \u201cI\u2019m Brett Patterson.  I graduated with you.  I know we don\u2019t know each other well, but I\u2026\u201d  Brett stopped, embarrassed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Nate demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett stuttered.  \u201cI-I really like you, and I\u2019m actually off work right now.  I told my manager I didn\u2019t mind delivering your pizza for you.  I already paid for it.\u201d  He said, handing Nate\u2019s money back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate was shocked, but he also found Brett to be very attractive.  \u201cDo you want to come in?\u201d Nate asked with slightly seductive eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love to!\u201d Brett shouted, almost too eagerly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate invited Brett into the living room to watch some TV.  They both enjoyed the freshly made pizza, still piping hot, although Nate seemed to be devouring the slices a bit more ravenously then Brett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHungry?\u201d Brett asked, staring at Nate mid-bite.  Nate had managed to finish off a whole pizza himself, minus the few slices Brett had eaten, and had started on the second one.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019m starved!\u201d Nate said with his mouth full, taking a swig of the room temperature Coke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even twenty minutes later and the only evidence of pizza that remained were the two empty boxes.  Nate leaned back against the sofa cushions, one hand on either side of his visibly full belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ate way too much.\u201d  Nate said, his shirt stretched as taut over his belly as it was over his firm pecs, and his jeans pulled down to relieve the pressure on his stomach.  Running one hand over his midsection, he was surprised at how incredibly stuffed it felt.  He struggled to stand up, but once on his feet he rolled up his shirt to examine the damage.  His tan belly looked cartoonishly round sticking straight out from his otherwise sculpted frame.  Looking down, he frowned when the structure of his rock hard stomach was still fairly visible, even un-flexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett tried not to stare.  He was amazed at how Nate\u2019s striated abs refused to surrender and attempted to hold back the inhuman amount of food he had just ingested.  He desperately wanted to give Nate a belly rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn!\u201d Nate yelled, sounding disappointed.  He was standing there with his shirt rolled up to his chest, scrutinizing the now bloated appearance of his once washboard stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Brett asked, still trying to act natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I had challenged myself earlier to see what it would take to make my abs temporarily disappear, and I thought by eating as much as I did I would be successful, but as you can see\u2026\u201d Nate proceeded to count each individual abdominal muscle.  \u201cThe only luck I had was diminishing the look of my eight-pack, I guess.\u201d  Nate said as he pointed at the completely smooth plane of skin below his navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Brett responded, trying to think of how to phrase his next question.  \u201cIs there any particular reason why you want to do that?\u201d Brett asked trying to mask the excitement in his voice as fattening up a jock was his ultimate fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate thought, then answered with an adorable half-smile.  \u201cI never really thought too much about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett took a deep breath, making sure to keep his tone level.  \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we go get some dessert and see if we can say bye-bye to those perfect abs of yours?\u201d Brett suggested and gave Nate\u2019s swollen middle a poke, astonished by the contrast of its spherical shape yet unyielding, although blurred, abdominal definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiled even bigger and rolled his shirt back over his exposed midsection.  The fabric hugged the curve of his newly acquired girth and to Brett\u2019s delight left about an inch of tan muscle belly visible.  Nate didn\u2019t seem to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Nate started to say\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dave wore cargo shorts and an open button-up over a T-shirt today, rather generic but acceptable clothes for some one who knew so much about the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Selina.\" David smiled, always happy to see her. She was two years younger but about a million years wiser, at least in the eyes of Dave. They met at a Starbucks last year, and got into a conversation about the novel Enders Game. While Dave saw it as an allegory for the horrors of war, Selina viewed it as a misogynistic piece of rubbish that worshiped Hitler. They had been dating ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you.\" She said with a wry smile, \"So, I was thinking Itallian?\" She said, linking her tiny arm in his. She always was the forceful one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itallian? I dunno...I kinda had a big dinner last night...And they say you should never have two big meals in two days.\" David said, which was partly true, namely the part about him having a big dinner last night. Two brewskis and a frozen meal, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, one, nooooo one on Earth says that. Awww, can't Mr. Manly Man eat more than two big meals? You're never gonna survive Thanksgiving at my house at this rate!\" Selina giggled, poking his hard stomach. This was going to be the big year, after all, meeting the parents and the supposed \"monsters\" that were three older brothers to Selina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can too!\" Dave protested, dropping the know-it-all act for a minute. He hated it when she challenged his manliness like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then prove it.\" She giggled again, pointing her thumb at the restraunt they stood in front of. Bella Dolla Itallian Bistro. To assert himself, he opened the door for her and followed her in, happily taking a seat near the back. Flirtations were had and light conversation sang, until the waiter came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you?\" the man in about his 30s that stood about Dave's height with a little paunch and spectacles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" Dave stammered, blushing as Selina seemed to give him a <i>look{/} and a smirk to match. He looked down at the menu again. Lets see...Stick with what you know and get the light salad, or prove Selina wrong with the Tour of Italy...</i></span></div></div>",

He hadn't been planning to eat just yet, but when Dremiel invited you to something, it was usually worth doing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got something I want to talk over with you,\" Dremiel added, fairly bouncing along beside David.  Dremiel's enthusiasm was contagious, and he was regularly coming up with ideas to make money, or improve the wrestling team, or just get better marks - and the thing was, nearly all of them worked!  So David was always ready to listen to Dremiel's ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go in here,\" Dremiel said, nearly pushing David into the Garden View buffet.  Ordinarily, David would not take being pushed around, but Dremiel was something special - while David was just a middleweight wrestler, with 188 solid pounds on his 5'11\" frame, Dremiel was the biggest of the big - a full superheavyweight, 260 pounds over 6'1\", and solid.  He also had a solid, not to say massive, appetite, and David was not surprised that they'd ended up in a buffet.  Dremiel had always seemed able to eat and eat and always stay in weight, while David sometimes had to watch his weight before competitions.  Now, though, with the wrestling season over, and graduation coming up, David was not worrying about calories.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wrestling studs loaded up their plates, then sat down.

He did everything possible to get the attention of the salesmen and their manager so he dressed sharp, dark suit, tasteful tie, polished shoes and he tried to impress the customers with the service he provided, hoping that the word would get back to management.  So far, he was  just one of the pack, maybe one of the better looking guys in the pack with his dark wavy hair, cornflower blue eyes and chiseled jawbones, but he continued to hope that his chance was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he plugged through each boring day, it was hard for him to remain positive and confident that he would get noticed and offered the sales training job he wanted. Still he worked hard, sucked up and looked sharp during the days and kept himself in good shape with heavy gym workouts and running during his evenings and weekends.  He was careful about his eating, balancing his proteins and carbs and avoiding fats to keep his 6 foot 2 inch body at a trim, muscular 185 pounds.  His 42 long suits needed tailoring to fit his 32 inch waist but showed off his broad shoulders and lean midsection.  He didn't have time for a girl friend, at least no until he got his promotion.  He only had time to focus on making sure that he would be the obvious choice for the nest sales training position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was harder and harder to keep motivated and hopeful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one night after a particularly heavy workout while he was eating his tasteless chicken breast and dry baked potato, the phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave?\" said the voice on the other end of the call.  \"I hope I am not interrupting anythig.\" </span></div></div>",

He wouldn't have believed that his old friend Brad could pack away that much food.  Then when they hit a baseball game, he watched Brad put away more.  Brad dropped Dave off at his apartment near midnight.  Dave was staggering from the rounds of beer at their last food stop.<br>\r\n\"This was fun, old buddy.\" Brad slapped Dave on the back with a meaty palm then drew him into a hug that pushed Brads hard meaty belly hard into Daves abs. \"We have to do this again, next time I get to town.  I intend to get back more often and maybe I can help you find a better job.\"<br>\r\nDave had confided to Brad that his job seemed to be going nowhere.  He was just putting in time while he looked for something better.  Now he was embarrassed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monday's work was just as boring as usual, but Dave began to notice some things as he walked through the office. He'd always been keeping an eye on the people he knew he needed to impress. He tried to strike up a conversation here and there, make sure that they knew his name, and how he was doing. But today he noticed something he hadn't before. It must have been Brad's sudden belly that caused him to notice the bellies of his bosses. Four men, four of the five men on the promotions board, to be exact, were standing in the break room, and suddenly Dave noticed all of their bellies, which they were currently feeding with donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave walked into the break room, he began to overhear their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...best steaks in town.\"<br>\r\n\"I guess they have a new chef, named Maurice. Did wonders with the place after a consulting firm came through and gave him a hand.\"<br>\r\n\"That's great!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, only now it's impossible to get a reservation. It's a two-month waiting list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave got excited. It couldn't be a coincidence. He was sure they were talking about the same restaurant that Brad had taken them to. He hurried back to his desk and called Brad, who was happy to oblige with the favor. Before he knew it, he had a table -- tonight -- for five at the restaurant. He offered to take the promotions board with him. They were surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd love to! We didn't figure you for the gourmet food type!\" said one.<br>\r\n\"You don't look like you have the figure for it,\" laughed the largest one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was ecstatic. This would be a whole dinner's worth of alone time with almost everyone involved in his promotion. He wanted to make sure everything would be perfect. When Dave arrived at the restaurant, he wondered what exactly Brad had asked Maurice for. They were personally greeted by the chef, and told that anything on the menu would be theirs, on the house. Dave was surprised and overjoyed, especially when he saw the reactions of the board members. As they pulled up their menus and conversation began again, Dave got nervous over the topic. They seemed to chime in together a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna order a salad, are you Dave?\"<br>\r\nYou're not one of those guys who goes to the finest steakhouse in town and just orders a salad or dry chicken. Tell me you're not one of those guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave smiled and tried to make a laugh that wasn't forced. \"Of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave wanted to prove this, so he ordered two fried appetizers, a large steak, and a side of mashed potatoes. He wasn't sure what he would do with all that food, but he wasn't planning that far ahead yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChef Maurice sent up a special bottle of wine to go with their dinners, and everyone had a glass. Dave was being careful not to end up drunk in front of everyone, but the wine was delicious. When the appetizers came, calimari and puff pastries, Dave chowed down. He had hoped that the board members might share, but it seems they had all ordered their own appetizers as well. To his own surprise, Dave finished all of both of his appetizers. He continued drinking the wine, and by the time dinner came, had a pleasant numbness throughout his stomach. The steak was delicious. Juicy and fatty, and Dave didn't bother to trim this time. Every bite was succulent and just led him to another, until he realized he had once again cleaned his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation through the meal went extraordinarily well. Even though Dave drank more wine than he would have intended, the board members drank even more than he did. Everyone was greatly enjoying themselves. Work never came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't order dessert, but Maurice apparently had it sent out anyway. It was a rich, thick slice of dark and double chocolate cake for everyone. Dave didn't know where he found the strength or space for it, but he ate all of his slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him, the board members patted their stuffed bellies that stuck out. To fit in, Dave joined in and found himself enjoying the sensation. The wine had numbed his stomach feeling on the inside, but his belly felt unique on the outside. It was hard and tight, and Dave rubbed it self-consciously for a minute before coming to his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men all bid each other farewell and went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dave arrived home, he...</span></div></div>",

The board members stopped at his desk throughout the day, each one thanking him profoundly for the meal and inviting him to others. By 10:00 the rest of his week was booked by dinner with board members. The dinners are thankfully planned at less expensive restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach night, a board member took him to lunch or dinner, and Dave felt the pressure to match them. He began to order appetizers and full course meals where he usually ordered a salad with grilled chicken. The constant dinners out also cut into his workout time.

He was beginning to think that maybe there was a chance for him to break into the higher corporate circles with his company.  It was funny that when those big shots were at the dinner table, work never came up.  To his surprise,  he was enjoying the eating.  He had persuaded himself that those fancy dishes were just exercises for chefs to show off but those rich tastes were growing on him.  The food tasted good and Dave found that he could match his new buddies forkful by forkful.  Still, Dave was not getting to the gym with his new social life and though so far this new eating didn't seem to be affecting his waistline, none of the board members were skinny.  If he kept up this new lifestyle, he would get fat.  Dave wasn't ready for that but did he want to go back to being a nobody.  What a choice for a guy that was as proud of his toned body as Dave.  He really wanted to go back to his normal diet but how could he get his life back in control without losing his new friends and the opportunities for promotion that might come?<br>\r\nFortunately, Dave had vacation and so he scheduled a week.  This gave him an excuse for skipping the dinners.  He told the board members that he would be gone even though he planned to stay at home and schedule some heavy workouts.  He set up the appointments with a fitness trainer at the gym.  He was planning two a day workouts.  He stocked the kitchen with lots of greens and lean chicken.  This week was going to turn around all the bad habits of the recent past.  Monday, he was at the gym at 9:00 ready for his first workout.  <br>\r\n\"Are you Dave?\" As Dave entered the gym, the man behind the counter called to him.<br>\r\n\"That's me.\" Dave answered walking up to the counter.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Ivan, your trainer for this week.  Put your gear up and meet me in the weight room.  I think we can take care of your problem.\"<br>\r\nIvan's eyes rested on Dave's midsection causing Dave to furtively look at his lean waist - well maybe it wasn't so lean anymore.  Dave could see a definite bulge which he hadn't noticed before.<br>\r\n\"Good to meet you Ivan.\" Dave answered shaking the trainer's hand.\"See you in a minute.\"<br>\r\nDave rushed off to the dressing room sucking in his gut.  Dave was thinking that he was just maintaining his well tuned body but now he was already finding that he needed hep getting back.  He hoped that Ivan was going to be the right choice.  He looked muscular and toned but <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe Ivan wasn't the trainer that Dave needed.  Well he would think about it later.  Dave changed into his workout gear, thankful that his shirt was oversized enough to hide his belly.  Feeling better, Dave walked to the weight room and found Ivan.<br>\r\n\"Just so you know.\" Ivan greeted him, \"I don't usually have this belly.\"  Ivan smiled at Dave and rubbed the monster fondly.  \"It's just the result of a bulking up program for my body building. In a few months when I get back to top condition, I will look like this.\"  Ivan pointed to a wall poster with a well-muscles Ivan posing with a trophy.  \"Only with even more muscle.\"<br>\r\n\"Pretty impressive.\" Dave was thinking.  He had always been proud of his body but it had never been that muscular.  He never thought he had the genetics for big muscles.<br>\r\n\"You have the right genes for building muscles.\" Dave commented.  \"I don't.\"<br>\r\n\"Not everybody wants the body builder muscles.  You have a good build without all that bulk.  Me, I just need to be big.\"<br>\r\nIvan took Dave through a good workout, pushing him hard.  Dave felt exhausted.<br>\r\n\"Good job, Dave,\" Ivan told him.  You check back with me tomorrow morning and check in with Ryan this afternoon for aerobics. Between the two of us that belly doesn't stand a chance.  Now get something to eat and relax.  See you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now he was ready to take it easy this afternoon because he had earned it.  He would get some lunch and take it easy.  But what should it be.  Somehow Dave just wasn't drawn to another salad and chicken breast back at the apartment.  The way Ivan was working him, he could eat like a hog and still slim down.  Then he remembered that Brad had given him a card from another of his clients.  This was a sports bar and it wasn't too far from the gym.  He fumbled in his wallet and found the card.  There it was. Touchdown was the name it it was over on main street.  The name Lou was written on the back.  Why not try it.<br>\r\nTouchdown was nothing special to look at but inside it had several big screens showing various sports.  There were pool tables and a nice big bar.  Dave was motioned to sit anywhere so he picked a corner booth where he had a good view of the action while he checked out the menu.  All the burgers were big, the smallest was 1/2 pound and there was a nice selection of beers.  Dave ordered a burger and a draft beer and sat back to watch.  It was getting toward lunch time and the place was filling up.  When the waiter brought his food Dave remembered the card.<br>\r\n\"Say,\" he told the waiter. \"My friend said that when I came here I should ask for Lou.  Is he here today?  My friend Brad told me to say hello.\"<br>\r\n\"Lou's in the back.\"<br>\r\nThe waiter finished setting out Dave's food and left.  <br>\r\nDave wasn't sure how to take that.  Would Lou be coming out?  Well, no big deal.  He dug into the burger which was juicy and loaded with fresh tomato and lettuce along with a healthy layer of guacamole.  It was great.  <br>\r\n\"You the guy looking for lou?\"  Dave looked up from the plate of fries and wipedi the juices from his mouth/<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" he said to</span></div></div>",

It was Saturday and Dave was wearing sweat pants stretched around his thicker ass and waist with thicker tights and his arms and chest were meatier and his belly has grown bigger. His face has gotten fuller and had a starter double chin. Dave now weighed 223 pounds. Dave was on the couch eating a bucket of KFC  and rubbing his stuffed hairy gut. H got up to answer the phone and learned he didn't get the job. Dave called brad ,'oh hey Dave what's up?' 'Oh I was wondering if you had a position that I can work?

Now he was completely bald with a shiny dome.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave followed Brad though the lobby to the bar, he observed some other changes in Brad.  He was thicker than Dave remembered, filling his Italian cut suit almost to capacity.  Seated in the booth, he unbuttoned his suit coat freeing an expanse of white shirt front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the old buddies were catching up.  Brad was an image consultant for top restaurants and was in town working with a client to develop a new restaurant.  He had been meeting all day with his client with hardly anything to eat. Now he was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you join me for dinner.  There's a new restaurant that's supposed to be fantastic.  It will be on my  expense account because I need to keep up with all the new restaurants and I sure would like the chance to catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave muttered something about having to work tomorrow and not being dressed well enough for dinner but Brad was insistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm flying back tomorrow so this is our last chance.  Besides, this restaurant is casual.  You wait right here while I go upstairs and change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave finished his beer and soon Brad was back, dressed in chinos and a polo which fit tightly around a belly sagging over his belt.  He didn't seem self-conscious at all, even next to the tight muscled Dave.  He was even patting it contentedly as they waited for Brad's car to be brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving,\" Brad announced when the car finally arrived.  \"And I'm really looking forward to checking out this restaurant.

Inside, it was a sophisticated white and dark wood motif  with a dramatic cuckoo clock in the reception area.  Brad marched on accompanied by the hostess and soon they were seated in a corner booth surveying the menu.  It seemed The Cuckoo was a German restaurant with all the traditional dishes and Brad after some consulting with the hostess ordered for them both.  Soon they were drinking German beer and catching up on the years since they had last been together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the food arrived, they were well into their second pitcher of beer.  Dave was amazed to see a family sized platter of savory sauerbraten accompanied by bowls of red cabbage and spaetzle.  Brad immediately dug in, savoring the succulent meat and side dishes and was quickly demolished his first heaping plate and reloaded.  Dave was still working on his first plate when Brad wiped the last of the sauce from the serving plate and paused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably remember that I wasn\u2019t much of an eater in high school.\u201d Brad commented.  \u201cMy mother was a lousy cook.  Everything was tasteless and overcooked and so I never realized that food was supposed to taste good.  That\u2019s why I was so scrawny.  I never thought anything about it and I was never such a scarecrow that I couldn\u2019t get a date so I was fine until I got to college and started loosing my hair.  That got me scared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Brad stopped.  His eyes focused across the room where a server was approaching with more food.  Brad immediately focused on the platter of potato pancakes accompanied with sour cream and applesauce and dug in when the plate was set before him.  Dave had a plate as well although he was full from his share of the sauerbraten and he picked while Brad wolfed down his and then smiled as he saw the server approaching with two more plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey need to be hot off the griddle to be at their best,\u201d he explained to Dave. \u201cSo I asked them to bring them in batches.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave watched in wonderment as his old friend finished his second plate, then Dave\u2019s second plate and finally the rest of Dave\u2019s first plate.  Then with a contented expression on his face, he pushed the plates away, belched quietly and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Anyway,  I decided that a wimpy guy with a comb over was not going to be any girls idea of a hot date.  <br>\r\nI put myself on a serious weight training program, forced myself to eat lots of healthy, tasteless food and shaved my head.  It took two years  to add 25 pounds of muscle to  my boney frame but by my junior year I felt pretty good.  At 195 pounds and 10 percent body fat, I wasn\u2019t a 10 but I did alright with the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still had to force myself to eat to maintain that weight but once I bulked up it wasn\u2019t nearly so hard to maintain.  After college my first job was pretty pedestrian.  Just deskwork.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s attention was again diverted when another server approached with more food.  This time is was a savory platter of sauerkraut with pork chops, apples and sausages. Dave couldn\u2019t see how anyone could eat any more food but Brad plowed right in.  He slowed a bit with the last of the sausages but the heaping platter was reduced to pork chop bones in short order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a little heavy, Brad sighed, let his belt out and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut than last year I got a new assignment that meant traveling to work with our clients in designing and managing restaurants. They wanted me to understand and appreciate the food they were serving in order to do the best marketing and packaging of their restaurants.  I told them they were wasting their time because I just didn\u2019t appreciate food.  They insisted so I began to sample the food my clients were serving.  I had never tasted anything so good in my life and before long I was hooked on good food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHooked,\u201d Dave was thinking.  He had never seen such a display of unabashed gluttony in his life.  Where did Brad put all that food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve go the perfect job?\u201d Dave commented, observing that there was now a definite ledge of bulging belly under Brad\u2019s muscular chest which he hadn\u2019t noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLife is good.\u201d Brad responded.  \u201cI don\u2019t have any trouble keeping my weight up anymore.  In fact, I have gained 20 pounds over the last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted his now very prominent belly with evident pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the conversation was interrupted by</span></div></div>",

We haven\u2019t seen each other for years.  Dave this is Gtetchen Kohl.  She and her brothers own this restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave took a better look at Gretchen. He had been too busy keeping up with Brad to pay her any attention but now he found that he like what he saw.  Gretchen was a pink and gold confection barely contained in slinky black dress.  Her ample curves were far from the size 6 skeletons that he was surrounded with at work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Gretchen.\u201d  Dave\u2019s glance wondered down to her breasts, then caught himself and met her blue eyes..  \u201cYou have a lovely restaurant.\u201d Looking over at Brad, he added,\u201dand you have a raving fan.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretchen laughed. \u201cBrad doesn\u2019t count.  He has to like our food because he had a big part in developing the restaurant.  But I do like to know when he is coming or the kitchen will run out of food.  Now I\u2019m sure that Brad couldn\u2019t manage another bite after all the food he put away tonight but David surely has room for some nice linzertorte.\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put a plate with a small piece of the desert before Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave felt a tingle when Gretchen spoke his name.  Smiling he happily ate his desert.  Gretchen sat next to him and made small talk while he ate one, then two and finally three slices. Brad, meanwhile was making selections from the desert cart he had summoned. Finally sated he pushed back from the table and smiled contentedly at Gretchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful.\u201d He told her.  \u201cThis was even better than last time.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rose carefully exposing his bulging belly.  \u201cThanks again, Gretchen,\u201d he said struggling to pull up his chinos which had sagged under the pressure of belly growth.  \u201cI\u2019ve got to get Dave back so he can get his beauty sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave was still talking with Gretchen, completely unaware of anything Brad had said but Gretchen rose and taking Dave by the hand said\u2019 \u201c You will have to come back soon David.  I will make sure you have a good time even without Brad.  Give me a call when you\u2019re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave took the card.  He loved to hear Gretchen call him David.  He loved the sound of her voice.  He loved her voluptuous body.  He didn\u2019t want to leave but he had come with Brad and Brad was ready to go so reluctantly he said goodby to Gretchen and the two friends were settling into Brad\u2019s car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the hotel, Brad hugged Dave and promised to call him the next time he came to town.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A morning spent out in the field, checking if the test site had lost its snow cover, then an afternoon spent on errands, laundry...and now, a beer and chips and a video.  Three years into his career, he was just starting to find life lonely - through the hard slog of three degrees, he'd always had friends and fellow students, but now, with a research fellowship, he only saw a handful of people, and most of those were in the lab.  When he'd moved to take this job, he knew he was leaving most of his grad student friends behind, but he figured there'd be new friends - and there weren't many, not really.  Oh, there was a class full of students to teach, but they were all so young...and that was unethical, anyway.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, here he was, a lonely Saturday night.  He looked through the pile of mail that had accumulated over the week, and found a notice from a local church, listing an Easter morning drama service, followed by lunch.  When he was a kid, he'd gone to church most Sundays with his parents, but except for visits with them, and a wedding during grad school, he'd hardly darkened a church door since.  Maybe he should go?  He remembered there were always young people around his parents' church, and this one didn't sound too extreme - how far out could Methodists get, anyway?  So, with nothing better to do for tomorrow, and a nagging sense of loneliness, he decided to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Mark hesitated long and hard over what to wear.  A suit?  His father had often worn a suit, but he hated it when he had to, as a boy.  Was it expected?  He finally settled on a jacket over chinos, with a white shirt, no tie.  Looking at himself in the mirror, he thought he looked intelligent, and approachable, and if the jacket was too much he could chuck it.  He looked harder at himself then he had in a while - wondering why he hadn't 'found a girl' as his mother put it - and noted that....</span></div></div>",

I should dress up more often, he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChurch was much like he remembered. He saw families, young couples his age with one or two small children and older couples with teenagers. This all made him feel like life was passing him by.  Why was he still alone and lonely?

Even from beneath the jacket he could tell that his chest had grown more muscular and his arms thicker.  He'd started going to the gym for a light exercise routine more as a method of getting out of his head for a time than out of a desire to build muscle.  He enjoyed his scholarly pursuits, but no one could live entirely in their head.  Still, the new muscle mass was a nice surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more confident, he made his way to the church.  It was only a couple blocks away, so Mark decided to walk instead of drive.  It had been a fairly mild winter so far, with the only noteworthy snowfall taking place early last week.  He'd gotten a place in a nice building in a good neighborhood, and he liked to stroll down the city streets every now and then.  The streets were fairly empty at this time.  He did see a few people emerging from their homes, maybe heading the same way he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe church itself was one of many in the area.  It wasn't particularly large, but it was very well maintained.  At one side sat a small courtyard in which a set of small stone benches surrounded the sculpture of Mary.  The large wooden doors leading into the building itself stood open and inviting.  He went in a found himself a seat towards the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, don't think I've seen you around here before.

Scott was feeling better about himself as he checked them out and then he came to Roy.  Roy had been the best athlete in his class and the one that all the girls swooned over.  Lots of muscle in his chest and shoulders tapering to a lean waist with a sixpack that Scott had envied but no amount of workouts seemed to give him.  Well, Roy was now a successful contractor and from the picture, he must be double his high school weight.  Those shoulders were still big but his narrow waist was now a huge belly, wider than his shoulders.  Scott noticed that Roy was smiling.  He looked like he had the world by the tail.. or maybe like he had just eaten it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott added Roy to his friends list and when he finished sat for a moment thinking about Roy.  He bet Roy didn't worry about a second helping at dinner or a donut at coffee break.  Now his 40 inch belly didn't seem like much and his 36 inch pants were only up 2 inches from the 34's he wore in college. What would it be like to have a belly the size of Roy's, he wondered hefting himself up from the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped by the kitchen on the way to bed to see if the boys had left any of the pie from dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those boys\", he muttered when he found the plate empty, \"They are going to eat me out of house and home.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott rummaged around some in the refrigerator looking for something to take the edge off the sudden hunger pangs.  Finally he made a thick sandwich loaded with sliced beef and cheese and got out the milk and soon he was stuffing his face and draining the last of the milk carton.  He patted his gut, now more stuffed than after dinner and belched softly.  Then he went upstairs and crawled into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe there was a possibility of a friendship down the road.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he got to the office next morning, all he found was a note stuck on his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott,<br>\r\nI am going out of town for two weeks.

He often had an hour or two or work in the evening before getting into bed at 11 or ao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week of this left Scott pretty eager for the weekend and Friday night, after a good family dinner and his daughter was in bed, Scott settled down at his computer for some relaxation.  He checked email and then he remembered signing up for Facebook last week.  He signed on and found that he had a bunch of new friends including his old jock buddy, Roy who had written on his wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear from you buddy.  Hope you are doing well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott wrote about his boring week on Facebook then started to play a video game.  Soon bored with that and tired from his long week, Scott poked around the refrigerator for something to eat and was soon in bed snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can't expect me to bring everything.\"<br>\r\nScott got a sixpack from the refrigerator under Roy's watchful eye.<br>\r\nWhen Scott handed Roy a beer, Roy pulled up Scott's shirt and patted his belly.<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you are getting to be a man.  I swear some of our buddies are still trying to look like skinny kids.  How much you weigh?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, I don't really know.  My weight has just gotten out of control in the last year.  Maybe 200.\"<br>\r\nRoy laughed.  \"You aren't out of control.  This (he grabbed his belly and shook it at Scott) is out of control. And I love every pound.  I can't imagine being a 185 pound muscle twink when you can be a 400 pound man.  Now let's eat up.  You'd better appreciate what it takes when you are my size to delay a meal.  Now dig in.\"<br>\r\nScott dug in, encouraged by the presence of Roy.  Roy clearly enjoyed eating and Scott was carried along with his enthusiasm.  There was more chicken than Scott had seen in one place before and soon it was gone along with two huge tubs of potato salad and a second sixpack.<br>\r\n\"That's more like it, skinny.\"  Roy patted Scott's much larger belly.<br>\r\nScott burped and smiled in peasure.

You wish, skinny.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can't be as magnificent as me but there is no reason to live life as a twink. Let's see how much you weigh.  Wherei's your scale?'<br>\r\nScott was torn now.  Roy was so comfortable with his size and Scott had to admit he looked great but Scott didn't think he could be as confident and deal with his friend, but what if?<br>\r\n\"OK.\" Scott said at the door of the bathroom.  \"Here is it.

Woman who love curves and men who grew big bellies. The report went on to tell of communities of people interested in gaining weight. There were terms such as 'gainer' a person who gains weight, and 'chaser' a person who likes gainers.

Grinning to himself, Scott fought to fasten the button on the 40's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd managed to get the pants closed, but only with a lot of hard work.  His naked gut bulged over, hiding the waistband from view, but he could still feel the fabric digging into his flesh.  In the end, Scott threw them into the discard pile, knowing that they would likely lose their button the next time he sat down to a good meal.  He paused for a moment to admire how his newly fattened thighs and rear filled out his boxers before picking up the 42's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the 42's fit Scott's fuller form much better than the previous pants.  They weren't exactly roomy, but they did fasten beneath the curve of his belly without having to be forced into position first.  He didn't even need to suck his gut in before buttoning.  Before leaving the changing room, he picked up a pair of the size 40 jeans on a whim.  He did kind of like how he looked squeezed into very tight pants.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm not sure that I know exactly what you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sighed and felt his belly shift its weight as he pulled himself upright and turned to face his intern. These student summer workers were a pain.  Always needing something to do and never quite knowing how to do the tasks so Scott ended up doing the work all over again.  Then too, Brett was a first string quarterback at State, looking forward to taking his team to a championship this fall in his Senior year.  \"He was a pretty good kid for a summer intern but still more work than he was worth,\" Scott thought.  \"Too bad he couldn't manage to find something that would really help.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's take a look,\"  Scott heaved himself up from the chair and followed Brett back to his desk.<br>\r\n\"Man, that kid is built.\" he was thinking as he followed Brett.  \"Broad shoulders tapering to a tiny waist with every muscle showing through his fitted dress shirt.  Even in college and at his top condition, Scott never had that body.<br>\r\nBack at Brett's desk, Scott was very conscious of the contrast between lean hardbody of Brett and Scott's growing bulk.  He worked through Brett's work, fixing errors and correcting some numbers.  As he worked, Brett scooted his chair aside to make room for Scott's belly as it rested on the edge of the desk.  <br>\r\nHe hadn't paid much attention to his boss so far this summer.  Just another boring summer job.  But this was his last summer before graduation.  In just a year, he would be entering the job market.  If he could establish himself this summer, maybe he could ensure a good job here.  He remembered how he had worked his way into his football coaches favor by bringing donuts to his office before practice.  This Scott guy clearly loves his food.  He was gone two hours for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how to do it?\" Scott grumbled to Brett as he stood up and swiveled his belly in Brett's face.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,Boss. It's really pretty simple once you show me what you want.\"<br>\r\nBrett watched Scott's progress back to his own desk.  You could still see that he had been a jock.  His butt was still pretty tight  but his belly was starting to wrap around forming some flabby lovehandles stretching the capacity of his shirt.  The man was definitely letting himself go but he could use his weakness to make Brett a valuable asset to Scott.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow would be interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't take him long to notice the box sitting on his desk.  It took even less time for him to take a large bite out of one of the donuts after he opened the box.  Brett had chosen his first move very well.  Scott had finished off the first one and already taken a bite out of the second before he even picked up the little note Brett had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a pain that you've got to walk me through all this work, so I thought I'd offer you something to say thanks.  I hope you like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott closed the box after his second donut, intending to drop the box in the breakroom later.  It wasn't long before his appetite got the better of him though, and his hand crept back into the box.  In the end, he finished the last donut sometime after lunch without it even registering.

Still, he didn't want to be found out because he'd gotten overconfident.  Better to play it safe for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrett continued to bring in snacks for his boss regularly.  He would only do something as big as a dozen donuts about once a week, only when he had an excuse for it.  On the other days he restricted himself mainly to offering a couple pastries or other treats a few times throughout the day.  It didn't take long for this rather small bit of effort to start producing results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe annoyed look that Scott had always adopted when Brett had approached him had disappeared almost entirely.  It wasn't what you would call friendly conversation by any means, but now his boss at least tolerated him easily.  He'd even noticed a hint of anticipation in Scott's face whenever they spoke.

The new one this year, Brett, seemed to have more on the ball than most.  He was the kind of kid that turned Scott off initially, tall and good looking with a muscular frame.  Scott had been that kind of kid although 20 years and 40 pounds ago and at that age Scott was just looking for a good time. This kid was different.  He asked questions.  He seemed to appreciate help and direction and even more surprising learned and remembered.  Scott munched on a cupcake, thoughtfully.  Brett even showed his appreciation by doing helpful things for Scott.  He picked up another cupcake.  This was just another example of the thoughtfulness of this kid.  He was always bringing in snacks.  Scott usually had to roam around the office looking for a tasty tidbit for his morning break, sometimes even going down to the lobby.  Lately, however, there was always something handy to keep Scott's belly happy.  He are another cupcake.  <br>\r\n\"You know,\" he thought to himself. \"I haven't been showing Brett much appreciation.  Maybe I should be a little nicer.\"<br>\r\nScott mused somemore about Brett's good qualities.  Two more cupcakes disappeared into Scott's greedy mouth.<br>\r\n\"These are pretty good.\" he thought finishing off the last of the dozen in the box.  \"Probably should have shared them but one dozen isn't enough for the office.  It wouldn't be right to have somebody do without.\"<br>\r\nScott heaved himself up.  After the cupcakes, he needed some coffee.  He grabbed his cup and headed for the coffee pot.  On the way, he saw Brett head down working at his desk.  Scott smiled.  Maybe now was the time to start showing Brett that he appreciated his good work.  He turned and headed over to Brett's desk.<br>\r\n\"Brett.\" he said. \"You have been doing a great job.\"</span></div></div>",

Scott was sure that even with all his training , Brett would be just as clueless and useless as the others.  Finally, Brett was satisfied that he understood what Scott needed from him.

Only 10:45, too early for lunch but already he was hungry.  <br>\r\n\"Maybe some coffee would hold him over,\" he was thinking as he ambled over to the coffee pot.

I'm gonna stick with tradition and go with a cheeseburger.\"  He took a sip from the new mug that the waiter had returned with while Randy gave them their orders.  The service was quick, and their meals were placed before them by the time he'd drained half his glass.  Randy had emptied his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is huge,\" Scott said as he admired the girth of the burger that was placed before him.  He hardly believed that his mouth would open that wide.  His boss didn't seem to have any similar problem with what was placed before him.  He sat hunched over a plate holding three different heaps of pasta; each looked large enough to be a meal in and of itself.  Even so, Randy was working his way through the first pile without any obvious strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if there was one thing that Scott had proven over the last week or so, it was that he could handle himself at the dinner table.  It turned out that the burger was just the right size for him.  Leaning over the plate to keep the grease from falling onto his shirt, Scott went to work on his meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished the burger in time to catch Randy grabbing a handful of fries from his basket.  \"Haven't had enough yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about!  You were just taking so long with that burger I thought I'd help you out here.  Hate to see good food go to waste.\"  Chuckling, Scott brought a pair of steak fries to his mouth.  Between the beer, the appetizers, and the large main course, he was pretty full.  Still, he hated to waste food just as much as his boss did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you say to...\" </span></div></div>",

He'd planned on cornering his boss in the break room that Friday.  The two of them often ran into each other several times a day as they went to help themselves to the treats and baked goods that various office workers brought in to garner good will with each other.  Scott made his way there three times that day, but each time he returned with nothing to show for his trip beyond an admittedly mouth-watering wedge from someone's birthday cake.  Randy must have decided to take the day off; there was no way he's miss out on such a tempting treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend was going to be a great time to relax.  Each of the kids were supposed to be out of the house until Sunday evening, either for some school outing or a sleepover with a friend.  Even his wife was planning on abandoning him in favor of a spa trip with a few of her girl friends.  Secretly, Scott always kind of looked forward to these times when he had the house to himself.  It gave him a chance to relive his glory days as a bachelor without having to give up the benefits of married wife.  For one thing, he mused as he gave his gut a shake, I certainly eat much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all he had to do was decide how best to spend his family-free time.  It would be the perfect opportunity for Scott to defy his wife's ridiculous new one-restaurant-outing-per-week restriction without having to be cunning.  He'd been getting around his wife's attempts to put him on a diet pretty well up until now, but it was a bit of an inconvenience to have to craft a convincing lie every time he felt like swinging through the drive-thru at McDonalds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was tempting, but there was something alluring about the idea of spending as much of the weekend as possible parked in front of the television.  He'd be able to recline in his easy chair in nothing but his boxers and an old t-shirt, with just the remote, a bottle of beer and a pile of greasy take-out food to keep him company, just how God intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What sense was there in going out into the cool fall air when he had everything he needed within reach of his soft, warm couch?  The only thing left to do what decide what kind of take-out he was going to call for.  He leaned forward with a grunt and retrieved the stack of menus that had been gathering dust ever since his wife had gone crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been weeks since the last time he'd had Chinese, so he picked up the phone and dialed the restaurant.  Just reading through the menus had been enough to rouse his appetite, and he stroked his naked, hairy gut absentmindedly as he thought about just what to order.  He knew what he liked; the problem was that there was so much of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell, he thought after trying unsuccessfully to decide what to drop from the lunchtime lineup.  He was a free man this weekend, and there was no reason for a man not to eat however much he wanted.  Promptly shutting up the part of his brain that was warning him of what Laura would say if she heard what he was about to order, Scott proceeded to instruct the woman on he other end of the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was a bit surprised when he looked back on all that he had ordered.  Maybe his newfound temporary freedom had gone to his head?  His belly rumbled in anticipation, but he wasn't sure that he was going to be able to put it all away.  A full order of both chicken and beef fried rice, a heaping helping of beef lo mein, six eggrolls and an order of sweet &amp; sour chicken was a pretty big meal for one man of even Scott's thick frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I'll just have to do my best he thought as he stood to answer the doorbell.  He was half way there when he remembered that he wasn't wearing anything but his boxers.</span></div></div>",

He hadn't answered the door in nothing but an old pair of boxers in years, and he had almost certainly been at least twenty pounds slimmer back then.  Still, there was nothing around for him to cover up with and he didn't want to risk having his order carried away by an impatient delivery guy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling upon what bravado remained from his days as a jock, he confidently pulled the door open.  Somehow he managed not to blush when he saw that it was a pretty young woman carrying his lunch (all three bags of it) instead of the pimply teenaged guy he had been expecting.  There was no way he could miss the way her eyes lingered on his belly.  Scott could imagine what kind of sight he made right now; a 40-something man standing in his doorway with his fat belly sticking out over his tight boxers and forcing the waistband to ride low beneath its curve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned his away from the delivery girl to carry his bags of take-out to the coffee table, very aware of just how well his rear end was filling out his boxers.  Gotta be sure to tip the poor girl really good, he thought with a quiet chuckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot sir.  Enjoy your meal,\" the girl said politely as she took her payment with a smile.  Even if it was fake she had earned her hefty tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's belly rumbled insistently at her words.  Instead of feeling embarrassed, he just gave his soft belly a couple pats and grinned.  \"You bet I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must've looked like some kind of slob, he thought as he made his way back to the couch after closing the door behind the girl.  For some reason, the embarrassment that he had expected to feel during and long after that encounter had never showed up, even though he could still feel his boxers stretching slightly around his backside and thick thighs.  As a matter of fact, Scott was becoming aware of the way that something else was stretching his boxers.  </span></div></div>",

We're goin' the same way, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott hadn't planned on drinking as much as he did this evening, but there was no denying that the beer had left him just a bit drunk.  Even the large amount of food he'd put away couldn't negate the effects of the beer.  He wasn't sure, but he had a suspicion that Randy had even drank more than he did.  Randy was the bigger guy, even with Scott's newly-added poundage, but there was no way he was sober enough to drive.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound's like a plan,\" Scott said as he got to his feet, feeling a bit unsteady.  Maybe he'd downed more beer than he'd thought, or maybe all that food was contributing to his buzz.  He followed Randy's broad back out to the street, noticing that his boss was weaving at least as much as he was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found an empty cab pretty easily.  The bar was a pretty popular place for people to hit up after a long day of work.  It didn't take long for the cabs to learn that they could make a good business by driving those people home.  Randy held the door open before following him into the back seat.  There wasn't as much room to spread out as Scott would have liked and his leg ended up pressed firmly against his boss's thick thigh.  They reclined in silence for several minutes: the only sounds being their heavy breathing and the occasional loud belch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott's eyes had drifted closed before Randy finally spoke.  \"Ya know Scott, I knew you were a good worker or I wouldn't have offered you that job, but you're a pretty good guy.\"  He was quiet for another moment before he continued.  \"I actually had a real good time with you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy had moved closer as he was speaking and there was now only a couple inches between the tips of their noses.  His boss was so close that Scott could smell his beery breath, yet only a sense of mild surprise managed to pierce his drowsy contentment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a great time too,\" Scott said as he lazily draped his arm over Randy's shoulders.  \"Totally worth the hell I'm gonna catch from my wife when I come home drunk.  She don't understand that I'd rather hang out with other guys sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop at my place.  I got coffee if you wanna try to sober up a bit.

The rest of the trip was pretty short and they passed it quietly.  Normally he would be worried about making his wife even angrier, but he actually liked Randy and she was going to be pissed either way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it had just been a case of greener grass that had him fooled, but Scott had expected Randy's house to be large and fancy.  Instead, the cab stopped in front of a large apartment building.  It wasn't a bad building, but it wasn't nearly as lavish a place as he'd imagined.  His place was up a few flights of stairs, on the fifth floor.  Scott automatically headed for the elevator, but Randy put a hand on his shoulder.  \"Thing's broke.  We're gonna have to hoof it up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first flight of stairs was nothing for the pair, but Scott hadn't made it half way up the second flight before he began to breathe a bit heavily.  Towards the top of the third flight, he began to hear his boss panting ahead of him.  When they finally got to Randy's floor, they were both out of breath.  and sweat had even begun to bead up on Randy's forehead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate them stairs,\" Randy puffed, wiping his brow with a forearm.  Scott merely nodded, deciding to save his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped at a door halfway down the hall and Randy fumbled in his pockets for his keys.  He threw his jacket to the side upon entering the apartment, motioning for Scott to do the same.  It became quickly apparent that this was not the home of a neat freak.  There were dishes waiting to be washed in the sink and boxes and cartons from takeout places littering the counter in his small kitchen.  A few more containers sat on the table in front of the sofa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you weren't expecting much.  I ain't big on housekeeping.\"  Randy sounded normal, but the way he snatched at the empty cartons on the table seemed embarrassed.  His face was too ruddy to be sure either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.  This is how men are supposed to live,\" Scott said with a grin. It was true too.  He actually liked the way Randy had his home set up.  It even reflected its owner's personality: laid back and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll warn ya now, I'm no good with anything in this kitchen except the food in the fridge,\" he said as he began to fiddle with the coffee maker.  \"I usually get my mornin' fix when I hit the McDonalds on the way to work.  That's what's worst about bein' divorced.  Mornin' coffee was one of the few things my ex was good for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed into the living area to wait for the coffee, Randy yanking his tie off and unbuttoning the top few buttons of his shirt on the way.  Scott could see dark patches of sweat beneath his arms.  \"I'm dyin' in these clothes.  I ain't gonna offend you if I lose this dress shirt, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott took a seat on the small sofa as Randy shrugged his way out of the shirt.  He tossed it on top of a pile of discarded clothes in one of the corners of the room before dropping onto the couch next to Scott and flipping on the television. The sofa was a two-seater and he could feel the heat radiating from Randy's body, but it wasn't just his body heat that was warming Scott up.  His big boss's thick lovehandle was pressed against his own fleshy side.  Scott loosened his own collar a bit.</span></div></div>",

The clips served as a pretty good distraction and before he knew it Randy heaved himself up from the couch to get their coffee.  He returned with the pot, two mugs and some packets of cream and sugar, all of which he placed directly onto the wooden coffee table.  Scott grinned inwardly as he imagined what his wife would do if someone put those things right on her wooden furniture.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black's probably the best choice if we're gonna sober up quick,\" Randy said.  His face was still flushed and his eyes remained bleary.  Scott wondered if the mountain of food that his boss had consumed was adding to the effect of all that beer like it was in him.  Still, it was a comfortable buzz, he thought with an inward shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy handed a mug to Scott just as a new set of clips from the latest big football game appeared on the television.  They both reclined in the sofa to get comfortable, the heat generated by Randy's body starting to make Scott feel a bit light headed.  He felt a hand resting on his left shoulder, but didn't think anything of it as he leaned over and continued to watch the game.  It took a commercial break to snap him out of the trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed was that he was comfortably warm despite leaving his coffee sitting on the table.  Looking over to his left, Scott spotted Randy's big paw resting on his upper arm.  Slowly, it dawned on him that he was being held comfortably within the crook of the other man's arm.  Scott knew that Randy was a pretty physical person who wasn't afraid of touching, but this was rather extreme.  Still, Randy was pretty drunk and, between the warmth from Randy and his overstuffed belly, he was more inclined to stay put.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to think back to the last time he and his wife had been so close.  He couldn't remember the last time they'd exchanged anything more than a quick hug or a peck on the cheek.  It was funny in a way that Scott was getting more comfort from his boss than what his wife had given him in a long time.  He gave a mental shrug before scooting closer and placing a hand on Randy's full, soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what he'll think of this when he sobers up, if he remembers it at all, Scott thought.  Hell, I wonder what I'll think of it...</span></div></div>",

He had no idea what he would say if Randy approached him about their cuddle time last night.  He was convinced that it had simply been the result of an awkward mixture of beer and chronic dissatisfaction over the state of his love life.  That was all well and good for him, but it wasn't something that most employees would like to talk to their bosses about.  Still, if he didn't show up then he would just be giving Randy a reason to have to address last night's events.  Why ruin the chance that he wouldn't say anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Scott wound up scurrying to his desk and trying his best to look very, very busy.  That alone was difficult enough because of the boring nature of his job, and soon it was complicated by the growling of his unsatisfied belly.  On the days when he wasn't nervously avoiding his boss, who also liked to take full advantage of free treats, he would have made at least a couple trips there by this time of day.  Still, it had been  months since Scott had been able to make it through a morning without a bearclaw or two.  He would be needing a refill of coffee if he was going to keep up the slog through the tedium that was his work anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited for a lull in what passed for the office's mid-morning bustle before leaving his desk.  Getting to the breakroom without running into anyone was easy, but there was no way for him to know who was in there without going in himself.  Hopefully Randy had had a hearty breakfast that morning and wouldn't be looking for a snack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott let out a relieved sigh upon entering the empty break room.  Not only had he managed to avoid his boss so far, but he was rewarded with a nearly complete coffee cake.  The wedge he took was even larger than usual, nearly a fourth of what was there.  He was going to need something to calm his nerves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been avoiding me Scott?\" asked a voice from behind him.  Moving up next to him, Randy slapped Scott's shoulder amiably.  He grinned and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scott walked into work the next day feeling nervous.  He had no idea what to expect from his boss after a night that seemed eerily similar to a date.  His own feeling about sitting cuddled up next to Randy's big, warm belly still hadn't been sorted out completely.  Part of the problem was that he knew that he'd enjoyed it.  It had been warm and comfortable, and he never even felt a flash of embarrassment over his overstuffed belly throughout the whole evening.  Still, the rational part of his brain told him that life would be easier for both of them if last night was just forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it seemed like Randy had the same idea.  They ran into each other in the breakroom like they usually did.  It seemed that their guts both began grumbling for a midmorning snack at about the same time.  He grinned and gave Scott a friendly pat on the back, but nothing else.  Scott decided to take that as a good sign.  His boss was still acting like his usual friendly self, so either he was willing to overlook last night or he simply didn't remember it.  Either way, Scott was relieved.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a few of those cupcakes.  They're so good I'll have to take the whole plate if it's still there when I come back.\"  Randy had already done some damage to the plate, judging from the empty space taking up about a quarter of it.  He gave his thick middle an affectionate rub and grinned conspiratorially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his advice, Scott picked up four of the best looking samples.  Normally he'd take one or two at a time, but for some reason he didn't feel like there was any need to pretend to have restraint in front of Randy, at least when it came to food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Randy began when Scott went to refill his mug with coffee, \"I was wonderin' if you'd want to head back to that restaraunt this Thursday.  A big guy with a man's appetite could really get his money's worth.  They're havin'...\"</span></div></div>",

Anyone who can put away their challenge platter in one sitting gets to eat free there for a month.  Anything you could possibly want off their menu, any time, as many times as you want.\"  Randy paused for a moment, imagining the damage he'd do with such a privilege available to him.  Snapping out of it, he continued, \"I thought of you as soon as I heard about it.  Us guys gotta stick together.  You interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a perfect offer in almost every sense.  First, it showed that Randy was not angry or uncomfortable with their cuddle session.  He would never invite Scott out to dinner with just him if he was.  Besides that, it would mean at the very least another night of delicious, plentiful food.  If he didn't succeed at the challenge he would still be able to stuff himself silly on the bar's deliciously greasy cuisine, and if he won he would be able to do the same thing as many times as he could fit into a month.  Finally, though he probably wouldn't say it out loud if he could help it, he had to admit that spending an evening of gluttonous indulgence with his boss had, after only one night, become one of Scott's favorite activities.  In the back of his mind, Scott knew that it would take quite a lot for him to turn down an invitation to Burger King for lunch if it came from Randy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had to ask?  Of course I'll be there.\"  Scott grinned and gave his growing pot a couple of light slaps.  Suddenly struck with an idea, Scott continued, \"I don't know about you, but I'm thinkin' we should do what we can to make sure we win this.  We've both got pretty good appetites, but it can't hurt to stretch them a bit more, can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy gave a brief shout of laughter before clapping Scott on the shoulder and pulling him into his soft side.  \"I knew you were a man after my own heart Scott!  You're some kind of genius.  So, where should we start our trainin' regimen?\"</span></div></div>",

Scott laughed too.  It was nice to talk with another guy who seemed to enjoy his extra heft.  He'd worked for Randy for years, but he'd never really seen him as anything but 'the boss'.  He was a bit surprised to find that he genuinely liked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd both drained their glasses and the waitress returned with fresh ones.  Before he left, they placed their order.  The woman didn't bat an eyelash at the size of Randy's order, and she even asked if he wanted a side for both the orders.  Randy liked to get the most for his money, so he agreed.  Scott decided to keep it simple and ordered a cheeseburger which, according to the menu, was well over half a pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad order there.

Scott's burger did turn out to be even larger than he'd expected, but he made his way steadily through it without much trouble.  Randy was making short work of both of his orders.  He was clearly paying more attention to his food than the actual conversation.  Scott's attention was divided as well.  He liked watching another man enjoy a good large meal nearly as much as he liked filling his own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Scott had finished his burger, as well as the platter of thick steak fries which had accompanied it, Randy had nearly cleared both of his plates.  He'd never seen a man so dedicated to his food.  His boss never even seemed to slow down, yet it was somehow clear that he was enjoying every bite.  Pretty soon he was wiping his plates clean with a bit of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quite a sight there, big guy.\"  He surprised himself by speaking in such a familiar way, but his full belly was making him feel very relaxed.  \"What do you say to topping it off with dessert?  I've gotta give this carrot cake a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth to respond, but the first thing that came out was a healthy belch.  He gave a grin, half sheepish but half proud, before responding.  \"Ah, you're a bad influence.

With Randy, there was certainly no need to hold back.  He dug into his burger with savage abandon.

As he was leaving, Randy gestured and waived his arm over the dishes in front of him.  The waiter knew what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another round?\" he asked.

Scott's sandwich had been consumed, but now he was quite full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy cleared his final plate and released a very satisfied belch.  He leaned way back in his seat and began stroking his stomach gently.  \"See, isn't the food great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was awesome,\" Scott replied while trying not to stare at his boss's bulging belly.  It was always noticeable, but his large meal had blown it up to a size Scott hadn't ever witnessed before.  Unless he was imagining things, the buttons over the thickest portion of his lower belly were beginning to show hints of the white cotton beneath.  He forced his eyes up to Randy's content face.  \"I'm completely stuffed though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPainting a look of mock astonishment across his face, Randy said, \"A big guy like you getting beat by two  sandwiches?  It's just not right.  Besides, I still need dessert before I can call this dinner a success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really was very full, but something about that statement caught and held Scott's attention.  How much more would his boss's soft belly grow as he ate his dessert?  It was already even more round and solid than usual.  Maybe he'd even lose a button from his shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these thoughts passed through Scott's mind almost too fast for him to recognize, let alone remember.  \"Well, I guess it would be a shame to go home without finishing the meal off right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the way you think, bud,\" Randy said as he once again motioned for the waiter.  \"Me and my friend are gonna...\"</span></div></div>",

Scott was inspired.  He imagined eating with Randy until the two men had bellies out to their knees.

He hadn't pegged Randy as the type to prefer upscale restaurants, but he wasn't really expecting a place quite like this one either.  Suddenly he was glad he hadn't dressed up today.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were probably expecting something a bit classier, huh,\" asked Randy as he approached.  \"What can I say?  I still keep mostly to the diet of a college student.  It don't help me fit into my pants now that I'm not a starving student anymore, but it's certainly worth it.\"  He gave his round paunch an affectionate little squeeze and even gave Scott's smaller belly a little pat as he held open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the buffet is a safe bet today.  I had a pretty light lunch today and now I'm starving!\"  Scott grinned, remembering the extra wedge of pastry his boss had taken earlier that afternoon.  He was willing to bet it hadn't been his only afternoon snack.  Still, his new, larger clothes seemed to have awoken Scott's appetite, so he agreed immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading past the salad bar with little more than a dismissive glance, Randy said, \"Just remind me to grab a few veggie slices before we leave, will ya?\"  Scott chuckled as he loaded his plate with large slices of the delightfully greasy, cheesy sausage pizza in front of him.  He made sure to suggest a seat very close to the buffet tables, foreseeing several more trips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott refilled his plate twice before the tightness of his belt became a little too noticeable.  Instead of letting it out a notch, he decided to simply remove it altogether.  He glanced across the table as he leaned back to catch his breath and gave his gut a quick rub.  It looked like his boss was ahead of him by a full plate.  Randy reclined far into his seat, taking several deep breaths.  His hand was going around his waistband, underneath the thick ledge of flab which sat in his lap, trying to relieve the pressure.  It didn't seem to be working, because a moment later Randy simply unbuttoned his pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished, he gave Scott a triumphant grin before standing up again.  \"Now I'll be sure to get my money's worth!  Come on, you can't be full yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning the grin, Scott took hold of the offered hand and hoisted himself up from his seat.  They'd already cleared out a good amount of the pizza on the buffet tables, but they both managed to fill their plates to overflowing before returning to the table.  After shoving nearly half a slice into his mouth and licking his fingers clean, Randy leaned sideways with a grunt and placed a packet onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we've both took the edge off our hunger, I think we can start talking business.\"</span></div></div>",

Still, Scott managed to get a good understanding in between the trips to refill their plates.  He also took the packet, even though he was sure that the grease and sauce stains would make it a bit difficult to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they'd finished their conversation about the job, they were both more or less satisfied.  Scott had been forced to follow his boss's example and unbutton his new pants at around his fifth trip, and he was pretty sure that he saw the white fabric of an undershirt through the gaps in the buttons over Randy's full belly.  The man had managed to put away what probably amounted to half a pizza more than Scott had eaten.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Randy said between shallow breaths, \"we also paid for the dessert buffet.\"  He sat back, grinning and running his hands over his broad, thick gut.  \"I like to get my money's worth and you know how to put food away almost as good as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Scott a moment to fully understand what he was being asked.  He'd eaten what had to amount to at least three large pizzas, and his boss was surely ahead of him by another pie.  Randy's capacity was surprising and actually a bit inspiring to him.  Just then he became aware of just how much he'd enjoyed sharing a meal with another man who knew how to enjoy himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy read his grin accurately and hoisted himself out of his seat with a groan.  His gut always rounded out in front of him, but now the soft flesh was riding higher and firmer than usual.  Without thinking, Scott gave his boss's stomach a gentle pat saying, \"Are you sure there's any room left in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received a rather loud belch in response.  \"Well now there sure is,\" he replied proudly.   \"Now lets finish this meal, unless this is your way of offering me a nice belly rub?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott withdrew his hand with an awkward clearing of his throat, but Randy didn't seem to notice.  Instead, he draped an arm around Scott's shoulders and began walking him towards the dessert bar.  He hadn't expected anything like this, but he quickly decided that he didn't mind.  Randy had never been afraid of a bit of contact; it was just his way of being friendly.  Randy was radiating warmth, and Scott could feel his beefy chest and fat belly pressing into his own stuffed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was painfully aware of the heavy fullness of his stomach as he drove home, but Scott had had a great time.  He always enjoyed stuffing his gut, but it was even more fun to do so with a companion.  He actually found himself looking forward to the next meal he'd have with his boss as he pulled into his driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his achingly full stomach, Scott followed his nightly tradition of heading to the kitchen for a brownie or a handful of cookies before bed.  Surprisingly, he found his wife still awake and getting a glass of water.  Knowing that he must look like a mess, Scott grinned sheepishly and grabbed a beer from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you had a good meal tonight,\" she said simply.  He had untucked his shirt and left his pants unbuttoned after the feast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the boss asked me to dinner.  I'm going to be taking over as office manager and he wanted to go over it with me.  Maybe we overdid it a little,\" Scott chuckled as he gave his full gut a gentle slap.  He wasn't about to tell his wife that he'd enjoyed this evening more than any family dinner in recent memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd say so.  All of a sudden you've put on all this weight.  Didn't you just buy those pants a few days ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and drained his beer before responding.  \"All this weight?  I've gained 15 pounds tops.  Happens to everyone.\"  He couldn't help but grin as he said that.  He hadn't felt ashamed of his newfound appetite and weight in a while, but now he was actually kind of proud of it.  \"Besides, those pants were already kinda tight when I got them.  Guess 40's weren't the best choice..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took care of the laundry so his wife didn't know he'd really bought 42's.  Right now didn't seem like the best time to clue her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I think maybe we should put you on a diet.\"</span></div></div>",

He was trying to stick with it until he made a decision, but he still found himself making stops at McDonalds when the poor excuse for breakfast he got at home failed to even dent his hunger.  He tried halfheartedly to stop snacking at the office, but that simply made him too hungry to make it home without pulling through a drivethru on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was looking like another one of those days.  One of the women had brought in a delicious looking marble cake and it had taken a great deal of willpower to keep from cutting a piece when he went for coffee.  He'd almost made it to the end of the workday without mishap when he saw Randy approaching.  They hadn't seen much of each other, and since Scott had been spending as little time as possible in the breakroom, their paths didn't cross very often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're trying to stick to that diet your wife forced you on,\" Randy said with mock disapproval, \"but I couldn't let you get away without a little piece of this.  Didn't even steal any of your frosting.\"  He placed his hands on Scott's desk and leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like more than a little piece, Randy.\"  Diet or no, he couldn't refuse such a good offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, it's great isn't it,\" Randy said.  His belly looked as big as ever as it strained against his shirt's buttons.  His eyes lowered momentarily to Scott's torso before he started speaking again.  \"If you're anything like I was, and I know you are, you ain't havin' much success at ignoring your gut's grumbling.  You should just forget about it.  What your wife don't know won't hurt her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think she'll catch on if I bust out of my pants,\" Scott responded before placing a large chunk of cake into his mouth.  He'd like nothing more than to go back to his unabashed hedonism, but he just couldn't convince himself to outright disregard his wife's wishes,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy seemed intent on getting him the rest of the way.  \"Well that's where I come in.  Trust me Scott, I'm a pro.  I know you like to indulge and you're the best eating partner I've ever had.\"  He placed one paw on his bulging belly, stroking it affectionately.  \"Come on, we'll have a good meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a terrible influence, you know that?\"  He wasn't sure if it was Randy's words or the confident and content way that he had rubbed his gut, but Scott had finally made up his mind.  \"Tell me where to be, big guy.\"</span></div></div>",

Alex loved fried chicken although he normally was happy with a thigh and a drumbstick, tonight there were two thighs and two drumbsticks on his plate with a mountain of mashed potatoes swimming in rich gravy.

After Scott got home from work, the two of them would go through a heavy, hour long workout and then refuel with a miniature feast for dinner.  That hour of exercise meant that father and son were spending more quality time together than they had in a while, and both of them were pretty pleased with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were focused on helping Alex add the necessary weight, and so neither of them thought anything of it, or even really noticed, that most of the heavy lifting was actually being done by Alex.  Sure, Scott threw the weights around to break a pretty decent sweat, but most of his time during their hour-long weight routine was spent 'encouraging' his son.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Scott's less than impressive dedication to the weightlifting portion of their new program didn't translate to him slouching through his work at the dinner table.  The thought of watching what he ate never even entered his mind; after all, he worked all day and then came back and jumped into an hour long workout.  He needed to refuel after that, didn't he?  Besides, he would be crazy to pass up an opportunity to enjoy some of his wife's delicious cooking when he got the chance.  She had always been great in the kitchen, but ever since he had started putting on a couple pounds she had been sticking with bland health food and plain vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he happily partook of rich casseroles and delicious fried chicken, excusing his indulgences, when he even bothered to acknowledge them, as justified in due to his heavy workouts.  He got to enjoy large sundaes and freshly baked cakes without having to worry about his wife raising an eyebrow and scowling in his direction.

Did you have a good run?\"<br>\r\n\"Five miles.  Mom went over to Grandma's so you want to go out?  I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing son.  Just let me get dressed.\"<br>\r\nScott was long past the point where he wore his pants around his waist.  His growing gut pushed his pants farther and farther down under the ball of his belly but today he was having a new problem.  Instead of a firm ball, the softening flesh now made an apron of fat that lopped over the waistband.  Scott struggled to get his jeans buttoned.  <br>\r\n\"Must have put on some more weight.\" he told himself.  dropping the jeans and trying some elastic waist chinos his wife had bought him hoping to shame him into losing weight.  They were 42's, four inches bigger than what he considered his normal size of 38.  And they had an elastic waistband.  Scott figured that they would be loose enough for comfort and he would also be able to show his wife that he wasn't really fat.<br>\r\n\"Damn.\"  Scott muttered.  \"they fit.  Maybe I am fat.\"<br>\r\n\"Dad!  You coming.  I'm gonna eat the furniture.\"<br>\r\n\"Hold your horses.  I'm coming.\"<br>\r\nScott gave one last look in the mirror.  The guy looking back was no college jock.  He was a beefy, big bellied man packed into a polo shirt that showed off every curve of a belly that bulged over his belt.  Was that really him?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd had a gut for a while now, so that was nothing new, but it had been relatively round and firm up until now.  The new, soft overhang folding over his pants was a new addition, and the way his shirt stretched around it, leaving none of his curves and bulges to the imagination, left little question about his status as a fat man.  It was a lot to take in, especially so soon after finally accepting his old form. <br>\r\nHis body wasn't the only thing that had changed from the last time he'd examined his reflection.  After so many years of the daily grind at the office and marital stress at home, Scott had gotten used to seeing a middle aged man with graying, receding hair and tired, lined face.  His hair was still flecked with gray, but the reflection in the mirror today showed a much more relaxed, contented man.  He looked happy and healthy instead of worn-down and weary.<br>\r\nTo Scott, his new look was a huge improvement.  Sure, he was bigger and softer than before, but he looked and felt better than he had in years.  Having a belly was a small price to pay for such a turn around in his life.  Giving his belly a little bounce, Scott smiled and went to collect Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you worked up an appetite too dad,\" Alex said, hiding his grin behind his burger.  It hadn't taken long for them to get tired of sticking to healthy foods, and both father and son were content with eating whatever they felt like.   The newly unhealthy diet hadn't had much of an effect on Alex because of his exercising, but he did notice his dad's fatter figure.  A few weeks ago he would have been embarrassed by it, but their quality time together had changed their relationship for the better.  He hadn't even realized how much he had grown apart from his father before, but luckily that process seemed to be reversing. <br>\r\nScott decided to take it in stride.  Alex's mean spirited comments had gradually been replaced by good natured mocking.  He still liked to poke fun at his dad's big appetite, but somehow it wasn't harsh or judgemental anymore.  <br>\r\n\"Yeah well I missed breakfast, didn't I?\" he responded, polishing off his double cheeseburger with one final large bite.  He reached over and grabbed a handful of Alex's fries and dipped them into his milkshake one by one, just to make his point.  He couldn't get over how nice it was to just eat what he wanted without having to answer to anyone about it.</span></div></div>",

Shelly was such a pretty little thing- not even 5 feet tall or 100 pounds soaking wet.  She was appraising him and her eyes kept returning to his big belly.  \"Damn,\"  Scott thought to himself.  \"I must be 50 pounds heavier than the last time I saw Shelly.<br>\r\n\"That's a beautiful shirt, Mr. Adams.\"  Shelly kept her focus on Scott's big middle.  \"I love those bright flowers.

She remembered him as just another jock gone soft back when she was spending time with Adam.  Not much to get excited about but now he was a real man of substance.  Adam had been fun but she just wasn't into skinny track guys and so she had moved on.  Now she was thinking that the apple wouldn't fall too far from the tree.  Adam might be a skinny runner but maybe he just needed a good woman to make him into chip off the old block.<br>\r\nBack at home, Scott fixed himself a snack to hold him over until dinner.  He heard the front door and Adam joined him with a hefty sandwich of his own.<br>\r\n\"Hey,\"  Scott said to Adam.  \"Saw Shelly at Home Depot.  Nice to see her again.

Adam seemed insistent on matching Scott forkfull by forkfull.   Scott wondered what had happened.<br>\r\nAdam was feeling the pain but he had made a vow to match his old man at the table.  He was still giddy from this afternoon.  He had called Shelly and to his surprise she wanted to get together.  She'd been really friendly and apologetic about breaking up with him.  It didn't make any more sense than when she told him not to call but Adam didn't care. He'd been smitten with ere since 6th grade and it didn't seem like anything would stop it.

Each pound that Scott added just made him happier.  Adam joked about Scott's bulk but it wasn't hostile.  He'd been committed to getting bigger for sports but since he'd gotten back together with Shelly, Adam had rounded out.  His mid-section was decidedly convex  these days.  Scott hadn't wanted to ask and Adam hadn't shared but he would have guessed that Adam was up at least 20 pounds.  All his pants were tight riding under a rounded baby jock belly and his shirts had started riding up revealing a strip of flesh.  It was time for Adam to get some bigger clothes.<br>\r\n\"How bout I take you to breakfast?:  Scott announced when Adam lumbered down the stairs on Saturday morning.  \"It's time we spent some quality time together and I found a great place for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n\"I was going to hook up with Shelley.\"  Adam answered tugging at his tight T-shirt. <br>\r\n\"You can see her later.

All his pants were a struggle to button and he'd blown the seat out of his cargo shorts last week after a night of studying and snacking at Shelley's.  Still he wasn't sure that he liked to accept getting bigger.  So long as he was wearing 34's nothing seemed different but 36's meant that he was getting fat.  And where would it end?  His Dad used to be a pretty buff guy but he just kept getting bigger and bigger.  Still, he was hungry and going out to eat with his Dad these days meant eating all you wanted and unless he stopped eating, there would be nothing that Adam could wear.<br>\r\n\"OK, Dad, you talked me into it.

The pressure had made his gut temporarily resume the firm, round shape it had had before he'd started getting soft.  <br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he huffed, his full belly making it a bit more difficult to keep up with his energetic son.  \"What's the hurry?\"<br>\r\nAlex turned and watched his dad lumber after him.  He'd thought that working out together would encourage him to get into shape, but his old man was looking bigger than ever.  It didn't look like any of it was muscle though, unless you counted 'table muscle', he thought.  It was weird.  Here he was, watching his fatter-than-ever dad leaving a restaurant after eating a double cheeseburger, two orders of fries, half an onion ring appetizer and a milkshake, and he was leading the man into an ice cream parlor for dessert.  It was like he wanted to make his dad eat even more.<br>\r\nScott and Alex had been spending a lot more time together, and both of them had been enjoying it a lot.  Most of their time together, as it turned out, was either spent exercising or eating.  Scott had continued to join his son in their workouts, but his role was becoming more and more that of a coach or cheerleader instead of a lifting partner.  Without noticing, he had practically stopped performing any exercises of his own all together, though he still ate like a lifter.  Alex had noticed this at first and had considered being harder on his dad, for his own good of course, but their relationship was still newly mended.  He didn't want to ruin it by basically calling his dad lazy.  Besides, it was enough that they were hanging out together again.  If he didn't want to work out then they could still eat together.  His dad never turned down a meal these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them ordered huge banana splits and, despite both being pretty full, they both emptied their bowls completely.  Scott could feel his bloated gut pressing uncomfortably against the elastic waistband that he had earlier thought of as forgiving.  He wanted nothing more than to go home, lose the pants, and take a nice, long nap.  He slowly ambled out to his parked car, feeling his packed stomach rub against the steering wheel as he sat down, and drove home. <br>\r\nAlex was going to meet a few friends to hang out, so Scott had the afternoon to himself.  He didn't feel like climbing all the stairs to get to his bed when there was a perfectly good couch right there in the living room, so he settled for being somewhat less comfortable during his nap.  He struggled out of his surprisingly inadequate fat pants and, because it was so hot, decided to lose the shirt as well.  His wife would almost certainly have something to say about his fat, but he was going to be comfortable.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Without the football scholarship, I would have to go to JC.  I only have three months and I don't know how to start.  I really want to go to State and I want to play football but at that weight, I'd be even bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was quiet.  This was quite a moment.  His fit and athletic son needed to pack on 50 pounds. Was this the right thing for him to do?  He mulled the question over in his mind.  He was really torn.  Alex was by far a better athlete than his dad, a good student and great looking to boot - thanks to his mom's genes.  He could surely find another football program but at this late date, it would mean a year at JC and he wouldn't be getting the coaching or the experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sighed. \"Ok son, I'll help you get this done but it won't be easy and you are going to have to do everything I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked up gratefully from his half-eaten burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, dad; and I just want you to know that I really feel bad for calling you fat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott smiled.  \"That's ok son. I have packed on a few pounds.  It's either give up eating or gain a little weight.  I'm just not ready to starve myself but back to you.  Are you ready to get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then finish that burger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alex was stuffing the burger down, Scott motioned the waiter over and ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your conversation with Chris on Bigger Directions has given you something to look forward to, unlike the rest of your life which seems to be following the regular routine. Nagging wife, boring dead end job, growing distant from the kids. You have another chat with Chris on Sunday night and you talk about movies, a couple of restaurants you enjoy (mainly family ones lately, since you're pretty tied to your kids) and a couple of other things. <br>\r\nWednesday arrives and you step on the scale to see you're 3 pounds heavier then you were on Friday with the first chat with Chris. You log in to Bigger Directions and see a new message in your inbox from MHEn, aka Chris, saying: Looking foreword to seeing you tonight at 8. <br>\r\nYou reply by saying: Me too, see you there.<br>\r\nYou log off and clear the internet history and pile into your car and drop off your daughter at work and quickly sneak in a MacDonald's drive-thru breakfast before heading to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day at work seems to just drag on, the same old, same old. Boring repetitive reports to do and such. Lunch time is a bit of a breath of fresh air as you grab a double cheeseburger and fries from downstairs and return to your desk satisfied and catch yourself running your hand over your belly once or twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the work day comes to a close and you mousy on home to see your wife is just about done cooking chicken breasts and vegetables. Not your favorite meal by far, but will still do. You tell her you're going to go out to Rob, a friend from work, to watch a game. She accepts and you head upstairs and get changed into something a little less formal. You dig out your 36\" jeans and a plain white t-shirt. You pull the jeans up over your thighs and realize there's a little less room to fit into. Doing up the button is a bit of a struggle and the idea of buying bigger pants kind of excites you. You look at yourself in the full length mirror and grab your belly and give it a shake and smile to yourself. You slip the shirt on just in time to hear the dinner call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner wasn't as filling as hoped for, then again all the meals your wife cooks can't all be filling and fattening. You help with the clean up and help your daughter with some homework and soon it's 7:45 and grab the car keys and kiss your wife goodbye and head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinny's Doughnut and Coffee Shop is on the opposite side of town and about a 10 minute drive. You're feeling a little nervous meeting Chris. He's the first guy you've ever met from online. Let alone a sexual fetish site. You have butterflies in your stomach and haven't been this nervous since your son Alex took a baseball to the head and was out cold for half an hour.<br>\r\nYou arrive at the Doughnut Shop to see it's pretty empty looking.

You drive out of the drive thru lane and back onto the road.<br>\r\n\"Where to now?\" you ask feeling pretty excited.<br>\r\n\"How about the old Stitch Mall parking lot?\" suggests Chris. The Stitch mall is commonly referred to as the \"Old Fogies Mall\" since most of the stores cater to senior's and is super slow and no one goes there. Most of the stores close at 6pm there, except for the small grocery store.<br>\r\n\"Great idea,\" you say and feel your belly rumble a bit.<br>\r\n\"Must be a sign big guy,\" Chris says and gives your belly a quick pat.<br>\r\nThe drive to Stitch Mall takes a couple of minutes while the fumes of the fast food waft through the air and make you hungrier. You eventually reach the parking lot and swing around to the back to see it's empty. You pull into the middle and park the car and turn off the engine and switch it to the radio only.<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" you ask a little nervous looking at Chris, since it's your first time.<br>\r\n\"Well you can unbuckle yourself and lean the seat back and get ready,\" Chris winks unbuckling his seatbelt and opening the bag.<br>\r\nYou do as your told and unbuckle the seatbelt and push your seat back and lean it back and look over at Chris to see he's already unwrapped the first Big Mac. He leans forward and brings the burger up to your mouth and slowly brings it closer to your mouth, then takes it back, ever so slightly teasing you.<br>\r\n\"Com'on, I'm hungry,\" you complain.<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Chris smiles and guides the burger up against your lips while you take your first bite. You feel Chris' other hand go to your belly and slowly begin rubbing it. Slowly the burger disappears into your belly.<br>\r\n\"Drink please,\" you ask and Chris nods and grabs the Coke from the cup holder and hands it to you as he gets the second Big Mac ready. You let out a burp and smack your belly which seems to get Chris to perk up.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was a good one there big guy,\" Chris says leaning back and taking the Coke with one hand and presenting the burger with the other.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say and take a bite of the second burger. You have to admit this event is turning you on to no end, Chris' hands on your belly seem to find every little roll and gives them a little squeeze and also circles your belly button with his finger. As you eat the second burger you soon feel Chris pull your shirt out of your pants and slips his hands under your shirt and his warm hands run across your hairy belly making you tingle and stand up straight under your pants.<br>\r\n\"Like that?\" asks Chris pushing the burger forward into your mouth.<br>\r\nYou take another bite and nod.<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Chris agrees and lets you chew as he slips his index finger into your belly button and fingers around in there,\" You have a nice soft belly.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say and take another bite from the burger.<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to see it get bigger,\" Chris smiles and gives it a slap.<br>\r\n\"It's up.. 3 pounds since you sent me the first message,\" you say chewing your food.<br>\r\n\"Not bad big daddy,\" Chris smiles,\" Let's see how fast we can pack on 10 pounds.\"<br>\r\nYou take the last bite of the second Big Mac and lick Chris' fingers greedily. Chris smirks and grabs the fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris slowly feeds you on fry at a time while his hands explore more and more of your belly and makes his way up to your chest. His hands slowly cup your growing moobs and his fingers circle around your nipples making you moan.<br>\r\n\"You like that?\" Chris says looking into your eyes and gives your nipple a pinch.<br>\r\n\"Oh god yes,\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Chris says and feeds you another fry.<br>\r\n\"That was the last one fat daddy,\" Chris says and looks at your longing eyes and leans forward and you can feel his warm breath on your face and soon his lips press up against yours. You kiss back while the boy's hands go straight to your belly. You feel his tongue press up against your lips as you kiss back and ventre your own tongue outward. You haven't done that in years with your wife. <br>\r\nFinally after a kiss that feels like forever Chris comes up for air and says,\" Wow, you're a good kisser too.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say breathing deep.<br>\r\nChris winks at you and goes in for round two while his hands explore your meaty torso and your hands run down his lean back and feel his tight butt. You're lost in the moment and suddenly remember your wife and 2 sons Alex and Greg and your daughter Misty. But all your worries melt away in the lips of the young college stud kissing your lips and rubbing your belly.<br>\r\nChris comes up for air again and tells you,\" Lean back all the way.\"<br>\r\nYou nod and use the lever to push the seat backwards so your belly faces the ceiling of the car while Chris bends over and begins to kiss your bloated belly while rubbing your chest.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, that feels good,\" you moan in pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Tell me if you feel uncomfortable,\" Chris says in-between kisses and moves up closer to your chest.<br>\r\n\"Don't stop,\" you moan as Chris begins to kiss one of your nipples while rubbing your belly.<br>\r\nYou feel like you could explode from pleasure, then you feel Chris's hand go for your pant's button and pops it open and unzips you. <br>\r\n\"Someone's excited,\" Chris says and gives you a quick kiss on the lips while he fishes you out of your underwear.<br>\r\nYou moan in pleasure as he slowly begins to stroke you and kiss you.<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you long before you feel yourself become overcum with pleasure and are left spent breathing heavy.<br>\r\n\"Oh wow,\" Chris says giving you another kiss,\" that was amazing big guy.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" you say with a smile,\" How about you?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.. I got enough fodder to last me a week now,\" Chris smiles and smacks your slightly wet belly,\" We'll have to do this again soon.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you say and grab a klneex and start to clean up your mess.<br>\r\nYou drive Chris home and promise to meet up with him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive home and feel your heart sink. You just realize you cheated on your wife and your heart sinks. Years of devotion flushed down the toilet in a night of cheap takeout food and feeding. You walk back into your home.</span></div></div>",

He skipped desert and passed on those donuts at work.  He even started hitting the gym again and was sore all over from the exercise.  All this effort made him feel better about himself and hopeful that his wife would get her old feeling back and stop treating him like a fat old man who just happened to be sharing a bed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fling was over.

You know of it, and know there's only a handful of stores there and it doesn't get good traffic. According to Chris, the best buffet in town is there and he wants to see you do some real damage to it and see how much you can eat. You can feel your mouth watering, belly grumbling and woody standing already. <br>\r\nYou hesitate replying at first. Having coffee with a boy about half your age is one thing, having dinner with him is another. Then you remember what it felt like to be stuffed with MacDonalds in the empty parking lot of the Stitch Mall as Chris massaged your stuffed belly and gave you the most erotic evening you've had in years. <br>\r\nYou write the reply and tell him that two days from now you'll be able to escape the house for the evening and will be able to indulge. <br>\r\nYou hit the send button and smile to yourself while your third leg tingles with anticipation.<br>\r\nYou tell your wife that you and a friend will be hitting up a bar for one of the games that's on TV and she agrees to let you go for the evening, but warns you not to eat much since you're putting on weight.<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself and think,<i>' She has no idea.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day is the same old boring routine only dragged on by your eager desire to see if Chris had replied yet. You arrive home and find your wife has once again made another boring diet meal for you that all tastes all watered down. You debate escaping and getting some drive thru, but you decide to wait until tomorrow. You check your e-mail to see that Chris is up for the buffet tomorrow and tells you to pick him up at 7.<br>\r\nYou fall asleep that night with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day goes by in a flash, you seem to be on cloud nine waiting for the evening. You arrive home from work and get changed into a comfortable pair of pants and a shirt that's maybe a bit too tight that perfectly shows off the curve of your belly. You walk downstairs and your wife looks at you and says,\" Scott, you're not seriously going to wear that shirt out are you?\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with it?\" you ask playing dumb.<br>\r\n\"It's too tight, go put on something that fits better,\" she tells you.<br>\r\n\"It fits fine,\" you say looking down at it.<br>\r\n\"It's going to ride up the moment you eat something,\" she scoffs.<br>\r\n\"No it won't dear, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n\"Just enjoy your night,\" she wishes.<br>\r\n\"I'll try.\"<br>\r\nYou leave the house and climb into your car and take off down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you long before you're at Chris apartment building and he's eagerly awaiting you. He races over to the car and climbs into the passenger side with a grin on his face and says,\" Hey fat man.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say with a grin on your face.<br>\r\n\"Ready to show me how much you can eat?\" he asks and gives your belly a pat.<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" you say and hold his hand on your belly.<br>\r\n\"Then let's go,\" Chris encouragers.<br>\r\nYou agree and back out of the parking spot and head towards the buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the Gateway Buffet and see there's only two other cars parked there. Chris leads the way to the door and the wonderful smell of food fills the air and makes your belly grumble.<br>\r\n\"Someone's hungry.\"<br>\r\n\"Very,\" you say and run a hand over your belly.<br>\r\n\"Better eat lots for me,\" Chris says and opens the door.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that,\" you wink.<br>\r\n\"Welcome,\" says a young waitress at the desk.<br>\r\n\"2 for the buffet,\" Chris requests.<br>\r\n\"Very well, seat yourself and enjoy,\" she says and points you towards the buffet selection, which is empty. You guess that it's only Chris, the waitress, a cook or two and you in the entire resturant.<br>\r\nYou head towards the assortment of food being kept warm from heat lamps and grab a plate and begin to pile food on it.<br>\r\n\"You can always get seconds, or fifths,\" Chris says in a whisper.<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\nOnce your plate is full you find Chris sitting at a table with his own plate full, you join him and begin eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on your second plate when someone else walks in.. but who?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With every new session with Chris your stomach is becoming more and more of an erotic center of your body. Whenever you wear a tight shirt, whenever you bump into something, when you find yourself rubbing your belly, when you're stuffed full a good rub or touch and get you going. Especially when you're full. Seeing your belly bloated out in front of you makes your belly very sensitive and you absolutely love the feeling. You find yourself escaping the house after even more diet meals from your wife to hit up the closest convenience store or fast food joint for a quick fix to fill your belly, or a hitting up a doughnut shop or drive through on the way to work, or on the way home. <br>\r\nYou find yourself in your bedroom trying to do up your pair of 36\"s to see that they're not going to last much longer at the rate you're going. You're 3 pounds off the big 2-0-0. During college you never expected you'd wind up being this fat and happy about it. You give yourself a slap on the belly and smile to yourself and wonder what 220 feels like, or even 250 or even.. dare you dream it.. 300 pounds. You're shocked at the idea in your head. A 300 pound Scott. <br>\r\nThe idea of slowly becoming 300 pounds stays with you the entire day and you're glad you've made arrangements to go to Chris' apartment for the evening to really be fed for the first time. You wonder what your cute young feeder has in store for you. You wouldn't be surprised if Chris feeds you so well that you wake up tomorrow at 200 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Scott?\" came the voice of your wife as you make your way towards the door for work.<br>\r\n\"Yeah Laura?\" you ask turning back to her and feel your belly jiggle ever so slightly under your shirt.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you have to go out with your friends tonight?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Well you're the one who told me to be more outgoing and make more friends,\" you answer truthfully since you don't mix well with her snotty friends.<br>\r\n\"Can't you have one of your get togethers over here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I would, but most of the boys are bachelors and have some pretty foul habits,\" you lie,\" You and I know how hard it is to get the smell of cigarettes out of the house and how you don't want Greg and Misty exposed to foul language. Tensions run pretty high during some of the games.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she says with a bit of a sigh,\" Can we have a quiet night soon?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you agree knowing it will only result in a boring meal at a high class restaurant that will only leave you starving and awkward attempt at sex after words where Laura will just complain about where you stick your member and give up after a minute.<br>\r\n\"I gotta go to work, see you, love you,\" you wish.<br>\r\n\"Love you too,\" she says and you head out into your car and decide to hit up MacDonald's to top up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night you find yourself outside of Chris' apartment and you buzz his number and your belly growls loudly knowing the feast ahead of it.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" comes Chris voice through the intercom.<br>\r\n\"Hey, big guy here to eat your food,\" you tell him knowing there's no one around.<br>\r\n\"Coooooommme on up big guy,\" Chris says in a teasing manor and presses the right button to buzz you in.<br>\r\nYou head over to the elevator and take it up to the third floor and quickly find room 312 and give it a light rapping.<br>\r\nChris arrives at the door and opens it up and invites you in.<br>\r\nAs soon as the door is closed he wraps his arms around you and gives you a hug while his hands grab a hold of your love handles and gives them a shake. Your nose takes in the scents of the new location. The smell of deodorant and shampoo from Chris the smell of garlic and tomato fills the air of the apartment causing your belly to growl loudly.<br>\r\n\"Somebody's hungry,\" Chris says stepping back and looking down at your belly.<br>\r\n\"Just a bit,\" you admit feeling a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"Do come in,\" Chris says inviting you in,\" It's not much, but it's home.\"<br>\r\nYou take off your shoes and coat and walk forward to see the small little kitchen that looks into the living room. You see a door leading the bathroom and a door leading to a bedroom, not much, but perfect for a college student.<br>\r\n\"Nice place,\" you comment looking at the decent sized 26\" TV and some hand me down couches which have seen firmer days.<br>\r\n\"It's nice, gets the job done. Probably isn't as big as your place in the suburbs,\" Chris says,\" Supper is nearly done. Just needs for the sauce to cool, the toast to toast and the wine to be opened.\"<br>\r\nWithin 15 minutes the tity bity dining room table was full of spaghetti, meat sauce, garlic bread and two plates.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully no one barges in on us this time,\" Chris joked setting down two wine glasses and poured some cheaper red wine into them.<br>\r\n\"You really didn't have to do this,\" you say feeling yourself blush.<br>\r\n\"But I want to, what kind of encourager would I be if I didn't?\" Chris winked and patted your belly.<br>\r\n\"Depends on how well you cook,\" you wink back and eyed the food,\" But if it tastes as good as it looks then I'd have to say you're a good one.\"<br>\r\n\"Then eat up fat boy, and don't be shy about asking for belly rubs mid meal,\" Chris encouraged taking his seat.<br>\r\nYou agree and begin to pile your plate high with the italian feast before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feast slowly vanishes, you swallow about half the garlic bread and a good portion of the spaghetti and meat sauce. About 70% through the meal Chris swings his around behind yours and reaches around and begins rubbing your slowly expanding belly while he tells how impressed he is at the amount of food you're eating while his warm breath blows against your neck and ears. You soon find your pants getting a bit too tighter and you unbutton them and unzip them to give yourself a bit more room for eating. With Chris rubbing your belly and encouraging you every step of the way, you find a way to finish off the noodles and sauce in front of you and you've never felt this full in your entire life.<br>\r\n\"Ooommph, I think I'm done,\" you say leaning back in your chair and resting your hands on your bloated belly.<br>\r\n\"Nice job fat man,\" Chris says getting out of his seat and surveying the damage,\" Go lay down on the couch and  I'll clean up here.\"<br>\r\nYou nod lazily knowing the couch would be much more comfortable then the chair which was digging into your back a bit. You slowly raise to your feet and feel a little tipsy with all the wine and food in your heavy belly and slowly make your way over to the couch and lay down while Chris goes to work cleaning the dishes.<br>\r\nYou lie on the couch rubbing your bloated belly for a couple of minutes while Chris tosses over compliments on eating all the food, making it easier to clean and just how impressed he is with how much food you've eaten.<br>\r\nYou hear the last dish hit the drying rack and Chris walks into the living room with a smirk on his face,\" Not bad fat man.\"<br>\r\nHe sits down next to you and runs his hands over your exposed hairy belly,\" Now I know how much you can pack away.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" you say with a smile,\" I think I even out did my own expectations.\"<br>\r\n\"Even better,\" Chris says rubbing a little bit harder causing you to moan in pleasure and your third leg stand up straight, begging for attention,\" We haven't even had dessert yet.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think I need a few minutes to digest this,\" you say and gives your gut a slap.<br>\r\n\"No problem fat man,\" Chris says sitting down on your lap with his knees pressing up against your love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Chris do?</span></div></div>",

I love it,\" you moan gently,\" It's great not worrying about what I eat and how much of it I eat. When I was in college I never would have thought I'd get anywhere close to 200 pounds, but here I am.\"<br>\r\n\"All of you,\" Chris says with a giggle and shakes your belly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I found myself wondering what the next 100 pounds would be like and how people would react to it,\" you say and Chris' face slightly shifts to a nervous look,\" Like a couple of high school pals who see I've gone from jock to exjock to just a plain old fat guy with a big beer belly.\"<br>\r\nChris laughs and his smile returns. He continues to rub your belly and finally asks,\" So how about me?\"<br>\r\n\"You? You're amazing Chris,\" you answer truthfully,\" I haven't had this much fun in years. And I mean that. I think I was down to masturbating once a month, now I want to give myself a stroke almost every time this gut gets full or I see my reflection in a tight shirt. Seeing your e-mails in my inbox gets me excited for the rest of the day and knowing you'd approve of me taking an extra doughnut at work, or cookie at home really makes my day. Why do you ask.\"<br>\r\n\"It's just that...\" Chris says and his hands stop rubbing your bloated belly.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask looking up at the college kid sitting on your upper thighs.<br>\r\n\"It's just that.. you're married and I like how you love to eat and... I... I just want something that will last. I don't want to be some guy's midlife crisis fling,\" Chris answers welling up with tears looking down at your belly.<br>\r\n\"Chris, Chris,\" you say trying to sit up, despite the pressure on your full belly. You finally sit up you hug the young man next to you,\" I don't mean to hurt you. You are an amazing young man.\"<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" Chris says wiping his tear out of his left eye, his warm breath whispering across your face.<br>\r\n\"I know so,\" you answer,\" You're smart, kind, can handle yourself in a conversation, you know how to cook, you know your way around the city, you're cute, your smile could capture anyone. You're... just amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Scott,\" Chris says starting to smile again,\" You're pretty awesome too.\"<br>\r\n\"I try,\" you answer and blush.<br>\r\n\"But you understand if I don't want to move forward physically right?\" Chris asks.<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" you answer with a smile and grab a hold of Chris' hands,\" As long as you keep rubbing my full belly, I think I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Scott,\" Chris says and leans forward causing you fall backwards on the couch with Chris following. You land on your back and Chris lands on top of your bloated belly and kisses you on the lips. The soft young lips on yours while the stubble from your face and his feels amazing as you both move your lips back and forwards. Chris slides to your side and moves his face away from yours with a smile. He rests his hand on your belly while your arm is wrapped around his shoulder. You spend what feels like forever in your close cuddle hug in silence while Chris gently rubs your bloated belly.<br>\r\nEventually your belly grumbles for more and Chris is quick to his feet to bring over the tub of Mint Chocolate chip ice cream, your favorite flavor. He sits on the edge of the couch and slowly feeds you spoonful after spoonful until your belly is once again stuffed and gives you another belly rub before you decide to head on home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home you reflect on what Chris said and realize he's right. Are you having a mid life crisis? Are you going to dump your young feeder to return to your wife or when you get bored with gaining? Is there a future for Chris in your life? You really do care for him. He's on the smartest and sweetest guys you've ever met, young or old. What if you do somehow find yourself divorced and with Chris, leaving your 40 odd year old wife for a 20 odd year old college boy would make people talk. At the moment you decide to continue your affair with the hot young college student who knows how to rub your belly the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that week..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You made sure to remove the tag from your pants so your wife Laura wouldn't nag at you some more about your waist size.

He just promised Laura that he would take care of himself for her and the kids and let her decide what that might mean.  She promised to help him by cooking healthy and keeping temptations out of his way. They made love for the first time in months and went to sleep in each others arms.  Life would be hard for a few weeks while Scott's second phase kicked in.<br>\r\nScott pulled into the drive through lane at McDonalds and ordered four breakfast sandwiches and a latte.  This morning Laura had fixed him breakfast just like when they were first married only instead of two eggs, hash browns, sausage and coffee, it was a poached egg on dry toast with juice. He was starving.<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" he told Amy when she offered him a donut at work.  He was going to do nothing that would make Laura suspicious about his plan.  No one at work would be able to say that Scott was cheating on his diet.  He'd have to suffer for a while but in the long run, it would all work out.  A salad with the gang left him weak at the end of the day but a few burgers and a shake on the way to the gym revived his spirits.  Then he hurried home to see how Laura responded to the first step in his plan to get his life back under control.  If Laura gained some weight, Scott was certain that the she might not be so critical.  He had ordered a five-pound box of hand dipped chocolates be delivered 'to Laura, my sweetheart'.

You've blown up pretty good lately.\"<br>\r\nScott wasn't self-conscious any more about his size.  He liked it and  made a point of showing off his big belly.  <br>\r\nNow that Laura had taken up cooking as a hobby, Scott no longer had to hold back.  He could eat when he liked and what he liked and Laura's explorations of gourmet treats meant lots of opportunities to eat delicious, satisfyingly rich and filling food in increasingly large quantities.  <br>\r\n\"So what gourmet treat did Laura fix for you last night. You're looking full and content this morning. Big guy.\"<br>\r\nScott enjoyed the banter with his younger, fitter co-workers. They were envious he was certain of Scott's lifestyle.  Maybe they weren't ready to embrace the consequences but give them time. <br>\r\nScott leaned back in his chair, belly rounding out high and wide.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a new love.\" he confessed.  \"Laura has been learning how to make confit and it's the best thing I've ever tasted. I could eat it all day long.\"<br>\r\n\"You're becoming quite the gourmet. So what is this confit anyway?'<br>\r\n\"The world is full of amazing dishes, I'm learning.

Only Scott hadn't stopped with just being an overweight ex jock and instead of being embarrassed by his extra weight, he was proud of every pound.<br>\r\n\"I don't know anyone who would classify you as skinny, Scott, let alone TOO skinny.  You are the biggest guy I know.  I can't forget how you used to look when I started here five years ago- 185 pounds of jock.  I don't think I'd ever have believed you would become such a tub of lard.  And never that you'd be happy about it. You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\nScott leaned back in his chair, big belly bulging big in front of him.  He clapsed his hands across it and rocked slowly.<br>\r\n\"I can understand.\"  Scott was feeling mellow.  He was way beyond embarrassment at the snickers behind his back or comments like Wades'.  Heck, 5 years ago he'd probably have made the same comments.  But a lot of water had flowed over the dam since those naive days.  \"I'd probably have thought just like you back then.  I never expected to get this big.  But then I never knew how to live back then.  My priorities back then were pain instead of pleasure.  I worked out every day and ate tasteless food.  I depraved myself of pleasure and lived up to other peoples expectations. Now I please myself and the man you see today is the result.  I confess that I enjoy a good meal.  I gave up torturing myself at the gym and I don't bore myself silly running.  I've grown up. My wife loves me more today than back when I was struggling to stay skinny.  \"<br>\r\nWade suppressed a snicker.  Grown up was certainly an understatement. <br>\r\n\"I have to say that you sure seem happy these days.\"  Wade answered.  \"You used to be kind of a prick.\"  <br>\r\n\"But now I'm just a cuddly Teddy bear?\"  <br>\r\nWade backtracked.  All this talk about Scott's bulk was messing up his mind.  \"I didn't mean a prick, exactly. You used to be hard to talk to, kind of intimidating.\"<br>\r\nScott chuckled.  \"Not a problem these days, is it.  You start running, I'd never catch you.  Not that I'd waste the effort.  It's funny how your priorities change.  Seriously though,  haven't you every thought about letting yourself have some pleasure- eating something tasty?\"<br>\r\nWade thought for a moment then ansered,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In addition shw was from the South with a delicate accent the drove Waid crazy.  She even knew how to cook and didn't mind demonstrating her skills.  To top it all off, she had never let Waid take her to bed depite all his efforts.  She loved to play around but wasn't willing to go all the way.  Girls never said no to Waid and her resistence frustrated his ego. Maybe that was why he was still dating Ashley six months after they met.  He watched her walk ahead of him into the restaurant entraced by her walk and the curves of her hips.  Then as the waiter seated her, he admired her lovely face and beautiful breasts. He unbuttoned his well-tailored blazer revealing the way his fitted dress shirt showed off his chest and lean waist.  He watched her watch his body.  Maybe tonight would be the night when Ashley would finally say yes.<br>\r\nThey ordered.  Waid, a green salad, broiled chicken breast and steamed vegetables and Ashley fettucini alfredo,  saltimboca and creamed spinach. He used to order the delicious dishes that Ashely picked but  stopped when his pants got tight.  Now he ordered carefully.  Ashley could apparently eat anything and keep her figure.  Waid could not.  If Waid ate like Ashley, he'd be as big as Scott.  <br>\r\n\"MM.\"  Ashley said after the first bite of her pasta.  \"This is really good.  You should try some.\"<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\"  Waid replied. \"You know those rich sauces give me indigestion.\"<br>\r\nHis was lying.  He wanted eating something good instead of the tasteless diet food but no way would he let himself get fat.<br>\r\nAshely smiled.  \"I don't believe you sweetie but suit yourself.\"<br>\r\nAs they chatted and ate, Waid noticed another couple enter the restaurant and walk over to a corner booth.  The woman was attractive but Waid couldn't help watching her excort.  He was about Waid's age and height.  He had the strut of a jock but he was clearly packing more pounds than  when he bought the suit he was stuffed into.  Still he wasn't self-consious about the round gut stretching his shirtfront and just beginning to sag over his belt.  It brushed against the table as he squeezed into the booth.  Waid would have been ambarrassed but the man didn't seem to notice.  <br>\r\nThen the man looked over.  He smiled and wiggled his fat belly back out of the booth and walked over to ther table.  <br>\r\n\"Ashley.\" the man called in a deep voice, \"I thought it was you.  How have you been?\"<br>\r\n'John,\"  Ashley answered.  \"It's good to see you.\"<br>\r\nJohn smiled back.<br>\r\n\"You are just as pretty as ever.\"<br>\r\n\"And you get more handsome every time I see you.\"<br>\r\n\"And fatter. \"  John grinned and patted his gut.<br>\r\n\"You carry it well.  Is that your bride?\"<br>\r\n\"The love of my life.\"  John answered.  \"Carrie.\"<br>\r\nJohn turned to Waid and put out his hand.  \"John Bradshaw,\" he announced.<br>\r\n\"Waid Hogarth,  Glad ti neet you.\"<br>\r\n\"We used to date back in college.\"  Ashley answered after John returned to his booth. \"Haven't seen him for a couple of years now. Looks like he mellowed out.  He was always so tense and driven.\"<br>\r\nWaid watched John and his wife order a Jim Brady sized dinner.  The wife nibbled and John finished both dinners.  Meanwhile Ashley was eating desert while Waid had coffee.  <br>\r\nNo wonder Waid resisted marriage.  It was hard enough staying lean while single and dating.  Marriage was the road to fat.<br>\r\nAshley finished her desert.<br>\r\n\"That was really good.\"  she said.</span></div></div>",

Fully half of his new friends worked blue collar jobs as mechanics, truck drivers and the like.  They usually worked jobs that let them off in the afternoon.  The others might be accountants and IT guys but most no longer showed any vestige of preppy ofricedom- at least after hours.  Boss, the informal leader of the bunch was actually a corporate honcho for a cable company.  Waid had seen him once dressed for work in a tsnt-sized dress shirt and skinny black tie, his hair slicked back in a slick corporate pony tail.  In the bar, he was letting it all hang out, all 400 pounds of him filling a tank top filled to overflow and  50 inch jeans held up by big read suspenders.

He wanted to be just like Boss.  Billy Bob, his leutenant was bigger but also softer with a huge ass and pillowy moobs.  There was muscle underneath but you wouldn't know it at first glance.  Waid had seen some sorry bastard try to push Billy Bob around and end up in the hospital.  Billy Bob was tough and bigger than Boss but Waid prefered the hard fat on Boss to the soft fat on Billy Bob.  Still, either look was better than Waid's preppy pretty boy.  <br>\r\n\"I need two beers.\"  Waid told Max at the bar.  He laid out a twnty.  \"And one for me.

His boss took the resignation and told Waid to clear his desk and get out.  No hard feelings but he didn't want Waid to have the chance to take any clients with him.  Waid was happy enough.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Packing a change of clothes and a shaving kit, Waid headed out of town on his bike.  He'd only ridden with the pack a few times, never solo. Today he was ready for adventure.  He had made a few mental notes as his biker buds talked about their rides.  He was headed for the mountains ready for some cooler breezes and eager to check out some of the diners, roadhouses and bars, maybe meet some new friends and have some experiences of his own to share when he got back.<br>\r\nIt was nearly 6 when Waid reached his first stop.  After two hours on the road, Waid was hungry again and thirsty too.  The Foothill Roadhouse had a reputation as a biker friendly place with a few cabins in the back.  He got his pick since it was only Tuesday and after a quick shower Waid squeezed himself into his new 36 inch jeans.  He'd bought them as encouragement after Ashley's rejection but way before he had anticipate they weren't 'fat' pants anymore.  He probably needed to find someplace to upgrade. \"Anyway,\" he told himself, \"The tight jeans just made his belly look bigger.  He was over the flat, rock hard abs and tonight it didn't seem that anyone would not see that.<br>\r\nInside the roadhouse a jukebox was playing country-western.  Waid wasn't into that either but it seemed to go with the territory.  Two good old boys were playing pool in the back.  There were a few diners in the booths down the side but the bar had some empty places and Waid headed there.  The three bar stool occupants were apparently not there together.  Waid sized them up.  It reminded him of Goldilocks and the three bears.  One guy was lean, the next guy was superfat and the last one down on the end was just rigfht. He was Waid's age and height but 50 to 75 pounds heavier. Waid walked over to him and sat down.  The guy was an inspiration for Waid- an image of how Waid would like to look when he grew up.<br>\r\nHe signaled the bartender for a beer and then took a big drink.  \"Nothing like a cold beer after a long hot ride.\" he thought.<br>\r\nThen he turned to his neighbor and said. \"Nice Day.\"<br>\r\nThe guy grunted and continued shoveling what appeared to be a family-sized Sheperd's pie.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well.\"  Waid thought.  \"The evening is young.\"<br>\r\nWaid ordered some wings and another beer.  He debated moving to another place at the bar but decided it was too much trouble. He was just looking over the menu after ordering a third beer when he heard.<br>\r\n\"New around here aren't you.\"<br>\r\nThe voice was deep, impersonal but not unfriendly.<br>\r\n\"Just up from the city.\"  Waid answered.  \"Checking out the higher altitudes.  Name's Waid.\"<br>\r\nWaid reached out his hand and the big man took it in a firm grip.<br>\r\n\"Dave.\" he growled. \"Didnt mean to be rude but around here, its not polite to interupt a man eating.  You may not appreciate it, being the skinny twink type, but this country boy appreciates his food.  My bud Decker is the chef here and that pie I just enjoyed was something special he fixed for me.  It's a bit more substantial than the regular menu item.\"<br>\r\nWaid admired the expansice belly on Dave.<br>\r\n\"Must take quite a bit to fill that tank.\" he said grinning.  \"It's a regular work of art.\"<br>\r\n\"More like gluttony.\" Dave responded.  \"But it does satisfy.  You planning to eat here? \"<br>\r\n\"Got all evening.  Planning to take my time but yes, my friends tell me that the food is good here.\"<br>\r\n\"It is.\"  Dave chuckled.  \"I was skinny like you the first time I came here, didn't really appreciate food but I recovered\"<br>\r\n\"So what do you weigh?\"  Waid asked.  He was worried about offending his new friend but Dave laughed.<br>\r\n\"Haven't been on a scale lately but last time I was it said</span></div></div>",

Dave and Waid had hit it off after a slow start.  Dave had suggested some rides and good places to eat.  Dave hadd told him to stop by the shop in the morning and he would show him around. Dave was quite the chow hound and Waid had been swept along.  Big Dave was quite the inspiration to Waid and this morning he was still feeling heavy. Dave might have 75 pounds on him but Waid could dream.<br>\r\nWaid nodded at the waitress, a bit puzzled.<br>\r\n\"Dave said to expect you although I should have figured that a city boy would sleep late.  I'll put your order in.  Sit where you like.  Want some coffee?\"<br>\r\nWaid had planned on some coffee but he was still full from last night.  \"Coffee.\" he mumbled.

That's real cream.\"<br>\r\nThe strong brew was starting to clear the fog in Waid's head when the food started to arrive.  First an omelette stuffed with cheese and sausage surronded by a heap of fried potatoes. Waid started to protest that he wasn't that hungry but she cut him off.<br>\r\n\"Dave said that you had a big appetite.  He said that you'd probably be embarrassed but to pay you no mind.  He said to tell you that he expects you to eat everything and then lick the platter like any respectable mountain man.\"<br>\r\nWaid ate.  Stopping for his breath once or twice. he finished the omelette, a double stack of flpajacks with bacon and finally biscuits and gravy washed down by a gallon of cream loaded coffee.<br>\r\n\"No more.\" he pleaded. His packed belly had ballooned from the stuffing.  I don't think I can move.<br>\r\n\"If you are full then Dave will be pleased.  \"<br>\r\nWaid struggled to his feet then dug into his jeans for his wallet. They were skin tight.<br>\r\nAs he paid, Waid asked the waitress where he might get some bigger jeans.<br>\r\n\"If I keep eating like this, I'll need to upgrade my wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n\"Jim's Country Store.\" she told him. \"Two blocks down on the right.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\"  Waid replied.  \"I'll stop by on my to Dave's Shop.\"</span></div></div>",

He was also enjoying the bigger bulge of his gut due to  his vacation eating binge.  <br>\r\nDave was looking big in his coveralls.  \"Get enough to eat?\"  he said after shaking Waid's hand.<br>\r\n\"More than enough.\"  Waid answered.<br>\r\nDave showed him around the shop.

What about your cholesterol? \"<br>\r\nThis conversation was blowing Wade's mind.  He'd been a committed health nut since college, running religiously, shunning carbs and fat and maintaining a 32 inch waist.  Wade's life was tightly controlled and gave him tremendous satisfaction.  At 32, Wade could still wear clothes from college.  While his friends began packing on pounds, Wade held the line and enjoyed their envy.  His friends were constantly dieting even as they kept getting bigger.  None of them was happy with a belly and their unhappiness motivated Wade's discipline.  Never had anything disturbed Wade's discipline until now.  Scott clearly enjoyed letting go and becoming a fat man.  He didn't envy Wade one bit. He even seemed to feel sorry for him.<br>\r\n\"You've been brainwashed, Waid.\"  Scott answered.  \"All this weight propaganda is hogwash.  It's ok to be skinny when you are young.  That's the way it is supposed to be but the human body isn't designed to stay skinny.  Look around you.  How many people have your discipline?  And that's what it takes to keep your college weight.  When's the last time you enjoyed a meal or felt full?  You're the guy that should be worried about your health. Life's too short to deprive yourself.\"<br>\r\nWaid couldn't help remembering how his dieting friends kept falling off their diets, eating cheesburgers and fries whil Waid ate steamed vegetables and dry salads. Waid hadn't let himself have a cheesburger for years.  Was his 32 inch waist worth this starvation?  <br>\r\n\"I guess we each have our own standards, \" Waid answered.  <br>\r\nScott's big belly rumbled loudly.  <br>\r\n\"You'll have to excuse me.\" he told Waid.  \"I've got some serious business to take care of.<br>\r\nScott lurched heavily out or his chair.

It's a comfortable place to spend the evenings in a more social setting.  They like their regular customers and you settle right in having a beer - or four and digging into the complementary appetizers, not that you need anything to simulate your appetite.  Without Laura's constraints, you pretty much eat anything that comes your way.  You get to know the staff enough for greetings and such and wave hello to the regulars when you settle in each night.  It doesn't make up for not being with your family but at least you arn't alone It wasn't the life you expected when Laura couldn't accept that you were happy being fat and getting fatter.  The idea of a guy getting off on your big belly made you uncomfortable at first but then you decided why not.  And then Chris wasn't ready for a full time commitment.  Well if this bar is the center of your new life, maybe you needed to get more involved with the regulars.  Get to know them and learn their stories.  At least you wouldn't be so lonely. You look around and see someone about your age who you recognize as a regular.  You've waved to him from time to time but don't know his name.  You decide to introduce yourself and see where it goes.<br>\r\nYou sit next to him at the bar and introduce yourself.<br>\r\n\"Name's Scott.  I've seen you here for a while and thought I'd just say hello.\"<br>\r\nYou offer your hand and after a moment, he puts down his beer and takes it.  <br>\r\n\"I'm Rick.  Seen you too.  How you doing Scott.\"<br>\r\nYou make small talk about the game and the weather and share some hot wings<br>\r\nWhen you head home Rick seems indifferent.<br>\r\n\"See you around.\" He tells you as you hike up your pants.  If I get any bigger you tell yourself, I need some suspenders.<br>\r\nYou decide that there wasn't any connection.  It was just another failed attempt to reach out.<br>\r\nThen you don't see Rick at the bar for several days.  Maybe he moved, you think or else he just didn't like having me talk to him.<br>\r\nThen you see him and you just ignore him and sit in your regular place. You decide to let him decide to talk to you or not.<br>\r\nThen when you have your beer and some calamari Rick turns and sees you.  He gets up and walks</span></div></div>",

You are pretty stuffed as well but it's still early and there is nothing for you at home so you signal for the waiter. <br>\r\nThis time you order a half-pound burger with cheese and bacon and a family sized order of onion rings.

You interested, big guy?\"<br>\r\nThis is totally unexpected and you aren't sure what to think.  You would love to have somebody really encourage you to stuff your belly but you don't know Bob.

You step on a scale and find yourself standing at an all time high of 206 pounds. You had to upgrade your wardrobe and buy several new 40\" waist pants. You sowed the 36\" tags from the old pairs onto your new pants so your wife Laura doesn't completely blow up on you. She's really been nagging at you about your weight gain and how it's not healthy and isn't a good role model for the children, but you don't care. You love the feeling of your belly being bloated and full. The weight of your gut. The sounds it makes empty and full. The way it bounce when you walk. The way Chris worships it and feeds you to the point you have to lie down for a bit to digest. Seeing yourself in a tight shirt or brushing against your belly is enough to get you excited. You find yourself absently mindedly rubbing your belly  every now and gain and love to look at your reflection and wonder if that's really you. You never even dreamed of being 200 pounds when you were in college. Now that you've blown pass 200 you wonder how much bigger you could get. You're almost always snacking, you usually make a pastry or MacDonald's run before work, grab a couple of chocolate bars on the way home and slip out to top off after a diet supper your wife made for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come home from a convenience store run to fill yourself up. You grabbed half a dozen chocolate bars, a 2 liter of coke and a bag of chips and polished them off in the car while you rubbed your slowly bloating belly. The growing tightness is a complete turn on. You walk into the house with your bloated belly and see that Misty is in the kitchen with your wife doing homework and decide to head upstairs to use the bathroom, the pop tends to go right through you. Sadly the dog somehow flushed his ball down the master bedroom's toilet so there's only one working toilet in the house until your plumber comes around tomorrow.<br>\r\nYou reach the bathroom door and attempt to open it only to hear the running shower.<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" you quietly sigh and lean back on the wall and look down at your bloated belly.<br>\r\nAfter a couple of seconds you hear the shower end and one of your sons get out of the tub and begin to dry off.<br>\r\nIt takes a couple of minute until the door finally opens and you're face to face with your son Alex who is only dressed in a towel around his slim waist. You're both stunned for a moment. Before you is your 17 year old athletic son who has a better build then you ever had in your whole life. A better pair of pecs and a defined 6 pac matched with a pair of strong looking arms and legs. While your son looks at your bloated belly which is pressing against your tight t-shirt and sits over your waist line.<br>\r\n\"Ahh.. sorry about that Dad,\" Alex finally says snapping out of his gaze at your belly.<br>\r\n\"It's ok,\" you reply also taking your gaze off of his shimmering damp body.<br>\r\n\"I had to have a shower after a jog,\" Alex says.<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" you say and realize you gotta piss bad and quickly side step and slip into the bathroom and shut the door and lock it. You look at yourself in the mirror and see your bloated belly and mentally compare it to your son's 6 pack and feel yourself get a little excited. You peel off your pants and take a seat on the throne and begin to release the torrent that was building up.<br>\r\nWhile you\u2019re on the toilet you begin to hear the ever so soft murmur of moaning coming from the opposite side of the wall. You realize that it's Alex's bedroom and the slight sound paired with the deep breathing and quiet moans sounds like he's masturbating as quietly as he can.<br>\r\nYou're a bit stunned. Is he jerking it to the thought of how fat you've become? How you've become a big fat daddy and he's stayed slim. You reach down and begin to play with yourself as well. One hand rubbing your third leg, the other rubbing your bloated belly. You quietly squeeze one out and wonder what Alex would think of you at 300 pounds?</span></div></div>",

Now you stock up on some pastries and fill up before arriving at the end of practice with a bloated gut proudly filling out your shirt while the young boys with their slim waists walk past making you feel even fatter. Today you packed away half a dozen doughnuts, a liter of chocolate milk and a couple of chocolate bars, so your gut is quite full pushing against your polo shirt.<br>\r\n\"Over here Alex!\" you call waving to your son who walks out of the school with his backpack with a couple of friends.

Would I be happy if I got fat?\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" you think.  \"This is too heavy here.  Alex wants the secret of life and he thinks you know what it is.  Could it be that simple?  Happiness is eating like a pig and getting fat.  Maybe but should I tell that to Alex.\"<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you tell him. \"I have let myself go a bit and maybe I decided to just let myself enjoy some good food but it isn't so simple.  When I was in school and working at sports, I had my metabolism working for me and I didn't have to worry about what I ate but I never would have succeeded in sports and attracted a hot chick like your mother if I was fat.  I might have been happy being fat but it would have been a whole 'nother life. I don't think getting fat would help you a bit.\"<br>\r\n\"But isn't it the same for you?  What does Mom say.  She always manages to cook enough even though you keep eating more?\"<br>\r\n\"She loves me enough to want to make me happy.

Oh, sure, your gut was already packed with the previous day's excursions, but hey.. what was one more? Or in this case, two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back into the kitchen and take a seat at the kitchen table, digging straight into both slices. You finish them off rather quickly, and just as you are licking your fingers and wishing for another slice, your mind goes back to the rest of the cheesecake. What was one more slice? Or so, that's how it starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlice after slice, you eat until the cheesecake is gone. But even then, it doesn't feel like it's enough. Oh, you're bloated all right, and not really hungry, but you want more. You stand up, your belly jiggling as you do so, and make your way to the fridge. You prop it open and look with delight at all of the delectables inside. Where to start? The cheese was calling your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlock of cheese gone, and you just had to go for the yogurt - your sweet tooth acting up. The fridge was rather packed by now, and the options just seemed endless. You lost track of your own gluttony, the tastes of a home-made buffet just too much temptation. You have no idea where this came from, but you didn't stop. It was almost as though you couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilk was guzzled down your gullet, the entire gallon gone between feedings of this and that. Carrots, pizza. Anything and everything. Your gut feels tight, packed and strained, and you're unsure just how much larger it is now. But you don't stop. Even as your gut groans, you don't stop. Even as you feel your buttons pop away, you don't stop. More and more and more, until you finish off the very last container of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back, amazed at all that you just ate, and especially amazed at how you feel. Your stomach has grown so large, you can't believe that it's really your stomach! And most importantly, you can't believe how tight it feels! As you rub the giant thing, you note that it's as hard as a rock, and you wonder for a moment if you'd reached your limit. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, wanting nothing more than to just lie down, and are about to do so when your eye catches something. Something that you missed, hidden behind the empty gallon of milk you put back. One large, delicious-looking slice of chocolate cake, the size of your head, remained. Your stomach groaned, and you wondered for a moment, if you put anymore into it, would it REALLY pop? But it was just there. Tempting. Tantalizing.</span></div></div>",

Somehow it felt right to be a big guy with a belly.  He had to recognize that he had not done anything to keep his weight down over the past year or so even as he bought bigger pants.  But did he really want to be bigger.  Looking at the profile for Bob the 370 hulk who sent him the message, he wondered what it would be like to weigh that much.  At 225, Scott was about 40 pounds over his college weight.  What would it be like at 370?  That would be up 200 pounds.  He would be a mound of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked again at Bob's picture.  He had a massive belly for sure but he also had a broad chest and shoulders, a wide ass and thick sturdy legs.  At 6 feet, he was the same height as Scott and in the details he noticed that Bob said he had been 195 when he graduated from college fifteen years ago.  Scott studied the picture and continued to ponder the question.  Even at 370, Bob looked like a man you wouldn't mess with, not a mass of blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" If I were that big and built like Bob, I'd be one proud man,\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore thinking, Scott's fingers were on the keyboard typing a response.

He had just chalked it up to some sort of morbid curiosity at first, but then why was he signed in now?  Was it just nice to find a group that wouldn't give him a hard over his middle age spread?  That wasn't so hard to believe: even his own family seemed too busy mocking him and trying to starve him to death to even give him the time of day.  <br>\r\nThen again, maybe there actually was something to this whole \"gainer\" thing.  Scott had never particularly liked his paunch very much, but it wasn't because he felt ugly, or unhealthy.  Sure, maybe he was a bit out of shape, but who cares?  The more he thought about it, the more he realized that it was the negativity from everyone around him that had made him hate the weight he had put on.  Even just stumbling across this hint of a society that supported fat acceptance had been enough to get him to join and post pictures of his fat belly, and now he was even being praised for those pictures!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took quite a bit of soul searching before Scott decided what to write, and in that time he managed to mindlessly munch his way through the cookies that someone had left by the keyboard last night.  <br>\r\n\"I just found this site on accident the other day so I'm not completely sure, but I think I...\"</span></div></div>",

Neal was an active teacher always moving around and energetic.  To Neal, English was exciting and he did everything possible to get his students excited too,  He finished his notes and sat for a moment reviewing the day.  He leaned back in his chair and  cupped his hands contentedly over his belly.<br>\r\nHe rocked and joggled the belly contentedly while his mind caught up.<br>\r\n\"Belly!  I don't have a belly.\"  Neal's mind snapped to attention and he looked down to see a mound of pudge hiding his belt from view.

He still ran once in a while  and always thought of himself as a lean greyhound.

Why didn't I notice,\"<br>\r\n\"Dad. you ready to go?\"  <br>\r\nNeal's middle son was a Junior and normally got a ride home with his Dad.<br>\r\nNeal enjoyed his son's and Wes was usually a lot of fun- not at school where he was embarrassed to have his Dad up close- but after Neal got him home, h was a laugh a minute.  Neal looked his son over.  He was a good looking kid but no jock and certainly not a greyhound Wes had always been chunky and since his growth spurt stopped leaving him only 5'9'' as a freshman, he had gotten chunkier.  Wes was sensitive so Neal didn't really know his weight but he guessed that Wes and his older brother might balance pretty well on a teeter totter even though Tanner was 8 inches taller and had always been a natural with sports.<br>\r\n\"Drop me at Mom's.\"  Wes demanded as the two walked to Neal's car.  <br>\r\n\"You are with me this week.\"  Neal whined.  \"Let's just get pizza and watch the game.\"<br>\r\n'Can't\"  Wes snapped. \"I've got to study tonight and it's so much nicer in my old room.  Besides, Mom always makes me cookies.  It's nothing personal Dad.  I just gotta pass this test and I can't study at your house.  There is no privacy.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, son.\"  Neal told him.  \"But we've just got to have our quality time.\"<br>\r\nNeal dropped off Wes and watched as his son ran into his old house.  Linda got the house while Neal merely got to pay for it.  All he could afford now was a flimsy dump with paper thin walls in a working class neighborhood.<br>\r\nTonight it would be just him and Cal, his youngest son.  Cal was smart as a whip and had the personality of a door.  Neal loved him but Cal was just no fun.  He always had his head in a book and never watched sports.<br>\r\nBy the time he reached home, Neal was feeling sorry for himself.  Then he saw a note from Cal on the table.  Cal was spending the night at his friend from the chess club.  Neal was on his own.  <br>\r\nNeal had planned to fix himself something light.  He was committed to getting rid of that belly.

Sneezer the mouse: 1 year old  this little mouse from tiny toon adventures isn't just an oh so sweet and adorable little mouse anymore now that he's become a much bigger and morbidly obese sized mouse after having consumed some formula of course. He's practically living large of course and eating any kind of food he can get his paws on. Known through out all of acme acres as the titanic mouse when he's seen stomping through downtown acme acres doing whatever he wants to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Whopper the puppy: 1 year old this little puppy from hanna barbera's pound puppies cartoon is no longer small anymore but now rather gigantic and morbidly obese who's said to have quite a massive appetite devouring any kind of food he can get his rather huge paws on and stuff his face as only he can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Tommy pickles the ever growing and hungry terrier dog: 1 year old a rather large rugrat terrier dog who is now as big as angelicus a maximus was and goes out to search for food when he's hungry and seems to have outgrown his clothes in the process as well.</span></div></div>",

After all tommy couldn't believe there was that much food that can make grow bigger and heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy: oh boy real greasy and fattening food and the world's biggest hot fudge sundae i bet this stuff's yummy and delicious now it's time to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the titantic terrier tot had gotten his rather fat paws on some real greasy hamburgers cheeseburgers hot dogs and pizza as well practially stuffing his face as only he can while his body was quite rounder as well. Then as soon he was done with his dinner he then went straight for the world's biggest hot fudge sundae and was gobbling it all down with the greatest of ease. Then he let out a burp that would make homer simpson proud of him. Then he decided to have one more thing to eat in this case his family's refridgerator. So he proceeded to stomp into the kitchen and approached the refridgerator thus quickly opening both the refridgerator and freezer door as well merely gobbling up everything in sight until there was nothing left to eat. Moments after he was done eating he noticed his family's pool outside and decided to go for a supersized swim of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he went for his supersized swim he decided to take off his clothes, first he got blue shirt off and then he took off his diaper which he had already got tired of wearing so he threw it as far away as he could much to his delight. Then he began stomping towards his family's pool and thus climbed in and noticed he was thirsty so he consumed all of the pool's water and thus swallowed it instanly becoming much bigger and heavier in size. After he was drinking all of the pool's water he felt he decided to have a few more bites to eat. So now the ever growing and hungry rugrat puppy was wondering where he should eat next after having heavily waddled onto the neighborhood sidewalks and began thinking about where he should eat next.</span></div></div>",

His breakfast (scrambled eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, gravy, and homemade donuts) sat heavy in his stomach, and with a quick, contented pat to his belly Mike stepped up onto the scale. The digital display flashed up a weight of 195 pounds, a fifteen pound gain since Mike had retired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, part of that's from breakfast,' he thought as he stepped down, examining his reflection in the mirror hanging on the door. 'But not all of it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no denying that he had put on weight; it was only a few pounds or so, but it was visible in the blurring of his abs (he was one of the only sixty+ age guys he knew who still had those), in the faint softening of his powerful chest muscles, and in the slight rounding of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood there, continuing to contemplate his reflection as he idly scratched at his silver chest hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, Mike, there's a couple of ways this can go from here. One: you find something as active as the factory.' The idea was distasteful to him; Mike had begun work at a very early age in life, and worked hard for over four decades. Careful money management had given him more than enough money to support himself and his wife for the rest of their lives, and it was time for him to relax and enjoy life more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Option two: you cut back on Georgia's cooking.' Even more distasteful, as Georgia was an absolutely fabulous cook, and Mike could never bring himself to leave the table without at least seconds, and often with thirds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or, option three: you accept that you're gaining weight, and just don't worry about. Maybe you won't look so trim and fit anymore, but Georgia's always moaned about how nothin'll stick to your ribs anyway; she likes a man with some meat on his bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich option do you take?</span></div></div>",
