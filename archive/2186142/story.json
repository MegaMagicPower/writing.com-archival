            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like most hunters, the body of the woman formerly known as Suzanne liked to do her hunting in the woods. They were quiet, they were remote, and the people who walked through them were typically younger outdoorsy types who made for good trophies. Especially so, because a lot of them liked to venture out at night, having heard ghost stories about the mysterious headless woman who appeared from the shadows and tore people's heads off with her bare hands, using her blood magic to keep the trophies alive and locking them in a dungeon for all eternity, only to be let out once every full moon where she paraded around the town wearing one of her stolen faces. Obviously some liberties were taken with the story and it was a bit over dramatic, but it nonetheless made brave and stupid teens go out in the dark to prove how cool and totally not scared they were, so Suzanne didn't really mind the less than flattering interpretation of her hobby. Besides, she let just about every person go unmolested. Headnapping every single one of them would probably cause too much of a scare, and people would stop going into the woods altogether. But still, every one in one thousand... they discovered the truth behind the myth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of stupid teens, it looked like a gaggle of them had just wandered into her hunting grounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Julia, keep up!\" A tall, tan, and athletically built woman with a long ponytail of dirty blonde hair called impatiently over her shoulder. In profile, her face appeared rather sharp and angular, with a big triangular nose, a well cut trapezoidal jawline, long rectangular ears, and cheeks bones that were high up on her face and well defined. She actually appeared to be just slightly out of the teen range, 21 or 22 if Suzanne's body had to guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, (huff), trying!\" a much younger, shorter, and plumper girl called from the far back of the group. She shared the taller girl's hair color, her big green eyes, her nose, and her bronze complexion, which made Suzanne's body think that she was her sister. Julia looked to be about 15 or 16, her body going through an awkward stage of puberty where every part seemed to be just slightly too big or too small but her head was pretty cute, a thin layer of fat smoothing out and softening her sister's hard angles and her shorter cut hair naturally forming into a doll-like bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she's real, Dianne? The headless witch?\" A pale young white teen asked the black woman who's arm wrapped around hers, implying the two were either very close friends or VERY close friends. Apart from their ages, both looking precisely 18, the two couldn't look more different. The Caucasian was tall and slender, with a long oval shaped head that sported a head shaved into a messy, wavy, lightning blue colored Mohawk running down the middle of her scalp like the plume of an ancient helmet. Her friend and/or girlfriend Diane was short and wide with a healthy amount of thick curves and a small circular face with a small but plump set of lips, nose, and cheek dimples, her eyes and ears practically hidden beneath a thick and naturally occurring mop of beautiful curly and wavy brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianne nodded, her shaggy hair swinging half a second behind the head it was attached to. \"Of course, you've seen the headless people wandering around town haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Suzanne's body had a face, it would be smiling right now. She wasn't the only headless body wandering around her home town, though as far as she could tell she was the only one with the power to remove heads and as such the only one capable of starting a collection. Most of the bodies she took the heads from simply wandered off into the woods, never to be seen again. No one knew where they went, search parties often found their clothing, usually folded into neat piles at the base of trees, but never bones or tissue or anything suggesting that they'd been done in by the forest. They just... got naked and disappeared. A few of them, however, walked back into town (usually fully dressed). They could still hear, see, and smell without their heads, albeit to a much more limited degree, and they seemed to understand English (and probably any other language they could speak before they got their heads stolen. There'd just yet to be a body appearing from someone who spoke any other language), but they had no memory of their previous lives. What's more, they seemed to be mindless drones, obeying any instruction given to them or just standing around motionless without any free will or personality to speak of. Suzanne's body had considered keeping as servants, using them to entertain the heads, but it seemed like a bad idea. The heads said bodies formerly belonged to may get sentimental and depressed seeing their old bodies, and may order the bodies to put them back on and try to escape. Suzanne's body didn't know if it would work, but she also didn't really care to find out. Besides, having a few other headless bodies wandering around made it less suspicious when she did did so. She was just another victim after all, the first victim, she couldn't be the headsnatcher herself, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've seen them but... a witch? Don't you think that's a little ridiculous?\" Dianne's girlfriend asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do YOU think happened to them?\" Dianne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno! Aliens, prototype zombie virus... alien prototype zombie virus? Anything other than magic!\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDianne rolled her eyes. \"Like THAT'S any less ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the group, Suzanne's body decides that it's going to take...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Paulie, slow up!  I'm stuck!\"  Julia called from the back, one of her thick and seemingly brand new hiking boots getting stuck in a thick patch of mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you gals hear something?  Like a really annoying whining sound?  I think it came from waaaaay back there.\"  The older girl, presumably Paulie, said, pointing vaguely in Julia's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall girl pale girl next to her chuckled halfheartedly, awkwardly caught in the crossfire of this sibling feud and trying her best to remain neutral.  \"Seriously Paulie, maybe we should slow our roll a little.  These boots aren't made for walking.\"  She said, pointing to her thick soled, black leather punk boots, which were clearly never intended to serve as hiking boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, don't call me that.\"  Paulie said, shooting her friend an annoyed side eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, Peanut.\"  The tall girl answered, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or that!\"  Not Paulie and not Peanut snapped, jabbing a stern finger into the side of her tall friend's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Dianne said, swatting at not Paulie and not Peanut's hand, though the tall girl she had her arm wrapped around didn't seem to mind the poke one bit.  If anything, she seemed to enjoy knowing that her teasing was getting to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  So what's third of all, PAULETTE?\"  The tall punk asked, being sure to enunciate her friend's name as slowly and pretentiously as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SECOND of-\" Paulette stopped, realizing that her friend was counting the demand not to be called Peanut as the second command.  She let out a puff of air, deciding that it wasn't worth her time to argue that point.  \"Third of all, Carly, we've still got four more miles to go until we reach the campsite, and I want to get our tents set up before midnight so we're not all groggy and cranky tomorrow morning when we wake up for the hike up the mountain.\"  She said.  Seeing Carly's mouth open with a smile on its lips, and expecting her to joke about not knowing that Paulette could be anything other than cranky, the shorter athletic girl cut her off with \"Come on, I'll race you there!  Beat me there, and I'll clean all the dishes this trip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's eyes lit up.  \"You're on, sister!  I'm gonna RUIN those goddamn dishes, just for you!  Melted cheese, canned beans, gonna pick every mushroom I see and saute th- HEY!\"  She said, watching as Paulette quickly ran off down the path ahead of her, leaving the punk in the dust within seconds.  \"Hey no fair, you didn't say go!\"  She called, shrugging out of Dianne's embrace and desperately sprinting off after Paulette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!  Don't... split... up.\"  Dianne shouted to no avail.  \"Oh... crap.\"  She said, looking around the woods nervously.  She knew that witch attacks were rare, but they did happen and they happened to happen more often to lone wanderers and very rarely to groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was a really stupid thing to do.\"  Julia said, summing up Dianne's thoughts perfectly as she hobbled up beside her, one boot caked in mud and splatting with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... well... Carly has a way of not thinking everything through.\"  Dianne said, patting Julia on the shoulder.  \"Come on, sweetie, let's stick together.  I'm sure they'll tire themselves out soon enough, we'll catch up.\"  She said, walking at a slightly slower pace than she had been before to give Julia a more comfortable walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector, having seen all of this, quickly made her way through the woods in an attempt to cut Paulette off.  Despite knowing all the shortcuts and alternate routes of this path like the back of her hand, she still found it extremely difficult to keep up with the athletic young woman without causing too much noise and giving herself away.  Paulette had to be on the track team at her college or something, her speed and stamina were absolutely astounding.  What's more, her face had barely broken a sweat throughout her run, her tanned cheeks gaining only the most superficial of blushes as she barely exerted herself.  The way her tight ponytail fluttered behind her as she ran, the way her lips pursed as she sucked in air, the way her eyes stared straight ahead with burning intensity as she raced, it convinced The Collector that this was the one.  She was stealing Paulette's head.  And she knew just how to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkipping a bend in the path, The Collector managed to put herself four or five minutes ahead of Paulette, giving her just enough time to set a trap.  While she wasn't \"witch\" as these girls had so rudely accused, over the years The Collector had learned a few additional ways of removing heads rather than simply yanking them off.  While that was the only way she could do it at birth, and it was her most common method of removal, she had other ways.  For instance, if she rubbed inorganic metal compounds on her body's neck stump for long periods of time, she could literally \"rub off\" some of her powers on the object.  While the conferred power was only temporary, and wore off after only a couple of uses, it still provided her with a rather useful asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a large coil of steel wire, which flickered and sparkled with dark blue energy every once in a while, The Collector got to work.  Tying one end of the wire around a thick tree at the height of Paulette's neck (she'd gotten VERY good at judging people's neck height at a glance over the years), The Collector ran to the other side of the path and tied the wire around another thick tree, creating a neck high garrote trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds of her finishing, she saw Paulette zoom around the corner of the bend, a minute ahead of schedule.  The Collector quickly ducked behind her tree to avoid being spotted.  Paulette really was fast!  Too fast, in fact, as while Paulette saw the wire a second before she hit it and had enough time to gasp in shock, she didn't actually have enough time to stop her momentum.  The wire caught her neck just below the chin, severing her head and sending it tumbling into the dirt.  The Collector had planned to lay down some leaves to cushion her fall, but Paulette great speed didn't give her enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\"  Paulette yelped, her head rolling to a stop in a ditch by the side of the path.  She landed facing her body, and saw it...</span></div></div>",

Nor did it collapse it lose all of its motor functions and senses before collapsing into an only technically alive heap of meat and organs as was uncommon.  Instead, Paulette's body reacted in the most rare manner, remaining completely under the young woman's control.  While the Head Collector prided herself on her magical prowess, magic was still magic, and magic was never an exact science.  Otherwise, it would be science and not magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulette stumbled to a stop several meters beyond the tripwire, felt around the empty space where her head had been in disbelief, then she quickly spun in the direction of her head and scrambled for it.  The Head Collector cursed her bad luck, not only for Paulette's unusual reaction to decapitation but also that her head had just so happened to land facing her body giving her an easy way to find herself.  Leaping from cover and making a mad dash for Paulette's head, the Collector also cursed herself for not reacting sooner.  If she hadn't been so surprised, she probably could've gotten to Paulette's head first and made off with it already.  Instead, Paulette was the first to reach it, pressing her head back down against her neck before turning to face the sound of the Collector's footsteps and lowering herself into a practiced judo stance in preparation for The Collector's attack.  \"Bring it on, witch!\"  She snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.  She knows how to fight, too.\"  The Collector thought.  \"Could my luck get any worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, her luck...</span></div></div>",

Despite her awkwardly proportioned and somewhat pudgy body, Julia's head was absolutely adorable, and would look even cuter once divorced from her body and placed on a shelf, or on The Collector's much sexier body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking behind the group and waiting for them to drop their guard, The Collector was able to pick up a bit more information.  The tall pale one was named Carly, was the drummer in a punk band with a rude name, and was indeed Dianne's girlfriend.  Dianne had been secretly dating Carly for almost a year, but had only recently come out to her parents and had run off on this camping trip to give them some time to process her revelation.  She also seemed to be the only one who knew anything at all about the forest, pointing out some of the different varieties of trees and identifying bird calls with (almost) total accuracy.  Julia's tall, bossy sister was named Paulette, and apparently she and Julia shared a sister in between their ages named Bella, who couldn't come on this camping trip due to breaking both her legs in a bike accident two weeks ago.  Whether or not their parents intended to give their three daughters the first initials PB&amp;J was unknown, but it made The Collector give a silent giggle when Carly pointed it out and started joking about Paulette being a health nut, which ironically drove Paulette nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was Julia, looking sad and miserable taking up the rear of the group.  While Dianne and Carly would occasionally banter with her, and did their best to deflect Paulette's rude remarks, it was clear that they were closer friends with the oldest sister than the youngest, spending most of their time talking with her rather than Julia, who spent the majority of the hike panting with her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing this girl a favor.\"  The Collector thought, her resolve to steal that one's head hardening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she saw her opportunity.  Julia leaned heavily against a tree, wiping sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand.  \"Sis, seriously, can we stop for a sec?  I need to catch my breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been walking a while...\" Dianne said noncommittally, her voice level and clearly not strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't indulge her, we've barely walked two miles.\"  Paulette said without stopping, checking the step counter on her wrist.  \"This will be good for her, help build up her cardio and those leg muscles.\"  She glanced briefly over her shoulder.  \"Hear that, tubby?  Keep up or get got by the witch!  We're not taking a break until eleven!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia huffed and glanced at her phone.  It was 9:53pm.  \"UGH...\" she wearily groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry girl, once we stop I'll whip us up some sweet midnight chili!\"  Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Carly meant the words as genuine encouragement, Paulette saw an easy opportunity for an insult and added \"Hear that, little piggy?  Slop awaits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SLOP?!\"  Carly said, offended more by Paulette's critique of her cooking skills than at the insult she'd just lobbed at her lingering sister.  She and Paulette began arguing, paying no attention to Julia who remained leaning against the tree as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" Julia grumbled, pushing herself off the tree and preparing herself to jog to catch up with them.  Before she could take her first step, however, she felt a pair of hands clasping against her cheeks.  She gasped in surprise, then yelped in fear as The Collector pulled her head clean off her body.

Her eyes went from confused to furious in an instant, her charge leaving her stunned friends in the dust as she instinctively rushed to her sister's aid.  The Collector turned and broke off into the treeline, Julia's head screaming in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds passed, Carly and Dianne struggling to process if that had really just happened and if so what they should do about it.  Shaking off their momentary surprise at the same time both sprang into action, Carly sprinting after The Collector and Paulette while Dianne ran over to Julia's headless body, which was already attempting to disrobe and wander off into the woods as most of the discarded bodies The Collector left in her wake did.  Dianne tackled it to the ground while it was still fumbling with the straps of its heavy backpack, its muscles weak from exhaustion (and also just being a generally weak 16 year old), and held it in place in case her friends came back with the body's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Carly was huffing along a fair distance behind Paulette and The Collector, only able to track their movements through the darkness by the path of broken sticks and deep shoe prints in the mud, as well as Julia's faint screaming.  She couldn't tell if the head of her friend's sister was screaming purely out of fear or if she was consciously creating a racket to act as a sort of flesh homing beacon, but either way she was thankful for the teen's continued cries.  Her thick combat boots sank deeply into the mud off the trail, further slowing the lanky young woman.  \"Hell.\"  She said, one arm fumbling around behind her as she fished for her metal water bottle.  \"How the hell are they so fast?\"  She panted, doing her best to run, unscrew her bottle, and keep her flashlight pointed straight all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Paulette had heard her, she would've answered with a simple 'RAGE!'  No one kidnapped her sister.  No one was allowed to lay a finger on her.  She may have been a whiny little overfed loser brat, but she was Paulette's little sister and as the big sister it was Paulette's duty to ensure that no harm came to her.  Adrenaline and hatred carried Paulette forward, hot on The Collector's heels despite the headless woman's years of additional experience, advanced knowledge of the terrain, and supernatural stamina.  \"IF YOU DON'T LET HER GO RIGHT THIS INSTANT I'M GONNA SHOVE MY FOOT SO FAR UP YOUR ASS MY SHOE'S GONNA COME OUT YOUR THROAT AND BECOME YOUR NEW HEAD!\" Paulette roared, vaulting a half collapsed tree that The Collector had slid under and sprinted sideways of in an attempt to break line of sight and escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!  Paulette, help!\"  Julia called as loudly as she could, giving away The Collector's position and spoiling her attempt to break away.  The Collector silently cursed, digging into her pocket to find a rag or something to gag this head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here, sis!\"  Paulette called, turning on a dime and sprinting in the direction of her sister's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector had miscalculated, the excitement of the moment causing her to take a wrong turn.  She was now standing near the edge of a steep, muddy embankment, too slippery to navigate on foot without slowing to a crawl, which wasn't really an option given the fact that she was currently in the middle of a high speed pursuit.  The Collector turned around, tucking Julia's head under her left arm while her dominant right got into a fighting stance.  If Paulette wouldn't give up, The Collector would just have to take her head too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop a dozen feet away, panting heavily but standing tall and ready, Paulette stood motionless before the ready Collector.  \"Give.  Her.  Back.\"  She hissed, venom oozing from her lips between each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector held up her index finger and wagged it in a \"No no\" gesture, then pointed to Paulette's head, her own neck, and then waved Paulette towards her.  If she stepped up to her, The Collector would take her head too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see you try.\"  Paulette said, setting down her flashlight pointing towards The Collector, cracking her knuckles, and getting into a judo stance.  While she'd only been taking classes for the last two years, she thought that her furious anger would give her the raw drive needed to break this bitch.  The Collector didn't move, her right hand steady and ready to lunge for her neck the second Paulette got within range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulette never got the chance to find out whether or not she could've taken The Collector in a fight.  A glinting metal object burst through the foliage behind  and to the side of her, sailing clear over her shoulder and slamming against The Collector's throat.  It was an aluminium water bottle.  \"Carly!\"  Paulette cheered, turning briefly to find her friend dry heaving against a tree as she tried to recover from her run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to The Collector, Paulette's heart stopped.  Carly had done her job too well.  The Collector reflexively dropped Julia's head as she clutched her throat with both hands, silently coughing from the impact and stumbling closer to the edge.  Julia's head fell to the ground and rolled over the edge of the muddy ravine, the young teen screaming in terror as she rolled and skipped down the hill.  \"JULIA!\"  Paulette screamed, gathering up her flashlight and sprinting towards the edge of the ravine, paying no attention to how close she was getting to The Collector.  She saw no sign of her, the slope too pockmarked and uneven to make out any dents that could've been made by Julia's head.  What was worse, Julia's screams had stopped.  All Paulette could hear was a deafening silence.  Had Julia been hurt?  Was she knocked out in the fall?  Was she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector recovered somewhat, her chest still heaving and her neck sore with a slowly developing bruise.  Realizing what had just happened, The Collector...</span></div></div>",

She may have no moral scruples involved with headnapping or holding heads against their wills in her dungeon, regardless of age or circumstance, she never wanted to hurt a head.  And if Julia was hurt, or worse, killed, The Collector would never be able to forgive herself.  She stood up slowly, raising one hand high into the air in a show of surrender while the other reached into her pocket and withdrew her phone.  She needed to explain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulette either didn't understand the gesture, or was too angry to care.  With a wordless roar of anguish and fury, she hurled herself into The Collector's ribs, tackling the older woman to the ground with a force that knocked the wind out of her and sending her phone flying out of her hand.  Lacking a face to punch, Paulette proceeded to rain blows down on The Collector's neck, knowing from Carly's example that that hurt. The Collector tried to push her away with one hand and defend her throat with the other, but without the ability to communicate her intentions and not wanting to cause further distrust by removing Paulette's head, the best she could do was force a stalemate, where most of Paulette's hits failed to land and most of her strength was being used just to keep on top of The Collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  Carly said from behind her friend.  When Paulette didn't answer, Carly repeated herself, louder.  \"HEY!\"  She shouted, grabbing Paulette by the collar.  Paulette turned, momentarily, eyes wild and teeth barred.  Carly held up The Collector's phone, it's screen slightly cracked from the fall but the message it had been typing still clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Truce.  Let's fin</i>\" it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaulette stared in confusion for a few seconds, then snapped her gaze back onto the empty space where The Collector's face should have been.  Its hands were open and on the ground, not attempting to defend herself from or take the head of Paulette.  She didn't move.  Paulette roughly swiped the phone from Carly's hand and slammed it into The Collector's palm.  \"You have ten seconds.  Type fast.\"  She commanded, grabbing The Collector by the throat and raising  her fist again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector did indeed type fast, her fingers experienced from years spent with mixed ability to vocalize and her phone now filled with shortcuts and accurate auto-completions for commonly used words.  After exactly ten seconds, she turned her phone around to Paulette to reveal the completed message.  \"<i>Truce.  Let's find your sis.  Work together.  Won't collect her, I promise</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I'm gonna take help from you!  This is all your fault you kidnapping bitch!\"  Paulette answered, sounding more dumbstruck by the audacity of the statement than angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Technically it was Carly's fault.  Just saying.</i>\"  The Collector quickly typed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Carly's turn to be offended.  \"Is that supposed to be a joke?  None of this would've happened if you hadn't tried to steal my best friend's sister!  I was just trying to stop you from taking her back to your secret alien super-villain lair or whatever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We're wasting time here.  Julia could be hurt.  We can point fingers later, AFTER we find her.</i>\"  The Collector typed, sidestepping the conversation entirely and trying to guide it back in the direction she wanted it to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading this, Paulette's muscles tensed and then released.  She really wished the Collector had a face, she was good at telling if someone was lying by their face.  Reading her body language, while she was still poised to stop a punch to the throat, it was hard to read her.  But, what she said was true.  They were wasting time.  Paulette had to make sure her sister was alive first, and then worry about how to protect her from this monster.  She stood up, and stepped away from The Collector.  She reached out a hand to help her up, which The Collector took.  \"Keep those grubby little hands where I can see them while we look, do you hear me?\"  Paulette demanded, to which The Collecter raised both with splayed fingers, either mocking Paulette or genuinely assuring her that she would comply.  If only she had a face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peanut, are you sure this is a good idea?\"  Carly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Paulette responded, not even registering the nickname that had so annoyed her before.  \"But it's our only option.  Carly, you should...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An extremely long hour passed the two women by, their calls answered only by the whistle of wind through the trees and the distant cry of unknown birds.  Paulette's flashlight, a sturdy and absurdly expensive metal hiking flashlight , was as useful as a box of matches would have been.  The flashlight had been designed for battery life, durability, and illuminating a wide but relatively short area in modest light, not to act as a searchlight looking for a needle in a haystack.  Even at its most focused setting, the light barely traveled forty feet from Paulette in a pretty wide cone, and was just as bright as her friends' cheap plastic flashlights that they had probably bought from a grocery store or a pharmacy.  The Collector hadn't brought a flashlight of her own, her \"natural forrest sense\" apparently making her too proud to carry one, and as such she was all but useless in the search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julia!\"  Paulette called for what had to be the hundredth time, only to be answered by silence for the hundredth time.  Her shoulders slumped.  Was her sister really gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She may have fallen into some mud and can't answer, or rolled down at an angle and is far left or right of us.\"  The Collector said in Clementine's soft little voice, trying and failing to comfort Paulette.  \"Don't worry, she doesn't have to breathe, drink, or eat like this.  If she isn't hurt, we have all the time in the world to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she isn't hurt.\"  Paulette repeated bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector sighed.  \"Look, it's dark and we're tired.  We'll have a better chance of finding her if we go out looking for her fresh in the morning.  I can offer you some boarding if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Paulette answered immediately.  \"My friends and I aren't going to be the Hansels and Gretels to your witch, bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClementine's face contorted into a sharp frown.  \"Look, I'm not the monster you think I am.  I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just kidnap and paralyze people, then hold them against their will in some dungeon forever.\"  Paulette interrupted again, not wanting to hear The Collector's sale's pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never lost a head before.\"  The Collector continued, her tone making it very clear what she meant by 'lost'.  She looked Paulette in the eyes.  \"and I never want to know what that feels like.  I love them, all of them, and I want them to be safe.  I swear, on my life, that I'm not going to snag you or any of your friends while we're looking for your sister.  And once we do find her, I'll return her to her body and I'll let you all leave my forest intact.  I'll take you if you come back, obviously, but if you come back after tonight... I have to assume you wanted to be taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did Clementine's eyes have to be so big and cute?  It was like looking at a kicked puppy.  \"I'll talk it over with my friends.\"  Paulette said, after a long pause.  Pulling out her phone, she saw that yup, still no signal, and promptly began walking back up the hill.  \"Wait, we should probably mark this spot, make sure we remember where we last left off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\"  The Collector said, pausing for a moment before removing Clementine's head.  Climbing up a tree and setting her in one of its higher branches, Clementine began loudly whistling at a high pitch.  Not a musical tune, just a single continuous exhale that Paulette watched her make for almost an entire minute before she remembered what The Collector had said about heads not needing air and realizing that Clementine could do this indefinitely.  Climbing back down, The Collector pulled out her phone and typed \"<i>We'll be able to hear that from a long way off.  Can I walk with you back to your group?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess?\"  Paulette said, realizing that she wouldn't have questioned The Collector's intentions if she hadn't brought attention to them.  If she was going to kidnap the three of them, it would've made more sense to kidnap the isolated Paulette, then go back on her two distracted friends rather than taking on all three at once, which seemed to imply that she could trust The Collector to keep her word, for now, but it still felt wrong to allow her sister's kidnapper follow her.  Paulette began marching back up the hill, not looking back to see if The Collector was keeping up but knowing full well that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor lack of a voice to speak with, the two walked back to the trail in complete silence, both engrossed in worry over Julia.  Reaching the path once more, and finding themselves about a mile ahead of where Dianne had been left to hold down Julia's struggling body, the two walk up the trail in continued silence.  As they approached the spot where Paulette's friends had been left, they saw...</span></div></div>",

She arrived at her home as she finally get to the part where she adds the head to the shelf. She found a space for the head for the tough girls section as she placed the head there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector then goes to put on a more cheerful head as she found one perfect for the moment. The head was named Rosie and had pink twin tails and looks as if she was a pop star. In fact she was as the collector went to one of her meet and greets and flat out stole her head in front of everybody. Good times. She managed to get the head adjusted because Rosie had a history of child abuse from both her parents and work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it my turn already?

Sure it can get a bit moody with some problems, but you'll get used to it my pretty,\" said the collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you sound really stupid saying that with that voice,\" said the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!

Julia, the girl trailing at the rear of the group, panted and continued to trudge at an even pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector, stepping out from behind her tree as the girls passed, had come to a decision.  Julia's sister and Carly were both pretty argumentative, likely to kick up a lot of fuss on the shelves, and Julia herself was a bit too young for The Collector's tastes.  Dianne was nice, smart, funny, and pretty to boot.  It would be her head that The Collector would add to her collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCutting ahead of the group of girls, aware of all the shortcuts and alternate paths along the trail the girls were following, The Collector climbed a tree that commanded an excellent view of the surrounding forest and met with her 'barn owl'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup boss?\"  A cute, round, early thirties looking Latina head inquired as The Collector wrapped her fingers through its hair.  Dianne had been correct about the call being that of a barn owl, but the source was not an owl at all, but Gal, a former country singer with a formerly extremely long name that ended with 'De Galicia' which The Collector had since shortened to Gal.  Gal had studied bird calls as a hobby, and as a bodiless head with little else to do besides practice with her well trained voice, she'd perfected the calls and used them to assist The Collector in her collecting.  She acted as a sort of scout for the collector, using different calls to indicate which direction groups were travelling in, if there were other groups or wild animals nearby that The Collector should worry about, and general just enjoyed watching The Collector work.  She actually quite liked the idea of being a living head, mostly because it meant she never aged and her voice never degraded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Gal's surprise, The Collector put Gal's head on, and responded to Gal using her own smooth voice.  \"I'm taking the black girl's head, Dianne.  Care to help me do a little hands on work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGal, speaking inside the Collector's mind (or, technically her own mind, which the Collector was now occupying alongside her), answered  \"Of course!  Anything for you boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  The Collector said, patting Gal's cheek which both of them could now feel.  \"I will have to dirty your head up a little bit, but I promise to make it up to you in the morning.  I'll give you the full spa experience, three hours of it, you'll be cuter and cleaner than ever, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, I don\u2019t mind getting my hands dirty from time to time.\u201d  Gal joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her apologies out of the way, The Collector unfurled Gal\u2019s long, wavy ponytail and ruffled it up, sticking bits of bark and twigs in it as she did so.  She reached down, picked up a fistful of dirt, and rubbed it on Gal\u2019s cheeks and on her own clothes.  Finally, she began sprinting in circles for a few minutes before running to head off the group of girls, her face now sweaty, disheveled, and begrimed.  As she caught sight of the group, The Collector screamed \u201cHELP!  HELP PLEASE!  OH GOD, HELP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?  Who\u2019s there?\u201d  Julia\u2019s older sister asked, shining her flashlight right in Gal\u2019s face and causing The Collector to shield her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve got to help me, she took her!  She took my daughter!\u201d  She cried, continuing to run at the four girls as she pulled at their heartstrings, hoping to drop their guard.  The first girl in the group to react was..</span></div></div>",

Reasons why the collector does not use her often is due to how Lily may end up having a gigantic harem while the heads would fight each other over her. Also the collector prefer to use unique ways to get a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the collector placed Clarisse's head on an empty row on the shelf just so that she avoids any other head who have a thing for Lily.

She is someone that Rosie does look up to as she is a professional despite being around the same age as Rosie. She often train heads to be better than when they first came here and even trained the collector herself. To make use of her skills and any head who is an actress or model, the collector does short films and photo shoots to make use of their efforts.

Sometimes you need to cut back a little and you don't have to act all dramatic all the time. I do doubt that is how you use thee as well,\" Christi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I do need a break for that for now,\" Lina said, \"It's so fun though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with having fun, just moderation is needed,\" Christi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such wise words from a fair maiden,\" Lina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you,\" Christi said as she blushed, \"It brings me joy that I still have value even in this state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all love you Christi,\" Rosie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I am honored to have you be in my movie,\" Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your words mean so much to me.

It looked like a full faced motorcycle helmet, large and yellow with an impenetrably dark tinted black visor, a large sideways 'S' painted above the left eye, and two large triangular protrusions on top mimicking cat ears.  The helmet belonged to, was handmade by, and was now almost permanently worn by, a teenaged girl named Ami.  Ami was a huge fan of anime, and apparently based this helmet off a character in one of her favorite shows, Celty.  Based on The Collector's somewhat hazy recollection of Ami's constant ramblings, Celty was a dullahan who'd misplaced her head and now wore a motorcycle helmet out in public to disguise her true nature while she searched for her head.  The Collector didn't really watch much TV, whether it be live action or Japanese cartoons, but she did enjoy the fact that this Celty had made it absurdly easy to capture Ami.  The Collector had seen her at some sort of convention wearing her full Celty costume, babbling to her friends about how awesome she was and how cool it would be to meet a real dullahan.  While not technically a dullahan, The headless Collector in search of pretty heads to wear, dressed coincidentally in a thick black leather jacket and skintight black jeans (her standard attire when stalking out in the woods, which she'd just gotten back from that night having found nothing worth taking) made Ami practically throw herself into The Collectors arms and offer her head on a silver platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttaching the helmeted head to her shoulders, The Collector's mind was immediately bombarded by Ami's excited thoughts.  \"OHMYGOSH THANK YOU!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!  OH MY GOSH, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?  WE GONNA GO OUT COLLECTING OR RIDE AROUND TOWN ON A MOTORCYCLE OR JUST HANG OUT OR WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now.\"  The Collector said, controlling Ami's lips and speaking aloud in a muffled voice with a slight Japanese accent.  This helmet was a bit too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm just so excited!\"  Ami responded.  Indeed, despite being captured over a year ago her enthusiasm for her bodiless state hadn't waned.  She got to spend all day talking to the other heads about all her favorite shows, several of whom were also into anime that she could have endless discussions with and others who didn't watch it that she could give detailed synopses to and recite episodes with a near encyclopedic knowledge, and each week she behaved the Collector would set her down in front of a laptop, purchase (or pirate) any shows Ami wanted, and let her watch her cartoons all 24 hours of the day.  She behaved every week.  \"So, what's up?  Why put me on?\"  Ami asked in The Collector's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector informed her...</span></div></div>",

It's thanks to heads like her that the collector is slowly becoming a closet anime fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other head she held is named Tsukihime, a daughter of a Japanese feudal lord that she had sights on many years ago. Yes the collector is that old. The head had a tied up black hair with the accessories of someone of her class. Her eyebrows were big but cute. She did learn to speak English and other languages as she had years to study and was treated like a princess by the collector. Her relationship with anime is more out of curiosity and trying to hear what's up in Japan. She is mostly fine with being in the collection due to less restriction and that's saying much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I thank you for this opportunity for a bath. While it's not like the bath houses from where I was from, it will suffice,\" Tsukihime said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey princess!\" Ami called from the cauldron, \"Looking good Clementine.

Turning to the simple but sturdy porcelain tub, The Collector dropped the bath stopper in and turned the both the hot and cold knobs.  As a lady who liked her baths hot, she turned the hot water knob as far as it could go while giving the cold water knob only a quarter turn.  Watching the water slowly fill up the tub, the collector stood and began to undo her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Collector, do you mind if I ask you something?\"  Ami thought, The Collector tossing her bra towards the clothing heap and inadvertantly catching its strap on one of the protruding ears of Ami's helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  Speak your mind!\"  The Collecter answered in Ami's voice, sitting on the edge of the tub and dipping a finger into the water to test it. \"Or think it, anyway\"  She added, a classic joke of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any friends?\"  Ami asked, her mental tone completely free of malice or contempt.  It seemed like she was asking an honest question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  The Collecter flatly asked in her head, too surprised to articulate the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, do you have any friends that aren't part of your collection?  Like, real people friends.  With bodies and such.  Do you have any?\"  Ami clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're 'real people' too, you know.  Just because you dress yourself like a cartoon character doesn't mean you are one.\"  The Collector answered her, speaking slowly but not meanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we're kind of fash-...\"  Ami stopped herself, as though she were about to think something that she'd regret having The Collector hear her think.  Her mind went silent for a while, then thought \"I'm just curious if there's anyone besides us.  Friends, relatives, loved ones, people on the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"  The Collector asked.  \"You girls are all I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... no reason.  Nevermind.\"  Ami thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bath was just about ready, and The Collector was happy to drop the subject if Ami was going to.  Sticking her fingers into the matted bun of brown hair tied behind Ami's head, The Collector dug and pulled, dug and pulled, until the knots and tangles of sweat encrusted helmet hair cascaded down her bare back.  She shook the head on her shoulders twice, feeling the hair not so much sway as scrap from side to side behind her.  She could NOT let Ami go this long without a bath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning off the water, The Collector slid back and submerged herself in the steamy water up to her bust, letting out a deep sigh of pleasure as her arms rested along the rim of the tub.  She closed her eyes and tilted her borrowed head back, slowly lowering her head back into the water until only her face remained above the surface, Ami's small round ears filling with water as she did so.  She rested in that position for a while, smiling as the water worked its way between the fine hairs of her head and untangle them.  Without opening her eyes, The Collector reached out and grabbed a bottle of shampoo and a poofy bath sponge.  She dunked the sponge into the water, worked the shampoo into its nooks and crannies, then rose into a sitting position and massaging the sponge against Ami's scalp, the shampoo breaking down the compacted grime and sweat and dropping small grimy clumps into the water around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile none of Ami's thoughts were explicitly telegraphed or clear enough for consistent coherence, The Collector could still detect some flickers of emotion and Ami seemed to be enjoying her bath.  She enjoyed the way The Collector's fingers moved through her hair, the feeling of the sponge against her scalp, getting pampered and cared for.  The Collector, likewise, enjoyed the feeling of caring for the helpless head, knowing that it was she whom all the heads relied on and depended upon for everything and that she was always willing to benevolently provide.  So long as they didn't want her to provide their escape, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with the cleanliness of Ami's hair, The Collector decided to clean her own body before Ami's face, as she felt it was almost ritual for her to clean any head just before or just after she removed them.  Setting the shampoo and poofy sponge aside, The Collector opened her eyes as she gathered up a bar of pine scented soap and a more robust sponge.  While the scent was a bit masculine, she felt it helped her blend into the forest better while also being pleasant to walk around the collection wearing it.  Dunking the sponge and slathering it with soap, The Collector proceeded to wipe down her body, starting with her forearms and working her way towards her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuning in on Ami's thoughts again, she noticed that the head's emotions seemed more intense now.  She seemed to be enjoying this more than her own hair wash.  \"What's up?  Did I not do a good enough job washing your hair?\"  The Collector asked aloud, Ami's subconscious performing the equivalent of a gasp at being called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's not that, it's just... I like the way your body feels.  I mean, uh, the way you... you feel like... womanly.  You know?  Like, my old body wasn't... it didn't feel like this.\"  Ami mentally stammered, her words coming through fuzzy as she struggled to find the right ones and struggled still harder in trying to suppress the wrong ones from leaking out.  The Collector remembered Ami's body, a scrawny, short, stick figure of a thing that even the heavy padding of her homemade Celty costume couldn't hide the total lack of meat on her bones.  If The Collector had to guess, Ami's couch potato lifestyle didn't have much regular exercise or large meals scheduled into it, just a lot of internet arguments and instant noodles.  While none of the heads HAD to eat, a lot of them still requested food and candy for the nostalgia of it, or just to feel normal.  Since she'd been collected, Ami had had 1 small blueberry milkshake on her birthday and exactly nothing else ever, as though she considered eating a hassle and was happy to be rid of the need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, while she never had the time or energy to take care of her own body, she seemed to be rather infatuated by The Collector's healthy, athletic, well proportioned figure.  The Collector detected Ami's strong feelings clearly even without the young adult's concious effort to convey them.  She enjoyed the way her strong arms felt as she ran her fingers over them, the way her firm but plump breasts felt as she rubbed the sponge against them, the way her well defined belly felt as it curled and twisted in the near scalding water... wait, was Ami gay?  Or bi?  Was that why she was asking if The Collector had 'friends'?  Had she been dancing around asking about if she had a boyfriend or girlfriend?  Or was the Collector just looking too deep into it?  Anyone would've been jealous to have a body like this one, especially someone who'd looked like Ami had.  Her excitement could've easily been for herself, like this was merely a power fantasy for her to look like one of those ridiculously over-sexualized women in her silly cartoons without any of the effort.  Plus, spending a lot of time deprived of a body often had the effect of making everything with it feel more intense.  The Collector certainly felt her heads more intensely if she went a long time without wearing one, and Ami had gone unworn for a few months.  She could simply be experiencing an intense reaction due to her heightened sensitivity, and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector decides to...</span></div></div>",

That just means that they are in the middle as Harley is not satisfied with just tired. Sometimes she breaks the collector, but she views it as a normal workout. The odd thing is that the collector is mostly going through all this pain just to lose some pounds when she realized that she is overweight or at least think she is. It does get in the way of head hunting as she needs to be fit to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only gained like five pounds from the last you picked me up.

Its a shame that the old body is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough about my body, let's worry about yours!\" Harley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector kept at it until she really can't stand anymore.

The head then came to a stop as she stood, if you can call it that, in front of the gym and felt excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while since I got a more independent workout. I'm more for track, but I'm open for any form of working out,\" said Harley, \"What should I do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley did her head stretches first as she tried to decide. She could try weights, but her mouth realistically can't hold it. Dumbbells might work, but they are too big for her. There was the pull down machine that seems to work for her. A bit too high, but she can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'm up for the challenge!\" Harley said as she rolled to the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head started hopping towards the handles as she barely can reach. Once she did, she manage to catch it with her teeth and her lips holding it still. The head struggle to use her weight to pull it down as her saliva started to make her slip. She held on and eventually sort of got it to work as she ended up bouncing up and down here and there. She barely made any progress, but the head was sweating bullets. To her, she is doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's done, she hopped down and stretched her teeth as they felt sore. She realized that maybe she needs to wait until there are more head friendly stuff. Though there is the track like field she could use later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was rough, but worth it! Maybe some laps will do!\" Harley said as she started rolling off to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head then rolled to the field and did about 10 laps before retiring for the day.

Della spent the whole time frowning and glaring at the Collector as the Collector looked happy to just sit back for once. Sometimes Della is put on as it was Franny's turn to be the head.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were three specific heads to be exact that the collector is interested in trying on today. It was mostly an odd story of how she got them but she collected their heads regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the heads is named Maria, an innocent religious girl with short black hair and green eyes. She was captured during a bet between both an angel and a demon whom the collector also stole their heads from. The bet was to see is Maria can be corrupted only for it to be a tie thanks some odd technicality. The collector bet that the tie will happen and won all three heads in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria hated to be in the collection as not only she find being a head unnatural but she can't die and go to heaven. She is not outright rude or front about it. She spends most of the time praying and staying silent unless spoken to. When interacting, she can be shy but is most of the time a sweet girl or head. She can be used to mediate arguments in the collection or calm things down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next head is the head of the devil who the collector nicknamed Lucy due to the complicated name. The demon's head has long blond hair in a pony tail with goat like horns with a tiara in between. The devil's relationship with the collector is mixed but the head favors her when the collector used her for sinful actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly is the angel Gabby and same reason as Lucy for the nickname. She looks like a twin sister of Lucy only with no horns and has a halo. Gabby is a bit bitter and can be rude and hostile for an angel. She does get along with the collector when she does good things or took time off not collecting heads. However, the head can be strict, very professional, and a stickler for the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon placement of the heads, Maria has to be in the middle between Gabby and Lucy as Gabby is Maria's guardian angel and Lucy is the devil on her shoulder. This is to ensure that Gabby and Lucy don't fight and Maria can help mediate the two heads better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the collector approached the three as Maria is praying as usual, Gabby is looking over Maria with care, and Lucy grinning at Maria. The three heads saw the collector as they wonder on who will be chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got time to get dirty or raise hell?\" Lucy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I advise you to take me instead of that goat. You should be doing good for the world with us heads! It is quite sinful for you to steal us, but at least do something good to balance it out!\" Gabby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello,\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe pick Maria and have her give you head?\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Maria deserve some time with a body and she will use it as God sees it fit,\" Gabby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like we have much control anyways,\" Maria said, \"But if you were to choose me, do take good care of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the collector decided to wear...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a year and a half since The Collector had gotten the head she now stood before.  It was a cute head, with olive tinted Mediterranean skin, sharp and angular cheekbones and a long thin nose, sporting an adorable thick mop of frizzy brown hair that The Collector just loved to run her hands through.  Yet, in that year and a half, she'd never been able to get this head's name.  Unless the head's name happened to be \"Go find my ass and kiss it.\" or \"I bet your head had to be real goddamn ugly if you had to take it off and wear ours.\"  She'd not only never given up on insulting The Collector, but she had somehow never lost her will to fight either.  She'd try to bite The Collector's fingers whenever she got near.  She'd try to chin hop her way off the shelf in an attempt to find... The Collector didn't know what she was trying to accomplish with that, but the fact that she kept trying it until The Collector had to fasten her to her perch with thick leather straps implied that she had some sort of plan.  Or was just that committed to trying to anger her.  And worst of all, if The Collector allowed her hair to grow too long in front of her face, the head would chew up balls of her own hair and spit said balls into the eyes of heads which seemed to enjoy The Collector's company, causing them to cry and complain and generally just sowing discord.  The Collector had recently resorted to applying tape over her mouth, but that was a solution that The Collector herself hated as it covered up the head's beautiful big lips.  Plus she had to apply another strip daily as otherwise this head would lick the adhesive away before chewing up the balled up tape and spitting it into other heads' eyes.  She had remarkable aim, The Collector had to admit.  Maybe if she bought a ball gag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector had tried everything she could over the last few months, switching tactics over and over again to try and see what would work.  Taking the head on walks through town, letting it watch movies, locking it in solitary confinement, trying to get other agreeable heads to socialize with her, letting her go filthy and mangy as punishment, nothing seemed to work.  While The Collector had plenty of problem heads, most seemed to at least lose some of their fighting edge after a year in captivity or at least make some like minded friends that they could 'plot their escape' with.  But this one had no need or desire for co-conspirators nor did she pity the heads who were complicit in her capture, she just seemed intent on annoying her way out of captivity. <br>\r\n Unfortunately for The Collector, this method seemed to be working better than any other.  All of the heads who had to spend time around problem head begged The Collector to get rid of this spoilsport, either because they enjoyed being part of the collection and she bullied them or because they hated being part of The Collection and were hoping to see The Collector up and give up on a head, as it would inspire them and give them hope that one day, maybe they could escape too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't never let that happen, obviously.  At worst, she'd just have to excavate a new room in her subterranean hideout exclusively for this head and keep her locked away in there at all times The Collector wasn't wearing her.  But she really hoped it didn't come to that.  She was such a pretty head, she wanted her proudly on display.  She had to find some other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfastening The Head's Leather restraints and lifting it onto her shoulders, feeling the Head flex its jaws in a vain attempt to make The Collector lose her grip, The Collector waited until the head was under her control before pulling the tape away.  Even if it hurt, it would hurt less than getting her fingers bitten again.  \"How are you doing?\"  The Collector asked aloud, admiring the beautiful sound that escaped this head's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can control us, we can control you.  I'm going to figure out how to take control of your fat, disgusting, worthless body and I'm gonna make you jump off a cliff.\"  She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a new one.\"  The Collector said, genuinely surprised that she could still be surprised by this head's chutzpah.  \"But it doesn't work that way.  This control thing only goes one way, me to you.  Try a different plan.  Or don't.  I really feel like you'd like it here if you just told me what sorts of things you liked and just gave living here a fair chance.  What are your hobbies?  What do you like doing?...  That isn't related to escape?  I can be pretty flexible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like this place if it were on fire.  With you in it.\"  She thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"  The Collector said, rolling the unruly head's eyes.  \"I'm just going to freshen you up a little.

Even if this head could \u2018talk some sense\u2019 into The Collector\u2019s original head, which she couldn\u2019t, The Collector still wouldn\u2019t let her go. She was in charge around here, and she would never allow her collection to be compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen no. Literally why would I want to talk to yet another useless glass-half full yes-woman shit-for-brains telling me to just lay down and accept that this is my life forever now and I have no say in it. Fuck your head and fuck you.\u201d She thought, raising her mental voice higher and higher as her tirade went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can do one of those for you.\"  The body said, shrugging.  The collector walked through the halls of heads composing her head shrine, some heads complimenting her on keeping up her efforts to indoctrinate the head on her shoulders, some heads insulting the angry brat she wore, and some insulting The Collector herself and cheering on the angry head, though the angry head provided no further thoughts one way or the other on their reception.  She seemed too confused by the headhunter's comment and what it meant.  Reaching the staircase out of the cellar, the angry head thought that the two of them would be going on another walk around town, until The Collector turned and entered her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the accommodations for her heads were rather lavish for a hand-dug underground tunnel system, particularly for The Collector's loyal and happiest heads who were given access to things like pillows, TV's, voice operated laptops (no internet without The Collector's direct supervision, though), toys and games that could be operated with the mouth alone, and polished hardwood shelves of obviously high craftsmanship, the room that The Collector herself slept in was extremely spartan by comparison.  No artwork, no electronics beyond a cheap plastic lamp on her nightstand, furniture made of simple plywood amd aluminium screws, the only luxurious thing in the room seemed to be her mattress, which was a thick memory foam thing with sheets and quilts so puffy you could get lost in them.  The head supposed it made sense, The Collector spent so little time in here that there was no real point in getting fancy with it.  As for why she came in here<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you come in here?\"  The head thought, her usual anger dulled somewhat by genuine curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told me to fuck myself.\"  She said, using the head's own voice but intentionally losing the angry tone the head had thought those words in.  \"If that's what'll make you happy, I accept.\"  She continued, unzipping her jacket and sliding them off her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head was at a loss, her mind going blank as she felt the body slowly disrobe.  The head could feel everything the body felt, and The Collector tilted her head down and kept her eyes fixed unblinkingly on what she was doing just to really run the point home.  \"You-you can't be serious.\"  The head thought hazily, her words somewhat scrambled as she was unable to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different heads have different needs.\"  The Collector said, unfastening her bra and folding it up neatly before setting it on her nightstand.  \"Some want to eat, some want to watch TV, some want to socialize, and some want... more basic pleasures.\"  She slipped off her long black socks and set them beside her bra.  \"I admit, I don't normally do this for heads that act like you do, but I realize now that, as a woman who I'd captured in a... compromising position.  Maybe working some of that out of your system could improve your mood.\"  She said, pulling off her panties and neatly stacking them with the rest of her clothes.  She was now fully naked, her cool hands slowly running themselves down her warm sides as she gave the head an eyefull of her forever youthful body.  While she'd insulted The Collector's figure earlier, The Collector keenly remembering the terms 'fat' and useless' getting thrown around, they both knew even then that the words were hollow and just meant to hurt.  The Collector was a fine body, one that any head would be proud to be mounted atop.  Soft curves, athletic from long nights and busy days, and a neutral tan complexion that seemed to go with just about any head she wore, apart from the VERY dark, light, or red ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stole me on my wedding night!\"  The head shouted in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as you and your hubby were about to consummate the marriage, I know.\"  The Collector said, remembering vividly each and every capture she had performed.  \"And I'm sorry I didn't wait until the two of you had finished... or had actually started.  But I was in a hurry and I needed to grab you while you and your husband were both vulnerable, and what's more vulnerable than underwear around both of your ankles stumbling blindly around a badly lit rented room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you don't have to tell me.  I WAS THERE!\"  The head fumed.  \"You stole me from my first love and you cucked me on my first fuck!  I'd been saving myself and you robbed me!  And now I'm never going to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you are.\"  The Collector interrupted.  \"And if you behave yourself, your first time won't have to be your last.\"  She climbed up onto the bed, her bare back sinking softly into the thick quilts as her legs spread slowly beneath her.  The head didn't respond, though The Collector could feel a lot of activity going on inside her borrowed brain.  Reaching into her cheap nightstand, The Collector withdrew a...</span></div></div>",

It does get lonely down here,\" the head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the collector said, \"I'll go pick them up while you behave down here until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector pulled the head off her shoulders and placed her on the shelf that she was confined in without restraints. For once, the head obeyed as the collector left and the head remained silent as she made an evil grin. The head had some positive thoughts for once, but all of them aim against the collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna give her hell with some help,\" the head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector returned with three heads in her disposal that have been naughty in her book. All these heads have two things in common, they are pretty and they hate the collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne head has a doll like look with white pigtails, a white beret, some blush, and pale skin. Her name is Alice, heir to a rich doll company and is surprisingly an adult despite her young looks at the age of 19. She manages to run her company pretty well and can be professional about it. However, the collector stole her head during her conference of a new product and had spoiled her since to calm her down about her demise. At first, Alice is trying to get used to being a head and eventually took advantage of the collector's kindness to the point of being treated like a doll. Alice grew from an adult, to how she was as a child, to the definition of a spoiled brat as she would make tantrums, insults, and lots of things that are unacceptable. It went too far when Alice started to attack the collector and the other heads just to get what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother head is of a previous serial killer who looked like a horror movie villain with ragged long black hair. The collector did find her pretty for a killer and needed something for a Halloween party. This was a big mistake on her part as the head had tried to kill other heads around her and has no desire to do anything else but to kill. There were also attempts at the head trying to kill the collector. All the collector knows about the head is that her name is Helena, she was in an asylum before, and she gets bored when she is not killing. Helena had to wear a brace for her teeth to not bite into people and a spell to make her more immobile than most heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, we have a head of a troubled girl with tied up blond hair that looked spiky with the name of Laura. She was found in the streets with no home or family and should be in high school but is really a drop out. Thinking it was a noble act, the collector took Laura's head to provide her a home and be her adoptive mother of sorts. Laura did not take this well as she has tried to make a gang out of the heads, smuggle some drugs somehow to the house, had some heads in the collection sold to the black market just to get money for a bunch of stuff, and she is really rude to the collector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These three heads are really naughty and deserves to be friends with you, I hope you girls enjoy each other's company,\" the collector said through a head that she picked up earlier before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This place is too dark and cold! And where is my pillow?!\" Alice complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh... only three heads here... too easy,\" Helena sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck here with you three?

She then took the head to her built in studio that she uses for her photography hobby. Minerva simply rolls her eye and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't done these for a while,\" Minerva said, \"I assume that it's just for fun, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector gives a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I'm not under a schedule or it's busy work, I can indulge you,\" Minerva said, \"Just don't get too cocky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector did warn her of the possibility of it going on the internet with hand signs. At least the head understood what the headless body meant the first time unlike some heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Minerva said, \"But again, I do these shoots when I feel like it. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector gave her a thumbs up again. She could not imagine what Minerva will do to her if she disobeyed. She has heard rumors of her doing things to people who seriously crossed her and the only assuring thing is that it's not for petty reasons. Despite being the master of all of these heads, she is powerless to some of them for certain reasons and she obeys just to keep them in her collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the Collector tried taking photos of Minerva's head only. Despite having only her hair tied up and not go all out like her past, the head gave it her all with her expressions and head turns. Her movement may be limited, but she was able to make some impressive poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector then joined in and did some poses while carrying Minerva's head. From what was seen in the photos, the head was able to outshine the Collector and most of the attention and appeal goes to the head. What's better is that Minerva was able to adapt to the Collector's poses and not keep the stoic or seductive look she often have. When the Collector would do a pose based on cheerfulness, Minerva was able to put her own twist in it with her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally came to Minerva's head attached and the Collector spent most of the time doing as the head tells her subconsciously. The photos look great but it feels more forced than what the head can pull off herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Minerva looks tired and is placed on a table. The Collector grabbed some water and offered it to the head even though the head doesn't need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the gesture,\" Minerva said, \"Now I feel that I should retire to my spot on the shelf. This session did take a lot out of me. Back when I still have a body, I would of have a small drink with some nightly routines if I were free. I miss those times when it was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the Collector...</span></div></div>",

Minerva looked surprised and simply smile for approval. The Collector left as Minerva waited for what her master have in store for her. After a while, the Collector came back with a pillow and what appears to be a bottle of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice of you to do this for me,\" Minerva said, \"I suppose that I would do this as a head? Perhaps if you can indulge me, I like to be able to do this as a only head and then with a body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector gave a thumbs up as she is aware of what the head has gone through. Giving control to her for a bit won't hurt as she first set the pillow under the head and poured the first glass. She fed it to Minerva's lips with care and going based on the memories that she absorbed from the head when putting her on. The head smiled as she simply drink as elegantly as much as a head can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do wonder, where would the drink go despite me lacking a body?\" Minerva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector pointed her neck to say that she'll tell her when attached. Minerva tiled her head to say that she wants to be attached now as the Collector obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector said with Minerva's mouth, \"Mostly when you are the head, the food goes to your old body, even if it is gone. When attached to me, it goes to me of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intriguing,\" Minerva said in the Collector's mind, \"So about using your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" the Collector said, \"I grant you permission to control me for the time being. Be sure to not take advantage of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise,\" Minerva said with her own lips again as she has control after so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former model drank a little as the Collector was happy that one of her heads is happy. Minerva didn't finish the whole thing since she does not want to get wasted. After she is satisfied, Minerva went back to the hall of shelves and voluntarily attempts to put her head back in her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that I can trust you with control over me,\" the Collector said in Minerva's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minerva's head is placed on the shelf, she said, \"Likewise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector then left as... </span></div></div>",

Her pleas fell on deaf... neck, however, and The Collecter carried her off to the bathroom to freshen up.  \"Seriously, how many times are you gonna make me do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector put the pouting head on her shoulders, and answered in the head's voice \"I'll stop if you just admit that you're beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant control was given back to the head, she rolled her eye.  \"Fine, whatever, I'm beautiful.  A work of art.\"  She paused, then gave a cold laugh to herself \"A Picasso, judging from the sideways nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for that, I'm braiding your hair.  Hope you don't have any plans for the next two hours\"  The Collector said, pulling a stool up to the bathroom mirror and opening her makeup kit.  The face that looked back at her was certainly one of the more 'unique' in her collection.  It belonged to Ida, a rosy cheeked woman in her early thirties whom The Collector had, by means of kidnapping, saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda'd been stuck in an abusive relationship for years, emotionally dependent on a man who showed her boundless love, loyalty, and devotion most of the time but who would, on occasion, fly into fits of rage and lash out at everything around him, including her.  After a particularly nasty outburst, Ida tried to flee the house, and at the thought of her leaving him he went berserk.  He broke her nose, dug deep scars in her cheeks with his nails, and even put her left eye as he pummeled her.  If The Collector hadn't been strolling around the neighborhood at that time, he would have killed her.  The Collector used her magic to break him apart and hid all of his pieces all over the woods (save for two, which she kept in her cabin and tortured from time to time).  She actually didn't collect Ida's head that night, instead calling an ambulance for her before slipping off into the night, but when 3 weeks later she ran into Ida again, this time on a highway overpass with Ida leaning over the edge, The Collector knew she had to save Ida from herself.  She had to show Ida that she was still beautiful, that she was still wanted, and that she could still be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the scarred, eye patch wearing, crooked nosed woman's head, The Collector could still see the underlying beauty.  Her remaining eye was big, bright green, and was framed by perfectly curved brow that allowed each movement to carry so much emotion.  Her lips, though a small scar ran across their right side, were plump and curved into a beautiful smile (though the Collector had never gotten Ida to smile on her own free will) with big dimples that made her look ten years younger.  And her hair, now that all of the pulled parts had grown back, was gorgeous.  Auburn brown, naturally wavy but with little frizz, and reflective to the point of dazzling the unready eye, it framed her face beautifully when properly done up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a natural knockout, and despite the Collector's repeated attempts to touch her up and show her her true beauty, Ida refused to see it.  She continued to sulk and put herself down and demand that she simply be put back on the shelf and left alone until the heat death of the universe.  Or dropped down a well.  But, this time The Collector had a plan.  After giving Ida yet another makeover, The Collector intended to...</span></div></div>",

Track down my body and give me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking back control, The Collector twisted Ida's face into a horrified grimace.  \"Good heavens, no!  I'd never give up a head as pretty as yours!\"  Her face relaxed, and a slight smile crossed its large, plump, and slightly scarred lips as The Collector cracked open her makeup kit and began applying a layer of foundation.  \"No, I was saying that once I finish freshening you up, we're going to go to a club and hit on some people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIda tried to scream, but The Collector didn't relinquish control of her face.  Ida proceeded to curse her out inside her head, demanding that she stay home and leave her alone and stop applying that gaudy red lipstick, but to no avail.  The Collector ignored her furious ramblings, focusing entirely on making Ida as pretty as she could.  She straightened and trimmed her brow and applied a darker eye shadow to draw attention to her beautiful green eye, she lightened up some of Ida's scars without actually hiding them, she applied a glossy red lipstick and some rosy pink blush on her dimples to really make her smile pop, and just as she'd threatened The Collector braided Ida's hair into a tight, neat rope that she wrapped around her head like a crown.  The Collector had Ida's face smile, and admired her results.  While it wasn't a perfect face, it was beautiful all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to have some fun?\"  The Collector asked, Ida's inner voice having gone suspiciously silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Let's get this over with...\"  Ida thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as an enthusiastic yes, The Collector threw on a simple but stylish sleeveless black dress, a small black handbag, and a pair of heels tall enough to give her a noticeable boost but short enough to be comfortable.  While The Collector would normally ride her motorbike into town, she wouldn't be able to get a helmet over this hair without ruining it and wouldn't dare endanger one of her precious heads by riding without a helmet.  This left her with only one option.  \"Okay, let's dust off the old teleportation spell!\"  She said, rubbing her hands together.  In truth, the Collector didn't like using teleportation, as it drained her magic faster than just about any other spell she knew.  She could only hold so much magic inside her at any one time, and while it recharged on its own it took 24 full hours to fully recharge her magic batteries.  Just teleporting into the city would drain nearly half of her battery, and teleporting back would drain another near half leaving her all but powerless.  She hated having no magic, made her feel naked, but this was just something she'd have to do  if she wanted to give Ida the night of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing Ida's eye tightly and concentrating, The Collector teleported herself into an unused bathroom stall in one of the town's busiest clubs.

While she didn\u2019t have eardrums that could ring, The Collector could still be startled by loud noises, and this surprise greeting sent The Collector stumbling back a few steps in surprise.  \u201cO, surry.\u201d  The head whispered, smiling nervously as The Collector regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector paused for a moment, then responded \u201cHello, Orchid, how are you?\u201d in slow and robotic American Sign Language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite regularly having no mouth, The Collector had never really been interested in learning any form of sign language.  She could hear perfectly fine despite her lack of ears, and if she wanted to say something to someone she\u2019d learned to both type and write extremely fast, could put on a head to talk, or she could just take the head of whoever she wanted to converse with and attach it to herself so she could communicate telepathically with them.  Very few people spoke sign language, and as a result she\u2019d never put much effort into learning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until, she Collected Orchid, a deaf and dyslexic Hawaiian college student who\u2019d been touring in The Collector\u2019s woods many years ago.  While Orchid could read and (formerly) write, it was extremely slow and tedious for The Collector to converse with her through text.  The Collector could attach a head and have Orchid lip read when she wanted to speak with her, but for some reason when The Collector spoke through a head the words were, according to Orchid, \u201cmuddy\u201d.  She could lip read any head talking to her with zero issues, and The Collector had taken the liberty of mounting Orchid\u2019s head to the wall like a trophy opposite a head shelf so she could see and talk to a lot of heads rather than putting Orchid on a shelf where she couldn\u2019t see their lips well, but when the Collector took control of another head\u2019s lips it was for some reason hard for Orchid to read them.  Orchid theorized that because The Collector was only borrowing the head, and wore a lot of different heads with different musculature, its movements weren\u2019t fully natural or consistent with the face and fell into a sort of lip reading uncanny valley, the equivalent of a normal person hearing a computer synthesized voice.  She could understand it if she concentrated, but it was a bit jarring and unsettling according to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, Orchid couldn\u2019t follow The Collector\u2019s lips well, couldn\u2019t generally read well, couldn\u2019t hear at all, so The Collector had started putting in the work learning ASL.  \u201cThat wus pretty gud.\u201d  Orchid said, her voice rising to a level slightly above a normal person\u2019s speaking level.  \u201cAnd Iam doing all right, thaenks.\u201d  She said, her tone less enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright?  What\u2019s wrong?\u201d  The Collector signed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Iam still a prisoner in a crasy witches dun-g-on, I don\u2019t know howe my family is coping, and I miss avin\u2019 my own arms an legs.\u201d  She said, very curtly but not maliciously.  Orchid had once been a very problematic head for The Collector, her deafness and the fact that she could scream indefinitely once detached from her body allowing her to scream for literal days on end.  While she had certainly calmed down over the years, she still resented her kidnapper.  Orchid had wanted to be a great artist, studying photography at a prestigious university and profitably selling her own paintings (both watercolor and oils) since she was twelve.  She\u2019d actually been photographing the headless bodies that sometimes surfaced in the nearby towns and snapping pictures of the woods they\u2019d lost their heads in for a school project when The Collector found her.  Of course, now that she was stuck in this \u201cdun-g-on\u201d, as her deaf accent pronounced it, she had very little artistic inspiration.  She had no means of taking photos, and even if she could her subject matter was rather limited.  As well, while the Collector tried to make her happy every few days by putting a brush in her mouth, setting up a paint palette below her chin, and putting a canvas in front of her, Orchid had lost her passion over the years.  She had developed amazing an amazing skill in painting with only her mouth, but her once happy paintings of flowers, mountains, and landscapes, had all become paintings of bare branches, foggy windows, and half buried coffins.  Often, she\u2019d just let the brush fall out of her mouth and refuse to paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector did feel bad, but she knew she\u2019d come around.  All the heads did.  And even if they didn\u2019t, they eventually learned to find their own happiness here.  She just had to keep trying.  For now, The Collector decided to take Orchid off of her mounting and try cheering her up by giving her a nice grooming.  She\u2019d gone a long time without a proper wash, and dried paint was all over her face and hair.  After washing her up, if Orchid was still feeling down, The Collector would\u2026</span></div></div>",

She'd built up such a stash over the decades that actually finding the time for all of them was all but impossible, yet she didn't want to make any of the heads feel bad by not choosing them.  She grappled with herself for nearly an hour, examining just about every head in her collection, until eventually she managed to build up a sizable headache.  An impressive if annoying feat, considering her lack of a head.  She needed air, despite her lack of any way to breath it in, and when the head lines walls began to feel like they were closing in on her, she made her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, The Collector would spend the day clearing her head by not having a head to clear.  Quickly, The Collector threw on a coat and fled her suddenly claustrophobic cabin, the cool morning breeze tickling her bare neck stump.  In spite of her thick coat, long sleeved shirt, jeans tucked into tall boots, and a comfortable set of undergarments including a thick woolly pair of socks, The Collector felt naked.  She'd been out headless before, of course, but it was usually in the dead of night, and it was usually done when she knew she'd be collecting a new head to wear soon enough.  Being headless in broad daylight was extremely rare, and the thrill of breaking her routine had her arms breaking out in goosebumps already.  Yes, this was the exact change of pace she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector considered taking her dirtbike into the nearest city, but decided that a long walk through the woods to civilization would do her more good.  It was a long walk, made longer by the fact that The Collector had changed her mind halfway through her walk and went to the second nearest city, and intentionally overshot it so that she would be coming in from the side opposite her cabin (so that if anyone recognized her, they'd think her hideout was in the opposite direction), but after nearly half a day of walking she found herself peeking from a thick patch of bushes beside a bus stop on the outskirts of town.  Making sure that there was no one around to see where exactly she'd come from, The Collector emerged from the bushes and stood soldier stiff at the bus stop.  A few minutes passed, and a half full bus rolled up.  **BEEP BEEP BEEP**, the bus' speakers blared.  The Collector, moving with a mechanically stiff gait that she had learned from long hours of observation, entered the bus and lumbered to the back, barely turning a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't too surprising, seeing as how half a dozen other occupants had no head!  Yes, all those bodies that The Collector hadn't just disappeared.  Well, most of them had, and The Collector was still a little worried about just wear the hell most of the bodies had wandered off to since she never heard reports of their being found and she had never seen an animal attack them, but some of the bodies had found their way into the cities surrounding The Collector's woods.  Bodies freed from their heads by The Collector usually became autonomous and moved on their own, however it was evident to even a casual observer that the bodies that found themselves in the cities were NOT sentient.  They could move around, could perceive basic information about their surroundings, and they understand some simple words in whatever their native language was prior to head-snatching, but there was no intelligence behind any of it.  Opening doors was about the height of their intelligence and even that pushed the bodies' non-minds to their limits, they moved in unnatural lockstep and if they fell over they would not even try to get up unless explicitly instructed to, didn't retain any knowledge about who they were before beheading or what they did after it, and would blindly obey any instructions given to them (in their native language) by anyone who gave said instructions, assuming said instructions were incredibly simple and involved no reading, writing, complex motor skills, understanding of idioms and figures of speech, decision making, or anything else that would involve an actual intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnidentified bodies or ones from other countries that had found themselves in the cities were placed in what were functionally just storage lockers, the police keeping them locked up and safe until their heads were recovered.  Many, however, were given back to their families once identified, and the families that lived in these cities would often have the headless bodies of their relatives run simple errands, perform menial labor, or just send them out on walks.  Some did it for the sense of normalcy it provided to see their relatives moving around and doing things, some did it to try and job their memory, some did it for money, and some did it because they couldn't handle the grief of seeing their headless family member all day.  Whatever their individual reasons, the cities nearest the woods had grown accustomed to the sight of headless bodies wandering around unsupervised, and had made accommodations for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake the buses, for example.  Headless bodies were allowed to get on and leave without paying, got reserved seating in the back so that they always had a place to sit and knew where it would be (there was obviously some backlash about the implications of making a particular class of citizens sit at the back of the buses, but after weeks of bodies toppling over at every stop trying to keep their balance standing in the isle and trying to sit in other customers' laps the seating arrangements were pushed through).  And, instead of listing the stops (since bodies would often take the word \"stop\" as a command and would stay on the bus indefinitely) the buses would beep a specific number of times at specific stops, allowing the body's caretakers to \"program\" what stops to get on and off at by telling them to exit the bus after hearing a certain number of beeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the bus from her designated seat in the back, her posture rigid and identical to the posture of the other six bodies surrounding her, The Collector eventually noticed...</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to waste the opportunity to figure out what was different about them, The Collector waited until the body stood up to get off, following her off the bus. The body makes its way to an apartment building, showing more signs of sentience by punching in the combination for the door. The Collector follows right behind, catching the door before it fully closes to get into the building, and, when the body enters into an elevator, she followed. Once the elevator started moving, The Collector hit the stop button, trapping them both.<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In all her years as a head <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">thief</span> Collector, the Collector had never met another body quite like this.  Most bodies wandered off into the wilderness never to be seen or heard from again when they lost their head, roughly 80% of them if the Collector had to guess.  About 15% would become non-sentient drones that the nearby cities had taken upon themselves to shelter and provide for, like the Collector had pretended to be to make her way safely around town.  That left a 5% minority of <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">victims</span> collection inductees that retained a connection to their body, their separated body parts still reacting and responding as though they were whole.  That minority always annoyed the Collector, as those heads required a LOT of upkeep since the magic did nothing more than create a portal between the pieces.  The heads still required food, water, oxygen, regular grooming, and aged at the normal human rate.  The Collector would often only keep those outlier heads for short periods, then either sedating them and returning them to their owners while they were knocked out, or letting them think they escaped all on their own.  It was too much trouble to keep them most of the time, and it depressed the Collector if/when those heads started to grow too old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, however, was almost entirely new to the Collector.  A fully independent body that had no need of a head.  The only other example the Collector could think of was herself, and the Collector's head and body had separated so long ago that neither could remember exactly how they had done it.  The Collector had to know more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds lovely.\"  The Collector typed into her phone's text to speech, the robotic female voice showing none of the excitement the Collector felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently her body language did plenty of talking, as the next thing the independent body typed into her phone was \"Haha, I thought you'd like that.  Come on, my room is pretty close by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe independent body hit the button for the sixth floor and the elevator started up again, the two headless bodies not bothering to type during the short voyage upwards.  When the elevator reached the sixth floor, the Collector was surprised to feel a long set of feminine fingers wrapping firmly but not forcefully around her own, the independent body taking her hand and guiding her to the appropriate room.  Inserting her key into the door of room 609, the Collector was all but flung into the room by a body that seemed just as excited as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small and modestly decorated apartment which opened up into a living room composed of a small cheap sofa with a blanket and pillow thrown across it to make it double as a bed, a small cheap TV on a small cheap desk, and a cheap desk and chair tucked into the corner.  The only thing of value in the room seemed to be the computer and monitor stacked on top of the desk, a massive but sleek black brick of a machine that stood like the monolith from <b>2001: A Space Odyssey</b>.  Off to the left was a small bathroom with a door opened just wide enough for the Collector to see a shelf completely devoid of any beauty products besides soap and scented lotion, no makeup or shampoo or anything pertaining to the head and face.  To the right was a small kitchen devoid of... everything a kitchen should have.  The shelves were stacked with paperwork and files instead of cutlery, the stove was full of movies and DVD's and obviously hadn't been turned on since the body had arrived, and in place of a refrigerator there was a large bookshelf crammed with textbooks, mostly self help books and books on forensic investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, about that drink.\"  The Collector typed, seeing nothing but a tap and no cups to put the water in even if she wanted some.  In her excitement, she had completely overlooked the absurdity of a headless body asking another headless body to join her for a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe independent body froze, then slapped its palm against its neck stump, its closest approximation to a facepalm.  It typed rapidly and replied \"Ugh, sorry!  That was really stupid.  I was nervous and just blurted out the first thing that came to mind.  It's not often I have company, ESPECIALLY company sharing my condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector dismissively waved her hand.  \"No worries, I'm pretty excited too.  So, why don't we start with names.  I'm Suzanne.  What's yours?\"  She typed, picking the first name that came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Duel.  Hanna Duel.\"  Hanna Duel responded/<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lucky the Collector wasn't wearing a head, as if she were she probably would've burst out laughing at that.  Not just at the weird James Bond style introduction, but also \"Hanna Duel?  Like Dullahan?  Wow, you parents must've been psychics or time travelers or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought it was fitting.\"  Hanna said, one hand crossing her stomach in embarrassment.  \"Truth is, I don't know my REAL name.  I just woke up one day in the middle of the woods, naked and without a head.  I had no memory of who I was or how I wound up in that state, but after wandering around for a while I stumbled into this town.  They thought I was just another drone at first, but that theory was quickly disproved when I refused to follow orders and gave one overly handsy gentleman a piece of my mind.  And a bit of my shin.\"  She explained, pantomiming a crotch level knee jerk to drive her point home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves him right.\"  The Collector typed, twitching her neck in a head shake.  She knew that not everyone in town showed the bodies the same level of respect, and many came home missing some clothing or didn't come home at all.  Before the Collector could realize the hypocrisy of her anger, what with her being a kidnapper who done plenty of things against the heads' wills, she typed \"So you had no idea who you were, and I assume no one in town recognized you either?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a lot of them thought I was the witch!\"  She typed, using the most common name for The Collector and the one she hated most.  \"Since I could think, didn't have a head, and apparently had a similar figure to her, they accused me of being the witch and trying to pull some sort of trick on them.  They threw me in jail and interrogated me for months, and my case wasn't helped by the fact that they couldn't identify any of my fingerprints, had no record of my DNA, and no one's head had gone missing for nearly a year when they had found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A year?\"  The Collector typed.  She couldn't recall the last time she HAD gone a year without stealing a head.  She usually took one head every month, two if she found a REALLY nice pair.  She'd had a dry spell every now and then, usually when she stole someone a bit too high profile and had to lay low for the heat to die down, but a year?  \"When DID they find you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between 82 and 84.  I kind of last track of time in jail.\"  She typed.  \"Anyway, when another body turned up without a head, they realized that I really was innocent and they let me go.  A lawyer got me a fat cash settlement for emotional damages, and I set myself up in the city.  I went to school, became a police detective, and now I'm hoping to one day nab the witch and get some answers.  And my head, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"  The Collector typed.  She was at a loss.  Even if she wanted to give Hanna answers, she couldn't.  She had a good memory for faces, but all bodies kind of looked alike to her.  Especially Hanna's since, as she pointed out in her story, it LITERALLY looked just like herself, apart from being a bit taller, a little more muscular, and with a slightly smaller breasts.  The Collector had plenty of heads that matched this body's skin tone, but she couldn't remember taking any of them in the early eighties.  Like Hanna had said, she was pretty inactive at that time (though, not ENTIRELY off the radar like Hanna had said.  She distinctly recalled picking up a butch drifter named Caitlin and a teenage runaway named Sam during those years, and was pretty sure there were one or two heads she was forgetting).  Despite coming here for answers, The Collector now had more questions than she'd started with.  \"So, what now?\"  She asked, unable to figure out which burning question she wanted to ask first and hoping for some direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\"  Hanna typed.</span></div></div>",

While most of the people in this city paid her kind no mind, some people would naturally be uneasy around magic and those enchanted by it.  Maybe they pair were tourists, or people who had just moved in and were still getting used to the city's quirks.  Maybe the Collector reminded them of someone they knew, and they were trying to figure out who had so recently got got.  Or, maybe they just thought it was weird and that she was weird.  All possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes ticked on, and the pair continued to stare, point, and whisper to one another, the Collector began to grow uneasy.  Did they recognize her?  Would they cause a scene?  Would it look suspicious if she got off the bus or would they escalate the situation if she stayed on.  While The Collector knew a few spells other than head detaching, noise amplification was not something she'd bothered to learn and now she was beginning to regret that negligence.  What were they talking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector looked them over with her non-eyes, wondering if they somehow knew that she was staring at them just as they were staring at her.  The man was a bit on the shorter side, maybe 5'8\", and if the Collector were wearing a head right now she may have been a hair taller than him.  That said, the man was both broad shouldered and well muscled, a boxer's build complimented by a crooked nose and an intense gaze.  The woman beside him didn't look much less intimidating, equally as tall as the man and sporting cold eyes, angular features, and a few scars around her wide, thin lips that suggested her pointed jaw had taken more than a few good hits.  The Collector was no stranger to physical combat herself, as not all of her victims were alone and not all of them went down without a fight, but even so she could feel her skin crawling under their combined stare.  What did they want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the pair answered her.  They looked at one another, nodded, and approached the Collector.  The Collector remained perfectly still, hoping that even if she played dumb the other passengers would step in to defend the mindless headless body.  Assuming she needed defending, because hey maybe they didn't know her and this was all a misunderstanding.  As it turns out, the pair are...</span></div></div>",

An indirect telepathy spell was significantly more complex, so much so that The Collector had never learned it  That's why she had to talk with her phone or a pen and paper while headless.  If he was using it, and if his partner knew of it, the two were probably... \"You're magic users too?\"  The Collector thought at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.

Got gals linin' up to rub noses with ye?\"  The Collector heard, Lynne's voice clear despite her lack of moving lips.

Knew this was the 'ead witch 's soon 's I saw 'er, unlike some thick Lynne's I know.\"  He thought, folding his arms and adopting a self satisfied smile.  Lynne elbowed him again, causing Caleb to shove her shoulder, and the pair broke out in a fit of rowdy laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're magic users, and you're some type of British.  Would you care to tell me what you're doing all the way out here?\"  The Collector thought at them.  While the pair seemed friendly enough, their physiques and appearances still intimidated The Collector, and the fact that they were both magic users only deepened her unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I s'ppose.\"  Caleb thought, shrugging.  \"We're agents of th' International Wizarding Guild, 'ere to investigate an unlicensed magic user 'ose been stealing dames' heads'n releasin' their unsupervised 'n uncontrolled bodies into the wild.

How had she never heard about this.  And why are they investigating her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you investigating me?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's brow furrowed, trying to come up with a good way to explain.

Sitting near the front of the bus was unmistakably Maria, a meek little Catholic girl the Collector had Collected over a year ago.  Well, the Maria SHE knew was a meek little Catholic girl.  The one she was looking at now was almost the exact opposite, a spikes and leather clad punk plastered with anarchy symbols and slogans and with tattered sleeves covered in LGBT+ pins and patches.  Despite her new dress code, and the fact that her once long and wavy brown hair had been completely shaved on both the left and right side of her head and dyed into a tangled orange and yellow mess on the top and back of her head, it was still Maria.  Her small round nose, her low set and pouty lips (crimson with lipstick), her large hazel eyes set low beneath a high arched brow (now with 2 circular piercings above the right eye), the Collector never forgot a face and that face was Maria's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, she thought it was.  Right up until not-Maria turned her head and revealed a small mole near the bottom of her left cheek.  Maria didn't have that.  The Collector stared at the familiar yet alien woman for a long time, though luckily no one on the bus seemed to notice as she had no head and therefor where exactly she was looking was a mystery to all but herself.  The Collector was starting to wonder if she'd gone crazy (a thought that the ageless, head kidnapping psychopath with a superiority complex and a completely backwards moral compass surprisingly didn't consider that often), the Collector suddenly remembered something.  Maria had mentioned having a sister once before, in passing conversation.  She had never mentioned that said sister was an identical twin, but why would she?  It would be a weird thing to bring up to your kidnapper, and maybe she was embarrassed.  After all, she was everything her sister wasn't.  Or, maybe her sister HAD been like her, but had switched up her look and outlook after Maria went missing.  Maybe Maria was trying to protect her?  She didn't know, all she knew was that Maria was still safe and sound in her underground dungeon, and she silently sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, The Collector decided to...</span></div></div>",

What's that about?!\" the not-Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector then ran out of the bus as she makes a hasty escape back home as the not-Maria head surprisingly acted calm after a while. Confused at best but the head just kept her mouth shut. Upon reaching her collection, the Collector saw Maria being in the middle of an argument between her angel and devil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying, Maria should be used as a toy for once,\" Lucy said, \"I had so much fun when she used me as such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will not engage in such activities!\" Gabby said, \"The best thing to do is remain on the shelf and refrain from sin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I have a say in this?\" Maria asked, \"I don't like being stuck here but I don't want to be a sex toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria then notices the Collector and the head that she is carrying which made the head shocked. She tried to hold up the tears and her fears as there would be no one to wipe them for her as she saw her sister as a disembodied head like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis!

Bitch!\" Lucy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit that I acted on impulse but I was worried for you!\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! Look, I'm sorry and I finally got a taste of my own medicine. But just for you to know, I took care of your body. Mom and dad were freaking out and scared having no idea what to do with your body when they found it. I took it upon myself since some idiots thought it was sinful for doing such things. This is why I hate religion and mom and dad agrees with me on that part,\" not-Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am a sinful being now! A head should not live on after decapitation,\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again with the sin and crap! I believe ever since I saw a literal angel and devil fighting each other over you but I ain't buying the bigotry! You are not a demon, you are my sister!\" not-Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with your sister on that one,\" Gabby said, \"You humans can be bigots when it comes to god. She might look like a sinner but her heart is in the right place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Georgia,\" Maria said, \"I mean G.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" G said, \"We're together at least and I'm at least away from the bullshit that is my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and G has their heads placed on an empty row of the shelf together to separate them from Lucy and Gabby to help them bond again.

A few passengers groaned as the driver put the bus in park so that she could assist you, their journey delayed.  \"You, body, stand.\"  The driver instructed in a clear and loud voice, wrapping her arms through the body's armpits and linking them under its chest.  She manhandled the torso upright, and as per her instructions The Collector stood up in a slow and rehearsed series of motions.  With the body standing at attention, the bus driver came around and looked at its chest, then its arms, then walked around to its back again, her face transitioning from annoyed to confused and right back to annoyed again.  \"No tag, are you joking?\"  She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince bodies were so easily knocked out of their rhythm, most caretakers affixed an index card somewhere on the body indicating the body's home address, their caretaker's phone number, what their instructions had been, and what the caretaker would prefer you do should the body become disoriented (whether to walk it back home, reprogram its instructions, call the owner, etc.)  Since The Collector had come to this city on a spur of the moment decision she hadn't thought to make herself a tag and even if yoshe did she didn't fancy fabricating a cover story that someone might be able to debunk and cause even more trouble than just playing dumb would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, the bus driver stepped out of the vehicle to check her cross-streets, then returned to the bus and said in an authoritative tone \"You, body, exit vehicle.\"  The Collector did as instructed, turning mechanically and marching out onto the pavement.  \"You, body, turn left, walk three blocks, turn right, walk two blocks.\"  She instructed.  While The Collector didn't know this city well enough to say with total certainty, she were 95% sure that the bus driver was guiding her to a police station.  There they would attempt to identify her and return the body to its caretakers, or otherwise put it into one of their storage facilities.

She's like a modern take on Shirley Temple except for the fact that she is not perfect at everything. Just acting only. She ended up in the collection much to her dismay and is more concerned about her career than her state as she often worries that no one would hire a disembodied head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the collector being her master, the collector does respect her for her talents and has seen movies featuring her. Christi acts like a strict mentor to the collector when it comes to acting and will not tolerate any mediocrity. The same goes to any heads who were also actresses either they are more experienced or not. In a way, the collector fears and respects the head. In fact, Christi is the type to refuse to be attached to the collector unless she proves herself worthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how strict the head is, she is kind and warm to others on other matters. The best way to describe that side of her is that she is like an older sister. She does respect actress heads that are older than her but will not hesitate on criticizing them if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head has long blond hair with some locks tied at the back of her hair. While she has a young aura to her, she is surprisingly older than you think as she is about 19. One could mistake her for being a high school senior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she wishes is to get a gig again instead of being stuck on the shelf. Or at least her friends get an opportunity in acting. Either she and they get a new body or be able to act as heads. She does get nervous over how society would not accept her for her bodiless state even though she wants to be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what would we do with the head?</span></div></div>",

She spent her time finding inner peace and lacking a body has helped her do so. She felt more at ease until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M BORED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella opened her left eye as she saw her neighbor being impulsive and impatient. The head next to her is Sunny, a tan brown twin tailed haired head with a happy go lucky and energetic personality. She often is the head used when the collector needs to feel more positive about life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The collector hasn't put me on for a while and I got nothing to do,\" Sunny said, \"But that might mean that she is not sad so I should be happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStella just smiled as she tried to meditate again. The collector has put Stella next to the more social heads so that Stella would be able to talk to others better. It sort of worked, but Stella doesn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you truly feel happiness from the happiness of others?\" Stella asked with her eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I feel happy for my body out there having fun! I'm happy for the collector feeling good about herself. And what's this? I made you smile! Everyone told me that you barely do!\" Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can smile,\" Stella said, \"I choose not to. Though being around you is pretty infectious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy for you,\" Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about yourself?\" Stella asked, \"Sure you are happy for others, but have you felt happy for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! The fact that I can still do something without a body is enough to keep me smiling. Since I'm a head, I have a face and it's my job for my face to keep smiling,\" Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, something tells me that you are hiding a frown under there,\" Stella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mean,\" Sunny said, \"I'm doing my best to make the sadness here go away for the heads here. I do admit that I don't like seeing the heads here sad. Someone's got to be their sunshine in this room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woe is you to take such a heavy burden for us all. I am not mocking you as I feel pity,\" Stella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! I'll be fine! Maybe you can join me!\" Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Stella said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could make an event where we show the joys of being here! Maybe that will raise the morale here!\" Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this girl is dense. She's interesting,\" Stella thought to herself, \"Maybe I should follow her to see where this goes. On the other hand, it seems like trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Stella...</span></div></div>",

Shit, indeed.  How could this have happened?  \"How could this have happened?\"  The head said, this time preempting the Collector's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched a blue and black sea of police officers, search and rescue operators, deputized members of the local populace, news crews, and even an FBI agent swarmed into and around the Collector's ostensibly abandoned cabin, which served as a front for her main base of operations and home to her lair.  Nearly her entire collection was stored there, nearly 500 heads of all ages, races, classes, and from several decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, those 500 heads were slowly amassing in a heap outside, the deputies stacking them in rows while a few officers went to work identifying anyone they could.  Some heads were laughing and praising the men and women who'd finally saved them, others were crying out for the Collector to come and rescue them from their rescuers, others still were silent, either in shock or simply not sure what to make of this turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector wanted to scream.  She might have screamed, had she been wearing her head when she got back to her cabin.  How could this have happened?  How could they have found out her hiding place?  What was she going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was not entirely lost, she still had about 20 heads scattered in hidden locations around the forrest, as well as a much smaller collection of about a dozen heads hidden away in the cellar beneath a second cabin, located FAR away from this one, which she had started building once she realized that she couldn't excavate any more space beneath her current dwelling without risking a cave-in.  Plus, she had a few 3-4 head stashes in other countries, hidden for when she took international trips and found heads that struck her fancy, but which she couldn't transport back to her neck of the woods until the heat died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was her home.  These were the majority of her heads.  And they were getting reclaimed.  \"What are we gonna do now, ma'am?\"  the Collector's head asked.  The Collector pat the thick mop of turquoise dyed hair belonging to Chloe, one of the Collector's most loyal heads.  She was one of the only heads that the Collector ever allowed to take temporary control of her body, and had always considered her a sort of adviser.  She was lucky, if nothing else, that she hadn't lost her.  \"I mean, I hate to say this, but there's way too many of them down there.  Even if you tried to pick off the stragglers one by one, eventually you'd get caught and catch a bullet.  Or they'll call in back up before you can get all your heads moved to some place new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector observed the scene before her.  At least two dozen people were buzzing around her cabin, police officers surrounding the place with weapons drawn and floodlights scanning the forest for the Collector while deputies ran into and out of the cabin carrying armfuls of heads and rescue teams tried to comfort and identify them as they were laid in heaps on a series of large blue tarps spread out around the building.  A young newslady was speaking to her camera wielding crew about the massive find, and was holding up the head of Heather Jueves, a beautiful thirty year old hispanic news anchor that the Collector had swiped back in the late 90's and who was now giving her first televised interview in over twenty years.  In short, there were eyes everywhere, and the chances of the Collector getting in unseen, incapacitating every able bodied person around her home, and getting all of her heads to some place safe and discreet (which she did not even know where that would be) was, as Chloe had pointed out, impossible.  That said, running wasn't going to be easy.  Without her, these heads had no way of getting their bodies back, even if they could be found and not many of them could.  They would be looking for her, and if she ran back to her secondary cabin they might get on her trail and find that one too.  That said, what if one of the heads told the police where the cabin was?  She only gave that information to her most trusted heads, but what if they had blabbed it to some of the less good ones, or what if they cracked under interrogation?

In the end, she could only salvage three heads because the police and all managed to break into her hiding spots. The collector ran off to who knows where, using her heads as disguises to get what she needs, and found a small motel that she can live for now. She spent the whole time disguising herself as Chloe to earn money while doing other things as the other three heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the three heads that she gathered is named Yuri, a stoic head with long black hair and Japanese. She was stolen when she was heading home in her limo as the collector crash the car and grabbed Yuri's head. Yuri was pretty much the pretty and smart student that students are jealous of while having parents who pressure her. Her background make her come off as cold and strict, but after some time with the collector, she does reveal to be a lesbian that can get really kinky if she wanted to which ends up making her drop her stoic attitude. The head for the most part act professional and is a bit antisocial while acting as one of the collector's advisors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other head is named Linda who is a blond girl with twin tails and she is what you call a tsundere. Not exactly like anime, but she does have her moments. She is often pessimistic and angry while being a bit demanding here and there. Here head was stolen after the collector could not stop gushing over Linda's attitude while Linda worked at an antic store. Linda hates being a head, but is kept content as long as the collector does keep her happy and does get along with other heads to some extent. Linda can be flustered and embarrassed over anything she messes up or have go against her if she said anything snarky and all. She is also age 21 for the record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly is Tammy, the calm and collective head that the collector wears when she needs to cool down. Tammy is the head that the collector used to resolve conflict and mitigate problems. The head has a bow tied up into brown ponytail hair and has a slight tan. The collector got her as a price for Tammy to save a friend of hers and kept that promise to this day. Tammy for the most part is chill and rarely get angry.

The Collector has a random head on just to be able to talk to Lina on the way. All the head know is that her master has something for her. Lina then found herself being placed on a magic circle as the Collector appears to be doing some odd spell. The head simply accepts this as it is the will of her master. The circle started to glow heavily until is just faded off as Lina started to feel light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, what is thy intention of this?\" Lina asked before finding herself floating in the air, \"Woah! What's happening to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You been such a good head that I grant you the ability to move as you please around the mansion. Remember that this is a privilege and I can take this right away from you,\" the Collector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful for thy gift, but do thee might helping me out? I can't control where I'm going,\" Lina said as she lacks control of her new floating ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure!\" the Collector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector gave the head some small advice and some lessons to control her movements. The head eventually got used to it and act as though she has a body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember,\" the Collector warned Lina, \"You can only float around the mansion and not outside. The garden is the exception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am grateful for this ability of flight master,\" Lina said, \"Thee won't regret this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so...</span></div></div>",

What really shocked her was that she felt the pulsing of a rifle gun. It's one of those hunters, huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful,\" said the Hunter as she picked up the head, \"No need to lose more than your noggin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let me go!

Safari hat and coat while has parts of her clothing that cleverly hid her weapons so you don't know what she'll pull.

I also got this for you as a small token.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Collector caught what appears to be a pamphlet for a head auction. She seems interested and got an idea what's it for. A competition in bidding. Though she does wonder how the Hunter earns money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I'm some random bum who hunts heads,\" the Hunter said, \"Sometimes I get my hands dirty or sell stuff in the black market. Both the heads and maybe their stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear one of these days I'll take your head and give you a taste of your own medicine,\" the Collector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today cuz my ride is here!\" the Hunter said as a ladder appears as the Hunter climbs on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above appears as a giant blimp like mansion that soars in the sky but appears hidden from the public view.

Hope nothing gets in the way of our fun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't jinx it,\" Meggie said, \"And what are friends for. We like having a home and being paid and you like hunting 'cute' heads. I personally like to do as I please with your collection and see them in despair when we help you with the hunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right I do,\" the Hunter said, \"And I don't just do it for anyone, we known each other since kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for taking us in ever since you know,\" Annie said as the Hunter shrug in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how is my collection doing?\" the Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dandy as usual,\" Annie said, \"Though Meggie got her crying again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I like seeing them in despair,\" Meggie shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to judge,\" the Hunter replies as the three went to the Hunter's collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a big room, there is a collection of heads that were displayed as if they were trophies. Some were held up in plaques while others sat on pedestals or trophy stands. Some were used as decoration for the furniture and had jewelry to make them look nice. Annie was the one who helped designed this room and Meggie and the Hunter helped as the muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the heads stare at their master as they kept silent and only stared. If they were to talk, it grabs the Hunter's attention and they don't want to grab her attention. It's not out of punishment or anything, the Hunter will just play with them as if they were toys or something as demeaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hunter sat on a chair as Annie served her a glass of wine before giving it to herself and Meggie.

As part of my collection, I assume that you'll be granted more benefits than how you treat your heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any rules to not annoy ya?\" the Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just don't try to escape and when I need you, I need you. Other than that, just behave and we'll get along,\" the Collector said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we follow...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The story is about a head collector who goes out stealing heads for collection and accessory sake. She mostly spend her times either going out to get heads, grooming her current collection, or trying on her collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: Descent grammar is appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters and recurring characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collector: An odd headless bodies that likes to collect beautiful heads of girls. She only targets beautiful girls and either ignores or kill anyone else who gets in her way. At best, not care for the ones she is not into. She is often really eccentric and odd while having a strange caring side to her as she loves her heads and likes to abduct them from helpless victims. She is pretty open-minded of things to an extent just to make her heads happy like letting them use the internet if they can. She also learns from the heads she collected like playing music or speaking another language. She can be reckless as some of her choices involves charging into things. She barely acts serious usually unless her heads are in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina: A former youtuber that's into the dark arts and all. She lost her head to the collector after a deal with a devil gone wrong. Despite this, the head is content with being part of the collection and serves the collector as a loyal servant thanks to the contract. She often speaks all dramatic and all which the collector finds cute. She still make youtube videos with the collector and as a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe: The collector's guitar instructor and one of the main advisors for the collector. She is mostly taken for both her beauty and guitar skills. She is often wise in her odd way and seem to have some authority over the collector even if she isn't teacher her guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the heads are female and human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Updates] Fictional female characters can appear in this story as part of the collection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso I should of been more clear that the collection is filled with humanoid heads. Aliens can appear and anthros to an extent. Just no animals in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun.</td>",
