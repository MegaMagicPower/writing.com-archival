Its limitations were unknown, but the children have successfully used it in the past to: change their genders, swap their bodies, grow to tiny or enormous sizes; (yep this thing is the ultimate fetish tool :p...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this power came at a cost. First: you could never be certain exactly how the wish came true; some outcomes, as the children learned, could be quite horrific. Second, nobody not even the person using the diamond could be sure that they'd remember the change afterwards or notice that it has happened in the first place. These two conditions made the diamond very dangerous to use, and indeed the kids have agreed among themselves to never use it again except in the case of a serious emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was then. And that adventure seemed to be quite a long way away, as the four sat in front of the fireplace, chatting on a cold winter evening.<br>\r\nWith the world cold and dark outside, and the four huddled together in the company of warm cocoa, and -naturally- reminiscing about their previous adventures, the talk quickly turned to the diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine what you could do with it?\" Chris Clove daydreamed loudly. \"I wouldn't have to be Ignored Chris anymore - I could be Chris Clove, the...school's superstar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could use it I'd ask to grow up right now. Being the youngest sucks.\" Mouse Salt (whose parents introduced new curfew rules just the other day) commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonono, you guys are thinking about it all wrong!\" Summer, the level-headed one, interrupted. \"We should do something important and useful, like...I don't know...Use it against one of the bad guys we've been fighting in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you wish for, Jamie?\" Chris asked their fourth, oddly silent friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! ...me? I don't know, I guess I never thought about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you to be so boring\" Chris joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut secretly all four were fantasizing about what they'd do with the diamond that night, and at one point, one of them could not stand it anymore and tiptoed back to the living room, took the diamond out of its hiding place and said the words...</span></div></div>",

She knew that among all of her friends, she was the only one with a really good reason to use the diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know where the Clown Prince is and what he is thinking...and I want to defeat him.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould the diamond fulfill this wish?

The eye height felt wrong, the air in the room too.<br>\r\nShe seemed to be in some sort of engineering room, with scary metallic equipment and monitors.<br>\r\nBut what made her jump back in shock was that there was a busy girl in a clown attire fiddling with a control panel right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything OK, Boss?\" She asked her when she noticed Summer resting against a wall.<br>\r\nBoss...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her hands, which ended in red gloves. With a panic that almost made her throw up came the realization - she WAS in the body of the Clown Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled and fell on the floor coughing while the clown girl rushed to her aid. Her mind wanted to wake up from this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...OK...\" She somehow got back on her feet.<br>\r\n\"Oh, good! You wouldn't want to miss surveying the new captives in room 5.\"<br>\r\nSummer was feeling sickened again. While she was sitting at home, the Clown was continuing his old tricks behind her back...And this was just happening like it didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that she was not going to interrogate anyone if it was up to her, and she didn't quite feel strong enough yet to be ready to deal with whatever was waiting outside.<br>\r\n\"No, right now I just need to...retire to my Evil Lair...I DO have an evil, lair, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! 2nd door to the left.<br>\r\nIt's too bad - we hoped you'd be giving us some new friends!\"<br>\r\nShe held up  a device that looked like a half-sphere attached to a headband, or maybe a weird crown.<br>\r\nSummer's heart jumped. The mind control device! The Clown Prince stole it from Pao-Ting ages ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, she could put an end to - no maybe she might even be able to free the Clown Girls?<br>\r\nPao-Ting once said it was irreversible but there were counterexamples and it wasn't like they ever got the chance to try it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of her said that she should be working on undoing the spell, but the other part reminded that part that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not just to learn the Clown's plans, but maybe even get access to all of his assets and destroy them forever, and free all of his captives.</span></div></div>",

She noticed that there was a long, LONG line of people in front of her, stretching beyond and around the bottom of the pyramid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person in line crouched down and kissed her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it! That diamond must've been a trap by that stupid Summer. Just you wait when I get out of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All hail to the feet of the goddess! Its touch will bring us good luck!\" The person to the left chanted.<br>\r\nPao realized in horror that after the previous person stepped aside, the next one knelt down to her feet, and ran a finger up and down.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Ha-ha, no touchy! Hey! I'm your goddess, right? Then I command you...\"<br>\r\nThe man on the left stepped closer, he looked like a sort of priest.<br>\r\n\"Please, goddess, the people must get in touch with your feet or bad luck will haunt them.\"<br>\r\n\"They don't need to tickle me for that!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, but you see it's very important...For the goddess' foot and voice to respond, some of these people have a lot of troubles to confess...\"<br>\r\n\"That's got nothing to do with me! How long does this line go on for anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"It's a sixteen hour service every day. In the dry season, then we go back to foothbaths. That's about three months from now...\"</span></div></div>",

It was only natural that they would help them out, as their Boss said so too. But the way the girls would keep resisting their efforts and fought back left a strong impression on Smiley, and even more importantly, she was missing the kid detective's sister, who she felt she had developed a strong sense of camaraderie with.<br>\r\nAnd although they only had met briefly, Smiley secretly started to wish to see her again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so during the last big move that transported all the girls and equipment from the Mansion to a new location, Smiley got \"lost\", or more precisely, she lost herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering the streets, the eternal clown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outdoors turned out to be strange. There were people walking about (sometimes bumping into her) who did not laugh or appear to try to be happy at all.<br>\r\nSmiley squinted and examined her reflection in a shop window. Her makeup was slightly askew, but it was still her. She honked her nose twice to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese-looking girl who sometimes would be brought to the Mansion said it once that the clown girls were \"kidnapped\" or \"brainwashed\" but she wasn't sure if she could believe her, after all as far as she could recall, Smiley had always been just...Smiley. Although she wasn't feeling quite sure if that was true right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her morning, lunch and afternoon tickling, she was feeling strange right now. Her body still craved it, but walking up to a stranger and asking them to tickle her did not seem like a terribly good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had made a sign on a piece of cardboard that said WILL WORK 4 GIGGLES. but so far it did not work. No-one wanted to hire someone for giggles, which was strange because as far as Smiley remembered, that was the only thing you got hired for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a clown girl in the big town, whose only skill was to make people laugh with a touch. Poor, lost Smiley, what is she gonna do?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, they saw someone else arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wearing a mask like the others. She had messy red hair, just barely pass her shoulders. She had a simple tank top and short-shorts, ripped slightly. She wasn't wearing any footwear at all and unlike the girls who were only giggling, she was laughing out loud. The devices on her bodies were set to max, causing the red head to laugh herself to tears, yet she handled it like a champ, walking with complete ease.\"Hahahahahaha sohohoho hahahahahaha yohohou ohoohur nehehehw gihihihiirl hahahahahaha wehehehelcome\". The red head girl said, laughs intertwined with every word. The girl was released from the pole, a tickle-induced grin stuck on her face and she was taken to another room.

Fionna and sarah, the two leaders of the gang came and stood in front of everyone. The members in question tried to stifle their giggling fits, although very few succeeded. Fionna then spoke up through her laughter. \"HAHAHA I glad you HAHAHAHA sorry *snort* all made ihihihihiht. We hahahve found new tahahargets for our lihihihtle fahamily of ours.\" Fionna said, trying to talk clearly. \"You'd be easier to understand if you turn those things off.\" Summer thought slightly annoyed.

Summer was starting to get annoyed by all the constant laughing. \"Will you at least take those things off? I can barely understand you.\" summer said clearly annoyed. \"HAHA I can't. These are stuck like this.\" Fionna said. Summer's eyes widened. They were like this all the time. How has she not passed out or gotten even slightly tired? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did she sleep or eat knowing she was being tickled 24/7? Fionna could almost read her mind. \"I hehe guess hahahahhaah HAHAHa I mahahay as well explain\". She then stifled her laughter as best as she could, tho she couldn't stop grinning even if she tried. \"A few months, sarah and I visited a good friend of ours ,Mary, who had made quite the invention. She said these were suppose to be for massages but she messed with us and stuck them on us. The moment she turned them on, me and sarah were turned into laughing idiots.\" Fionna then paused to let out a small giggling fit. \"Both of us were already really ticklish so this was too much to handle. She even put them on our tickle spots, knowing we couldn't take it. Sarah and I finally couldn't take much more and tried ripping them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how they wouldn't we tried pounding at them instead but it only made things worse. We ended up turning them to their max setting and nothing she could do could stop it\" She had to stop again to let herself laugh. \"We both laughed to the point we passed out. We woke up in the hospital and we could barely talk from laughing so hard. It took a whole day to eventually get used to it and by that time, we didn't want the doctor to get them off us.\" Summer gasped at her words. \"We both learned we loved being tickled nonstop. I'd never seen sarah laugh like that before and she looked so happy. I couldn't believe how much I was loving it. I decided from then on that others needed to know this. As you can see, multiple girls here learned that they loved it too\". Summer didn't need her to finish. \"That's when she started kidnapping others\". Summer thought. The girl was a masochist for this kind of thing. She'd probably get a job with the clown prince easily. Summer knew she needed to be stopped but how.

She saw that the door was wide open and none of the others girls showed up but the leaders were way faster. Mouse then whispered to summer. \"Maybe two on one? They can take one of us but not both.

Every minute, every day of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake the following example.<br>\r\nI'm just walking to my classes as normal, proceeding along the school's main corridor.<br>\r\nThere are some girls running about in front of me, pushing each other, shouting and laughing - like girls do, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the suddenly the following happens:<br>\r\nOne of the girls cries out:<br>\r\n\"What did you say about my hair?\"<br>\r\nShe puts her manicured nails on her friend's sides, and the two fall on the floor. I can clearly see their panties as they drop.<br>\r\nThe first girl then begins to squeeze the second one's sides, until the second girl goes into a counterattack, and slips her friend's stockinged feet out of those shoes, and runs her ten fingers over her soles, causing the first to double over and the first ger the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, here I am, with this amazingly incredible scenario of tickle-play happening right in front of my eyes.<br>\r\nAnd yet I feel nothing! It doesn't excite me the slightest!<br>\r\nI wish these two bitches would just get out of the way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a teacher comes up and I can hardly believe my ears when she says:<br>\r\n\"Sue! Sally! That's quite enough, meet me for detention after school! And since you like being tickled so much, maybe we'll make THAT the subject of your detention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, can you even picture it? A teacher saying that? Wouldn't they have to face molestation charges or something?<br>\r\nBut apparently not. I know; I looked it up. And the librarian looked at me like <i>I</i> was being weird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here I am, every day, living like this.<br>\r\nI watch these happy perverts frolic around me and secretly in the back of my mind, I despise them.<br>\r\nBut I can't do anything about it. Fate dealt me a card from the bottom of the deck, and made me the one with the odd tastes. Oh how I wish I could meet just one girl who shares my fantasies but they never do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's maddening and unfair.<br>\r\nI mean look at me - I've got good looks - dark hair, brown eyes and a brooding attitude that chicks supposedly go crazy after. And they do, yes - at first. The problem is that as soon as they're starting to get to know me, they always, ALWAYS ask for me to tickle them! And when they find out it doesn't excite me, then they just leave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went out with this one girl once. Serafine Kawasaki. Picked her out of the class specifically because she seemed shy and quiet - the kind of girl you picture being as far from anything weird as it can be.<br>\r\nI thought that maybe with effort she could be molded into the ideal girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet picture this. We're in her room, I'm outting my hand on her breast - and she walks to a cupboard and starts taking out some amazing assortment of tickling tools! Furry handcuffs, ostrich feathers, soft brushes...I thought I'd have a heart attack right there! So naturally I refuse her, and now she's telling everyone<br>\r\nthat Dan Mitchels is just \"no good\". I get so frustrated I could burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I have learned my lesson.<br>\r\nNo more passes, no more second chances. <br>\r\nI'll just live my life without interruptions in this hell, day to day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...What is that?<br>\r\nI hear a loud voice and suddenly I have my eyes on the most adorable freshman ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Margaret! Leave those freshmen alone!\"<br>\r\nThe girl...Salt, was it?...says to her:<br>\r\n\"I had told you before! The way you're doing it, tickling is NOT fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stare in amazement. Could she be...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait! Don't let your guard down! It always starts out like this!<br>\r\nSure, she seems sweet and innocent now, but as soon as you get to know her, she's actually probably a total tickle masochist freak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl girl (Margaret) is now tickling her (of course).<br>\r\nSince the other girl offers no resistance, only defends herself (odd, very odd) she seems to get bored after a few minutes and stands up. Seems like she doesn't want to get in trouble with the teacher.<br>\r\n\"Pff, you were just lucky this time Salt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm staring at this girl sitting on the floor in front of me coughing and panting.<br>\r\nShe looks up at me. My brain catches up too late that she was probably waiting for me to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She's says pouting a little.<br>\r\n\"Wait...You were actually not having fun?\"<br>\r\nShe looks at me. \"Did it LOOK LIKE I was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment of weakness, I feel like I need to seize this chance. \"Hey...I have these tickets for Friday, would you maybe like to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait in front of the cinema. It's an hour late, I'm convinced now that she set me up and doesn't come.<br>\r\nWait! There she...No, it's not her.<br>\r\nShe dresses a bit like her, but it's a kid about half her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not a lolicon so I don't really care.<br>\r\nHowever then she starts following me.<br>\r\n\"What do you want, brat?\"<br>\r\n\"Brat yourself. I came to give you a message. Summer sent me.\"<br>\r\nSummer. Even her name is adorable.<br>\r\n\"Where is she?\"<br>\r\n\"She caught a cold and couldn't come.\" She snorts and doesn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, would you like to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're having an ice cream afterwards.<br>\r\nShe seems like a nice kid. Though being me means I had already noticed that \"glint\" in her eye.<br>\r\nOh well, it's not her tastes I'm interested in.<br>\r\nI decide this is a good opportunity to carefully confirm a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, does your sister get tickled at home?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. All the time.\"<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n\"Sometimes my mom tickles her, sometimes I do...Sometimes we both tickle her at the same time!\"<br>\r\n\"And...she doesn't object?\"<br>\r\nMouse thought about this. \"Not really as far as I know. I mean, she always curses when I do it, but she usually hugs me and calls me a good sister afterwards.\"<br>\r\n\"I...See...\" pause \"Hey, could you pass on a message to her..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey. I'm sorry I couldn't come last time...\"<br>\r\n\"No, I understand. Your sister explained everything.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can go some other time.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Some other time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer was sitting over family dinner complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. First I thought he liked me, but now he's not even returning my texts.\"<br>\r\n\"Boys, eh?\" Mouse said with a full mouth. \"You can't trust them. Hey, pass on the mustard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan's and Summer's search for romance shall continue...</span></div></div>",

She starts out as a 11-year-old (WordOfGod by Kuddles) but ages considerably between stories.<br>\r\nShe could be described as uptight, hot-headed and frequently arrogant;<br>\r\nbut a true hero always ready to fight for the needs of others.<br>\r\nHer perception of the world is colored by having consumed one too many detective stories, and she frequently imagines herself acting out such a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI actually find it curious that her strong moral sense remains unacknowledged and looked down on even by her sister and two best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her \"bookworm\" status, Summer is actually the most traditionally \"girly\" of all of the characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salt family all are derived from 60s era Western white \"nuclear family\" stereotypes. Hence, I want the reader to always picture Summer's dad with a friendly grin and a pipe in his mouth. :p<br>\r\nSummer herself is your typical white cheerleader stereotype, or more accurately draws on mid-20th teen detective story tropes. In later stories, characters often remark that for a \"modern girl\" she's remarkably traditional and old-fashioned. For example, she uses a typewriter and a camera instead of a cellhone - because that's what the archetype demands! :p<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Susan \"Mouse\" Salt:</b> <br>\r\nDespite bearing all the hallmarks of a spoiled youngest daughter, the 2nd daughter of the Salts displays a remarkably balanced personality. I think it's because (like many younger daughters) she subconsciously knows when not to push her luck. Thus, she knows how to enjoy life without worrying constantly like her sister.<br>\r\nAt times I think she may actually be the wisest of all of the characters...<br>\r\nAge difference from sister appears to be significant (3-4 years?)<br>\r\nThe origin of her nickname (\"Mouse\") has never been revealed in canon, leaving a good story ripe for future authors. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jamie Ginger:</b> Summer's best friend \"A\".<br>\r\nJamie is decidedly more mature than his/her other  friends, and has a tendency to abuse this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they are yet to make an appearance, Jamie is actually either the oldest, or one of the oldest of a family with 8 kids.<br>\r\nI guess that makes him/her the \"Ron Weasley\" of the story, same as Chris is the \"Neville\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chris Clove:</b> Summer's best friend \"B\". S/he tends to be an \"underdog with hidden depths\" type of character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris appears to be an only child (at least so far, no other siblings have been mentioned). The only family mentioned yet are a mother and a grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pao-Ting:</b><br>\r\nSummer's self-elected rival. A Chinese girl with a lot of ego who's also an inventor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to headcanon, she has an older sister who is an actress and foot model, and a great-uncle who is a offensive Chinese/Fu Manchu stereotype. She lived with her family until they lost their house and wealth between Mystery and Riddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Margaret (Montmorency) Allspice:</b><br>\r\nClass bully and heir to the Allspice farms. Margaret is your typical \"sadist\" type character.<br>\r\nHer partner in crime is (shorter, stouter) Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Suzanne Salt: </b>The girls' mother. Perfect mother, lover, and housewife. Ergo, there is not much to say about her.<br>\r\n(LOL, how cruel!)<br>\r\nOccasionally I wonder if a Ladies' Aid Society still exists in Hollering Heights. If not, I'm sure she can organize one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stephen Salt:</b> A successful writer and the girls' father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dan Mitchels:</b> Briefly mentioned in \"Riddle...\" (and further explored in the short story \"Melancholy...\"), Dan is Summer's crush (briefly) and a student at Hollering High &amp; Elementary. He is the only character in the Summerverse who possesses zero interest in tickling, a fact that causes him considerable stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Characters who appeared in \"The Sign of the Seven\" (spoilers):</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Waldorf Pepper: <br>\r\nA 19th-century pilot whose diary Summer finds behind a wall during the intro of \"The Sign of the Seven\".<br>\r\nA famous war veteran and soldier of fortune, who partook in many adventures alongside his cousin/sidekick Axelle (\"Axle\"). He owned the Salts' home before they bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Sugar/son:<br>\r\nMinor characters who appear in \"Riddle...\" as part of storyline.<br>\r\n(Never mentioned, but I think her first name might be Sandy.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty Cinnamon:<br>\r\nOwner of the Cinnamon Bakery in HH. She wouldn't be of much interest if she didn't happen to be the secret-keeper of the Seven, the last remnant of a secret society among 7 families who have played a role in the founding of Hollering Heights. As such, she plays an important role in the conclusion of \"The Sign of the Seven\".<br>\r\nHer age and even gender are indeterminate. Basically a tinier, transgender Mary Poppins.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clown Prince:</b> <br>\r\nSimply put, a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knows hypnosis, as well as many other clown tricks. He pops up at least 4 or 5 times (Riddle, Mystery, Clue, Case, and What...?) before the heroes can finally get rid of him for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Clown girls:</b><br>\r\nThe Prince's entourage. In my canon, they come into existence in two ways: <br>\r\n1. the Prince may use hypnosis (his own clown trick) to mesmerize a girl momentarily. This is temporary and subjects have to be gathered on the spot; indeed the clown paint's original purpose (in \"Riddle...\") may have been to hide who the victims really are. 2. with a device created by Pao-Ting, the condition can be made permanent and for all known purposes irreversible (although building a reverse machine has never been attempted in canon). Some powers like a vampire's own hypnosis are known to be able to break the effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSETTING:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Hollering Heights:</b> Summer's hometown where the majority of her adventures take place.<br>\r\nBased on \"Riddle...\", it appears to have many facilities, including: a museum, a library, a public park, a police station, a town hall, a shopping center...and probably many others that have not been revealed yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotable locations include:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Featherton Manor:</b> An ancient estate practically next door. It used to be haunted by Hildegard Featherton and Count Featherton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Allspice Farm:</b> Owned by one of the town's oldest families, it has an important role in the town's economy, and also hosts the annual town fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Podipopoulos: The founder of the town, if in name only. Based on his name, he must've been a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seven: Seven families who played a role in the founding of the town. Their names are: [SPOILER]<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Cinnamon, Pepper, Salt, Sugar, Clove, Ginger, and Allspice</font>.[/SPOILER]<br>\r\n________<br>\r\nGeneral guidance to writing Summer stories:<br>\r\n- One thing that stands out for me in SS stories is the amount of quality tickling content. ;) <i>(And we know what you're all here for.)</i> Even though I included a LOT more story focus in \"Riddle...\" (and have had immense fun building up the characters through them), most of these are actually there to provide a logical transition between different (fetish) scenarios. If you just want to cut the crap and stumble from one tickling scenario into another without providing exposition, go ahead. (This was more or less how it worked for \"Mystery...\".)<br>\r\n- Jamie's and Chris' genders are always up to the reader until a new chapter sets them in stone. Not using gendered pronouns is actually surprisingly easy once you get the hang of it. :p</span></div></div>",
