            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yes, my robot's finally finished!\" I shouted, a little louder than I'd hoped as the other people in our college's lab began to stare. I couldn't help it though, as I was more than pleased with the outcome of my work. Months of blood, sweat and tears went into building this thing, and it was finally done! Excited, I quickly finished typing out my notes so that I could test it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyping out the last sentence of my research paper, I slammed the laptop shut and grabbed the little robot along with the syringe on the table. See, the way this thing works is it's essentially a virus, like on a computer more-or-less. It enters your system through your bloodstream to the brain where it scans your brain cells, downloads your memories and transmits them wirelessly to the robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, enough with the technical stuff and on with the testing! I took the syringe, rolled up my sleeve and carefully stuck it into my forearm. I couldn't help but cringe, years of research on the human body for this experiment yet a simple needle in my arm still terrified me. I chuckled, realizing how stupid that seemed and pulled out the needle. Pressing a button on my phone, I powered on the robot to begin the upload. All that's left to do now is wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes my phone popped up with a message saying the upload was complete. Excited, I picked up the robot and held it in the palm of my hand. Peering down at my invention, I saw it standing in the middle of my hand looking back up at me. This is amazing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't told anyone else what I'd been working on as I wanted to wait until it was finished. But looking down at my seemingly flawless creation, I figure now is the perfect time to show it off. Walking over to Tara, I casually placed the robot on her desk, then proceeded to strike up a conversation. The plan was for the little guy to hopefully get the message and make his way over to Tara and surprise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tara! How's your invention coming along?\" I asked, trying to draw her attention away from the desk. Looking down though I could see my robot slowly but surely making his way to the edge of her desk. Perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Zack! And good, it's almost done actually! So, you ready to reveal whatever it is you've been working on all these months?\" She questioned, to which I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a possibility\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, seriously?! You've had that thing under lock-and-key! You've gotta let me see it!\" She begged, jumping out of her seat in excitement. Leaning back on the table, she made herself more comfortable to hear my presentation, and as I looked down I expected to see my robot nearing the edge of the table but, it was nowhere to be found?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Rest of the story is in the Robot's POV* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can switch back and fourth between Zack and his mini companion to add to the storyline if you'd like, but the majority of the story will be from the robot's perspective from now on</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I wasn't sure why he'd placed me on the desk, so I figured I'd just wander around for a bit. The world at this size was incredible! The wooden surface seemed to stretch forever, then simply dropped off revealing the distant background of the lab which appeared, at your size, worlds away. Looking up I saw Zack talking to Tara. Wait, did he put me on her desk? I made my way over to the edge as to be seen by them and sure enough, I saw him looking down at me. Good, he saw me at least but why wasn't he retrieving me? Nearing the edge I heard him tell Tara he'd completed his invention and suddenly she burst out of her chair in surprise. Before I could react, she turned around and began to lean back against the desk. Swinging her arms back, she used them as support to lean back and in doing so, unknowingly knocked me off the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damnit\" I said to myself. I knew I couldn't break from falling, I'm built to last baby. It was just the matter of getting their attention from the floor. Crashing down, I bounced quite a ways away. Gathering myself, I stood up and looked on to see Zack searching the room, clearly worried about something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, he noticed I'm missing!\" I yelled aloud, glad I wouldn't go unfound for hours as I thought I might. Running over to them, I was suddenly suckerpunched, or kicked rather, by this cunt Brian. That dude's such a snob, making shitty inventions that barely work so that he can feed his ego. He's been prodding at my work for about a month and the only reason I've kept it secret is because he insists on finding out what I've been making. He'd love nothing more than to get me kicked out of the lab and I guess he finally got his wish. Flying through the air, I braced myself for the fall. This time I was ending up a lot further away than I'd have liked to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's going to take a while to get back to them.\" I said to myself, standing back up after recovering from yet another fall. Good thing this hunk of plastic and metal was built by yours truly. Heading back, I swore to seek revenge on that dick when I was back in my body. Growing close, I was again rudely interrupted by a foot crashing down on me. With every step I was squeezed against the ground and pressed up against this person's shoe. From what I heard between steps, the person seemed to be female and heading to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this thing could feel, it didn't hurt being smashed against the ground. What kind of idiot programs a body that can feel pain?  Walking into the bathroom, she headed into a stall and shut the door. Waiting for her to sit down, I tried to free myself seeing as how I wouldn't have her full weight crushing me. Peeling myself loose, I waited for her to move her foot so I could make my grand escape. Eventually she did, and I quickly ran to the edge of the stall so I didn't find myself stuck in that situation again. Finishing her business, the mystery woman stood up, flushed and left the stall. Soon after she left, the stall door opened and another girl walked in. I recognized her from my classes, it was Julie! Wait, if Julie's in this bathroom, how far away am I? Should I try to ask her for help or just make my way back to the lab is the question?</span></div></div>",
