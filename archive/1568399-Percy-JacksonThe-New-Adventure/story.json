The giant pulled out a HUGE stone club with a dozen one feet wide and three feet long spikes. Despite his huge mass, the stone giant was quick. He slammed at the place I was an eighth of a second before. The spikes inflicted a half inch deep wound up my whole arm. I was demobilized by the pain, my knees buckled and I knelt down, and the giant came in for the kill. I tried roll aside but the pain was too strong. Before the club crushed me, an arrow was shot directly into the giant's eye. The giant disintegrated before my eyes. It was Chiron!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron helped me up and he bandaged my wound.

They're like your birthday, New Year's, Fourth of July, and whatever other holiday you want all rolled up into one. There's all the food you can eat, every imaginable (non-alcoholic) beverage you can drink, the latest hits playing on the stereo, and your best friends hanging out with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why I, Annabeth Chase, left early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't feel right. Grover was there, and Nico, and all my half-brothers and sisters from Athena's Cabin. Actually, everybody in the camp was there. Including Percy, of course...and Thalia. Yes, even the Hunters were persuaded to come. We were celebrating the finish of the new cabins. Percy used his brain for once and asked the gods for ALL the demigods--even the kids of the 'minor' gods--to be claimed and brought to camp. I for one had a lot more half-siblings, and there were a ton more cabins. And none of them were empty anymore. Even Zeus's cabin had an occupant--this kid named Ivan, who thinks I'm the smartest person since Einstein (who, by the way, was also a child of Athena). But I'm getting off-subject. I left because I wasn't having fun. True, I was kind of the 'guest of honor', since I designed about all of the new cabins. But it just wasn't right. You know before, how I mentioned that all of my friends were there? Well, I didn't tell the whole truth. There was someone missing, and my whole body aches when I think about the piece of my heart that's gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke. Yes, he gave himself to Kronos. Yes, he turned against all of us....including me. Yes, he tried to kill us on more than one occasion. But none of that matters. He sacrificed himself in the end, to save us. When we were up there on Mount Olympus and Luke asked me if I loved him, I said no. And it's still true. I admired him, looked up to him, and tried to be with him, but I never loved him. Not in the way he meant. Luke was like the big brother I never had, the father I never knew I had, the best friend I'll never see again. And that's why I can't enjoy myself. How can I, when he was ripped out of my life like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat on Zeus's Fist in the middle of the woods, enjoying the night breeze. Everything was so peaceful and quiet, especially after the whirlwind the past few months have been. Building the new cabins, finding new demigods...and the Prophecy. The new Great Prophecy. I frowned and pushed that out of my mind...I didn't want to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annabeth!\" With a start, I heard someone calling my name. Then I realized I was crying, and I hurriedly brushed the tears off of my cheeks. Whoever it was, I couldn't let them see me cry. </span></div></div>",

Well, the others might notice, but he's the only one who would come after me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned and waved. \"Hey, Seaweed Brain,\" I called, hoping he wouldn't hear the slight catch in my voice. \"Got tired of the party already? What, you can't handle your adoring fans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe them,\" Percy answered. \"They actually ask for autographs. Of course, none of them have a pen, and I don't either. Then they see Riptide and they get mad because I keep saying I don't have anything to write with!\" He looked so genuinely frustrated that I had to laugh. \"It's not funny,\" Percy insisted, but he smiled anyway. When I didn't come down, he stuck Riptide in his pocket and scrambled up. \"So, what's wrong, Wise Girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally I would have rolled my eyes--gods, he can't think of a more original nickname?--but I was too startled to do anything except stare at him. \"W-wrong?\" I stammered, hating myself for doing it. \"Nothing. I got tired of the party, and...\" my voice trailed off as I saw he didn't believe me. My story was pretty weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke.\" It wasn't a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo anyone else, I would have lied. I don't know why I didn't. But there was just something...maybe it was the way the wind blew his hair perfectly around his face. Or the look in his eyes: sympathetic and understanding. Whatever it was, I took a deep breath and spilled my guts about what I was really feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was done, I bit my lip, anxious to hear what Percy would say. </span></div></div>",

When he finally did speak, his voice was icy. \"You know, Annabeth, Luke is gone. I'm sorry, but he is, and you can't get him back. You need to open your eyes and see that there are other people around you. Get over him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made me angry. \"Percy, you don't get it. Luke was like a brother to me! Sometimes I think he was the only one who truly understood me, and I loved him for that.\" The last part slipped out before I could stop myself. The sad, hurt look in Percy's eyes made me want to snatch my words out of the air. But once you've said something, there's no going back. Besides, it was true. ...Wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, fine.\" Percy's words were still cold, but he couldn't hide the hurt in his voice. \"I'm sorry that I can't be Luke for you.\" With that, he jumped off the Fist and started to storm off. Instead of walking back to camp, though, he headed towards the ocean side. To get there, you have to cross a stream; but Percy just held the water back and walked on dry land. Showoff. He disappeared from view, and I settled on the rocks. He'll be back, I thought. He always comes back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was colder now, much colder. I had been waiting for about half an hour, maybe more, and Percy hadn't returned. I had a bad feeling now, like this was one of those times that I should have kept my mouth shut. I haven't had much of those with Percy, and when I did, we always made up. But something was telling me that he was even angrier than he had let on. With a sigh, I slid off of Zeus's Fist and started back to camp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I walked out of the woods, I knew something was wrong. There were campers running all over the place, and Chiron wasn't even calling for order. If anything, he looked worried...\"What's happened?\" I shouted, running towards him. \"Chiron, what's wrong?\"</span></div></div>",

It's not on the higher level that yours was, but I get the idea. And I just want to tell you, I understand completely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned at him in relief. Why had I been worried?

Grover was covered in leaves and dirt, and had the beginnings of a black eye. \"There you are, thank the gods!\" He trotted over to Zeus's Fist, not even bothering to shake off the twigs stuck to his fur. \"There's....at the camp....he's trying to....bla-ha-ha! I'm overexcited!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. Grover, overexcited? What a surprise. \"Slow down, I can barely understand what you're saying.\" I slid off the Fist and hurried over to him. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrover took a deep breath to collect himself. \"A new demigod, trying to come up the hill. Something's wrong. Ladon won't let him in, and there's a monster after the kid! We need you, Ladon will listen to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. Ladon was the dragon that guarded Half-Blood Hill, and I was kind of the unofficial caretaker of him. If he wouldn't listen to anyone else, he would almost definitely listen to me. As we ran through the hill, I frowned as I thought about the situation. A half-blood that Ladon wouldn't let enter? That had never happened before, even when Ivan showed up and almost fried Ladon with a lightning bolt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe burst out of the woods and streaked across the campgrounds. The Big House was still lit up for the party. But instead of people dancing and eating, they were milling around outside, looking confused and scared. Some of the experienced campers were grabbing their weapons and running towards Ladon's post, where Thalia's tree had been a long time ago. When I got closer, I picked out Percy and Thalia running at the front of the pack. Percy uncapped Riptide and it grew into a three-foot Celestial bronze sword. Thalia strung an arrow, and both continued towards Ladon. All of a sudden, the dragon swung around and let loose a blast of fire! I gasped as my two friends narrowly avoided being burnt to a crisp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear lent wings to my feet, and I sped past Grover. \"Ladon!\" I shrieked at the top of my voice. \"Stop!\" He raised his great head in confusion, giving Thalia and Percy time to slip past him. I could see the small figure of the half-blood, being relentlessly pursued by a hellhound the size of a bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally reached the hill. \"Here, boy,\" I called. \"Listen to me. It's me, Annabeth. What's wrong?\" I stroked him, calming him down. \"The hellhound is the enemy here. Help out Percy and Thalia.\" Ladon blinked at me, then reared back and spit out a ball of flame. It struck the hellhound, who yelped as it was vaporized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Good boy,\" I cheered. The dragon snorted smoke out of his nostrils, looking displeased. I didn't pay attention and ran to help Percy and Thalia, who were kneeling by the unconscious demigod. \"How is he?\" I blurted. \"Let me see. I have some ambrosia and nectar...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annabeth, wait,\" cautioned Thalia, and Percy put a hand on my arm. I frowned at them and pulled the ambrosia out of my pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you...\" I stopped when I saw the kid. My breath came hard and fast, and my heart started beating wildly. There, on the ground, was the unconscious face of a 12-year-old Luke. </span></div></div>",

We didn't speak on the way over there. When we reached the sea, I sat down in the cool sand and rested my head in my hands. I could feel Percy hovering anxiously beside me. He wanted to make me feel better, but he didn't know how. So we both sat there in silence, listening to the waves lap up on the shore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking about him, you know,\" I told Percy, my voice muffled. He looked at me, confused, but didn't say anything. \"Luke. I felt horrible again. It's been happening lately. Whenever I try to enjoy myself, he pops into my mind, and I feel miserable. Why is that happening? Why now, six months after he was...killed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought something was wrong,\" Percy told me, looking worried. I lifted my head to look at him. His green eyes were gazing at me, without any of the embarrassment they used to have, and I felt a shiver run the length of my body. He really did care. \"Is there anything I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned at him, even though my heart wasn't really in it. \"Well, we haven't gone swimming in a while...\" I winked at Percy, and he smiled back. He stood up, grabbed my hand, and we ran down to the surf, plunging into the waves. The water washed higher, past my waist up to my shoulders. Finally, when I couldn't feel the sandy bottom beneath my feet, we stopped. Percy called up a current that it kept us afloat. Some curious dolphins swam nearer and Percy encouraged them, talking to them with his mind, asking them for a ride. They obliged, and soon we were zipping through the water. I laughed from the sheer exhilaration of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, three more dolphins jumped up in front of us. I grinned and nudged Percy, but he frowned. The other dolphins were chattering frantically, making short leaps but always swimming back to us. \"What are they saying?\" I asked Percy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tanker...there's a huge oil spill. Some of the sea animals are trapped in it...including two hippocampi!\" He shot me a look. We both knew how dangerous that was. If humans came to help with the spill, and found the mythological creatures, who knew what would happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to help,\" he told me, just as I said, \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned at me. \"Annabeth, go back and get help. Get Blackjack and some of the other pegasi, and tell Chiron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I objected. \"You'll need my help. You can't do everything, and we know you can't control oil, so I can do whatever you will.\"</span></div></div>",

This is when the necklace glowed. It started to change, into a sword. Damn it! I'll get arrested for carrying dangerous weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the sight of a sword, the dragon hissed and striked at me, I rolled aside. Suddenly, a feel of fire surged inside me, granting me strength. I ducked and rolled, then I saw an opening, so I counterattacked and swiped one of the heads off. The dragon hissed in pain and started to attack recklessly. After I chopped two more heads off, a girl that have strange grey eyes came to the dragon. She whispered something to the dragon and turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly lost my breath, she was beautiful, no, gorgeous! I didn't know what to say. To my suprise, she blushed, although the one blushing should be me. Look I have this special power on girls, they fall in love with me the moment they see me. Then the girl said:\" Hello, this is Camp Half-Blood, my name is Annabeth, what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stammered:\" H...huh? Oh! My name is Lyner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled:\" Nice to meet you Lyner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt dizzy, a nosebleed is coming up, but I controlled it. Somehow I get to control water, weird. Then I realized that she said that this is Camp Half-Blood, I was so excited, so I yell:\" This is CAMP HALF-BLOOD? I FINALLY GOT HERE WITHOUT DYING!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth looked puzzled, she asked:\" Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said:\" My father told me to come to Camp Half-Blood, so I made it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought for a while, then she said:\" Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I thought it over for a while. Let's weigh the options, I said to myself. Stay out here, where monsters can attack at any time; or follow this beautiful girl into the camp my father told me to come to? It was kind of a one-sided contest, and I don't have to tell you which side won. I followed her into the camp. The dragon eyed me suspiciously and blew smoke out of his nostrils. Annabeth ignored him, so I did too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked through this place that looked like a normal camp, I guess. There were these huge cabins all in one circle. Some of them looked really crowded, but there were two or three that looked like there were only a few kids in them. There was a lake with a bunch of canoes, a sand volleyball pit, and a large circle with a bunch of dummies in it. I guessed that was for football practice? A wild-looking forest made up the border, and it stretched on for as far as I could see. I saw a girl, probably only about eight or nine, walking into the woods alone, and I nudged Annabeth. \"Hey, is she going to be okay? Is she allowed in there?\" Annabeth looked at me with a bemused expression on her face, that morphed into a smile. She shook her head and kept walking. When I looked back, the girl was gone. I blinked and looked again. That small oak tree had not been there before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annabeth! Who's this?\" Two guys were coming towards me. They both looked a little older than I was. One of them was kind of thin and scrawny, with a cap covering his curly head. He walked with this weird shuffle-step that looked like he had something wrong with his legs. The other one had black hair and green eyes that kind of reminded me of the ocean...I don't know why. This guy's walk looked pretty confident, which didn't match the slightly nervous expression on his face. He was twirling something between his fingers, and I realized it was a ballpoint pen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyner, this is Grover,\" Annabeth pointed towards the scrawny guy, \"and this is Percy.\" When she motioned towards the black-haired dude, I noticed a small blush creeping up her cheeks. \"Percy and Grover, this is Lyner. His, uh, dad told him to come, and he did. Alone,\" she added, with a pointed look towards Grover, as if it meant something. He looked surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without a, um, guide?\" Grover frowned. \"And he's...what, thirteen?\" I nodded. \"That's the age, Annabeth. Bla-ha-ha! That shouldn't be possible. And you say his dad told him to come?\" He looked at me. \"Who is your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kind of unnerved me. My dad left when I was really little, so I don't know much about him. The first sign he knew I even existed came in a letter, telling me to go to this place called Camp Half-blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy was scrutinizing me closely. It hit me that his eyes, the ones that looked like the ocean, are the same color as mine. \"Lyner,\" he said aloud, like he was testing my name. \"Uh, let's go down to the dock.\" Annabeth looked at him strangely, and he pulled her close and whispered something in her ear. Her eyes widened, and she grinned nervously at him, whispering something back. They both laughed, and it made me feel uncomfortable. I mean, it was kind of obvious that Percy liked Annabeth, and I think Annabeth liked him too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Percy motioned with his head towards the lake. We walked in silence for a little bit. I was aware of Percy sneaking looks at me, appraising me. What did this guy want from me?</span></div></div>",

So I just stopped. \"No,\" I told Percy. \"I don't want to go to the dock. I'm tired and would like to rest.\" I folded my arms and tried to look fierce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy stopped, too. \"Come on, kid, I just want to see something. I wouldn't hurt you, I promise. It's just a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me kid!\" I shouted. I really, really hate when people do that. My vision turned red, and I heard a roaring in my ears. I wanted to hit Percy, wanted to wipe that look off of his face. I felt the lake near me, and for some reason I could smell the ocean. I felt stronger and more confident now. I took a deep breath and...pushed. Not with my body, but kind of with my mind. I heard something that sounded like a huge river, and then a startled exclamation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\" I opened my eyes when I heard Percy's voice. He sounded like he was choking on something, and I just about fainted when I saw what was happening. The water in the lake was rising up, forming the biggest tidal wave I have ever seen in my life. Something inside me whispered for more, so I pushed harder. The wave swelled even higher, and someone screamed. It might have been me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy shook himself out of his shocked state. \"Stop, Lyner!\" he shouted. \"It's too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't!\" I called back, frightened because it was true. I told myself to stop, but there was a tugging in my gut that wouldn't quit. </span></div></div>",

He gave me the evil eye, and that reminded me of the metal lion I killed in Washington D.C., it gave me the same evil eye when I threw a water gun down its throat. Anyway Percy looked at me and said:\" Son of Poseidon. Lyner Barsette, you are the Son of Poseidon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky turned dark and thunder rumbled. Suddenly, a guy in wheelchair appeared beside Percy. He looks at Percy and speaks softly to him:\"Don't be so sure Percy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy said:\" But..but Chiron, he just called that tidal wave from the lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiron( or what I guess his name was) turned to me, and spoke:\" Lyner, do you know how to shoot arrows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI beamed:\" Of course!!

A pandora is a god who is the child of Zeus and Hera, all the gods give the pandora a fragment of their power which is infinite.

I clutched my necklace again and it popped back into a sword. I stepped up towards the guy, driven by anger, I thrust my blade towards his legs, but was blocked easily. He guy countered my attack and made me take a step back. I calmed down and feinted a quick strike to his right, when the sword tip was one inch in front of his right eye, I swerved the sword down to make a hard stab on his stomach.(This move won me the fencing champion of the state.) The guy lowered his sword down casually and blocked my attack again. I tried again, slashing at his hips. He blocked the slash with his blade, I used my tip to slide against the flat of his blade, and made a quick thrust towards his wrist when my sword tip got close to his sword hilt. He used his oversized hand to bat my sword down and kicked my sword away. My first reaction was to punch him, but my hands were held by a pair of strong hands. I looked up and saw the guy laughing,\" You are <i>my</i> prisoner now! HA HA HA HA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kicked and squirmed when suddenly a lightning struck down from the sky, and the guy backed off me. A man in Greekish tunic floated down from the sky, you heard me <i>floated</i> from the sky. He held a <i>lightning bolt??!!</i> The man spoke:\" Stay away from the Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pandora, isn't it the girl who opened a box and...</i> I thought. The big guy bellowed:\"You will fall, Zeus! So will Olympus! We, Titans will rise to POWER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for you to go to Tartarus, Octraseus.\" The man cast down another lightning and the big guy disappeared. The man waved his hand and I fainted.</span></div></div>",

I opened my eyes, and I saw Annabeth beside me, and I'm holding her <i>HAND??!!</i> I quickly let go of her hand and muttered:\"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at me(Oh my God, I think I'm gonna bleed through my nose), and said:\"You've been sleeping for two days, I'm so worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned sheepishly:\"You're worried about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth suddenly blushed and replied:\"You are the Pandora, of course I would be worried. Because if you die, then no one can stop the Titan Organization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at her blankly, I mean what's your response if someone said that to you, with a creak, someone entered the room. I looked at the guy, he is on a wheelchair, but the wheelchair seems to be automatic, 'cause he ain't touching the chair, rather reading a book. He guy smiled at Annabeth and said:\"Annabeth, stop talking nonsense, you will confuse him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth breathed a quick \"OK\" and left the room. The guy smiled at me and introduced himself:\"I am Mr. Brunner, the activity director of this camp, may I show you around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, Mr. Brunner.\" I said, and tried to get up. My knees felt weak and I collapsed back onto the bed. Suddenly a wave of pain ran through my body, and I fainted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, Mr. Brunner was talking to Annabeth, he said:\"Annabeth, do not tell him anything, not even his true identity, just say he is a normal half-blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Chiron. Sorry, I was too reckless last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chiron</i> smiled and left, something was wrong about him, he is half <i>horse</i>! Annabeth turned to me and saw me stare wide-eyed at the door, she held my hand and asked:\"How do you feel now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess.\" <i>I'm always fine when you hold my hands</i>, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth took out a cup filled with strawberry smoothie(I think it is), and gave it to me. I suddenly had a mischievous thought, I pretended to drop the cup, Annabeth quickly cleared up the mess and got a new cup, and fed me the smoothie. Man! I feel like I'm in <i>heaven</i>. The smoothie was strange, it tasted like chocolate, but if felt warm, even with chunks of ice in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, I finished the drink and I felt a lot better. Annabeth suggested to give me tour in camp, of course, I agreed. She showed me the archery range, and a sword fighting arena, when we got near a bathroom, a group of girls stopped us. These girls were huge, I mean they can make professional wrestler like Undertaker or Triple H run for their mommy. One of them stepped out and said in a nasty tone:\"Yo, wise girl, hanging out with this guy? What about your boyfriend? Percy's heart is broken. Ha, ha, ha.\" Their laugh was terrible, it sounded kind of like crows.</span></div></div>",

The dragon.\" Annabeth didn't say anything, and I took that to be a yes. I grabbed my necklace, and once again it morphed into a sword. \"Well, if you think it's so funny, then try fighting me.

Before my brain could register that, whatever had blocked my weapon was on the offensive. I had been the most skilled in my fencing classes, and I could barely keep up with the onslaught of the girl. I tried one more desperate move--a fake swing to the left, followed by a quick thrust to the right. Annabeth neatly sidestepped my sword, grabbed my wrist, and twisted it so my sword fell out of my grasp. I took a swing at her with my left hand, but she took hold of that one too.

And the one that amazes me the most is the archery training ground, totally awesome! I was assigned in Cabin Eleven, which is full of guys. It's so crowded while cabins like Cabin One, Two, Three are nearly empty. Confused, I asked Annabeth why, but she just smiled. So I got this small spot on the crowded ground of Cabin Eleven. The guy in charge of the cabin is called Connor. He looks very elvish and he is nearly always smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second day at camp, Annabeth asked me out for a walk in the woods. I agreed and we walked into the woods. Annabeth introduced me to two guys named Percy and Grover. Percy has black hair and green eyes that remind me of the...ocean. Grover is a scrawny guy who looks way older than his age, and he walks strange, like his legs are injured. Annabeth seems to like this Percy guy, and he seems to like her too, which made me kind of jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I was determined to win Annabeth's heart. My plan was to beat Percy at everything, and make him look weak in front of Annabeth, so I asked him for a archery competition, which I knew was his worst subject. But to my surprise, he agreed. Because Annabeth is there, he didn't want to look scared in front of Annabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I easily won him and Annabeth even clapped for me. I was so happy. After I went back to the cabin, Connor, our guy in charge asked me:\" Are you in love with Annabeth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question choked me, I look at him, surprised:\" What made you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned:\" You asking Percy on a archery competition.\"</span></div></div>",

I plucked it from the boulder it was placed on and ran back. I was as swift as a deer and no one can even keep up with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of running, I was tired and I looked around. Damn! I was lost again! Suddenly I heard someone speaking, and a group of Athena's cabin's campers came out of the bushes. Their leader was Annabeth. What!! I ran into them, bad luck.</span></div></div>",

The rest of the Athena campers used pincer movement and surrounded me. I tried to break through the formation by charging West, then suddenly attack North. Bang! I slammed into one of their shields. I backed off a little and I regain balance, then I feinted a thrust towards the guy on the East side, then I jumped over Annabeth. The split second I touch the ground I stared running, leaving Annabeth's squad far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran and ran until I reached the place that our squad encountered Percy. I saw shields and swords all over the place, so I turned away and ran towards the West. I ran and ran until I arrived at the creek, I saw my team fighting with Percy's team. Should I help them, or should I just take the flag back?</span></div></div>",

I sprinted even faster, only to find that our camp was raided by Athena's cabin, a couple of the Athena guys stayed and tried to reach our flag ( it was high on a boulder). I crept behind them, and gave each of them a crippling backstab. I climbed up the boulder easily and set Poseidon's flag on to of the boulder, beside our own flag. Everyone gathered around and Chiron announced that We won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so happy that I almost fell off the boulder, but, I got down safely. Annabeth's cabin all look sullen and the Apollo cabin cursed in Greek.</span></div></div>",
